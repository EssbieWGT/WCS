Battery will strengthen and stabilise power supply on the Goldfields Line

Construction has begun on the Merredin Big Battery - a project that will help to strengthen and stabilise the State's main power grid and contribute to Western Australia's clean energy transition.

The 100-megawatt/four-hour Merredin Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is a joint development between Atmos Renewables and Nomad Energy, with construction by GenusPlus.

It will generate up to 70 jobs during peak construction, and up to five permanent jobs during operation.

Positioned alongside the 650-kilometre Muja to Kalgoorlie 220-kilovolt transmission line (the Goldfields Line), it will support energy security for the Wheatbelt and Eastern Goldfields and improve the line's stability and capacity as the energy transition continues.

The battery adds to the region's renewable energy projects, including the 222-megawatt Collgar Wind Farm and Risen Energy's 132-megawatt Merredin Solar Farm.

The Merredin BESS is expected to be commissioned in October 2026.

Since 2023 almost 500 megawatts of battery storage has begun operating in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) with a further 728 megawatts of committed storage expected to become operational in 2025-2026.

The Australian Energy Market Operator recently noted that the SWIS expansion of large-scale battery storage has helped alleviate energy shortfalls.

Merredin BESS developers have established a voluntary community benefit fund to provide financial support for community-based initiatives, projects and events.

Once operational, $20,000 a year will be made available through the Merredin Battery Community Legacy Fund, continuing over the estimated 25-year life of the project.

There are also commitments to local employment, and support for education and First Nations employees, contractors, businesses, and services.

Comments attributed to Energy and Decarbonisation Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson:

""Grid-scale batteries play an important role in our clean energy transition, storing excess energy during the day and discharging it at night - helping to stabilise and strengthen our electricity grid.

""The Merredin Big Battery will add to our energy armoury, which includes State-owned batteries in Kwinana and Collie, and the Neoen battery also in Collie.

""Together with new transmission lines, wind, solar, and gas generation where needed, they are important elements of the energy grid of the future.

Louisiana has a land-loss crisis. The state has lost nearly 2,000 square miles of coastal wetlands since the 1930s. This loss also means less protection from hurricanes and storm surges. Now a massive project that was meant to build back some of that land has been canceled. WWNO's Eva Tesfaye reports it came after the governor decided the project was just too expensive.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS CHIRPING)

EVA TESFAYE, BYLINE: Black-bellied whistling ducks fly overhead as I stand on the west bank of the Mississippi, about 60 miles upriver from the Gulf in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. On this stretch of the bank, the trees have been cleared to make way for a huge project known as the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion.

RICHIE BLINK: It's hard to make old friends. You can't just get back a-hundred-plus-year-old oak trees.

TESFAYE: Richie Blink laments that the trees have now been cut for no reason because that project is canceled. He's a local resident and a boat captain.

BLINK: There's a lot of regret there. The thing is, if the diversion would have been built, there would have been a sub delta that would have been created here.

TESFAYE: The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion was supposed to do just what it says - make the river move silt and sand into the middle of Barataria Bay. It's similar to how the Mississippi River used to form deltas, before it was engineered and levied. The diversion was estimated to build around 30 square miles of new wetlands over 50 years.

ROBERT TWILLEY: The connection between wetlands, storm protection and people and infrastructure became the focus of our restoration efforts after Hurricane Katrina.

TESFAYE: That's Robert Twilley, a professor of coastal sciences at Louisiana State University. He says building these coastal wetlands would help protect the area from hurricanes and storm surges. But it took decades to get the project going, and construction started just two years ago.

TWILLEY: Here we are, 20 years from Hurricane Katrina, when we started thinking big and really started moving aggressively on building these big projects, and now we are back to ground zero.

TESFAYE: The $3 billion project was funded by money from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement. Six hundred million dollars had been spent so far. But in July, the state agency overseeing the project canceled it, saying it was getting too expensive and cumbersome. State officials didn't respond to requests for comment.

Alisha Renfro is a scientist with the National Wildlife Federation, one of the environmental groups that advocated for the project. She says the cancellation was a massive setback for coastal restoration.

ALISHA RENFRO: It is kind of that long-term solution of getting sediment back into the basin in a - on a regular basis, that we just don't have any other way.

TESFAYE: But the cancellation was welcomed by Louisiana oyster fishermen, who harvest in the bay. The extra freshwater from the diversion would have altered the conditions that allow oysters and shrimp to thrive there. Mitch Jurisich has been fighting the project for years. He's a third-generation oysterman and heads the Louisiana Oyster Task Force.

MITCH JURISICH: The total oyster populations would have been wiped out - totally gone.

TESFAYE: There was $400 million in the project to help oyster fishermen and others who would have been impacted by the changes in and around the bay, but Jurisich says that wouldn't have been enough. He wants faster, cheaper ways to fight coastal land loss, like dredging sediment and using it to build new land instantly.

JURISICH: What we don't need in Louisiana is new deltas. What we need is land today to protect us tomorrow.

TESFAYE: The state says it's now looking at a much smaller diversion project in the bay. But supporters of the Mid-Barataria Diversion point out that it may again take years to get funding and permits approved - time, they say, that Louisiana's vanishing coast doesn't have.

The California New Car Dealers Association released its own second-quarter figures that largely paralleled the energy commission’s numbers and percentages.

Tesla registrations in California have dropped 18.3% so far this year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.","Sales of new electric vehicles in California remained sluggish in the second quarter of this year and the road ahead appears bumpy, as federal tax credits will expire at the end of next month.

The number of EVs registered between April and June in the Golden State came to 100,671, according to figures released by the California Energy Commission. That’s ever so slightly higher than the first-quarter figure of 100,326 but noticeably lower than the 116,813 registrations seen in the second quarter of 2024.

What’s more, the market share for sales of zero-emission vehicles dropped to 21.6% from April through June, down from 23% in the first quarter and 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The California New Car Dealers Association released its own second-quarter figures that largely paralleled the energy commission’s numbers and percentages.

Ivan Drury, senior manager of auto insights at Edmunds, said a number of factors came into play, including concerns by potential buyers that tariffs on cars and trucks from the Trump administration would go into effect in April or May.

“It’s not surprising to see that EVs tapered off,” Drury said. “It makes sense because (the California market) is the place that has the most receptivity” to zero-emission purchases.

The second-quarter numbers came just days before what was dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” led by Republicans on Capitol Hill, was signed into law July 4 by President Donald Trump. The 940-page budget bill affects taxes and spending on multiple elements of the nation’s economy, including the auto industry.

Under the new legislation, federal tax incentives for buying an electric vehicle will expire Sept. 30. That includes a credit of up to $7,500 on a new EV, or $4,000 for a used one. The credit for buying and installing a home charging station will end June 30, 2026.

The ending of the federal tax credit for EVs figures to have major implications for California because Gov. Gavin Newsom five years ago issued an executive order that mandates the elimination of sales of all new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles throughout the state by 2035.

Under standards passed by the California Air Resources Board, at least 35% of model year 2026 passenger cars and trucks sold in the state must be EVs, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The numbers ramp up each year, going to 68% in 2030 and 100% by 2035.

In a separate move, Trump in June signed three Congressional Review Act resolutions rescinding those California EV mandates — as well as rules related to diesel engines.

Newsom responded by filing a lawsuit, arguing that Trump’s actions are unconstitutional and beyond the authority of Congress. Ten other states joined in the litigation.

While the court battle proceeds, California policymakers insist the state’s goals to transition to EVs will continue and say the recent quarterly numbers amount to a blip.

“This quarter’s modest decline in zero-emission vehicle sales is no surprise given the federal government’s misguided and ongoing assault on clean transportation,” Liane Randolph, chair of the air resources board, said in a statement. “While they may slow progress, they can’t change the fact that zero-emission vehicles are here to stay — in California and around the world.”

A big reason for the drop in EV sales is a slump in Tesla registrations.

The company had a rough second quarter, with automotive revenue falling 16% compared to a year ago — the second straight quarter of lower sales. Tesla registrations in California have dropped 18.3% so far this year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk campaigned for Trump in the run-up to the November presidential election. Musk’s posts on political topics on X, the social media company he owns, and his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sparked protests, boycotts, vandalism and even arson at some Tesla locations.

Musk stepped down from DOGE in late May to focus on Tesla and then had a falling out with the Trump administration. More than a few Wall Street and auto analysts said his zig-zags have damaged the company’s image with potential customers.

However, Tesla’s sales growth had been slowing even before Musk jumped into the 2024 political campaign, signaling that EV adoption rates may have more long-term issues to address.

“It’s clear many consumers still face barriers to going fully electric,” said Robb Hernandez, chairman of the new car dealers association, “whether that’s due to affordability, lack of infrastructure (public charging stations), or range anxiety” — the fear of an EV conking out before a driver gets to a charging station.

Sales are anticipated to ramp up in the third quarter because customers considering an EV purchase are expected to race to dealerships before the federal tax credit goes away.

“Why wait?” Drury said. “The selection’s going to get worse” as the Sept. 30 deadline looms.

Despite Tesla’s woes, the automaker still had the top-selling vehicle in California in the second quarter — the Tesla Model Y, with 44,112 registrations, according to the new car dealers association. The Toyota RAV4 came in second with 33,960, and the Tesla Model 3 finished third with 31,394.

And there’s some good news for EVs in the used-car market.

According a study released in June by iSeeCars.com, a search engine that analyzes car listings, the average price for a 1- to 5-year-old used electric vehicle in the U.S. has dropped 8.8% over the past year to $31,110.

That’s lower than the average price of $32,317 for a gasoline-powered car in the same age range.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/202508041317MCT_____PHOTO____BIZ-AUTO-EV-SALES-CALIF-SD.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-08-04 23:58:23.245479

According to the complaint, that left Michigan without roughly $29 million dollars of promised money to finish its plan.
With regards to the usefulness of the program, which the Transportation Department’s statement also questioned, Malmgren said the funding had helped states invest in EV charging in underserved areas.
In late June, most of them succeeded in getting a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration’s funding pause.","Michigan has joined a multi-state lawsuit over federal funding for building new electric vehicle chargers.

Congress originally approved the money four years ago, during Joe Biden's presidency, in the Infrasturcture Investment and Jobs Act. But President Donald Trump ordered a pause in those payments to states when he took office.

According to the complaint, that left Michigan without roughly $29 million dollars of promised money to finish its plan.

“The Trump Administration's decision to unilaterally cut off these funds is not only unlawful – it jeopardizes Michigan’s EV infrastructure, while threatening our economic growth and environmental progress,” Nessel said in a press release.

The administration went about pausing payments for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program by revoking approvals for plans states had to submit under the program. U.S. Department of Transportation leadership said it was paused for a review.

In a press release, Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy defended the pause as legal.

“The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed miserably to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Congress gave the Secretary the authority to issue program guidance and ensure money is being spent efficiently, and that’s exactly what we are doing,” the statement from Duffy read.

Duffy’s statement went on to criticize the states suing his agency as taking too long to get the program off the ground to begin with.

That’s an oversimplification, however, according to Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director with the nonprofit Plug In America, one of the groups also participating in the lawsuit.

Malmgren said there first needed to be a new agency, rules, and plans created before states could spend that money.

“It wasn’t so much that states aren’t interested in using this money and that they were dragging their feet. It was much more that there was a lot of ground work to lay before they could start spending the money and actually putting chargers in the ground,” Malmgren said.

With regards to the usefulness of the program, which the Transportation Department’s statement also questioned, Malmgren said the funding had helped states invest in EV charging in underserved areas.

“Very rural areas, small communities where there wouldn’t be a lot of traffic and it didn’t make a lot of business sense to invest in these chargers, there was still funding available so that this charging network could be very comprehensive and complete,” she said.

The lawsuit was originally filed in May by 16 states and Washington D.C. In late June, most of them succeeded in getting a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration’s funding pause.

Michigan is among four states to sign onto the suit this month.

According to the updated complaint, Michigan had already bid out contracts to create the first round of charging stations the program would pay for. A second round for 48 more stations is underway.

The state says the pause in funds could keep it from putting in another 65 chargers as part of round three.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f9e9bf0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1760x924+0+135/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0c%2Fc6%2F34fbf247442bbb0ce96505b0ba88%2Fev-chargers.png,N,,2025-08-04 22:01:49.968070

Through the studies, Nyrstar proposes to explore the potential production of essential critical minerals, including antimony and bismuth at Port Pirie and germanium and indium at Hobart.
These critical minerals are considered vital for sectors including defence, clean energy, transport, advanced manufacturing and high-tech applications.
“Working with Nyrstar and the Commonwealth, we can modernise the Port Pirie smelter and take advantage of the world’s desire for critical minerals.
“There is no doubt the Port Pirie operations have faced challenges from global forces largely beyond its control.","Joint media release with the Premier of South Australia, Peter Malinauskas, and the Premier of Tasmania, Jeremy Rockliff

The Albanese Government will invest $57.5 million to protect jobs in Australian smelters as part of a $135 million package with South Australian and Tasmanian Governments investing $55 million and $22.5 million respectively.

Investment will support transformation of the Port Pirie and Hobart smelters owned by Nyrstar into modern facilities capable of producing critical minerals.

The combined support package, coupled with investment from the company, will enable Nyrstar to maintain its operations while progressing detailed engineering plans to potentially rebuild and modernise both smelters and, at the same time, fast track feasibility studies into world-leading critical metals production.

Through the studies, Nyrstar proposes to explore the potential production of essential critical minerals, including antimony and bismuth at Port Pirie and germanium and indium at Hobart.

These critical minerals are considered vital for sectors including defence, clean energy, transport, advanced manufacturing and high-tech applications.

An immediate focus of the package is to deploy an Antimony Pilot Plant in Port Pirie, which if successful would make Port Pirie the only producer of antimony metal in Australia and one of the few producers globally.

Antimony is an alloy hardener for other metals in ammunition and is critical to the manufacture of semi-conductors found in electronics and defence applications and is used in flame retardant materials.

The support provided to Nyrstar will also be targeted toward asset integrity projects including a planned Major Maintenance Project at Port Pirie and Major Furnace and Wharf Investments at Hobart.

As Australia’s only lead refiner and the largest zinc refiner in the country Nyrstar contributes around A$1.7 billion to Australia’s economy each year and employs 1,400 Australians directly, while supporting 6,647 indirect jobs.

The Major Maintenance Project in Port Pirie will require more than 350 contractors and more than 90 suppliers, and the Major Furnace and Wharf Investments in Hobart will involve around 200 contractors and suppliers.

Quotes attributable to Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Science Tim Ayres

“The Commonwealth, South Australian and Tasmanian Governments are together investing $135 million to transform Nyrstar’s Port Pirie and Hobart smelters.

“Nyrstar and its parent company Trafigura will co-invest in these facilities and lead feasibility, fast-track pilot projects and facility upgrades to secure their future operations.

“Nyrstar contributes A$1.7 billion to the Australian economy annually, directly employing 1,400 Australians and supporting over 6,600 indirect jobs.

“Through this transformation, Nyrstar aims to explore possible production of antimony, bismuth, tellurium, germanium and indium, minerals vital to clean energy, defence, and high-tech sectors.

“An Antimony Pilot Plant will be deployed in Port Pirie as a priority.

“If pilot studies are successful this would position Port Pirie as Australia’s only producer of antimony metal and one of the few globally, supporting sovereign capability in defence and advanced manufacturing.

“Sustainable and competitive smelting capabilities in Australia that can deliver critical minerals projects are part of the Albanese Labor Government’s Future Made in Australia agenda.”

Quotes attributable to Premier of South Australia Peter Malinauskas

“We have an opportunity to transform the Port Pirie smelter and secure its future for the long term.

“Working with Nyrstar and the Commonwealth, we can modernise the Port Pirie smelter and take advantage of the world’s desire for critical minerals.

“There is no doubt the Port Pirie operations have faced challenges from global forces largely beyond its control.

“But the transformation of the smelter into a producer of critical minerals like antimony would put our state at the forefront of a global supply chain that is vital to clean energy, defence, and high-tech manufacturing.”

Quotes attributable to Premier of Tasmania Jeremy Rockliff

""We will help secure the future of Nyrstar’s Hobart operations, backing Tasmanian workers and their families and saving more than 500 local jobs at one of our State's most significant employers.

""The Hobart site is a key part of our national critical minerals supply chain, and this facility is both vital for Australia's sovereign capability and Tasmania's economy.

Direct Current Fast Chargers will charge faster than the Level 2 charging stations being installed.
“The times that you want to use that fast charging are when you’re going to be traveling across the state or interstate,” Lisek said.
The charging stations will begin to be installed this fall; each station’s completion date is unknown, but they’re all expected to be operational by the close of 2026.","SAINT JOHN, Ind. (WANE) — The GO Electric Vehicle Indiana (GOEVIN) initiative has announced that they’re building new electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Fort Wayne and across the state.

On Monday, Drive Clean Indiana issued a press release to announce that their GOEVIN initiative is working to expand public access to EV chargers through 18 projects. Thirty-five chargers will soon be scattered across Indiana, with six coming to Northeast Indiana, including chargers in Fort Wayne and New Haven, and additional chargers in Roanoke, Marion, Elkhart, and Warsaw.

The locations chosen are on main arteries, looking to capitalize on places that would be natural stops on road trips.

“These are great locations that are right off the interstate where you can jump off, plug in your car, go use a restroom, go buy something, eat or drink, and then in 20 minutes, you’re going to be able to charge your car to about 80% and you’re going to be able to get 250 miles per charge to wherever you need to go on your next stop,” says Ryan Lisek of Drive Clean Indiana.

Lisek explained that 90% of charging happens at home, but the 10% that doesn’t is all about long trips where you want to charge fast.

Two different types of chargers are being implemented, differentiated by charging speed. Direct Current Fast Chargers will charge faster than the Level 2 charging stations being installed.

In general, the faster chargers are being put near the interstate and other heavily traveled destinations to make owning an EV an easier choice.

“The times that you want to use that fast charging are when you’re going to be traveling across the state or interstate,” Lisek said. “Those level 2 projects are more for your longer dwell times.”

Placing them strategically hopes to accomplish two things: making EV use easier, and encouraging more to make the switch.

“Electric vehicles are going to be very, very prominent,” Lisek said.

Further encouraging the switch, Lisek pointed to a tax credit for those buying EV vehicles that expires at the end of September. Despite it ending soon, he says EVs are still coming.

“There are some tax credits that are ending on September 30th; if you’re interested in that, please reach out to Drive Clean Indiana,” Lisek said. “That $75,000 tax credit is ending, but the world isn’t ending.”

The group is partnering with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management to use settlement money totaling more than $3 million.

“This funding is part of the Volkswagen settlement,” Lisek said. “We have this leftover funding from previous projects that did not move forward.”

Up to 75% of the cost for Direct Current Fast Chargers and Level 2 charging stations is paid by local, state, and federal money set aside for EV investment.

The charging stations will begin to be installed this fall; each station’s completion date is unknown, but they’re all expected to be operational by the close of 2026.",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/67a684eb0bd727.35972970.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-04 22:02:51.524948

Between May 2024 and May 2025, the average residential electricity price increased by 6.5%.

Data centers are projected to consume up to 12% of U.S. electricity within the next three years.

Americans are paying more for electricity this summer thanks to a combination of extreme temperatures and the expansion of power-hungry data centers needed to support the surge in artificial intelligence usage.

Power demand from data centers in the U.S. is expected to nearly triple over the next three years, consuming as much as 12% of the country’s electricity, according to a Department of Energy-backed study, as reported by Reuters.

How will this influx in energy demand impact residential electricity bills? Here’s what we know about the change in electricity prices for the average consumer:

Which states are paying more for electricity?

Between May 2024 and May 2025, the average retail residential price for 1 kilowatt-hour of electricity increased about 6.5%, according to the most recent available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Electricity costs can vary due to energy rates, taxes, and utility fees in your area. A report from Choose Energy, an energy broker, has identified which states are facing higher electricity prices this year.

Residents in Idaho currently pay the cheapest residential electricity rates in the country at 11.88 cents per kWh, while Hawaii’s residents pay the highest electricity rates at 41.03 cents per kWh.

What is causing electricity prices to increase?

Many factors influence the price of electricity, including infrastructure costs, fuel prices, weather conditions, record-high temperatures and the balance of supply and demand, according to the EIA.

On July 28 from 7 to 8 p.m. ET, Americans consumed 758,149 megawatt-hours of electricity – a new national record, according to EIA. The extraordinary demand for power resulted from large, densely populated areas of the U.S. experiencing a slow-moving “heat dome,” which trapped high temperatures and humidity for days at a time, as previously reported by USA TODAY.

In addition to the extreme weather causing an overall increase in residential electricity consumption, the demand from artificial intelligence data centers has also been linked to rising electricity bills in some areas.

A recent report from The Washington Post found that some customers in areas serviced by PJM Interconnection, which coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or part of 13 states (Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia) and the District of Columbia, have seen their electricity bills increase because of data centers. Electricity bills for some consumers in New Jersey have increased by 20% and in Ohio, prices rose between 10% and 15%.

Last month, a Maryland federal district court ruled on another lawsuit against the EPA concerning canceled environmental justice grants.
Of the $2.8 billion in funding initially available for the environmental and climate justice program, about $500 million has not yet been obligated.","A coalition of nonprofits, tribes, and local governments is suing the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the termination of $2.8 billion in environmental and climate justice grants for disadvantaged communities.

One member of that coalition is located a few miles off the coast of the Bering Sea. The Native Village of Kipnuk (Qipneq), Alaska is built on thawing permafrost. Qipneq means ""bend"" in the Native Yup’ik language, referring to the village’s location along the meandering Kugkaktlik River.

In recent years, high water has become a common phenomenon in Kipnuk as the riverbanks become destabilized by melting permafrost, flooding, and erosion. Stronger storms in the region exacerbate damage to the village’s infrastructure.

The Native Village of Kipnuk is a federally recognized Tribe with around 1,700 members, including about 800 members who live along the river in Kipnuk. The Tribe relies on the surrounding land for subsistence living. Historically, members moved around the region following a nomadic lifestyle. But after the government built a school along the Kugkaktlik River in the 1930s, many families moved to the village of Kipnuk.

Today, erosion rates along the riverbank are between 10 to 28 feet a year, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director. And despite a number of assessments having been conducted in Kipnuk by the state and federal government over the past 15 years, the Tribe has yet to see any action to protect their community from high water.

“There’s been so many assessments that our tribe is getting tired of them,” said Paul. “They just want some action done.”

Earlier this year, it appeared that action might be on the horizon. Kipnuk was awarded a $20 million Community Change Grant under a $3 billion program from the EPA to carry out environmental and climate justice projects across the country. That program made $2.8 billion available for direct financial assistance to communities, local governments, and tribes. Kipnuk would use the money to address erosion along a stretch of riverbank that houses the community’s critical infrastructure, including the wind turbines that generate power, fuel tanks, several buildings, and the boardwalk connecting them.

The award was finalized in early January 2025, and Kipnuk’s project start date was set for March 1, 2025. When the funds were made available in early March, Paul hired a bookkeeper to keep track of grant spending and posted a job vacancy for a project manager. But a few days later, the project’s funding flow was turned off as part of President Donald Trump’s federal funding freeze. By May, the Trump administration had terminated the EPA’s environmental and climate justice grant program altogether.

For Paul, who also worked to put together the grant application in 2024, receiving the termination letter less than two months into starting the project was a significant blow. Amidst frozen funds and the grant cancellation, Paul has still not been compensated for her time, including the months she put in leading up to the award. Relaying the news about the grant cancellation to the rest of the community has been “discouraging,” Paul said.

“Everyone I’ve spoken to was like, ‘Oh man, what are we gonna do now?’ Their hopes fell,” Paul said.

Since May, the Native Village of Kipnuk and more than 20 others who have had their grants canceled have signed onto a class action lawsuit against the EPA and the Trump-appointed administrator, Lee Zeldin. The lawsuit, which was filed on June 25, will be heard in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia on Aug. 5.

Broken Promises

The town of Clinchco, Va. is at the heart of Dickenson County along the McClure River in the southwest corner of the state. It’s among a number of former coal camps in the region dealing with the economic impact of the coal industry’s decline: the town’s poverty rate was over 40% at the last U.S. Census. For the population of around 300, building resiliency is made more complicated by floodwaters from increasingly intense storms, including Hurricane Helene.

During a series of listening sessions over the past several months, Clinchco residents dreamed up a multifaceted approach to economic and disaster resilience. They envisioned a new green space along the McClure River that would mitigate flooding and serve as a local dog park. They also started designing a resiliency hub equipped with backup power and emergency supplies for shelter in times of need.

Clinchco is one of five rural communities in southwest Virginia included in a $500,000 grant to the nonprofit advocacy group Appalachian Voices, which hosted the listening sessions.

The grant money comes from the EPA’s now-canceled environmental and climate justice program, the same pool of funding as for the grant awarded to Kipnuk.

Appalachian Voices held more than a dozen listening sessions with residents across the region to plan community-level projects that would be paid for by the EPA grant. Clinchco had requested approximately $40,000 for start-up costs associated with engineering designs, surveys, and permitting to pursue the resiliency projects.

Like others in the region, those projects are now “dead in the water,” according to Tina Deel, Clinchco Clerk of Council.

“It’s just heartbreaking,” said Deel. Without the grant money, Clinchco cannot afford to build the green space and resiliency hub on its own. Appalachian Voices’ new economy program manager, Emma Kelly, said that even with the help of state and private funding, projects like the one in Clinchco have been set back years.

“It was a lot of effort to get this initial application in, and now that’s all gone, and there’s not a lot of time and energy left to do that again,” said Kelly. “This promise has been broken.”

In towns like Clinchco that voted heavily for Trump, Kelly described a “widespread sense of betrayal and confusion,” particularly among former coal miners and their families who had believed the administration would support their interests. Deel said that she and others in the town were shocked that the funding had been withdrawn. She said it’s not an action by the Trump administration that she or others support.

A Power of the Purse Argument

When the hearing begins on Aug. 5, much of the plaintiffs’ case will rest on the separation of powers between the three branches of government. Under the U.S. Constitution, the plaintiffs will argue that the executive branch does not have the authority to make decisions over programs that have been authorized and funded by the legislative branch.

Hana Vizcarra is a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the firms representing plaintiffs in Appalachian Voices et al. v. EPA. She said plaintiffs will argue that the EPA, an agency under Trump’s executive branch, violated the legislative branch’s “power of the purse” by canceling its environmental and climate justice program, which Congress created in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and section 138 of the Clean Air Act.

“This administration is trying to take power it doesn’t have,” said Vizcarra.

Last month, a Maryland federal district court ruled on another lawsuit against the EPA concerning canceled environmental justice grants. Vizcarra said attorneys will cite that case, Green & Healthy Homes Initiatives, Inc., et al. v. EPA, in their briefing.

There, the court found that the federal government violated the law by canceling grants made to regional grantmaking organizations selected to administer smaller grants to tribes, local governments, and community-based organizations. The Green & Healthy Homes ruling, which has been appealed by the EPA, did not go so far as to mandate the reinstatement of canceled funding for the three grantees involved, but it did make clear that the EPA cannot lawfully cancel grants on the grounds that environmental justice isn’t a priority of the current administration.

Rebecca Kaduru is the president of the Institute for Sustainable Communities, a plaintiff in Appalachian Voices.

The Institute for Sustainable Communities was selected as a national grantmaker for a portfolio of community-level grants ranging from $75,000 to $350,000 under the environmental and climate justice program. Kaduru said she believes the Green & Healthy Homes ruling sets up her organization’s case because it re-establishes grantmakers in some regions while organizations in others, like hers, are facing grant cancellations.

“There’s no reason why some Americans should have access and others not,” said Kaduru. “All Americans should have access to small grants for clean air and clean water.”

While there are similarities between the cases, Vizcarra stressed the two lawsuits differ in scope. Appalachian Voices is a class action lawsuit seeking a reinstatement of grant funding for all awardees impacted by the EPA’s cancellation of the environmental and climate justice program, not just the plaintiffs listed on the case.

The EPA filed a motion to dismiss the Appalachian Voices on July 14, arguing that the case is moot due to Congress’s recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). The EPA did not respond to the Daily Yonder’s request for comment for this story.

Attorney Ben Grillot with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is also representing plaintiffs in the case, said the OBBB does not amend any laws, like the Clean Air Act, to retroactively bar money from being spent on environmental and climate justice projects.

“The big beautiful bill did not change that language. What it did do was rescind any unobligated funds, but all the grants that have been awarded are in fact still obligated,” said Grillot.

Of the $2.8 billion in funding initially available for the environmental and climate justice program, about $500 million has not yet been obligated. Approximately $2.3 billion has been obligated in the form of awards made to grantees across the country.

Among the plaintiffs living or working in rural communities, there are mixed emotions leading up to the Aug. 5 hearing. While some are cautiously optimistic about the funding being restored, for others the damage has already been done.

In Kipnuk, the construction season is limited by Alaska’s long winter. If funds were to turn back on after the hearing in August, the village would have about a month to begin working on the riverbank before having to pause until the spring of 2026. In the meantime, community members continue to grapple with the impacts of riverine erosion, thawing permafrost, and flooding from storms that can take up to an acre of land at a time.

When asked whether there was hope the funding would be restored after the court case, Tina Deel of Clinchco said, “We’re not holding our breaths.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/73f886c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+135/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2F33%2F3d89de914e7fb3f7b4bb62543fe8%2Fkipnuk-lede-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-08-04 20:01:56.232722

This builds on Google’s successful demonstration with Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) “where we reduced the power demand associated with ML workloads during three grid events last year — paving the way for us to pursue opportunities at other locations,” Google noted.

“Meeting energy demand with reliable, affordable power takes an all-of-the-above approach,” said Claire Jones, Manager, Demand Response & Event Management Power Supply & Fuels. “TVA’s demand response programs are an important way we work with Local Power Companies and customers on days of peak energy use to protect the system. Our partnerships are a great example of how demand response programs can ensure we deliver reliable power while supporting economic growth and innovative industries.”

“I&M is excited to partner with Google to enable demand response capabilities at their new data center in Fort Wayne, Indiana. As we add new large loads to our system, it is critical that we partner with our customers to effectively manage the generation and transmission resources necessary to serve them. Google’s ability to leverage load flexibility as part of the strategy to serve their load will be a highly valuable tool to meet their future energy needs,” said Steve Baker, president and chief operating officer of I&M.

Google noted that the first data center demand response capabilities it developed involve shifting non-urgent tasks — like processing a YouTube video — during specific periods when the grid is strained.

“Through our ongoing partnerships with Centrica Energy and transmission system operator Elia in Belgium, and Taiwan Power Company in Taiwan, we've leveraged this capability to help grid operators maintain reliability during those periods of the year when demand is the highest,” wrote Michael Terrell, Head of Advanced Energy for Google, in a blog post.

“As AI adoption accelerates, we see a significant opportunity to expand our demand response toolkit, develop capabilities specifically for ML workloads, and leverage them to manage large new energy loads. By including load flexibility in our overall energy plan, we can manage AI-driven growth even where power generation and transmission are constrained. We believe this is a promising tool for managing large new energy loads and facilitating investment and growth,” wrote Terrell.

The Google executive said that data center demand flexibility is still in the early stages and will only be available at certain locations. “There are limits to how flexible a given data center can be, since high levels of reliability are critical for services like Search and Maps, as well as Cloud customers in essential industries like healthcare,” he said.

Incorporating ML workloads “is an important step to enable larger scale demand flexibility, delivering grid reliability and cost-saving benefits in the places where these capabilities are deployed. By engaging in long-term resource planning with utility partners like I&M and TVA, we can integrate flexibility into future grid development alongside Google’s data center infrastructure deployment.”

Terrell said that managing data center load growth will require a portfolio of solutions, including new generation and transmission investments, but demand response can play an important role.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-04 20:59:00.561757

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This letter includes financial information not prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow.","2025 Guidance Update

Last quarter, we cut our full year 2025 capital budget by 10% to $3.4 - $3.8 billion (from $3.8 - $4.2 billion) due to our concerns around macroeconomic uncertainty and our preference for Free Cash Flow generation over volume growth in an oversupplied market. With volatility and uncertainty persisting, we see no compelling reason to increase activity this year. Therefore, due to the combination of continued efficiency gains, synergies from our Endeavor merger and lower service costs, we are reducing our 2025 capital budget by another $100 million from the prior midpoint (~3%), to $3.4 - $3.6 billion.

We dropped four rigs in the second quarter, reducing our activity from 17 rigs to 13 rigs. We currently expect to run 13 to 14 rigs and five completion crews the rest of this year to execute on our capital and operating plan. Notably, due to capital efficiency improvements on the drilling side and better than expected volume performance, we expect to drill ~30 more gross wells and complete ~10 fewer wells than our last update, all while reducing capex. This results in a smaller than expected DUC drawdown and allows us to keep a DUC balance that provides for operational flexibility and the ability to increase production quickly when the oil market inevitably calls for growth barrels.

On the volume side, we are narrowing our annual oil production guidance to 485 - 492 MBO/d (moving midpoint up by 1 MBO/d) and increasing our annual BOE guidance by 2% to 890 - 910 MBOE/d. We have seen overall better gas capture beginning in the second quarter. In particular, we have seen improved capture and liquids yields in Martin County since Energy Transfer took over operations after acquiring West Texas Gas last year. They continue to invest in expanded gas processing capacity in one of our busiest areas of operation and long-haul egress out of the basin, something we support 100%.

Second Quarter Operational Performance

Oil production for the second quarter averaged 496 MBO/d (920 MBOE/d), near the top end of our 485 - 500 MBO/d (866 - 900 MBOE/d) guidance range. Capital expenditures were $864 million, near the midpoint of our $800 - $900 million guidance range.

Our operations team continues to exceed expectations and push the limits of efficiency, posting record‑low drilling and completion cycle times while delivering some of the longest wells in Company (and Texas) history. Our drilling team drilled the longest well in Diamondback history, and the fifth longest well in Texas history, reaching a total depth of 31,035 feet. A couple weeks ago, they drilled a 10,000 foot lateral, spud to total depth, in 4 days flat.

Our completions organization is also setting new efficiency benchmarks. In the second quarter, our completions crews averaged over 3,900 completed lateral feet per day, a Company quarterly record. We continue to test ways to maximize efficiency and reduce costs in all facets of the organization, fighting the headwinds of lower commodity prices and increased steel prices due to tariffs directly increasing our casing costs. We expect casing costs to increase almost 25% through the course of 2025, raising the breakeven cost of nearly every well drilled in the United States this year.

Thanks to our team’s relentless focus on cost discipline, cash operating costs fell to $10.10/BOE this quarter with Lease Operating Expense (“LOE”) of just $5.26/BOE. We expect LOE to increase slightly in the second half of the year but have been pleased to see additional operational synergies in the field compared to our initial cost expectations post closing the Endeavor merger. There is a significant opportunity to increase production, manage downtime and lower costs on the production side of the business. As more wells are drilled, we see a focus on the production tail becoming a significant priority.

Second Quarter Financial Performance and Return of Capital

We generated $1.7 billion of net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter, translating to $1.2 billion of Free Cash Flow and $1.3 billion of Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We remain committed to our stockholder return program by returning approximately $691 million to stockholders in the second quarter through our base dividend and stock repurchases, equating to ~52% of Adjusted Free Cash Flow. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares for ~$398 million, equating to a weighted average price of $133.15 per share. Through the first half of 2025, we have repurchased a total of 6.6 million shares for $973 million, an aggressive pace compared to prior years as the Company has grown and leaned into buybacks over other forms of return of capital. This underscores our conviction that our share price is still meaningfully below its intrinsic value, presenting an attractive, accretive opportunity to deploy capital. Notably, our repurchase strategy has brought our current outstanding share count back to the level we held prior to announcing the Double Eagle acquisition earlier this year.

To date in the third quarter, we have repurchased 1,669,115 shares for approximately $238 million at a weighted average price of $142.45. Importantly, on July 31st our Board approved an incremental $2.0 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization program, lifting our total buyback approval to $8.0 billion ($4.5 billion executed to date).

Balance Sheet

Consolidated net debt rose by roughly $2.8 billion in conjunction with the close of the Double Eagle acquisition on April 1st. In May, after closing the Viper Drop‑Down, we retired our $900 million term loan maturing this September. We exited the quarter with approximately $15.3 billion of consolidated gross debt and $15.1 billion of consolidated net debt. Looking ahead, we expect to continue reducing net debt through Free Cash Flow generation and proceeds from non-core asset sales.

Additionally, we repurchased $252 million in aggregate principal amount of our longer dated bonds at a weighted average price of 76.8% of par (~$196 million) in the second quarter due to the increase in long dated treasury rates. This approach to debt repurchases mirrors our approach on the equity side, opportunistically repurchasing at a value discount.

Non-Core Asset Sales

In July, we realized net proceeds of approximately $130 million from the previously announced sale of our 10% interest in the BANGL pipeline. Shortly thereafter, we executed a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Riverbend Energy Group to divest certain non‑operated properties in the Delaware Basin for approximately $138 million. This deal is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.

Additionally, we have made considerable progress on hitting our $1.5 billion non-core asset sale target and look forward to providing the market a comprehensive update soon.

Closing

In closing, this is my first quarterly letter after formally moving into the CEO role at our annual meeting in May. It has been an eventful first quarter with the business evolving at a rapid pace, but that should be expected at Diamondback Energy and is not a departure from my last nine years at the Company. While the shoes I have stepped into are big, I have an incredible support system with Travis as Exec Chair, a cohesive management team, a strong Board and the best employees in the business. As stockholders, you should continue to expect to see three things out of Diamondback: best in class execution, low-cost operations and transparency.

Thank you for your interest in Diamondback Energy.

Sincerely,

Kaes Van't Hof

Forward-Looking Statements:

This letter contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding future performance; business strategy; future operations (including drilling plans and capital plans); estimates and projections of revenues, losses, costs, expenses, returns, cash flow, and financial position; reserve estimates and its ability to replace or increase reserves; anticipated benefits or other effects of strategic transactions (including the Endeavor merger, the recently completed Double Eagle acquisition, Viper Drop Down and other acquisitions or divestitures); the expected amount and timing of synergies from the Endeavor merger; and plans and objectives of management (including plans for future cash flow from operations and for executing environmental strategies) are forward-looking statements. When used in this letter, the words “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “future,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “model,” “outlook,” “plan,” “positioned,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” and similar expressions (including the negative of such terms) are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. Although Diamondback believes that the expectations and assumptions reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, they involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, in many cases, beyond Diamondback’s control. Accordingly, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual outcomes could differ materially from what Diamondback has expressed in its forward-looking statements.

Factors that could cause the outcomes to differ materially include (but are not limited to) the following: changes in supply and demand levels for oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, and the resulting impact on the price for those commodities; the impact of public health crises, including epidemic or pandemic diseases and any related company or government policies or actions; changes in U.S. energy, environmental, monetary and trade policies, including with respect to tariffs or other trade barriers, and any resulting trade tensions; actions taken by the members of OPEC and Russia affecting the production and pricing of oil, as well as other domestic and global political, economic, or diplomatic developments, including any impact of conflicts in the Middle East and other regions on the global energy markets and geopolitical stability; instability in the financial markets; concerns over a potential economic slowdown or recession; inflationary pressures on the costs of products or services used in our operations due to the imposition of tariffs or otherwise; higher interest rates and their impact on the cost of capital; regional supply and demand factors, including delays, curtailment delays or interruptions of production, or governmental orders, rules or regulations that impose production limits; federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, including the effect of existing and future laws and governmental regulations; physical and transition risks relating to climate change; those risks described in Item 1A of Diamondback’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2025, and those risks disclosed in its subsequent filings on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which can be obtained free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and Diamondback’s website at www.diamondbackenergy.com/investors.

In light of these factors, the events anticipated by Diamondback’s forward-looking statements may not occur at the time anticipated or at all. Moreover, Diamondback operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. Diamondback cannot predict all risks, nor can it assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by any forward-looking statements it may make. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this letter or, if earlier, as of the date they were made. Diamondback does not intend to, and disclaims any obligation to, update or revise any forward-looking statements unless required by applicable law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This letter includes financial information not prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow. The non-GAAP information should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Diamondback's quarterly results posted on Diamondback's website at www.diamondbackenergy.com/investors/. Furthermore, this letter includes or references certain forward-looking, non-GAAP financial measures. Because Diamondback provides these measures on a forward-looking basis, it cannot reliably or reasonably predict certain of the necessary components of the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures, such as future impairments and future changes in working capital. Accordingly, Diamondback is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of such forward-looking, non-GAAP financial measures to the respective most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures. Diamondback believes that these forward-looking, non-GAAP measures may be a useful tool for the investment community in comparing Diamondback's forecasted financial performance to the forecasted financial performance of other companies in the industry.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SM5hlLJQ6TaFWwNwhmqSoA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD00Mzg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/65079ff8af771091c3a6d0b503fecdcc,N,,2025-08-04 20:02:53.985359

States like Iowa, Idaho, and Washington show lower economic viability for battery systems, as do economically disadvantaged communities and less-populated areas.","New research shows battery storage paired with solar panels can reduce electricity costs while providing critical backup power during increasingly common grid outages.

A new Stanford University study reveals that most American households could reduce electricity costs and maintain power during outages by installing solar panels with battery storage systems. According to the research published August 1 in Nature Energy, approximately 60% of US families could reduce their electricity costs by an average of 15% with solar-battery systems, even after accounting for installation and operating expenses.

Economic benefits extend beyond solar alone

The battery component proves particularly valuable, as 63% of households could maintain about half their electricity needs during blackouts without increasing their overall energy costs.

""With electricity rates now rising in most states, shaving utility bills can help people quite a bit, but the ability to ride out local or regional blackouts is becoming very important to many families,"" stated Ram Rajagopal, associate professor at Stanford and the study's senior author. ""That's because US electricity infrastructure is old and getting replaced slowly, while the extreme weather events like hurricanes and heat waves that cause blackouts are becoming more frequent, intense, and longer lasting.""

Tax credit deadline approaches for battery installations

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law on July 4 will end the residential clean energy tax credits established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Currently, homeowners can deduct 30% of investment costs for solar panels and batteries from federal taxes – potentially saving $12,000 on a $40,000 system.

""The bill does affect our analysis starting next year since our calculations include the 30% federal tax credit,"" explained lead author Tao Sun, a postdoctoral scholar in Rajagopal's lab. ""However, homeowners can still access tax credits indirectly after 2025 through leasing arrangements or power purchase agreements. These indirect benefits will continue until 2027 for solar and 2033 for batteries.""

Without the tax credit, the percentage of households for which solar-battery systems are economically viable would drop from 60% to about 32%. However, Sun added, ""By 2033, though, the falling price of battery packs would have the figure back at 60% and rising.""

Battery economics improve as utility compensation changes

Battery storage has become increasingly attractive as utilities reduce compensation rates for excess solar electricity. Many states now pay based on how much the electricity saves the utility rather than the full retail rate, making it more economical for homeowners to store energy in batteries for personal use rather than selling it back to the grid.

This shift has transformed the value proposition for residential batteries, which previously struggled to demonstrate economic benefits when grid-tied solar systems effectively used the utility as free storage.

Geographic disparities in battery backup benefits

The researchers found that battery backup benefits vary significantly by location. Ironically, homes in states where power outages are more frequent would generally see lower backup improvements from solar-battery systems.

""The solar-battery benefits often fail to align with the areas that need them most, like in certain high-outage-risk states where only one-fourth of households can get affordable backup power from solar-battery systems,"" noted Arun Majumdar, dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and study co-author.

Battery technology costs key to future adoption

The study highlights how battery costs remain a critical factor in the economic equation. States like Iowa, Idaho, and Washington show lower economic viability for battery systems, as do economically disadvantaged communities and less-populated areas.

""Economic incentives, financing mechanisms, and community-based deployment programs that target areas with high financial and reliability needs but low economic viability of solar-battery systems could help families that need such systems the most,"" said Sun.

Rajagopal emphasized that falling battery technology costs will continue changing the landscape: ""With technology costs declining, electricity rates rising, and US federal tax incentives and rates paid to families selling excess solar power changing, further research and analysis will be crucial for informing policymakers.""

He added that future innovations could include ""mobile energy storage that can move into neighborhoods when needed to supply backup power beyond the household level. Such innovations could make our energy system more affordable, sustainable, and resilient, especially in neighborhoods currently with little access to clean energy.""

Across the US, communities are already facing the devastating impacts of climate change, record-breaking heat, flooding, wildfires, and more. Weakening power plant pollution rules threatens our climate progress and the opportunity to advance a cleaner, more just energy system.

We’ve drafted a sample comment that you can submit to oppose the current proposal around GHG emissions from power plants. Take action below and let the USEPA know that Illinoisans won’t stand by while our climate protections are gutted.

This proposal is just one of the administration’s many attacks on the nation’s ability to tackle climate change. In July, Trump signed the Big Bad Budget Bill that will slash funding for climate and clean energy related programs. What’s more, budgets for staff and research are being gutted across agencies like the Department of Energy, the USEPA, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Just last week (on July 29) the USEPA announced plans to formally rescind the “2009 endangerment finding”, which is the legal and scientific basis for the government’s ability to regulate GHG emissions from all sectors. The announcement was met with immediate pushback, including a rally in Chicago. There will continue to be fierce public and legal opposition to this proposal and we’ll share ways to engage soon.",https://prairierivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GHGEmission-PublicComments-08.04.25.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 20:02:11.164995

As for residential solar, Absolute Solar CEO Rob Kaercher told Tech Brew in the spring that some clients were pausing or canceling solar projects because they were worried that the tax credits would disappear.
And according to Steve Hamile, COO of Nevada solar provider Sol-Up, net metering is more important than tax credits when it comes to making solar energy systems affordable.
Because of that, Hamile told Tech Brew he’d always wanted the tax credits to phase out—just not as fast as they will now.
Solar in those states and areas, Hamile said, will be most affected by the elimination of the tax credits.","The solar industry is disappointed: After months of lobbying Congress to preserve clean energy tax credits for solar power, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which President Trump signed last month, phases out tax credits for investment in and production of solar power.

Instead of subsidies granted by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for solar projects that started construction before 2033, they now will only be available for projects that commence construction within the next year or are in service before the end of 2027.

Brendan Bell, COO and managing director of clean energy firm Aligned Climate Capital, told Tech Brew that the policy changes are bad for the climate and the US economy.

“All of the manufacturing that had come to the US to support these new rules—which was creating jobs in places that haven’t had jobs in a long time, creating an economic industrial base here in the US—that’s gone,” he said. “If there’s anything that is most disastrous about this, it is, there is no longer a reason to have a solar manufacturing plant in the United States.”

But that doesn’t mean solar won’t bounce back. Solar installers, developers, and investors told Tech Brew that the industry will go through a period of transition in which consumers and businesses face a lot of uncertainty about whether they’ll be able to receive those sunsetting tax credits, and power prices will rise. But once the dust settles, they said, solar will be able to survive without subsidies.

“Every developer who you’ve signed a contract with is going to come back and say ‘I need you to pay more for your power,’ because of tax credits,” Bell said. “But people will transition to a different world, and it just means that consumers, whether you’re [a business] or you’re a homeowner, you’re going to pay more for power.”

For now, Bell said Aligned will move forward with projects already in motion and work to “get ahead of the [foreign entity of concern] requirements,” a provision in the new law that restricts clean energy projects from using equipment from foreign entities, like China.

“Our contracts will just build in adjustments,” Bell said. “If you get the tax credits, it’s this price. If it’s not, it’s this price.”

Dealing with uncertainty

However, developers (and the people paying them) won’t know if they’ll be able to receive tax credits because they don’t control when a solar power system is placed in service—utilities do. As for residential solar, Absolute Solar CEO Rob Kaercher told Tech Brew in the spring that some clients were pausing or canceling solar projects because they were worried that the tax credits would disappear. Now, he said, clients are confused about the phase-out process.

“There’s just unease about what [we can] trust,” Kaercher said of his clients. “Regardless of incentives or underlying policy, when you obscure what’s going on and make it difficult to follow, that uncertainty just hurts industries across the board.”

Absolute Solar is currently “extremely busy and booked out” with all types of solar projects, but Kaercher said he expects most of its projects will be commercial or nonprofit installations next year, given that the residential clean energy credit is only available until the end of 2025.

“It’s more prioritizing or benefiting larger industry, utility-scale projects,” Kaercher said, which “leaves your average person with less tools and less ability to invest in their own future and combat ever-rising rates.”

The loss of a continued solar boom will also hurt the grid, Kaercher said, as residential solar helps flatten the energy demand curve that strains the grid and leads to outages.

Using other incentives

Though the tax credits are being phased out, many states still allow net metering, an energy billing policy that discounts the electricity bills of commercial or residential consumers whose solar energy systems send power back to the grid. And according to Steve Hamile, COO of Nevada solar provider Sol-Up, net metering is more important than tax credits when it comes to making solar energy systems affordable. Because of that, Hamile told Tech Brew he’d always wanted the tax credits to phase out—just not as fast as they will now.

“We’ve been a strong believer that subsidies need to sunset over time,” Hamile said. “We just feel that it should have sunset [at] a slower pace.”

That said, some states don’t have net-metering rules, and utilities aren’t required to provide compensation for consumers with solar energy systems. Solar in those states and areas, Hamile said, will be most affected by the elimination of the tax credits.

Hamile isn’t alone in wanting to see the solar industry stand on its own without subsidies: Jorge Vargas, CEO of solar development and financing company Aspen Power, told Tech Brew that the tax credits are being phased out too quickly.

“[The US’s] competitive edge was the fact that we made our infrastructure decisions over 10, 20-year spans—which is the right thing to do. But now this administration chose to change that, and in a very hasty and poorly drafted way,” Vargas said. “That’s what the biggest impact is: [the disruptive] way that we’re going to do this.”

Vargas also said he expects the solar industry to get a boost from another type of incentive: some “big, beautiful PPAs”—power purchase agreements—with companies looking to lock down energy prices before they start to rise.

“We’re ready to embrace what’s next. And in a world where power prices increase, we have a product that can compete,” Vargas said. “We will emerge from this.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/c9d2ed4bd203b2e6f59d23296cbc541a5d6dc55c-3000x2000.jpg?rect=0,212,3000,1575&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-08-04 20:01:32.375577

I&M announced on Monday that it had filed a special, joint contract with Google designed to reduce the stress on the power grid as much as possible. The Fortune 100 company will “leverage new capabilities” to reduce electricity demand during peak hours, postponing the activities that use the most energy.

Director of Marketing and Communications Stephany Smith said when lots of people use their heat or air conditioning in extreme weather, it puts a strain on the power grid. They ask their customers to cut back on power, where they can, during prime time hours.

She said this deal is similar to that program.

“This also saves all of our customers’ money because if we’re not using all that power, we’re not having to buy the power and that saves our customers money,” Smith said. “This benefits everyone.”

Smith said this contract makes Google a ‘good grid partner.’

Both agencies are now waiting on the Indiana Utilities Regulatory Commission to approve the contract. However, one has already taken action against this contract.

The Citizens Action Coalition said because of the redactions limiting public access to the full document, they are filing a petition.

“We have intervened in the proceeding,” Director Kerwin Olson said in a statement over email. “We will work diligently in this case to protect I&M ratepayers, to ensure that Google is actually paying their fair share, and bring as much transparency to the case as possible. Considering the massive amounts of public subsidies that Big Tech, like Google, are demanding, the public has a right to be fully informed.”

Olson hopes that by intervening in the proceeding, the CAC ensures both Google and I&M are held accountable.",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/06/6853e5d8591975.80411225.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-04 20:59:05.757955

In a memo made public late Friday, the administration said that it would seek to block projects that take up a lot of room, calling wind and solar “highly inefficient uses of Federal land.”

The memo said that the administration would “only permit those energy projects that are the most appropriate land use when compared to a reasonable range of project alternatives.”

In doing so, it will put together a report of further actions that are needed to accomplish this goal.

“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum in a written statement.

The renewable industry balked at the effort — saying it could have significant impacts on developing wind and solar energy on public lands.

“Depending on how it’s ultimately implemented, it could have serious implications for new projects moving forward,” said Gene Grace, general counsel for the American Clean Power Association, a renewable lobbying group.

John Hensley, the organization’s senior vice president for Markets and Policy Analysis, also said that while wind and solar projects may be large, that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re bad for the environment.

“In the case of wind and solar, they do require much larger total project footprints, but the amount of land that’s actually disturbed … is a fraction of the total project size,” said Hensley, who noted that wind in particular is very efficient if you consider land that’s actually disturbed rather than the entire size of a wind farm.

Wind power brings steady income for farms Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America.
In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021.
The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits.
Renewable energy also powers rural economies Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.","Drive through the plains of Iowa or Kansas and you’ll see more than rows of corn, wheat and soybeans. You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.

But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.

Wind power brings steady income for farms

Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricitycame from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around US$3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.

Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.

Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.

In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing between 38% and 69%of tax revenue.

The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm

Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.

Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics– dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.

Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.

However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.

Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.

What’s being lost

The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.

The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.

While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies

Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.

Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.

In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing – such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries– and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.

On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.

As rural America faces economic uncertainty and climate pressures, I believe homegrown renewable energy offers a practical path forward. Wind and solar aren’t just fueling the grid; they’re helping keep farms and rural towns alive.",https://governorsbiofuelscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/favicon-biofuels.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 22:00:24.908098

Between Eldorado Valley and Ivanpah Valley, the latter won out.
Plans for the airport were first initiated in 2000 when the Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Act, championed by U.S.
Senator Harry Reid and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, transferred about 6,000 acres of public land to Clark County for a new airport.
In 2010 the Clark County Department of Aviation asked the federal government to suspend any work on the environmental review.","A proposed airport on a dry lakebed near the Nevada-California border is gaining traction as a solution to passenger demand – and raising questions about the potential impact on water, wildlife, and air quality.

Federal officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management held one of their first public meetings on the proposed Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport Wednesday– a project nearly three-decades in the making.

The airport would be one of the largest in the nation by land area, sprawling across 23,000 acres of public land in the Ivanpah Valley north of Primm.

Nearly a hundred people attended the meeting to provide public comments on the proposed airport – input that will help guide the federal government as they work through the environmental review process.

That review will likely center on the airport’s potential impact on two endangered species who call the area home: the desert tortoise and the white-margined penstemon, a small pink bell-shaped flower.

Early maps of the project show that desert tortoises will likely need to be relocated to accommodate the construction of the airport. However, recent studies have suggested that relocating desert tortoises can be detrimental to their survival.

One long-term study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that in the first three years of relocating 158 desert tortoises less than 10 miles from their habitat about 50% died, mostly due to predators.

The airport would also encroach on one of the sole known populations of the white-margined penstemon. A 2021 study commissioned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found a 50% chance of extinction for the wildflower in the next 50 years due to climate change and habitat destruction.

The Center for Biological Diversity and the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter held a press conference outside the meeting to speak on the airport’s potential impact on desert habitat and wildlife.

“If we destroy our desert for sprawl, we will end up harming our ecosystems, harming our air quality, diminishing our water supplies, and affecting people here in Las Vegas very substantially,” said Patrick Donnelly, the Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity.

Critics of the multi-billion dollar project said the airport was a sign of reckless sprawl in Southern Nevada, a region experiencing severe long-term drought.

State officials have suggested the new airport could lead to further development. In 2023, state lawmakers unanimously approved Senate Bill 19 which would allow Clark County to put aside at least 5,000 acres for a new commercial and residential development in the vicinity of the new airport.

“We cannot afford to sprawl all the way down to Jean. We cannot afford the wildlife impacts or the water impacts or the air quality impacts from adding a second gigantic commercial airport,” said Vinny Spotleson, the president of the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter.

Several locals who spoke at the meeting questioned the need for a second airport, noting the development of high-speed rail between Nevada and California, and the presence of several other airports in southern Nevada that could be expanded to meet demand.

James Chrisley, the senior director for the Clark County Department of Aviation, said the Harry Reid International Airport will not be able to keep up with projected demand for air travel without the Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport.

According to estimates by the agency, the Harry Reid International Airport will reach its full capacity of 63 million to 65 million passengers annually by 2030. The airport would accommodate both passenger and cargo flights.

Decades-old decisions have also left the county with limited options when it comes to the location of an additional airport.

“We’re landlocked,” Chrisley said.

The Harry Reid Airport was initially built in 1942 outside the city of Las Vegas, in a relatively undeveloped area. However, the rapid growth of the Las Vegas metropolitan area over subsequent decades led to the city’s suburbs surrounding the airport, effectively landlocking it.

The Clark County Department of Aviation has evaluated several locations and looked into potentially modifying smaller airports to meet their needs, but concluded Ivanpah Valley was the only feasible option.

More than a dozen sites were evaluated by 2005 as potential locations for the airport before being whittled down to four: Apex, Eldorado Valley, Moapa Reservation, and Ivanpah Valley.

Nellis Air Force Base, Moapa Reservation, and Apex were eventually eliminated due to airspace constraints. Between Eldorado Valley and Ivanpah Valley, the latter won out.

“We’ve revalidated that study recently and continue to look at it just to make sure this is truly the only feasible site,” Chrisley said.

Plans for the airport were first initiated in 2000 when the Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Act, championed by U.S. Senator Harry Reid and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, transferred about 6,000 acres of public land to Clark County for a new airport.

The Clark County Department of Aviation submitted their first draft by 2006, but local economic conditions following the Great Recession and other local budgetary constraints stalled the project for decades. In 2010 the Clark County Department of Aviation asked the federal government to suspend any work on the environmental review.

Chrisley said things changed this year after the Harry Reid International Airport recorded 58.4 million passengers last year, a 1.39% increase over 2023’s previous high.

“We’ve been planning this for 25 years, and I personally have been on this for the last almost 10 years. It’s time. The Valley continues to grow and we need to support the innovation of this community,” Chrisley said.

Preliminary plans show the airport would include a central terminal, two runways, a taxiway system, and an air traffic control tower. The plan would also require an expansion of the Interstate-15 and a new dedicated interchange.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airport-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 19:01:16.765846

If adopted, the rule could exempt many wireless projects from longstanding review requirements, including: small cell installations, towers under 200 feet that don’t require antenna structure registration, and rural 5G buildouts authorized under geographic licenses.

When the FCC sought comment on CTIA’s petition in May, at least nine individual Tribal governments weighed in to oppose the plan, as did eleven state historic preservation offices and a dozen cities and counties.

Those in opposition warned the FCC’s changes, if adopted, could exempt large categories of wireless projects from Section 106 tribal consultations and historic site assessments under the NHPA, a move that several Tribal Nations argued would violate federal trust responsibilities and dismantle longstanding protections for sacred sites.

In comments filed this spring, the Suquamish Indian Tribe argued that removing NHPA “undertaking” status would eliminate Tribal consultation entirely, and therefore, “contradict the Federal Indian trust responsibility, one of the most important principles in federal Indian law.”

The Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe similarly warned that the CTIA-backed proposal “would limit government-to-government consultation with Tribal Nations, eliminate cultural resources project reviews, and adversely impact and destroy our tribal cultural resources.”

The National Congress of American Indians and the National Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers jointly emphasized that the FCC must “meaningfully consult with Tribal Nations in a government-to-government capacity during the pre-decisional period.”

Despite these objections, the FCC has signaled that only public-record filings – not private consultation – will be considered in the official decision-making process. While Tribal leaders were invited to engage in off-the-record consultations with FCC commissioners, the rulemaking clarified that the FCC will only rely on filed comments and presentations placed in the docket in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.

“To be clear, while the Commission recognizes consultation is critically important, we emphasize that the Commission will rely in its decision-making only on those presentations that are placed in the public record for this proceeding,” page 42 of the notice for rule-making stated.

Wireless industry argues for 'fresh look' at efforts to permit wireless infrastructure

Meanwhile, CTIA – backed by carriers AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile and infrastructure firms like Crown Castle – met with FCC staff last week to reiterate support for the proposed rulemaking. The group argued the rule aligns with the federal government’s broader effort to scale back NEPA reviews, and the Supreme Court’s May decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County.

“Taking a fresh look at application of NEPA to wireless deployments is… especially appropriate given recent changes to the legal environment, resulting from both bipartisan changes to NEPA and a recent Supreme Court ruling holding that agency NEPA decisions are entitled to substantial deference, and clarifying that NEPA is not intended as a substantive roadblock to infrastructure projects,” CTIA wrote.",https://broadbandbreakfast.com/content/images/2025/08/ctia-2-1.webp,N,,2025-08-04 20:58:37.073013

GOP senators including Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Mike Rounds of South Dakota have also objected to Interior Department efforts to restrict approvals of wind and solar projects.
“What it means for a project to ‘begin construction’ has been well established by Treasury guidance for more than a decade.
Moreover, Congress specifically references current Treasury guidance to set that term’s meaning in law,” Grassley said in the Congressional Record.
“This is a case where both the law and congressional intent are clear.”","Grassley, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, announced in Friday’s Congressional Record that he had placed holds on three Treasury nominees: Brian Morrissey to be general counsel, Francis Brooke to be assistant Treasury secretary and Jonathan McKernan, who is nominated to become an undersecretary at the department.

A person familiar with the effort granted anonymity because the move was not made public told POLITICO Monday that Curtis has also placed holds on the same three nominees.

Two Republicans would not be enough to block the nominees on the floor.

But the pair, alongside other GOP senators such as Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), have escalated their pressure on the Trump administration in recent days to back off its efforts to strangle new solar and wind energy projects, warning that potential cancellations would make it harder to meet growing power demand, as POLITICO has detailed.

The White House and Treasury Department did not immediately comment about the holds.

GOP senators including Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Mike Rounds of South Dakota have also objected to Interior Department efforts to restrict approvals of wind and solar projects.

Grassley said he would object to consideration of the Treasury nominees until he can be “certain that such rules and regulations adhere to the law and congressional intent.”

His comments follow the July executive order from Trump that injected new uncertainty for solar and wind developers facing already onerous new deadlines under Republicans’ mega tax and spending law, H.R. 1 (119).

The order called on Treasury to “strictly enforce” the termination of the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities, including by issuing new guidance related to when a project is deemed to have begun construction — a potential outcome that Grassley and other GOP senators said they sought to safeguard against.

While the One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends the tax credits for projects that start producing electricity after 2027, those GOP senators added a last-minute compromise to offer more time for projects that begin construction in the next 12 months.

“What it means for a project to ‘begin construction’ has been well established by Treasury guidance for more than a decade. Moreover, Congress specifically references current Treasury guidance to set that term’s meaning in law,” Grassley said in the Congressional Record. “This is a case where both the law and congressional intent are clear.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa3%2F6f%2F6e38918c435a94d33fa0720d825d%2Fchuck-grassley-74512.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 19:01:30.494300

Hundreds of Georgia households can get free rooftop solar energy through a program that launched Monday.

Georgia BRIGHT, a statewide initiative to deliver communities affordable solar energy and economic opportunity, will offer rooftop solar arrays at no cost to Georgia households earning 80% of their area’s median income. Qualifying households can register now, with a drawing being held next month to randomly select about 400 recipients.

“It is a fully prepaid solar lease, so there’s no upfront cost, no monthly cost, no maintenance cost,” said program director Alicia Brown. “It’s as truly no-cost as a program can get.”

The program will also cover the cost of some upgrades that may be needed to make a house ready for solar, like trimming tree branches or shoring up the roof.

Georgia BRIGHT’s programs use a $159 million Solar for All grant and federal tax credits, both from the Biden administration’s signature climate legislation, to install rooftop solar for low- and middle-income households. The organization aims to cut down on climate-warming energy sources, while also helping people address rising power bills.

The recent behemoth budget reconciliation bill, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” signed into law by President Donald Trump, claws back much of the funding for renewables and sunsets the tax credits in that Biden-era climate bill. Georgia BRIGHT’s grant money was already committed, so the program still has its funding. However, Brown said the organization is working on ways to be “nimble” in case it’s unable to claim tax credits in the future.

The goal across most of Georgia BRIGHT’s programs is to save those Georgians at least 20% on their energy costs.

But according to Brown, that percentage just isn’t enough to be “transformative” for many families.

“It wouldn’t be enough to really improve their financial situation in a life-changing way,” she said. “That’s something that only no-cost solar could do.”

Because the households receiving no-cost solar won’t have to make lease payments for their systems, they’re expected to save around 50-70% on their energy bills.

Internal briefings warned field supervisors that reinforcements may never arrive and urged caution in initial attack strategies.

More than 4,500 Forest Service firefighting positions — about 26% of the total — sat vacant in mid-July, with vacancy rates of 39% in the Pacific Northwest and 37% in the Intermountain region despite official claims of being “fully prepared.”

A sweeping reorganization will close nine regional offices and relocate many staff to two Western hubs, a shift expected to trigger fresh resignations as above-normal fire activity looms.

Key quote:

“We were told: Don’t commit to an attack thinking the cavalry is going to come.”

— Anonymous U.S. Forest Service employee

Why this matters:

Wildfires are burning longer, hotter and closer to communities as climate-driven drought, heat, and invasive grasses extend the fire season across the West. When federal crews are understaffed, local engines, volunteer departments, and even international partners must fill the gap, stretching resources thin and slowing containment. Smaller teams mean bigger fires that pump more smoke into the air, worsening asthma, heart disease, and pregnancy risks hundreds of miles downwind. Forests already stressed by beetles and heat suffer deeper tree mortality, releasing still more carbon and degrading watersheds that supply cities from Denver to Los Angeles. With extreme fire weather projected to intensify, gaps in the nation’s primary wildfire workforce heighten ecological damage and put more firefighters and residents in harm’s way.

In short:

China’s EV subsidies, worth an estimated $231 billion since 2010, helped the country move 6.4 million electric cars last year, five times U.S. sales.

Beijing now controls about 85% of global lithium-ion battery production capacity and roughly 80% of the solar-panel supply chain.

Experts blame the U.S. retreat on decades of stop-start policies that cut research budgets, dropped purchase incentives, and left inventors without a domestic market.

Key quote:

“The Chinese have just cleaned our clock by having consistent policy.”

— David Kirsch, professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland

Why this matters:

Electric cars, advanced batteries, and cheap solar panels sit at the heart of any realistic plan to blunt climate change, yet the United States — where each technology was first proved — now relies on imports for them. Heavy dependence on Chinese supply chains increases geopolitical risk and exposes consumers to price shocks if trade tensions flare. It also concentrates the health and environmental burdens of mining, smelting, and manufacturing in provinces with laxer pollution controls, exporting airborne pollutants and water contamination along with finished goods. Meanwhile, domestic workers miss out on rapidly growing clean-energy jobs, and regulators have less leverage to enforce labor and safety standards abroad. The policy gap, not the science, dictates who captures the economic and public-health rewards.

In short:

A Norwegian Arctic Circle station hit 30C on 13 July days, while parts of Finland endured three weeks of 30C heat, eclipsing records that date to 1961.

Meteorologists blame a stubborn high-pressure system and unusually warm coastal waters; hospitals opened ice rinks for relief, and reindeer herders warned of animals dying from heat stress.

Researchers say nations adapted for cold — such as Norway, Sweden and the UK — face the steepest rise in dangerously hot days because buildings, transit, and health services were designed for cooler climates.

Key quote:

“To find a longer period at these stations, you have to go back more than a century.”

— Sverker Hellström, a scientist at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute

Why this matters:

Extreme heat at the top of the world is a flashing red light for both climate stability and public health. The Arctic is warming about four times faster than the global average, melting sea ice that helps regulate weather patterns far beyond the pole. When 30C days linger above the treeline, northern peatlands dry out, releasing stored carbon, and amplifying warming. Heat also strains bodies unaccustomed to it: Nordic homes lack air-conditioning, hospitals see spikes in dehydration and heart stress, and outdoor workers — from forestry crews to Sami herders — face greater risk of injury. Accelerating temperature swings test power grids built for heating, not cooling, and threaten ecosystems already squeezed by shifting seasons. Hotter poles can end up affecting into food prices, migration, and weather extremes worldwide.

In short:

Trump-era reductions left at least a dozen NWS launch sites idle, including Kotzebue, Alaska, forcing a pause in routine radiosonde flights.

WindBorne Systems and other venture-backed firms now sell balloon, buoy and drone measurements to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under a “data-as-a-service” model that lets them keep the hardware.

Former NOAA officials warn that substituting private data for the agency’s own could fracture the historical climate record and leave taxpayers captive to proprietary fees.

Key quote:

“There’s a contradictory nature to what this administration is doing, advocating for private sector delivery of data and then removing a third of the weather service. Who’s going to manage these programs and make sure they’re effective?”

— Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator during the Biden administration

Why this matters:

Weather data are the foundation of storm warnings, aviation safety, and climate science. And carbon-driven warming trends are measured against NOAA’s radiosonde archive, built balloon by balloon since the 1930s. If cost-cutting turns that public asset into a pay-per-view feed, emergency managers, pilots, and farmers could face blind spots just as ocean temperatures set new records and rapid-fire hurricanes threaten coastal hospitals. Relying on venture-capital start-ups also introduces business risk: A bankruptcy, software change, or data embargo could arrive faster than a storm front.

In short:

Phú Quốc has 286 tourism and real estate projects covering 9,600 hectares, and officials have approved conversion of more than 180 hectares of mostly special-use forest since July 2024.

A 2024 land-law overhaul lets provinces approve forest conversion for industry, resorts, and urban zones without National Assembly review, sharply accelerating approvals nationwide.

The Cityland resort alone will erase 57.7 hectares inside Phú Quốc National Park and force 508 families to relocate, many of whom call state compensation inadequate.

Key quote:

“I am not opposing the government. They say this project will help develop the local economy and improve people’s lives, but the local authorities are acquiring people’s land with very low compensation to hand it over to private company.""

— Huỳnh Ngọc Vân, Rạch Tràm resident

Why this matters:

Vietnam’s tropical forests hold some of Southeast Asia’s last refuges for hornbills, pangolins, and old-growth melaleuca swamps that filter water, temper storms, and lock away carbon. When provincial officials convert that canopy to asphalt, species lose habitat, coastal villages surrender natural flood barriers, and air quality drops as wood is burned or milled. Tourism compounds the strain, draining aquifers and spilling plastic and wastewater into the Gulf of Thailand. By classing tree plantations and degraded scrub with intact forest, the law masks biodiversity loss and encourages paper gains in “cover” while real forests vanish. Phú Quốc’s trajectory demonstrates the challenges facing rapidly urbanizing islands across the global South.

In short:

The combined national targets are just 2% higher than they were at Cop28, putting the world on track for about 7.4 terawatts (TW) of renewables by 2030 — well shy of the 11 TW needed.

The United States, China and Russia have not revised their goals; Mexico and Indonesia weakened theirs, while Vietnam, Australia, and Brazil offered only modest increases.

China’s forthcoming five-year energy plan could prove decisive, but Washington and Moscow still have no 2030 renewable targets.

Key quote:

“Tripling global renewables capacity by 2030 is the single biggest action this decade to stay on track for the 1.5C climate pathway. Yet, despite the landmark Cop28 agreement to reach 11,000GW of renewables by 2030, national targets remain largely unchanged and fall short of what is needed.”

— Ember analysts, in a report

Why this matters:

Wind and solar must soar for the world to quit coal, oil, and gas, yet planning timetables and subsidy fights keep choking the build-out. Every gigawatt delayed locks in years of carbon pollution and the smog, heat waves, and crop losses that follow. Because power plants run for decades, today’s inaction determines whether children now in kindergarten will grow up in a stable climate or face compound crises of food insecurity, migration, and escalating health threats ranging from heat stroke to mosquito-borne disease. The Ember findings show how quickly political momentum can evaporate after a summit handshake, undercutting investor confidence and raising the odds of costlier, more disruptive emergency measures later.

In short:

European nations are accelerating efforts to replace climate and weather data long provided by U.S. agencies now facing massive cuts.

Officials warn that without access to real-time data, countries can’t adequately plan for storms, sea-level rise, or infrastructure investments.

Nations like Denmark, Germany, and Norway are backing up U.S. data, funding alternative systems, and even recruiting American scientists losing their jobs.

Key quote:

“This isn’t just a technical issue, reliable data underpins extreme weather warnings, climate projections, protecting communities, and ultimately saves lives.”

— Adrian Lema, director of the Danish National Center for Climate Research

Why this matters:

Real-time data from the U.S. has long been the backbone of global climate response, but with that backbone cracking, countries like Germany, Denmark, and Norway are duplicating U.S. data systems, funding their own satellites, and even offering a haven for displaced American scientists.The irony is rich: As climate change accelerates, the country that bears heavy responsibility for the world’s atmospheric carbon is pulling back from the science that helps manage the fallout. Europe’s scramble to fill the gap shows just how dependent global health and safety systems are on robust, publicly-funded science.

Why we asked: The Trump administration’s new budget and tax plan calls for eliminating the popular electric vehicle tax credit at the end of the federal fiscal year in September. Many wonder if that will impact sales now and after that.

What we found: Just four in ten say they’re familiar with the tax credits expiring (only 12% said very familiar). Men (52%) and higher-income households (56%) were more likely to be familiar.

That could be problematic for dealers hoping to move products off their lots before the deadline. Tesla is far from the only manufacturer in that camp. Just 8% said the expiring tax credits were more likely to make them purchase an EV.

But under House Bill 402, only financial costs can be considered, not any benefits flowing from the imposition of a new regulation.","This week, state lawmakers made it more difficult to establish regulations that potentially protect the environment and public health with the passage of House Bill 402. Critics say the measure creates significant roadblocks to addressing air and water pollution.

The new law, known as the ""Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Scrutiny (REINS) Act,"" requires rules with a projected financial impact of $1 million over five years to be approved by a two-thirds majority of the rulemaking body making the rule. For rules with impacts over $10 million, unanimous approval is required. And if a proposed regulation is expected to cost $20 million or more, it must be ratified — formally approved — by the General Assembly before it can take effect.

Environmental advocates warn that the law, combined with the Trump administration's push to weaken federal environmental protections, could stall urgently needed responses to emerging and growing environmental and public health threats.

""Lawmakers who passed this bill did not have the best interests of North Carolinians at heart,"" said Mary Maclean Asbill, in a release. Asbill is the director of the Southern Environmental Law Center's North Carolina offices. ""This new law marks an awful turning point for families and communities across North Carolina when elected officials in the state legislature ignore serious illnesses and deaths in favor of polluters' profits.""

Asbill also pointed to potential economic consequences, arguing that the new law will likely increase the costs to consumers of Duke Energy power, which she argues is a monopoly in North Carolina

Asbill also estimated that the aspect of the law could cost the state, ""$23 billion in additional electricity bill payments over the next few decades and all but guaranteeing a more polluted and riskier future.""

House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) dismissed criticism of the legislation, saying it's intended to ensure transparency and accountability — not to hinder progress.

""What we had in the REINS Act was a situation where if you have a regulation that is extremely expensive, our position is that it's something that [the legislature] needs to take a look at, because ultimately, constitutionally, this body appropriates funds in this state,"" Hall said.

""It doesn't mean that we're always going to turn down a proposed regulation just because it comes over,"" he noted. ""But I think that often what they're doing in the agencies and regulatory bodies doesn't always come to the attention of this body until it's already implemented and already too late and somebody's suffering from it.""

Environmental advocates argue that delays in enacting environmental regulations can cause the public to suffer in other ways — including higher costs and increased health risks.

Costs passed on to consumers

Environmental advocates warn that the added red tape may delay or block rules needed to control harmful industrial chemicals — such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and 1,4-dioxane — both linked to adverse health outcomes, including cancer. They say it could also drive up utility costs in the process.

For example, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority spent nearly $50 million in 2022 to install a system that filters PFAS from drinking water. It's now exploring additional upgrades to better address 1,4-dioxane — a chemical the EPA classifies as a likely human carcinogen. Because no enforceable federal limit exists for 1,4-dioxane, the responsibility for removing it falls to utilities — and ultimately to customers.

That burden comes at a cost. As reported by Port City Daily, the technology needed to better control upstream 1,4-dioxane pollution is expected to cost millions — expenses likely to be passed on to ratepayers.

""If you're allowing 1,4-dioxane in people's water, if you're allowing thousands of different PFAS in drinking water, and you're not allowing the necessary rulemaking that would remove them, then you're not protecting the people of North Carolina. You're not,"" said Erin Carey, conservation policy director for the North Carolina Chapter of the Sierra Club.""You're protecting the polluters.""

Critics argue that protecting the public requires weighing both the costs and benefits of regulations — especially those designed to safeguard health and the environment. But under House Bill 402, only financial costs can be considered, not any benefits flowing from the imposition of a new regulation.

Critics of N.C. House Bill 402 warn it could delay or block regulations on harmful industrial chemicals like PFAS and 1,4-dioxane, potentially increasing public health risks and utility costs — as seen in Wilmington, where ratepayers covered the nearly $50 million cost of a PFAS treatment system at CFPUA's Sweeney Water Treatment Plant. ""It is expensive to have clean drinking water, to keep things out of our drinking water that would be harmful for us to ingest,"" said Brooks Rainey, SELC lobbyist to the North Carolina General Assembly. ""That costs money, but the reason we're all willing to do it is because the benefit so greatly outweighs the cost. For example, keeping fecal matter out of our drinking water means we don't have cholera outbreaks.""

Rainey noted, ""If we're only allowed to think about the cost of a rule, every rule is going to look like a burden on industry, and it is a scary road to walk down when the only thing we even think is worth considering is the cost to industry and the health of the people isn't even taken into consideration.""

""Everything about that bill is kind of rigged to make it harder to enact or keep on the books important environmental protections,"" said state Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford), a fierce opponent of the bill.

Where does House Bill 402 leave North Carolinians?

As the cost of living rises, environmental advocates warn that laws like House Bill 402 — which make it harder to implement pollution controls — are forcing public utilities to shoulder the burden of removing hazardous contaminants from drinking water. Without strong ""polluter pays"" provisions, those costs often end up being passed on to ratepayers.

At the same time, residents are also facing higher insurance premiums and reduced coverage as extreme weather events — including Hurricane Helene, California's wildfires, and Tropical Storm Chantal — strain the insurance industry's capacity.

""North Carolina decision-makers have more than enough information to move forward on strong legislative and regulatory actions around PFAS and 1,4-dioxane, whether that is a ""polluter pays"" bill like H.B. 569 or surface water quality standards,"" said Grady O'Brien, water policy manager for the North Carolina Conservation Network.

North Carolina House Bill 569 — which remains under consideration — would require polluters to reimburse public water systems for the cost of cleaning up PFAS contamination. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a wide margin, but has not had any legislative action since the House sent the bill to the Senate in early May. Advocates say HB 569 stands in direct contrast to HB 402, which they argue creates unnecessary red tape and stalls meaningful reform.

Another proposal environmentalists are watching closely is Senate Bill 666, the Water Safety Act, introduced by Senate Majority Leader Michael Lee (R–New Hanover) who represents a district that has been heavily affected by PFAS contamination in the Cape Fear River basin. If passed, it would direct the Environmental Management Commission to establish regulatory limits on PFAS. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Operations in March and has yet to advance.

""It is an essential function of government: we need to be able to regulate, to make rules — otherwise it becomes the wild, wild West out there,"" Carey said. ""People will start building wherever they want, filling in wetlands wherever they want, discharging chemicals where and when it suits them.

""If there are no regulations, no rules in place, then there is no protection for the environment — and no protection for the people.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f4a5b8b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/768x403+0+56/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F57%2F7a%2F5a72b265448192f47c57cbc78b8e%2Fcape-fear-pfas.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 18:05:25.977742

It comes just six months after a judge struck down an even larger pay package worth $US56 billion ($86 billion) after a lawsuit brought by a Tesla stockholder.

Mr Musk, the chief executive of the electric vehicle maker, will be awarded 96 million shares in Tesla. Analysts believe it signals the tech billionaire will remain with the company until 2030.

Tesla said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Mr Musk must first pay Tesla $US23.34 ($36.06) per share of restricted stock that vests.

That cost is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company's chief executive.

In a letter to shareholders, Tesla's board said that Mr Musk had not received ""meaningful compensation"" for eight years.

The board argued that Mr Musk deserved the compensation because he had delivered ""transformative and unprecedented growth"" that had ""translated into immense value generated for Tesla and all our shareholders"".

Group of Tesla shareholders voice concerns

Tesla shares have plunged 25 per cent this year, largely due to blowback over the billionaire's affiliation with President Donald Trump.

Tesla also faces intensifying competition from both the big Detroit automakers and from Chinese EV companies.

In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $US1.39 billion ($2.15 billion) to $US409 million ($632 million). Revenue also fell and the company fell short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Under pressure from shareholders last month, Tesla scheduled an annual shareholders meeting for November to comply with Texas state law.

A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders, who had watched Tesla shares plummet, said in a letter to the company that it needed to at least provide public notice of the annual meeting.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Mr Musk spent so much time in Washington this year.

He became one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the US government.

Deal could see Musk remain CEO until 2030

In December, Delaware judge Kathaleen St Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Mr Musk's multi-billion-dollar pay package.

She found that Mr Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.

At the time, Judge McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $US5 billion ($7.7 billion).

The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.

The rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk's 2018 compensation package.

Mr Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he felt Mr Musk's stock award would alleviate some Tesla shareholder concerns.

""We believe this grant will now keep Musk as CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 and removes an overhang on the stock,"" Mr Ives wrote in a client note.

Aneel

The expansion of Brazil's electricity grid in July was driven by solar and wind power sources, both characterized by renewable energy generation. According to calculations by the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL), four plants came online last month: three wind power plants (61 MW) and one solar photovoltaic plant (45 MW).

In the first seven months of 2025, the observed expansion was 4,211.13 MW. More than half of this growth (57.66%) was accounted for by 11 new thermoelectric plants, with 2,2428.05 MW – among them the GNA II Thermoelectric Plant (UTE) in Rio de Janeiro, which began operating in May with 1.7 GW of installed capacity.

In addition to thermoelectric plants, the expansion of the electrical matrix from January to July included 27 wind farms (898.90 MW), 18 photovoltaic solar plants (783.63 MW), six small hydroelectric plants (95.85 MW) and two hydroelectric generating plants (4.70 MW).

From January to July, plants in 14 states entered commercial operation. The highlights, in descending order, were Rio de Janeiro (1,672.60 MW), Bahia (687.70 MW), and Minas Gerais (553.25 MW). June saw Minas Gerais as the state with the greatest expansion, with 45.00 MW at the Pedro Leopoldo I solar park. Ceará came in second, with 40.00 MW at the Kairós Wind 6 wind farm.

July ended with 88 plants in test operation, totaling 3,063 MW. This includes 45 wind farms, 33 solar photovoltaic plants, six thermoelectric plants, two small hydroelectric plants, one hydroelectric generating plant, and one hydroelectric plant.

Energizer's stock posts a record gain as money from the IRA's production credits helps offset tariff costs, and after a large share buyback

Shares of Energizer Holdings Inc. enjoyed their best day ever on Monday, after the battery maker raised its full-year earnings outlook, as it now expects to be able to fully offset any negative impacts from President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The company also took advantage of the recent sharp selloff in the stock to a record low to buy back a big chunk of its shares.

Energizer's stock (ENR) charged up a record 26.7% to close at the highest price since April 4. That smashed the previous one-day record gain of 17.5% seen on March 24, 2020.

Chief Executive Mark LaVigne said on the post-earnings call with analysts that the projected impact of Trump's tariffs on Energizer's business has ""materially improved,"" as current tariff rates are significantly lower than what were expected three months ago.

""Through a combination of pricing, cost initiatives and production credits, we now expect to fully offset the earnings impact from tariffs in both fiscal 2025 and 2026,"" LaVigne said, according to an AlphaSense transcript.

He explained that the production credits the company was receiving, as a result of the continued investment in the U.S., were ""meaningful.""

""We expect them to contribute $35 million to $40 million of gross margin, net earnings and free cash flow on an annual basis prior to any reinvestment,"" LaVigne said.

Ironically, those production tax credits for U.S.-made battery components are part of the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law during the Biden administration. They remain in place, with some modifications, in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" that Trump signed into law.

As a result of the upbeat outlook on the impact of tariffs, the company raised its full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for adjusted earnings per share, which excludes special one-time items, to between $3.55 and $3.65, from the guidance provided in May of $3.30 to $3.50.

Energizer also bumped up its growth outlook for net sales to between 1% and 3%, from flat to 2%.

The average analyst's fiscal 2025 estimates compiled by FactSet are currently for adjusted EPS of $3.37 and for sales growth of 0.8% to $2.91 billion.

Separately, LaVigne said the ""material decline"" in the company's stock price, following Energizer's fiscal second-quarter earnings report in May, ""presented an opportunity"" to return an ""outsized"" amount to shareholders.

The company said it spent $62.6 million to buy back 2.8 million shares during the fiscal third quarter ending June 30, which represents 4.1% of the total shares outstanding. And since the end of June, the company said it has repurchased an additional $27 million worth of shares.

After the company reported results May 6, the stock had tumbled as much as 23.4% to a record low of $19.83 on June 20, which was roughly 10 years after the stock started trading after the company was spun off from Edgewell Personal Care Co. (EPC).

Since that record low, the stock has now run up 41.5%.

For the fiscal third quarter, the company swung to net income of $153.5 million from a loss of $43.8 million in the same period a year ago, which included charges to write off the value of some assets.

On an adjusted basis, EPS rose to $1.13 from 79 cents and beat the FactSet consensus of 62 cents. The margin of that bottom-line beat was the widest in at least five years, based on available FactSet data back to August 2020.

Net sales grew 3.4% to $725.3 million, above the FactSet consensus of $693.2 million. Batteries and lights sales increased 5.1% to $535.1 million, well above expectations of $495.6 million, while auto-care sales were down 1.1% to $190.2 million, missing expectations of $194.7 million.

Even with Monday's rally, the stock has still shed 19.6% in 2025, while the S&P 500 index SPX has advanced 7.6%.

As Chinese solar panels are encroaching on the market, the domestic solar supply chain is shaking from its roots.
Woongjin Energy's recent collapse, which was decided to abolish bankruptcy, symbolically represents Korea's initial supply chain for solar energy, which collapsed.
Although the capacity of solar facilities increased by 12.3% during the same period, the number of domestic solar manufacturing workers and sales decreased.
Despite the situation, the government designed policies based on renewable energy supply performance, encouraging domestic companies to die.","As the government set a target for renewable energy generation and increased the installation of solar panels, a large number of Chinese solar panels with price competitiveness came to Korea. As a result, domestic solar manufacturers have a narrower place to stand, and there is a possibility that there will be a gap in the solar supply chain. Experts said, ""There are no appropriate measures other than how to gain price competitiveness through technological advancement,"" and stressed, ""We need to preemptively come up with measures to protect domestic industries not only in solar power but also in offshore wind power.""

As Chinese solar panels are encroaching on the market, the domestic solar supply chain is shaking from its roots. Woongjin Energy's recent collapse, which was decided to abolish bankruptcy, symbolically represents Korea's initial supply chain for solar energy, which collapsed. According to the 'New and Renewable Energy Supply and Industry Statistics' published by the Korea Energy Agency on the 4th, the number of solar manufacturing workers in 2023 fell 2.5% and sales fell 22.1% year-on-year. Although the capacity of solar facilities increased by 12.3% during the same period, the number of domestic solar manufacturing workers and sales decreased.

According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the capacity of solar panel facilities manufactured in Korea reaches 7,999 megawatts (MW), exceeding the capacity of foreign manufacturing facilities of 5011MW, but this is only an optical illusion. This is because even if it is a domestic facility, most of them import Chinese wafers and make them into cells by domestic companies or assemble them into 'panel'.

The solar supply chain consists of polysilicon-ingot-wafer-cell-module (panel) steps. The domestic supply chain is in a state where the pre-wafer stage has collapsed. Until the 2010s, domestic companies such as Woongjin Energy and Hanwha Solution were in charge of the initial supply chain of solar power, but they withdrew their business after losing competition with Chinese products.

OCI Holdings currently produces polysilicon in Malaysia, but this is aimed at the U.S., not the South Korean market. This is because the price of non-Chinese solar basic materials is maintained higher than that of China as the U.S. bans Chinese polysilicon imports in the name of banning forced labor and provides tax credits for the production of solar facilities in the country through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). OCI Gunsan Plant has stopped producing polysilicon for solar power since 2020.

Despite the situation, the government designed policies based on renewable energy supply performance, encouraging domestic companies to die. Yoo Seung-hoon, a professor at Seoul National University of Science and Technology, said, ""After completing technology development so that it can be produced cheaply in Korea, we did not increase the supply of solar power, but rather focused on supply performance regardless of domestic and foreign products. As a result, the domestic industry collapsed and now it is irreversible.""

Experts fear that the energy security crisis caused by supply chain monopolies could grow as Chinese companies eat into the global market. Currently, China's share in the polysilicon and panel markets is 96% and 86%, respectively. If the Chinese government turns solar panels into strategic assets or raises prices sharply like rare earths, there is no countermeasure. Sohn Yang-hoon, a professor at Incheon National University, pointed out, ""The policy to increase solar power even without countermeasures being prepared means that we will risk anxiety over potential energy security.""

Unlike Korea, the U.S. is preparing various measures to break away from China's solar supply chain. Since 2012, anti-dumping tariffs have been imposed on Chinese solar products, and last month, it decided to investigate the national security impact on polysilicon, a key solar panel material. The U.S. Senate discussed a law that requires companies to pay taxes if they use Chinese technology or parts while building solar power plants.

The government plans to protect domestic industries and supply chains by developing high-efficiency solar panels and carbon verification agents. Carbon verification is a system that promotes the use of low-carbon solar panels. The domestic solar industry evaluates the system as the 'last bastion'. The Ministry of Industry is supporting the development of ultra-high-efficiency perovskite-silicon tandem modules, low-carbon eco-friendly modules, and artificial intelligence (AI) digital-based operation and maintenance (O&M) technology with enhanced cybersecurity.

An official from the Ministry of Industry said, ""We are preparing the domestic market through a carbon verification system introduced by benchmarking Europe's carbon footprint. We are also actively supporting tandem next-generation solar cells to promote technology development.""

Industry sources suggest that since China has dominated the initial process of solar supply chain, Korea should focus on technological advancement of late supply chain processes while meeting the supply chain demand of non-Chinese countries in the U.S. and Europe. ""Competing with China with polysilicon, ingot, and wafer, which are value chains of crystalline silicon that have already monopolized economies of scale and technology, has limitations in cost-effectiveness-oriented markets,"" said Myung Seung-yeop, PD of the Korea Energy Technology Evaluation Institute.",https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202508/05/news-p.v1.20250804.41130a6fa5954dddb794cbebd2812de2_P1.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 20:02:39.073530

The U.S. Senate has confirmed Paige Hallen Hanson as the new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Environmental Protection Agency, placing her in charge of managing the agency’s nearly $100 billion budget and more than 300 employees. Hanson, appointed by President Donald J. Trump, will be responsible for EPA’s financial operations, including budget formulation, financial systems, resource planning and performance management.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin welcomed Hanson’s confirmation, citing her decades of government and financial experience.

“Paige brings a wealth of expertise in complex budgets and over two decades of government and financial experience to EPA,” Zeldin said. “She understands the importance of stewarding every cent of taxpayer money and is uniquely and highly qualified to serve as EPA’s Chief Financial Officer. I look forward to working with Paige in this new role to make EPA more transparent and efficient as we carry out our mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Hanson expressed gratitude for the opportunity to lead EPA’s financial division.

“I am tremendously grateful for the opportunity to lead EPA’s financial operations,” she said. “From budgeting to payments, performance measures to financial technology, the work of this talented team enables the critical mission EPA plays in protecting human health and the environment.”

A native of South Carolina, Hanson most recently served as a Senior Fellow at the Tax Foundation and as a CFO in the private sector. She previously worked on Capitol Hill as a staff member for the Joint Economic Committee and Senate Budget Committee and advised a member of the Senate Appropriations and Finance Committees. She also served as EPA’s Associate CFO for Policy during Trump’s first term.

Hanson holds an MBA from Virginia Tech and a bachelor’s degree in government and economics from Wofford College.

Her confirmation drew praise from lawmakers and former EPA officials.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, “I am very pleased that South Carolina’s own Paige Hanson has been confirmed... Paige will be a great asset to Administrator Zeldin and the rest of the agency as they work to return it to its original mission: being good stewards of America’s natural environment while also supporting economic growth.”

Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., added, “Paige brings proven financial expertise, a strong work ethic, and a commitment to public service that will serve the EPA and the American people well.”

Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., called Hanson’s appointment “a fantastic choice,” saying her financial leadership would support EPA’s goals of environmental protection and domestic energy production.

Andrew Wheeler, former EPA Administrator, said Hanson “has the experience and knowledge the agency needs.”

Ryan Jackson, former EPA Chief of Staff, called Hanson “perfectly qualified,” citing her previous tenure at the EPA and years of budget experience on Capitol Hill.",https://eponline.com/-/media/ENV/eponline/Images/2025/080425EPA-Sign-on-Door.jpeg,N,,2025-08-04 18:04:27.567135

Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand. Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead. FASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments. I’m really sorry that we could not get to them all. But we only have an hour. (Laughs.) KISSANE: Thank you.

In December Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package.
She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives feels Musk's stock award may alleviate some Tesla shareholder concerns.
Under pressure from shareholders last month, Tesla scheduled an annual shareholders meeting for November to comply with Texas state law.","Tesla is awarding CEO Elon Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at approximately $29 billion, just six months after a judge ordered the company to revoke his massive pay package.

The electric vehicle maker said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company's CEO.

In December Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package. She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.

At the time McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.

The rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk's 2018 compensation package.

That pay package carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla's stock price.

Musk appealed the order in March. A month later Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it was creating a special committee to look at Musk's compensation as CEO.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives feels Musk's stock award may alleviate some Tesla shareholder concerns.

""We believe this grant will now keep Musk as CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 and removes an overhang on the stock,"" Ives wrote in a client note. ""Musk remains Tesla's big asset and this comp issue has been a constant concern of shareholders once the Delaware soap opera began.""

Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year, largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump. But Tesla also faces intensifying competition from both the big Detroit automakers, and from China.

In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company fell short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Under pressure from shareholders last month, Tesla scheduled an annual shareholders meeting for November to comply with Texas state law.

A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders, which have watched Tesla shares plummet, said in a letter to the company that it needed to at least provide public notice of the annual meeting.

The re-election of Donald J. Trump heralded sweeping changes to science and technology policy in the US. Major tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act for sustainable chemical technologies are on their way out. Hundreds of grants for clean technology projects are under review. US tariffs, and retaliatory tariffs on US goods, have shaken global supply chains. Amid all the change, private investors have become more cautious.

The Trump administration is prioritizing support for some areas of clean technology, like critical minerals. But as the government is easing the permitting process for certain mines, it’s simultaneously removing support for industries, such as electric vehicles, that use the minerals being extracted from the ground.

For many cleantech start-ups, the 30,000-foot view is bleak. But the impact of these changes is not spread evenly, and understanding their day-to-day impact requires a magnifying glass. In the following vignettes, leaders from four US chemistry start-ups explain how they are navigating uncertainty in the Trump era.

New Iridium

The Colorado-based start-up New Iridium has developed a technology that chemically converts bioethanol to acetic acid and ethyl acetate. The company says its oxidation approach is more efficient than fermentation and that the process achieves nearly equal the performance of converting fossil fuels to the chemicals, but with far fewer carbon emissions.

The company’s early R&D was supported by Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants from the US National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. The company wrapped up the initial DOE project in April and had hoped to apply for the second phase of the program.

Companies that successfully complete the first phase of an SBIR grant are usually invited to apply for the next round, says New Iridium’s chief operating officer, Brent Cutcliffe. But for several months, mass layoffs at federal scientific agencies have been throwing a wrench into those plans.

“Phase 2 is the big one,” he told C&EN in June. “But there's been no information. There’s been absolutely no communication. We have made a number of attempts to inquire, and it’s just crickets.”

By late July, the company was finally invited to apply for that funding. But two larger DOE grant programs that could help the company scale up the technology remain on hold.

Over the past few years, says CEO Chern-Hooi Lim, government grants had helped New Iridium survive a period when venture capitalists were hesitant to invest in cleantech start-ups. As it became clear in early 2025 that Trump’s election would mean a pullback of government grants, the company kicked its private fundraising efforts into overdrive.

In June, New Iridium closed a $2.65 million seed funding round, which should give it enough cash to operate for 18–24 months. Over that time, Lim hopes to begin operating a pilot-scale plant that will allow the company to start delivering samples to potential customers.

Lim and Cutcliffe argue that the reduction in US government support for clean technology is a temporary hurdle. They say that customers in Europe and Asia are eager to buy low-carbon chemicals and that the chemical industry is continuing to shift away from fossil fuels.

“There is a giant consumer movement towards biobased products,” Cutcliffe says. “No amount of government deregulation is going to quell that force.”

American Battery Technology

American Battery Technology has succeeded in attracting government support during both the Joe Biden and Trump administrations.

During the Biden years, the DOE’s Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains awarded American Battery Technology grants to help build lithium processing and battery recycling facilities in its home state of Nevada. The DOE is now considering cuts to grants awarded through that program.

But this year, American Battery Technology’s planned lithium facility was added to a list of mines that are getting priority treatment on permitting applications. And the project received a letter of interest for a $900 million financing package from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.

Even with those wins, CEO Ryan Melsert says American Battery Technology is affected by the changes in US policy. For example, the government’s rollback of funding for renewable energy generation and electric vehicles is hurting firms that use batteries, reducing the need for the lithium chemicals his company will make.

“The biggest change is the uncertainty,” Melsert says. “Our customers, our suppliers, everyone is in a little bit of a holding pattern, trying to see what actually manifests out of a lot of verbal statements.”

Melsert says getting the firm’s permits fast-tracked has sped up the timeline for its first commercial-scale lithium refinery, which already has customer commitments. But the timeline for the recycling plant has been extended because battery manufacturers that would create scrap in need of recycling have slowed their construction plans.

He says American Battery Technology’s strategy hasn’t changed significantly. Rather than trying to predict the future, Melsert says he stays focused on the details. “We’re trying to avoid the trap of reading the tea leaves,” he says.

BioConsortia

For sustainable agriculture companies, US policy changes have cut in both directions. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has sharply criticized the use of chemical pesticides, creating an opening for biobased alternatives. But layoffs at the Environmental Protection Agency threaten to slow reviews of those products.

Even before the layoffs at US science agencies, the California-based agriculture technology company BioConsortia considered Brazil one of the best places to launch a new product. The global farming hub has become a model for efficient evaluations of new agricultural products, says CEO Marcus Meadows-Smith.

“The registration process is very clear. It’s fast and it’s efficient,” Meadows-Smith says of Brazil’s bureaucracy. “In the US, the EPA has been struggling, missing timelines. . . . Uncertainty is actually worse than bad news in some ways.”

BioConsortia specializes in products derived from gram-positive bacteria. The company is developing nitrogen-fixing bacteria to reduce the need for fertilizer, biostimulants that increase yield, and products that protect plants from fungi and nematodes.

Meadows-Smith says Kennedy’s attacks on chemical pesticides do provide an opportunity to highlight the environmental benefits of biological products, but the boost is limited. In most cases, companies like BioConsortia are trying to create products that work in concert with synthetic chemicals.

As a fairly established company founded in 2014, BioConsortia is less dependent than young start-ups on landing government grants and new venture capital investors to move forward. It already has investors who see the long-term potential of the technology, but Marcus-Meadows worries that some early-stage agriculture firms are in trouble.

“There are some companies that are on the brink of disaster because they can’t raise money,” he says.

Calcarea

The DOE recently rescinded billions of dollars for projects intended to capture carbon dioxide emitted by power plants in the US. But things are different at sea, where global climate policies are pushing carbon capture technologies forward.

Earlier this year, the International Maritime Organization, a body that regulates international shipping, voted to impose a type of carbon tax on heavy ships, starting in 2028.

That’s good news for Calcarea, which is developing a system, based on technology developed at the California Institute of Technology, that captures carbon emissions from ships. Installing such a system could help shipping firms reduce their carbon tax.

Calcarea’s technology sucks up seawater as a ship moves forward. CO2 emitted by ship engines is dissolved into the water, making it more acidic. Then, the system reacts the acidic seawater with calcium carbonate, which releases calcium and bicarbonate ions into the seawater. Dissolved there, the ions store the carbon for up to 100,000 years.

The technology can reduce a ship’s CO2 emissions by up to 50%, CEO Jess Adkins says. And leaving the carbon at sea means that ships don’t have to unload any carbon products when they reach a port.

Calcarea is building prototypes on land and is slated to install pilot carbon capture systems on a ship owned by the logistics company Lomar Shipping in 2026.

For the most part, the international nature of the shipping industry has insulated Calcarea from the instability in the US. “The US-based investors come in quite skeptical about carbon capture,” Adkins says. “With European-based investors, that’s much less true. . . . It has been a job of finding the right audience.”","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/Start-up-vignettes---126951:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2025-08-04 17:04:44.109025

Local governments can apply through Dec. 5 for funding to help pay to upgrade HVAC systems, install solar panels, conduct energy audits and feasibility studies, and improve building insulation, among other projects centered on energy efficiency or renewable energy, according to Gov. Wes Moore‘s office.

Moore’s team has also billed the grant program as part of the push to decrease strain on the regional electrical grid, for which capacity has failed to keep pace with the ever-increasing demand for energy among a growing number of data centers, businesses and homes.

“It isn’t enough to ask Marylanders to see themselves in the consequences of the climate crisis; they need to see themselves in the progress,” Moore said in a statement Monday. “Investments in climate action drive new infrastructure projects, support our work modernizing the grid, and strengthen our pledge to act as disciplined stewards of the taxpayer dime.”

Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul Pinsky said the grants will help county and local governments save money that they may have otherwise used for clean-energy projects and use it to bolster other public services.

State officials are also hoping that local governments will see lower energy bills as a result of clean-energy projects, potentially adding to their savings.

The program includes an income-based cost-share structure that officials have said will accommodate rural and underserved counties.

“The agency designed this program to be flexible enough to be tailored to local priorities so that every Maryland county — regardless of size or income — can take meaningful steps forward to cut costs and combat climate change,” Pinsky said in a statement.

Democrats, who control the governor’s mansion and have a supermajority in the legislature, have repeatedly stressed the need to boost in-state energy production to decrease reliance on neighboring states.

Maryland, which belongs to a regional grid composed of 13 states and Washington, D.C., imports roughly 40% of its electricity from other states.

The Democrats’ solution has notably included supporting a US Wind project for more than 100 wind turbines off the Ocean City coast.

But the project, which had garnered opposition from local Republicans in Maryland and Delaware, is now facing a challenge from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Federal officials claimed that the Maryland Department of the Environment erred in its process for approving a permit for the project, though state officials have defended the process and said they won’t be reissuing the permit, which the EPA had requested.

Amid the standoff, US Wind officials have expressed confidence in the project’s prospects.

But recent moves by President Daniel Noboa have alarmed environmentalists and Indigenous leaders who say the country’s green reputation — and its protections for civil society — are unraveling.
And Ecuador just signed a new oil deal with Peru that could accelerate drilling in sensitive areas.

“Practically, Indigenous organizations live mostly from donations and NGOs.","BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — When Ecuadorians voted two years ago to block oil drilling in Yasuni National Park, it was a triumph for environmentalists seeking to protect one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. And it was in character for a country that was first to enshrine the “rights of nature” in its constitution and is home to parts of the Amazon rain forest and the Galápagos Islands.

But recent moves by President Daniel Noboa have alarmed environmentalists and Indigenous leaders who say the country’s green reputation — and its protections for civil society — are unraveling.

Noboa’s administration has moved to scrap the country’s independent Environment Ministry. It’s pushing legislation ostensibly aimed at choking off illegal mining, but which critics fear will devastate nonprofits. The National Assembly — pressed by Noboa — approved a law last month allowing private and foreign entities to co‑manage conservation zones that critics say weakens protections and threatens Indigenous land rights. And Ecuador just signed a new oil deal with Peru that could accelerate drilling in sensitive areas.

Natalia Greene, an environmental advocate with the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature, said Noboa’s decision to fold the Environment Ministry into the Ministry of Energy and Mines will speed up mining just as Ecuador is grappling with a surge in illegal gold mining tied to organized crime. She called it “like putting the wolf in charge of the sheep.”

“The government’s intention is very clear — to be a machine gun of extractivism,” she said.

Noboa has defended the ministry moves and other changes as necessary to cut costs, reduce bureaucracy and address Ecuador’s financial crisis. Officials argue that consolidating ministries will make decision‑making more efficient.

Neither the Ministry of Energy and Mines nor Noboa’s office responded to questions from The Associated Press.

Indigenous rights at risk

In July, Peru and Ecuador signed a deal for Ecuador’s state oil company to sell crude directly to Petroperu and link its southern Amazon reserves to Peru’s Norperuano pipeline, with drilling eyed for January 2026. Environmental groups say it could fast‑track drilling in sensitive areas while skirting safeguards and Indigenous consultation.

Peru’s Achuar, Wampis and Chapra nations denounced the plan in a public letter, saying it would gut long-standing protections that require communities be consulted before projects move forward on their lands. They warned the pipeline already averages 146 spills a year and that expanding it would be “a grave threat to the Amazon and to Indigenous livelihoods.”

“They are going to violate all our rights to enter our territories and extract the resources they want,” said Nemo Guiquita, a Waorani leader with the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon. She said Indigenous communities fear a surge of oil and mining projects across ancestral lands, threatening both ecosystems and livelihoods.

“There will be a weakening of environmental protection,” she said. “There will be a lot of deforestation, contamination of rivers and destruction of the ecosystem, which is vital for our existence as Indigenous peoples.”

Ricardo Buitrón, president of the Quito‑based environmental group Accion Ecologica, noted that the changes come just months after Ecuadorians voted to keep oil in the ground in Yasuni, a decision the government has yet to fully enforce.

“We have gone back decades,” he said. “A development model is being prioritized that does not care about protecting ecosystems, but about extracting natural resources to the maximum.”

Fears that proposed law will harm non-governmental organizations

The proposed law that has alarmed nonprofits is formally called the Organic Law for the Control of Irregular Capital Flows. But activists call it the “anti-NGO” law, saying it could impose heavy burdens on nonprofits and force many to close.

The measure applies to more than 71,000 organizations nationwide, giving them six months to re‑register with the government, submit detailed financial records and disclose foreign funding sources. The government says the law is needed to prevent money laundering and political destabilization. Critics warn it could instead silence dissent by placing organizations under sweeping controls.

Noboa submitted the bill to the National Assembly on July 29, giving lawmakers until Aug. 28 to act before it automatically becomes law.

“This has been hard for us,” Guiquita said. “Practically, Indigenous organizations live mostly from donations and NGOs. The government is weakening us in every space.”

“It represents a threat because they could dissolve us under any pretext,” Buitrón said. “This reminds us of what we already lived through a decade ago, when they tried to shut down some organizations in the country.”

Regional and global stakes

Kevin Koenig of Amazon Watch, a U.S.-based nonprofit that advocates for Indigenous rights and environmental protection in the Amazon, said the country’s changes are part of a wider rollback.

“We are seeing a sweeping package of regressive reforms that are rolling back environmental protections, Indigenous rights guarantees, and threatening basic civil liberties like the freedom of speech and assembly,” he said. “What it suggests is the massive expansion of oil and mining, particularly in the Amazon region.”

Koenig said the changes send troubling signals ahead of COP30, the United Nations climate summit set for Brazil later this year.

Similar trends are unfolding in Peru and El Salvador, where governments have limited environmental oversight, and in Brazil, where licensing for Amazon projects has been weakened.

Mobilizing resistance

Civil society groups are mobilizing against the changes. Greene said organizations have reactivated the Asamblea Nacional Socioambiental, a national coalition of environmental and social movements, and are planning legal challenges, demonstrations and appeals to international bodies.

Many fear Ecuador’s role as a global green pioneer is unraveling.

“Our only crime here has been protecting our territory, protecting our traditions, protecting our way of life,” Guiquita said.

Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association said there has been a “collective sigh of relief” among his peers developing one of the more nascent clean energy technologies.
Bergman said curtailing key clean electricity tax credits will slow the U.S. clean energy transition while leading to higher electricity costs and increased carbon emissions.
While some aspects benefit emerging clean energy, he still expects higher costs and more emissions under the new law due to the accelerated phaseout of wind and solar incentives and other new hurdles for clean energy.
Experts say this could partly offset the loss of policy incentives that have driven advances in clean energy technology and production.","When Congress passed the Trump administration policy bill known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July, it marked a substantial turning point in U.S. energy and industrial policy, which has been caught in the push-pull of partisan politics for more than a decade.

The new law sets a course that encourages fossil fuel exploration and energy production, while significantly curtailing support for mature clean-energy technologies such as wind, solar and electric vehicles. At the same time, it contained incentives for nascent renewables such as clean fuels, fuel cells, geothermal, hydrogen, and nuclear power.

The result is a new American energy doctrine that favors grand technology breakthroughs over the steady rollout of tried-and-true renewable solutions, and is out of step with the strategy pursued by many other major nations. Market forces — particularly increasing energy demand in the tech sector — could replace government incentives as the primary driver of the U.S. energy transition. The net result is almost certainly a slowdown in the country’s progress on limiting carbon emissions and mitigating climate change.

“We're in this frustrating world where we have the solutions, but speed is the critical thing,” said Gunnar Trumbull, a Harvard Business School professor and co-director of its Green Industrial Strategy Project. “Anything that we can do to improve the technologies now, to get the price of them down so the economics become more favorable, that really matters for the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.”

Trumbull warns against dire predictions for the energy transition or U.S. competitiveness, but does say it is fair to question whether the new policy will effectively combat climate change.

“We know basically where we're going and we know the economics are pushing in that direction,” he said. “Whether we get there fast enough to limit climate change, I think our chances are glancingly small.”

Diverging from a global trend

The new energy legislation has brought a tenuous sense of clarity to a sector frozen for months by policy uncertainty, experts say.

“It's hard to invest when you don't know what the rules of the road are going to be,” said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future who spent almost a decade working at the Department of Energy.

Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association said there has been a “collective sigh of relief” among his peers developing one of the more nascent clean energy technologies. He said they view the new legislation as “reasonably positive.”

While there will almost surely be additional uncertainty ahead, the new bill gave shape to the emerging regulatory environment, a policy patchwork that reflects the country's oscillation between ambitious climate action and support for fossil fuels. One thing that is clear is that the U.S. is dialing back the most significant clean energy support just as other major economies ramp up their green industrial strategies.

Jonas Meckling, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and co-director of the Green Industrial Strategy Project, says solar and wind power, along with electric vehicles and batteries, have been at the forefront of this global trend—a trend the U.S. joined enthusiastically through tax and other incentives during the Biden era. The European Union has recently adopted its Clean Industrial Deal, and China continues its policy-backed lead in manufacturing solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles.

“The U.S. is now taking significant steps back,” Meckling said. While solar and wind power are still likely to dominate new U.S. energy production because of their cost advantages, Meckling says that “progress will be slower” as domestic support falls and global competition intensifies. Now, he says, U.S. clean energy companies will need to learn “how to survive in these global markets with lower support.”

Trumbull said the U.S. has just started achieving the scale and product cycles needed for innovative growth in the technologies at the forefront of the energy transition. “[The United States is] at risk of really losing our competitiveness in the workhorse technologies like wind and solar … which is frustrating given the role that the U.S. played in developing all of these technologies,” he said.

Environmental consequences

While the overall economic and environmental impact of America's new energy legislation remains uncertain, forecasts suggest it is likely to exacerbate global warming. Bergman said curtailing key clean electricity tax credits will slow the U.S. clean energy transition while leading to higher electricity costs and increased carbon emissions.

“What we found when we modeled a full repeal of the tax credit for wind and solar was significantly less deployment of wind and solar, an increase in electricity prices for consumers ... and an increase in carbon dioxide emissions from the electric sector,” he said.

Bergman said carbon reduction targets would not be met at the same pace without these credits. One analysis by his organization showed that undoing all technology-neutral tax credits related to zero-emission electricity generation in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act would increase national average electricity rates by 5% to 7% by 2030, and potentially by 6% to 10% by 2035. That would add $75 to $150 to annual household electricity bills.

The decline in projected wind and solar deployment was forecast to add substantially to carbon emissions—an additional 350 million to 400 million metric tons of CO₂ by 2035, and a cumulative 3,500 to 4,500 metric tons between 2025 and 2040.

The new legislation did not completely repeal zero-emission generation tax credits, but it accelerates the phaseout for projects placed in service after 2027, with an exception for projects beginning construction by July 4, 2026.

Bergman says it’s harder to model the final legislation’s impact, especially for untested technologies. While some aspects benefit emerging clean energy, he still expects higher costs and more emissions under the new law due to the accelerated phaseout of wind and solar incentives and other new hurdles for clean energy.

“Subsidies for these new technologies are valuable,” Bergman said, citing the many external costs of climate change that justify government incentives. “It would have been valuable to also continue the subsidies for wind and solar.”

Demand may drive innovation

Yet experts still foresee a path for U.S. clean energy production and manufacturing to become a leading force in the global economy, even at a time when it appears China has established an almost insurmountable lead in solar and wind technologies.

“The American economy is unique in the world in terms of demand and in terms of the concentration of technology companies,” Trumbull said.

One primary driver may be the emerging and already massive domestic demand for cheap renewable energy from U.S. tech firms, which need it to fuel artificial intelligence and data center projects.

AI requires enormous computational resources, and its growth as an information tool is expected to put added pressure on energy demand. Data centers accounted for about 1.5% of the world’s electricity consumption in 2024, or 415 terawatt-hours, according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency. That is expected to more than double by 2030 to 945 terawatt-hours—more than Japan’s entire electricity consumption today.

Experts say this could partly offset the loss of policy incentives that have driven advances in clean energy technology and production.

“The growth in demand for energy from AI and data centers is going to create new demand for renewables over the next decade,” Trumbull said. “In some ways, this external technology shock is substituting for what we had thought we were going to have to rely on, which was continued support and subsidies.”

The surge in demand is already visible in corporate behavior. Google has signed an agreement with Commonwealth Fusion to buy power from its first commercial nuclear fusion facility, even though the technology has not yet been proven at scale. Big technology companies “desperately want to lock in new energy sources,” Trumbull said. “Most of them actually don't want to use coal or gas to run it because it's more expensive.”

The high impact of lower costs

Indeed, costs may also be a driving factor that steers the U.S. toward renewables. “In the past five years, we really passed a sort of tipping point, with renewable energies becoming cheaper than fossil fuels, and companies embracing those new technologies,” Trumbull said.

Texas is a good example, Trumbull said. Long branded as a big oil state, with a conservative state government that has not made climate change a priority, Texas has become a hotbed for renewables. Wind and solar energy are so cheap in West Texas, that in the last 15 years, “they basically had to shut down … coal plants because they were too expensive.”

Declining costs have turned oil companies in Europe into converts as well, he said. “All of the winning bidders on North Sea wind projects have been oil companies, and they're doing it because they know that's the future now,” Trumbull said. “If you look at the trajectory of prices, renewables are just going to keep getting cheaper and cheaper. These are companies that have generational aspirations, so they do not want to be left behind in this revolution.”

Companies are moving forward

Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence that companies will move forward on green technologies with or without the U.S. government as a full supporter and partner.

Research by Harvard Business School scholars last year showed that 45% of U.S. public companies in climate-relevant industries told the Securities and Exchange Commission in annual reports that they are developing or selling climate-related solutions. That number doubled in almost two decades, up from 20% in 2005. There are firms now making billion-dollar investments in decarbonization, a threshold that's happened in just the last few years, Trumbull said. Indeed, net-zero commitments have been made by more than 8,000 companies, according to a 2023 report by the consulting group McKinsey & Company.

“What I'm hearing from companies is that action is continuing,” Vijay Vaitheeswaran, global energy and climate innovation editor for The Economist, said at a green industrial strategy conference sponsored by the Institute for Business in Global Society earlier this year. “They're actually doubling down on the investments that they're making. It's a smart play, companies betting on clean technologies. I'm willing to say that this is going to continue regardless of what happens with … industrial policies in Congress.""

Meanwhile, the focus on nascent technologies in the new law passed by Congress could help the U.S. establish leadership in some technologies and help companies at the same time. Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla recently argued in The Economist that this focus could help climate tech by developing technologies at price points attractive to China and India.

“Climate-tech innovation and reshoring help America in the global battle for manufacturing supremacy, and in building the economic power that comes from technological superiority,"" Khosla wrote.

The nuclear industry in particular stands to benefit, with the Trump administration pushing for expedited regulatory approvals. An executive order aims to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050, though critics have expressed concerns about potential safety implications of accelerated reviews.

“These are technologies that have the potential to provide carbon-free electricity all the time,” Bergman said. “These are important technologies that are still being developed, and it is valuable that they are subsidized.”",https://cloudinary.hbs.edu/hbsit/image/fetch/q_auto/f_webp/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbs.edu%2Fctfassets%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6JCqnyTji63bLjUhwnsxHk%2Finside-washingtons-new-energy-policy.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 19:01:07.928690

Companies such as Tesla, however, have found workarounds to sell direct-to-consumer, avoiding the dealership model.
Currently, more than a dozen states also have an outright ban on direct-to-consumer auto sales.
Tesla had to deal with something familiar, settling with the state of Louisiana for challenging the ban.","Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian is suing Ohio’s Department of Motor Vehicles over the state’s partial ban on companies bypassing dealerships in order to sell cars directly to consumers. Within this federal lawsuit, Rivian has called the ban “Irrational in the extreme.”

The manufacturer, which produces the R1T, R2, and R3, argues that it decreases competition and reduces consumer choice, also noting that Tesla is allowed to sell directly to consumers in the state, which the company notes is seen as an unfair advantage.

“Ohio’s prohibition is pure economic protectionism for the benefit of Ohio’s existing auto dealers, putting their profits ahead of comsumers,” Rivian states in its complaint.

As The Verge’s Andrew J. Hawkins points out, the dealership model was established in the early half of the 20th century, when major auto manufacturers such as Ford and General Motors used to sell direct-to-consumer, which raised concerns around monopolistic practices. This led to state laws surrounding franchising, which in turn saw the popularization of car dealerships across North America.

Companies such as Tesla, however, have found workarounds to sell direct-to-consumer, avoiding the dealership model. Currently, more than a dozen states also have an outright ban on direct-to-consumer auto sales. In contrast, some states (including Ohio) have only a partial ban, as part of an agreement reached with Tesla and Ohio’s dealer association, which saw Tesla open three brick-and-mortar locations in the state to abide by the ban.

This is the first time Rivian has sued a U.S. state over its direct-to-consumer ban; however, the manufacturer was sued by Illinois’ dealer association for violating their ban, but the case was dismissed.

Even the VW group has been caught up in the dilemma, with its EV subbrand Scout being sued by California car dealers over its plan to bypass the state’s franchise law.

Curtis and Grassley played a major role in crafting the gradual transition.

However, a Trump executive order issued days after the law’s passage last month raised questions about whether the Treasury could speed up that timeline to appease conservatives who wanted a more immediate phaseout. Grassley cited the need for an “orderly phaseout” for businesses.

“Until I can be certain that such rules and regulations adhere to the law and congressional intent, I intend to continue to object to the consideration of these Treasury nominees,” Grassley entered into the Congressional Record.

Curtis has similar anxieties, according to a source familiar with the matter, particularly that the order may seek to nullify language from Trump’s signature tax cut law.

It is not uncommon for senators to use nominees as bargaining chips, but it is far less common for members of the president’s own party to do so. The nominees are but three of dozens pending confirmation in the upper chamber, creating major tension between Republicans and Democrats last week before the Senate embarked on its August recess. The GOP majority is weighing rules changes upon returning in September that could more easily allow them to confirm nominees in the face of Democratic stonewalling.

Trump’s executive order states that its purpose is to “eliminate subsidies for unreliable ‘green’ energy sources like wind and solar” and directs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to “terminate the clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities.”

However, it is possible that the holds from Grassley and Curtis, which would require additional procedural votes on the trio of nominees who were advanced from committees earlier this year along party lines, may be rendered moot.

TRUMP’S PRESSURE TO EASE NOMINEE BACKLOG FORCES SENATE INTO RARE WEEKEND SESSION

Grassley cited the Treasury’s Aug. 18 plans to release rules and regulations for the tax credit phaseouts, at which point the senators could withdraw their holds. The Senate is on recess until Sept. 2 and will not conduct business before then.

“What it means for a project to ‘begin construction’ has been well established by Treasury guidance for more than a decade,” Grassley said. “Moreover, Congress specifically references current Treasury guidance to set that term’s meaning in law.

Therefore, this question offers a useful proxy measure of support for climate action.
Previous research shows that individuals who are more concerned about climate change also tend to perceive greater concern among other people3,9,10.
We do not argue here that individuals should personally fund climate action or that voluntary individual action should supplant systemic policy efforts19.
The VR application visualizes past climate trends and scientific projections of potential pathways, but does not include any information on public attitudes toward climate change or climate action.","Present policies fall short of curbing global warming to meet internationally agreed climate targets1. Simultaneously, a majority of people around the world support action on climate change2,3. For example, in a recent globally representative survey with nearly 130,000 individuals across 125 countries, Andre et al.3 found that 69% expressed a willingness to contribute at least 1% of their personal income to help address climate change3. This finding highlights the gap between policy ambitions and public support for climate action.

One aspect that remains relatively understudied is how environmental policy actors perceive climate concerns and willingness to act among the global public. This is important as public opinion can, under some circumstances, have an agenda-setting effect on political objectives4,5,6. Additionally, participation and buy-in among diverse groups of people is crucial for successfully implementing climate solutions7. However, there is growing evidence that individuals tend to underestimate how much others are concerned about climate change and willing to act on it, a phenomenon known as pluralistic ignorance3,8,9,10. At the global level, there is a 26-percentage-point gap between the actual proportion of respondents who report being willing to contribute to support climate action (69%) and the average perceived proportions of fellow citizens willing to contribute (43%)3. A limited but growing number of studies have also documented that national or local policy officials are not always aware of the public views of their constituencies, including climate change attitudes11,12,13,14.

As climate change is a global issue requiring international cooperation, this study advances prior literature by examining how policy officials working at an international level, as well as others indirectly involved in international-level environmental policy meetings, perceive global public opinions about climate change. Specifically, we examine these perceptions among attendees of the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6)—the world’s highest-level decision-making body for environmental issues—including policy officials from national governments, the United Nations, and other multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, as well as attendees from academia, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector. While some of these actors may be directly involved in policy negotiations, others may influence the decisions of negotiators through advice, advocacy, and other forms of engagement.

We surveyed 191 attendees from 53 countries and investigated how accurately they estimate global public willingness to contribute personal income for climate action, and used the recent finding that 69% of the public globally say they would contribute 1% of their monthly income to climate action3 to benchmark their responses. UNEA-6 took place from 26 February 2024 to 1 March 2024 and was attended by officials representing 190 countries to negotiate international policies related to climate change, biodiversity conservation, pollution, and other environmental challenges. Attendees also included civil society advocates, government advisors and staff, journalists, observers from non-governmental organizations, subject-matter experts, and United Nations staff (see Supplementary Table S1).

All study participants were asked: “In a representative global survey, how many people out of 100 do you think would say that they are willing to contribute at least 1% of their household income every month to fight global warming?”. Policies aimed at a net zero transition can be perceived by the public as imposing personal costs in both monetary and non-monetary terms, even if they provide long-term benefits15. Importantly, we ask what attendees believe members of the public would say they would contribute, as reported contributions may differ from what they would actually do (i.e., the attitude-behavior gap)16,17. Therefore, this question offers a useful proxy measure of support for climate action. While other climate opinion polls using differently framed questions sometimes find lower support18, we adopted the exact wording from Andre et al. to leverage the results from their large-scale survey across 125 countries as a benchmark. This allows us to (i) assess the accuracy of perceived global climate attitudes among UNEA delegates, and (ii) compare the perception gap in their sample, i.e., the 26-percentage-point difference between individuals’ willingness to contribute (69%) and their perception that others will contribute (43%), with our own data3. Crucially, only Andre et al. directly measure this perception gap across the globe, making their data the necessary reference for this direct comparison.

Figure 1 shows that participants in our sample estimated on average that only 37.8% of the public would say they are willing to contribute 1% of their income to fund climate action (95% CI: [34.56, 41.01]). This gap corresponds to almost half of the 69% globally who say they would contribute3. Only 18.8% of attendees guessed a percentage that was equal to or greater than the actual share of 69%.

To test if this perception gap among UNEA-6 attendees differs depending on whether participants play an active policymaking role, we split the sample into two categories, which we refer to as policy officials and non-policy officials for simplicity. The former group comprises 88 national government representatives and individuals working at the United Nations, World Bank, and other multilateral institutions, including 24 policy negotiators. The latter includes 103 attendees from academia, news media, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector. We find no significant differences in the distribution of perceptions between these groups of attendees (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: p = 0.631). While policy officials estimated a proportion of 36.1% on average (95% CI: [31.76, 40.47]), non-policy officials estimated 39.2% on average (95% CI: [34.49, 43.94]).

Table 1 presents OLS regression estimates examining the relationship between participant characteristics and their perceived global share of individuals willing to contribute 1% of their income to combating climate change. The results confirm that there are no statistically significant differences in average perceptions between policymakers and non-policymakers (p = 0.381) after controlling for age, gender, education, and region of residence. In addition, column (2) shows that this is true when splitting the policymaker indicator into different types of institutions with which delegates are affiliated. Overall, we find little evidence of variation in perceived public willingness to contribute across demographic characteristics, with the exception of a weakly significant positive coefficient indicating less biased beliefs among those with a higher level of education, which becomes insignificant with additional controls.

Relative to the general population, delegates in our sample are highly environmentally conscious, with 88% stating that they are either very worried or extremely worried about climate change. Previous research shows that individuals who are more concerned about climate change also tend to perceive greater concern among other people3,9,10. This may stem from a false consensus effect, whereby individuals overestimate the prevalence of opinions similar to their own, but also from the reverse influence of perceived social norms on personal attitudes and behavior. While there is only limited variation in climate concern within our sample, column (3) shows that, in line with the literature, participants who are more worried about climate change tend to estimate a slightly higher global willingness to contribute to climate action (p < 0.05). Hence, the fact that the average perception gap among UNEA delegates mirrors that of the broader public presents a puzzle.

One concern could be that, despite attending UNEA, some participants may lack the expertise and experience needed to accurately gauge public views12. However, this is unlikely to be the primary driver of systematic misperceptions in our sample. First, we find no evidence that age —and by extension, greater experience—improves estimation accuracy. Second, we construct a direct proxy for climate-related expertise using a non-trivial survey question, where participants ranked five sectors by their share of global greenhouse gas emissions. Participants demonstrated significant knowledge, with only 23% performing no better than random. Table 1 column 3 shows no significant relationship between the ranking accuracy of the sectors (as a proxy for knowledge) and perceptions of public climate views (p = 0.549).

Another concern could be that delegates’ beliefs may not stem from pessimism about the public’s willingness to contribute to climate action but rather from skepticism about their ability to make a meaningful impact. However, our findings contradict this notion. Delegates generally believe that citizens can play an important role in climate action: 47.6% strongly agreed, and 36.1% somewhat agreed that individual members of the public have the ability to take meaningful action. Furthermore, column (3) of Table 1 shows no significant association between perceived public efficacy and perceptions of public willingness to contribute.

Finally, the delegates in our sample do not represent all countries and regions in the world equally. Given the significant cross-national variation in willingness to contribute documented by Andre et al.3, availability bias may lead delegates to base their global estimates on more salient local norms9. Indeed, we find a positive correlation (p = 0.056, see Table 1, column 4) between a delegate’s perception of global climate action support and the national share of individuals in their country of residence who say they are willing to contribute reported by Andre et al.3. Nevertheless, a bias toward national opinions cannot explain our main misperception results, as our sample is not disproportionately composed of delegates from low-support countries. In fact, when weighted by the composition of delegates in our sample, the share of individuals in Andre et al.3 who report willingness to contribute 1% of their income is 71%, compared to the overall 69%3.

Our findings offer, to the best of our knowledge, new evidence that attendees who are either directly or indirectly involved in policy discussions and negotiations at high-level international environmental meetings substantially misperceive global public attitudes on action against climate change. We do not argue here that individuals should personally fund climate action or that voluntary individual action should supplant systemic policy efforts19. However, while a clear majority of global citizens declare they are willing to incur personal costs to address climate change, UNEA-6 attendees believe that only a minority is willing to say so.

A multiplicity of studies concerned with the presence of pluralistic ignorance in society, have advanced a number of explanations. For instance, perceptions of public opinion could lag behind actual opinions due to reliance on outdated norms (“conservative bias”), contributing to misperceptions20. If this was the case in our sample, older respondents would underestimate climate action support to a greater extent, yet our data does not confirm this, as shown in Table 1. A systematic underestimation of global public willingness to contribute to fight climate change could also be explained by the inverse effect of false consensus, where highly climate-concerned individuals mistakenly assume their views are less common than they actually are—a phenomenon known as the “false uniqueness” effect21,22. However, as previously noted, the more common pattern in our data is a positive relationship between personal attitudes and perceptions of others’ attitudes. Even with the limited variation in climate concern within our sample, we find that delegates who are more worried about climate change tend to perceive slightly higher public support for climate action.

Our sample population offers substantial value as most studies exploring climate concern perceptions and pluralistic ignorance focus on members of the public, while fewer examine participants from environmental policy contexts23,24. This is in part because such individuals are more difficult to recruit than students or survey panels. The fact that UNEA delegates seem to underestimate global support for climate action to a similar extent as the general public—despite higher personal engagement and greater expertise on climate change—raises interesting questions for future research.

Multiple factors may contribute to misperceptions of public opinion regarding climate action among policy actors. These include a lack of vocal public discussions about climate change25; the frequency of exposure to individuals and constituencies with particular ideological viewpoints26; how public views are portrayed in news media; and exposure to climate opinion polls27. For instance, lobbying, campaign contributions, and media influence have been shown to skew perceptions of policy actors, making them less able to accurately estimate public preferences12. Similarly, recent evidence finds that citizens who publicly engage with local development projects tend to be highly unrepresentative of the broader population28. Finally, attendees may infer low public willingness to incur personal costs to address climate change from a perceived lack of progress toward carbon neutrality, leading them to underestimate willingness to act. However, due to data limitations, we cannot confirm these mechanisms.

Another limitation of our study is that our sample is not representative of international environmental policy officials. For example, individuals residing in Kenya are overrepresented, which is to be expected given that Kenya is the host country of the Assembly and the location of the UNEP headquarters. Another source of potential bias stems from self-selection into our study. Participants were recruited as part of a broader study that invited them to try a virtual reality (VR) experience related to climate change. However, it is unlikely that perceptions of public climate-related attitudes affected the decision to participate in our study. While we cannot test for this directly, we note that participants’ beliefs about likely global warming scenarios in our sample are comparable to those stated by IPCC scientists and COP climate negotiators (see Supplementary Fig. S2)23,29,30. Additionally, the VR experience did not include any information on public attitudes toward climate change or climate action, and there was no statistically significant association between exposure to the VR experience and estimates of public willingness to contribute (see methods for more details). We also note that it is possible that the participants may have been aware of Andre et al.’s findings, which received significant publicity in the weeks prior to conducting our study. While we cannot rule out this awareness, the fact that participants’ perceptions substantially deviated from the findings suggests otherwise.

Overall, our findings have important implications. They suggest that individuals playing various roles at international environmental fora could be operating under an assumption of a weaker public mandate for climate action than reality. For individuals directly involved in policy negotiations, this could potentially affect their policy ambitions6. Seeking to inform policy officials about current public opinion on climate change could therefore be a worthwhile objective. Indeed, prior research demonstrates that providing policymakers with public opinion data can potentially affect political speech, personal opinions, and policy decisions31,32,33,34. Related studies offer insights into strategies and challenges of sharing public opinion data with policy officials26,35,36,37.

Ambitious climate policies are desperately needed to achieve a societal transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to identifying the best policy mix to achieve this objective38, understanding how public support for climate action can help incentivize policy officials to act is crucial for addressing the climate crisis. Therefore, it is important to shed further light on the sources of misperceptions about public opinion among both citizens and policymakers, and to test different strategies to effectively correct perception gaps about climate action.

Future research can also expand on our findings through a larger, more representative sample, especially to understand perceptions among distinct subgroups of attendees such as negotiators, governmental advisors, advocates, and other environmental policy actors. Qualitative methods, such as interviews and focus groups, could help uncover the influences that shape policy actors’ perceptions of public opinions related to climate change. Questions could seek to understand to what extent lobbying by special interest groups, exposure to media coverage, and other specific factors shape their perceptions of how diverse members of the public feel, think, and act upon climate change. It would also be valuable to measure perceptions of public views on specific types of climate policies beyond contributing to fight climate change in general39, as well as realized behaviors rather than behavioral intentions. Equally, while this study directly sought to elicit participants’ perceptions about Andre et al.’s3 findings, future research could benchmark results against a wider range of opinion polls by adopting different question framings.

Data collection

Researchers attended the UNEA-6 session in Nairobi, Kenya, from February 26, 2024 to March 1, 2024. The researchers administered a survey on tablet devices to participants who were recruited in person at the meeting. A total of 198 attendees agreed to participate in the study. After excluding seven attendees who dropped out before answering the question on perceived climate action support, our main analysis sample consisted of 191 participants.

The survey questions described in this publication were included as part of a larger study assessing the potential effects of a climate-related virtual reality (VR) experience on climate attitudes and beliefs among UNEA-6 attendees. In this context, policy officials were exposed to the demo version of a new VR application designed by Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE). The VR application visualizes past climate trends and scientific projections of potential pathways, but does not include any information on public attitudes toward climate change or climate action. As part of another study, we randomly assigned the timing of exposure to the VR experience within the survey across participants. The main variable of interest in this study (perceived global willingness to contribute 1% of income to climate action) was asked before the VR experience for some participants and after the VR experience for others. However, there is no statistically significant difference in the distribution of perceived global climate action support by whether participants were asked before or after experiencing the VR (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: p = 0.363) (See Supplementary Fig. S1). All other survey questions described in this paper were asked prior to participants being exposed to the VR experience.

Survey measures

Policymakers’ views on global climate action support were elicited using the following question: “In a representative global survey, how many people out of 100 do you think would say that they are willing to contribute at least 1% of their household income every month to fight global warming?”. Estimates were collected through a slider that could be freely adjusted from 0 to 100 in increments of one. Other survey questions included basic socio-demographic information, as well as general attitudes and beliefs about climate change, such as perceived efficacy, past experiences with climate events, beliefs about future warming scenarios, and potential climate solutions. Perceived public efficacy was measured by eliciting the level of agreement to the following statement on a 5-point Likert scale: “Individual members of the public have the ability to address climate change”.

A question on potential climate solutions asked participants to drag and rank the following five items in response to the question “Which of the following, if any, makes you most confident in humanity’s ability to reach global emissions targets?”: technological advancement (e.g. renewable energy), global governance and international agreements (e.g. Paris agreement), collective action and social movements (e.g. climate protests), individual action and lifestyle change (e.g. transportation, food, recycling). Knowledge was evaluated by having participants answer the following question: “Please rank these 5 human activities according to their share of total global greenhouse gas emissions from greatest to smallest. If you’re unsure, please just take your best guess. Agriculture (e.g. land use, livestock); Buildings (e.g. heating, cooling); Energy production (e.g. electricity); Industry (e.g. manufacturing); Transport (e.g. cars, planes)”.

Analyses and additional evidence

For Fig. 1, we plotted histograms of perceived climate action support using (i) the full sample of 191 attendees who responded to the question; (ii) policymakers only, defined as participants who stated either of the following as institution: government and public agency, United Nations (excluding those in non-policy roles, e.g. IT, intern), and other multilateral institutions (such as World Bank); (iii) non-policymakers, defined as all other attendees (e.g., from NGOs, private sector, and academia). In addition, we calculate the mean and 95% confidence intervals (based on two-sided t tests) for each (sub)sample. To analyze whether responses to this question are associated with perceived global climate action support, we create dummy variables for each of these items that takes value 1 if the item was ranked first by the participant and regress perceived support on these dummies. The R-squared is 0.0046 and an F-test does not reject the null hypothesis of no explanatory power (p = 0.9669), as mentioned in the main text.

To adjust actual climate action support to the country composition of our sample, we matched country-level responses to the question eliciting willingness to give 1% of one’s income to fight climate change in Andre et al.3 with the reported residence country of our study participants. 13 participants in our sample come from countries that were not represented in the Andre et al. survey and are therefore excluded in this specific calculation. These countries are: Angola, Barbados, Bhutan, Burundi, Cuba, Eswatini, Grenada, Maldives, Oman, St. Kitts And Nevis, Vanuatu.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02536-2/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2536_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-08-04 17:04:04.035636

The layoffs take effect beginning Aug. 15, according to the filing.

“LevelTen Energy has made strategic workforce changes to align with the economic impacts of the recent federal budget legislation, tariff uncertainty, and ongoing permitting challenges. By streamlining our structure and adopting the latest technology tools, we’re maintaining our strong financial footing,” LevelTen CEO and founder Bryce Smith said by email on Monday.

The company describes itself as the world’s largest online marketplace connecting buyers, sellers, advisors and financiers of clean energy projects. Its customers include tech companies and other businesses and institutions looking to support renewable power in order to curb their climate emissions. LevelTen’s platform has been used for transactions totaling more than $14.8 billion.

“Customers rely on LevelTen’s data and marketplaces, especially in times of great volatility,” Smith added. “We’ll continue to build the products that they trust, and create new innovations that drive the clean energy transition. We have weathered ever-changing markets since 2016, and we’re fully prepared to achieve our current and long-term commercial and environmental priorities.

Clean energy deployments have been on the rise for many years, but Republican leaders in July passed their mega bill, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which cuts tax incentives for renewable wind and solar power passed during the Biden administration. Those breaks are scuttled in 2028, at which point new installations of onshore wind and solar in the U.S. are expected to plunge 41%, according to BloombergNEF.

The headwinds come just a year after LevelTen raised a $65 million Series D round that included investments from Microsoft and Google, among others.

As of last summer, the company had 130 employees and an optimistic outlook.

“We see a massive opportunity to bring our transaction infrastructure to new, really important adjacent climate technologies and to expand geographically and to add some new customer types to the platform,” Smith told GeekWire in July 2024.

The new funding was meant to help the company spread beyond the 29 countries in North America and Europe in which it was already operating. LevelTen has raised a total of $125 million.

Some power deals are still being made. In June, the company announced a new clean energy project that it facilitated with Starbucks and the software company Workday to support the construction of a 350 megawatt solar power installation in Central Texas.

Rob Collier, LevelTen’s senior vice president of marketplaces, said that demand for the projects remained high.

“Demand is booming right now for energy, for electricity, for power, particularly clean electrons,” Collier told GeekWire in June. “And that’s driven by a number of pretty strong macroeconomic forcing functions: the need for data centers, and the increased demand due to AI.”

But he did acknowledge that the sector was not attracting new customers for power purchase agreements and that the supply side was getting more difficult, with ongoing challenges with permitting and electrical grid connections, as well as persistent uncertainty around policy and tariffs making it hard to plan and deploy the infrastructure.

“We have deep respect and gratitude for our LevelTen colleagues impacted by this restructuring,” Smith said on Monday. “They are among the best and brightest in the clean energy industry.”",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Wind-turbines-PacNW-2-Kurt-Schlosser.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 20:01:45.853206

The locations chosen were Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky, and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, leveraging existing government-owned land and energy resources to accelerate AI infrastructure deployment.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said, “These sites are uniquely positioned to host data centers as well as power generation to bolster grid reliability, strengthen our national security, and reduce energy costs,” in a release.

While the effort to unlock federal land for data center use began under former President Joe Biden, the Trump administration has sought to fast-track the process.

The DoE's announcement follows an executive order entitled Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure, issued by President Donald Trump on July 23, which streamlined the environmental review and permitting process for data center projects and revoked clean energy conditions for AI infrastructure established by Biden.

The four selected sites were picked from a list released by the Department of Energy in April of 16 federally owned locations identified for their potential to host data centers and their available associated power resources.

At Idaho National Laboratory, the Department of Energy owns about 62,000 acres of an 890-square-mile site that includes four operational nuclear reactors and advanced integrated energy systems.

The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky – a 3,500-acre nuclear production site with 19 miles of road, nine miles of railroad tracks, and close proximity to a river – was positioned to deliver up to 3 gigawatts of power and supply 30 million gallons of water per day, fulfilling the high energy demands of AI infrastructure.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory has local power resources that include hydro, nuclear, and fossil fuels and contains about 100 acres suitable for near-term development. Located about five miles from another proposed small modular reactor site, this location provides a future opportunity to capitalize on regional nuclear infrastructure.

Finally, the Savannah River Site was home to a 310-square-mile site operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration to supply and process tritium for nuclear weapons.

As the four selected sites are to be developed in partnership with the private sector, the Department of Energy was working on formal solicitations that outline the scope, eligibility, and application process for private partners.

With these requirements expected in the coming months, the Department of Energy will likely unlock further land for AI, chipmaking, and other energy projects.

But any adaptation projects for South Sudan have to be designed with conflict in mind. In his new book, coauthored with Jerry Urtuzuastigui, conflict researcher Ore Koren discusses the relationship between climate adaptation and security. Understanding this is essential in designing projects that protect people against climate change and also work well in conflict situations.

Why does South Sudan provide valuable insights into climate adaptation and conflict?

South Sudan is a good place to study if you want to understand the relationship between climate adaptation and conflict. Since gaining independence in 2011, the country has endured a prolonged civil war. Today, it continues to experience instability, with up to 2.3 million people displaced.

South Sudan faces both worsening droughts and record-breaking floods that destroy crops and fuel food insecurity. These climate shocks can have implications for conflict. For instance, they can make tensions over land or water access worse. They can also isolate regions from each other, allowing violent non-state groups to operate uninterrupted, and harm local livelihoods.

Read more: South Sudan floods: the first example of a mass population permanently displaced by climate change?

In response, national agencies and international organisations – operating through a host of international nongovernmental organisations – have set up climate adaptation and food security programmes. These go beyond emergency aid. They include planting drought-resistant crops, rainwater harvesting, livestock restocking, and training farmers in climate-smart agriculture.

Some non-profit groups focus on building South Sudan’s long-term resilience to climate change. Others also provide emergency food and water. Smaller organisations emphasise community-led approaches to strengthen adaptation and food security.

Read more: Conflict and climate change lead to a rise in global hunger

However, the country has a fractured security landscape. Violence in South Sudan includes fighting between state forces and rebel groups and militarised groups left over from the civil war.

Social conflict also occurs. This includes clashes between ethnic communities, pastoralists and farmers, and local militias. Most insecurity today stems from decentralised, communal violence over resources and political grievances.

This creates a setting where even well-meaning aid programmes can unintentionally shift local power dynamics and spark conflict.

What did you find out about the relationship between conflict and efforts to manage climate change?

We collected detailed data on climate and food security projects like flood defences, drought-resistant crops, and local programmes to manage shared resources or reduce conflict. We mapped where these were were taking place in South Sudan, right down to the village or district.

We also tracked what kind of help was provided, how long it lasted, and how involved local communities and the government were.

Read more: Somalia: climate insecurity could trigger more conflict

Our research found that climate adaptation programmes in conflict-affected areas like South Sudan can both reduce violence and make it worse. This depends on how they are designed and when they are implemented.

For example, all adaptation and food security programmes were associated with increased conflict between government forces and rebel groups. This wasn’t because growing food is inherently risky, but because such programmes tend to increase the value of land. This attracts the attention of armed groups who are competing for control of land. In a militarised environment like this, efforts that improve access to resources can unintentionally lead to violence by making some areas more desirable.

However, when we examined violence involving militias and intercommunal groups who rely on local resources, we found more encouraging patterns.

We found that programmes that combined several goals – such as introducing drought-resistant crops and supporting local economic development – were more successful in reducing local violence. Such interventions help communities manage many problems at once – from economic hardship to resource scarcity. They also give people alternatives to violence as a coping strategy.

Climate change impacts often defy expectations. People may prepare for drought only to face floods. Therefore, projects that build capacity to tackle multiple possible outcomes are likely to be more effective.

So how exactly can climate projects reduce violence?

We found that interventions that respond to multiple stressors and include input from local people can reduce militia and communal violence. This is especially the case during acute climate shocks, such as extreme weather.

We also found that many donor agencies do not fully understand the complexity of designing climate adaptation programmes in high conflict areas. Our research recommends that policymakers and donors treat adaptation as a socially and environmentally complex process – not just a technical fix – and tailor it to local contexts.

Our findings also suggest that the benefits of climate adaptation were most pronounced during periods of acute climate stress, such as flooding or drought. In these times, even less-than-perfect programmes helped reduce violence. This is probably because they stabilised people’s livelihoods and eased pressure on resources exactly when stress levels are at their highest.

In contrast, projects implemented during periods of relatively mild weather had a much weaker effect on the levels of violence, or no effect at all.

Beyond South Sudan, the findings suggest that looking at the overlap between climate change and conflict could benefit fragile regions across Africa, like Uganda, Ethiopia, and Nigeria.

How should South Sudan prepare for severe violence and massive climate disasters?

Our findings point to four key strategies:

Climate adaptation programmes should prepare the country for several different types of climate disasters, and recognise that these may happen at unpredictable times. They can do this by supporting projects that address both adaptation and food security priorities. They can also combine efforts to adapt to climate change with broader socioeconomic development programmes aimed at improving people’s lives now.

Interventions that are helpful in periods of acute climate stress are more likely to have a positive impact on conflict. One example is improving ways to store food. Creating community-level committees to manage resources can also increase the likelihood that crises are handled peacefully and resources are distributed fairly.

But clean energy might still grow modestly without tax credits, especially with utilities required to meet the state’s 2040 net zero clean electricity standard and surging demand.
Battery storage and other clean electricity projects employing the 48E investment tax credit begin phasing out in 2033.","Passed by Congress and signed by the president a month ago, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act imposes a series of fast deadlines for businesses and residents who want to use federal incentives for clean energy investments.

The time to act is now, as several deadlines for tax credits are fast approaching, covering everything from solar energy installations to electric vehicle purchases. Homeowners using the 25D tax credit for solar, wind, geothermal, batteries, or fuel cell systems have to have projects done and activated by Dec. 31, 2025, to receive a 30% tax credit. The deadline is shared by those using the 25C tax credit to buy energy-efficient improvements, such as weatherization, home energy audits and heat pumps.

Fortunately, clean energy advocates have prepared. The Clean Energy Resource Teams (CERTS) gathered national and state sources that explain the various changes to the tax code, including its own roundup and others from Canary Media and Rewiring America. The lists include new and shorter deadlines for the many incentives passed in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Sponsored by the University of Minnesota Extension’s Regional Sustainable Development Partnerships and three other organizations, CERTS also provides “community energy ambassadors” to assist people with clean energy projects and navigate the new changes. The program “is a great way to understand federal clean energy incentives that may be leaving or Minnesota-specific incentives that may be coming online,” according to co-director Joel Haskard.

George Damian, director of government affairs for Clean Energy Economy Minnesota, said the organization’s membership had been planning and preparing for the elimination of tax credits. The solar industry, in particular, has experienced the rise and fall of tax credits.

“I think one of the biggest things is just the sense of urgency,” Damian said. “They’re trying to make sure that people know that, ‘hey, this is what’s still available and get out there and use these while you can.’”

Despite the impending deadlines, he had not heard of clean energy businesses hiring extra staff, outside of the usual seasonal bump, to manage any additional demand. Damian said even without tax credits, wind and solar energy will continue to grow as electricity demand increases because they take less time to construct than fossil fuel or nuclear plants.

“I think solar and wind and batteries will continue to be built,” he said. “We’ll definitely keep moving forward.”

Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association executive director Logan O’Grady said after the election, his members assumed the solar tax credit would go away. “I think our members have been preparing for this, frankly, since after the election in November,” O’Grady said. “Many of them have hit the ground running on marketing solar for the next few months to try and get residential clients. But it is such a short time frame.”

O’Grady said many businesses and residential customers will still choose to install solar and batteries as a hedge against higher electricity costs. As energy markets grow more sophisticated, solar and battery owners will have more opportunities to sell their production to help utilities manage escalating electricity demand driven by data centers and other energy-intensive businesses, he said.

The enormous bill certainly does not help solar and battery storage industries, he said, nor Minnesota’s clean energy initiatives. But clean energy might still grow modestly without tax credits, especially with utilities required to meet the state’s 2040 net zero clean electricity standard and surging demand.

“At the end of the day, these utilities are seeing that growth is coming and they have to figure out a way to meet it,” O’Grady said.” If they’re smart, they’re going to realize on-site, solar, wind and storage are going to be key to that.”

Avisen Legal attorney Jeremy Kalin said companies building commercial solar projects have a bit longer to qualify for tax credits. They can still get the 30% tax credit and any bonuses for projects installed and completed by the end of 2027.

Commercial projects that start before July 4, 2026, may get an extension beyond 2027. “We don’t know what the later date will be,” Kalin said. But an advantage to starting a project now — even if it does not reach completion this year — is that solar owners do not have to comply with the “foreign entity of concern” tax provision prohibiting the use of panels composed of more than 60% of materials from China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia.

Congress intended the restriction to primarily curtail China’s solar panel industry’s sales in the United States. Moving a project forward now allows time to deal with any hiccups in approvals from Xcel Energy, which approves all solar applications, and deal with supply chain issues.

Until the end of 2025, projects will not need to prove where components originated. “Your project will be cheaper, if only because the contractor doesn’t have to have paperwork showing that they’ve complied with this limit on Chinese parts,” Kalin said.

In other areas, consumers and businesses may feel even more rushed. Electric vehicle incentives cease at the end of September, but credits for chargers will be available through June 30, 2026.

The bill has a few bright spots for clean energy. Battery storage and other clean electricity projects employing the 48E investment tax credit begin phasing out in 2033. Net zero power generation plants can also receive a tax credit for the next several years, he said.

Congress left in place the 30% tax credit for commercial geothermal projects, but the residential geothermal credit only lasts through this year. Nonprofits building geothermal systems can continue to receive the tax credit from the government through a direct payment provision, he said.

Overall, Kalin is no fan of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and believes it could be the death knell for some solar companies. Yet, the industry is prepared. “I’m seeing billions of dollars of capital getting deployed that is meeting this moment in a beautiful way,” he said. “The next few years are going to be fine. They’re going to be hard, but we’ve trained for this. We’re hydrated and ready.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/08/Trump-signing-bill-web.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 16:05:37.883065

While California and Texas still played major roles despite congested markets, their combined share of new capacity fell by 16% from the previous quarter as states in the Southwest and Midwest saw significant storage growth.
Sizewise, Indiana and Nevada saw the two largest battery storage projects come online in Q1, with both projects adding 200 MW / four hours of storage to the grid.
Beyond utility-scale storage, the residential market also set new highs, with 458 MW and 893 MWh of capacity installed in what equals out as an 82% jump year-over-year.","The U.S. energy storage sector kicked off 2025 at full speed, posting record growth across utility, residential and commercial segments, according to the latest U.S. Energy Storage Monitor from Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association. The report highlights that not only has the market scaled rapidly, it’s also started shifting as policy, tariffs and manufacturing dynamics reshape where and how projects get built.

In a record-breaking start to the year, developers installed over two gigawatts of new storage capacity in Q1 alone despite 21 GWh of battery energy storage factories being cancelled in 2025. Utility-scale projects dominated and added 57% more megawatt-hours compared to the same timeframe in 2024; the total number rang in at 1,558 MW / 4,078 MWh.

Five states accounted for 91% of the country’s new capacity. While California and Texas still played major roles despite congested markets, their combined share of new capacity fell by 16% from the previous quarter as states in the Southwest and Midwest saw significant storage growth.

Sizewise, Indiana and Nevada saw the two largest battery storage projects come online in Q1, with both projects adding 200 MW / four hours of storage to the grid.

However, some experts expect states in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) to experience delayed or cancelled projects as hybrid solar-and-storage projects become harder to pencil.

Beyond utility-scale storage, the residential market also set new highs, with 458 MW and 893 MWh of capacity installed in what equals out as an 82% jump year-over-year. Here, California remained a leader. Coupled with Puerto Rico, the two markets made up just under 75% of new growth in early 2025.

Illinois also emerged as a promising new player in the residential storage scene; the report chalks this up to the state’s net billing scheme, though the authors note that attachment rates “have not yet reached anticipated levels.”

Even as smaller installers wrestled with ongoing supply chain constraints, homeowner demand for backup power and bill savings continued pushing residential storage forward.

But under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, wannabe residential battery owners have only until the end of the year to purchase and install storage systems in order to qualify for the 30% tax credit under 25D. Most leased residential systems will remain eligible for tax credits beyond 2025, however, as they rely on 48E instead.

Commercial, community and industrial storage (CCI) deployment also saw a 36% increase year-over-year in early 2025, though the growth was concentrated in California and New York.

Wood Mackenzie expects all storage sectors to struggle in the short-term before bouncing back in the long-term due to strong renewable energy interest from hyperscales and corporates, constrained capacity and state-level climate targets.

Utility-scale installations, in particular, are expected to see year-to-year swings due to tariffs and procurement bottlenecks but should recover strongly as demand for grid reliability and renewable integration grows later this decade.

Tyler Hill Solar 1 is a five-megawatt project proposed on a 21.6-acre property off Cochecton Turnpike. The project’s conditional land use permit was set to expire on July 21, 2025, the date of the supervisors’ meeting.

Tyler Hill Solar 1 requested at least a six-month extension on their conditional land use permit in order to allow time for the final land development approval to be obtained. They requested either a six-month extension on the permit so that it would expire January 21, 2026, or an extension until the land development approval is obtained.

The land development plan will include the input from the Wayne County Conservation District and an emergency plan.

Additionally, any proposal for an “an earth disturbance activity” in an area greater than one acre, with the exception of agricultural activity like tilling or plowing, timber harvesting, heavy animal use or road maintenance, needs a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, which regulates stormwater discharge from a property. NPDES approval is therefore needed. (See below for more on the details of an NPDES permit.)

One supervisor asked, “Is it likely that the land development plan will be approved within six months?”

According to project representatives, there are factors acting upon the timetable, such as the NPDES approval process, and the developer has no power over this.

The supervisors gave the project a nine-month extension, to April 21, 2026, but said they would grant no further extensions. Rather than asking for another extension next time, if necessary, the developer can reapply and start the project anew.

The project faces a looming federal deadline as well. According to published reports, it appears that the solar and wind projects tax credits originally enacted in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, can only be utilized if construction begins by July 1, 2026 or if the project is placed in service by December 31, 2027.

What’s in a stormwater permit?

Two components in the NPDES approval would be the Stormwater Plan and the Preparedness, Preparation and Contingency Plan.

The Stormwater Plan, also known as the Post Construction Stormwater Management Plan, is outlined by the PA Department of Environmental Protection. The plan’s goal is to ensure that stormwater runoff does not aggravate environmental degradation. This is a state requirement.

“Such requirements include maximizing volume control technologies, eliminating or minimizing discharges to surface waters, preserving the integrity of stream channels, and protecting the physical, biological and chemical qualities of the receiving surface water.”

The Preparedness, Prevention and Contingency Plan is a contingency plan in case hazardous materials are spilled into the environment.

“If the potential exists for causing pollution of air, land or water, or for causing endangerment of public health and safety through accidental release of toxic, hazardous or other polluting materials including concrete and gasoline, the permittee or co-permittee must develop a PPC plan,” according to state documents.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/riverreporter/original/20250725-150823-4f4-solar%20stock%20from%20PA%20DEP.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 16:07:02.233164

Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump.
In December Delaware Chancellor Kathleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk’s multibillion-dollar pay package.
She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.
The rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk’s 2018 compensation package.","Tesla gave Elon Musk a stock grant of $29 billion on Monday as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented"" growth despite a recent foray into right-wing politics that has hurt its sales, profits and its stock price.

In giving its billionaire CEO 96 million in restricted shares, the electric car company noted that Musk hasn't been paid in years because his 2018 compensation package has been rejected by a Delaware court. The award comes eight months after a judge revoked the 2018 pay package a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling.

Tesla on Monday called the grant a “first step, good faith” way of retaining Musk and keeping him focused, citing his leadership of SpaceX, xAI and other companies. Musk said recently that he needed more shares and control so he couldn't be ousted by shareholder activists.

“Rewarding Elon for what he has done and continues to do for Tesla is the right thing to do,” the company said in a regulatory filing, citing an increase of $735 billion in Tesla's value on the stock market since 2018.

Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. But Tesla also faces intensifying competition from both the big Detroit automakers, and from China.

In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company fell short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

The electric vehicle maker said in the regulatory filing that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package.

In December Delaware Chancellor Kathleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk’s multibillion-dollar pay package. She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.

The rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk’s 2018 compensation package.

That pay package carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla’s stock price.

Musk appealed the order in March. A month later Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it was creating a special committee to look at Musk’s compensation as CEO.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives feels Musk's stock award may alleviate some Tesla shareholder concerns.

“We believe this grant will now keep Musk as CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 and removes an overhang on the stock,” Ives wrote in a client note. “Musk remains Tesla’s big asset and this comp issue has been a constant concern of shareholders once the Delaware soap opera began.”

Under pressure from shareholders last month, Tesla scheduled an annual shareholders meeting for November to comply with Texas state law.

A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders, which have watched Tesla shares plummet, said in a letter to the company that it needed to at least provide public notice of the annual meeting.

The Local Government Energy Modernization Program will provide funding for projects that help governments with new infrastructure that would aid in reducing utility costs. The funding will be issued by the Maryland Energy Administration (MEA).

The program comes as Marylanders and state leaders have raised concerns about spikes in energy prices over the past year.

Clean energy funding program

The energy modernization program aims to help communities around the state transition from outdated systems to clean energy infrastructure, the governor's office said.

""It isn't enough to ask Marylanders to see themselves in the consequences of the climate crisis; they need to see themselves in the progress,"" Gov. Moore said in a statement. ""Investments in climate action drive new infrastructure projects, support our work modernizing the grid, and strengthen our pledge to act as disciplined stewards of the taxpayer dime.""

The funding will help county and local governments launch clean energy projects that would reduce energy bills. The energy projects would also improve reliability on the electrical grid and lower long-term costs that are often passed to residents.

""The agency designed this program to be flexible enough to be tailored to local priorities so that every Maryland county — regardless of size or income — can take meaningful steps forward to cut costs and combat climate change,"" said MEA Director Paul Pinksy.

Projects that are eligible for funding through this program include HVAC system upgrades, solar panel installations, energy audits, and building insulation improvements, among others.

The application period for the Local Government Energy Modernization Program will end on December 5. Find more information here.

Maryland's effort to lower energy costs

During the course of the year, Maryland has launched several efforts to lower energy costs both for residents and for local governments.

In mid-July, the state joined a regional effort to lower electricity prices for residents by requesting information about projects that could improve grid reliability.

""Eliminating funds or scaling down the operations of Earth-observing satellites would be catastrophic and would severely impair our ability to forecast, manage, and respond to severe weather and climate disasters.
Carbon-monitoring satellites have revolutionized climate science The carbon dioxide data that the instruments were originally designed to collect has revolutionized scientists' understanding of how quickly carbon dioxide is collecting in the atmosphere.
""Fifty years ago we thought the tropical forests were like a huge vacuum cleaner, sucking up carbon dioxide,"" Denning explains.
In recent years, multiple private groups in the U.S. have launched satellites that measure methane, a potent planet-warming gas that is poorly monitored compared to carbon dioxide.","The Trump administration has asked NASA employees to draw up plans to end at least two major satellite missions, according to current and former NASA staffers. If the plans are carried out, one of the missions would be permanently terminated, because the satellite would burn up in the atmosphere.

The data the two missions collect is widely used, including by scientists, oil and gas companies and farmers who need detailed information about carbon dioxide and crop health. They are the only two federal satellite missions that were designed and built specifically to monitor planet-warming greenhouse gases.

It is unclear why the Trump administration seeks to end the missions. The equipment in space is state of the art and is expected to function for many more years, according to scientists who worked on the missions. An official review by NASA in 2023 found that ""the data are of exceptionally high quality"" and recommended continuing the mission for at least three years.

Both missions, known as the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, measure carbon dioxide and plant growth around the globe. They use identical measurement devices, but one device is attached to a stand-alone satellite while the other is attached to the International Space Station. The standalone satellite would burn up in the atmosphere if NASA pursued plans to terminate the mission.

NASA employees who work on the two missions are making what the agency calls Phase F plans for both carbon-monitoring missions, according to David Crisp, a longtime NASA engineer who designed the instruments and managed the missions until he retired in 2022. Phase F plans lay out options for terminating NASA missions.

Crisp says NASA employees making those termination plans have reached out to him for his technical expertise. ""What I have heard is direct communications from people who were making those plans, who weren't allowed to tell me that that's what they were told to do. But they were allowed to ask me questions,"" Crisp says. ""They were asking me very sharp questions. The only thing that would have motivated those questions was [that] somebody told them to come up with a termination plan.""

Three other academic scientists who use data from the missions confirmed that they, too, have been contacted with questions related to mission termination. All three asked for anonymity because they are concerned that speaking about the mission termination plans publicly could endanger the jobs of the NASA employees who contacted them.

Two current NASA employees also confirmed that NASA mission leaders were told to make termination plans for projects that would lose funding under President Donald Trump's proposed budget for the next fiscal year, or FY 2026, which begins Oct. 1. The employees asked to remain anonymous, because they were told they would be fired if they revealed the request.

Congress funded the missions and may fund them again

Presidential budget proposals are wish lists that often bear little resemblance to final congressional budgets. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory missions have already received funding from Congress through the end of the 2025 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Draft budgets that Congress is currently considering for next year keep NASA funding basically flat. But it's not clear whether these specific missions will receive funding again, or if Congress will pass a budget before current funding expires on Sept. 30.

Last week, NASA announced it will consider proposals from private companies and universities that are willing to take on the cost of maintaining the device that is attached to the International Space Station, as well as another device that measures ozone in the atmosphere.

NASA did not respond to questions from NPR about whether other missions will also be privatized, or about why the agency is making plans to potentially terminate projects that may receive funding in Congress' next budget.

In July, congressional Democrats sent a letter to acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy warning his agency not to terminate missions that Congress has funded, and arguing that the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and its director, Russ Vought, are overstepping by directing NASA and other agencies to stop spending money that Congress has already appropriated.

""Congress has the power of the purse, not Trump or Vought,"" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., one of the authors of the letter and the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology in an email to NPR. ""Eliminating funds or scaling down the operations of Earth-observing satellites would be catastrophic and would severely impair our ability to forecast, manage, and respond to severe weather and climate disasters. The Trump administration is forcing the proposed cuts in its FY26 budget request on already appropriated FY25 funds. This is illegal.""

A spokesperson for OMB told NPR via email that ""OMB had nothing to do with NASA Earth Science leadership's request for termination plans."" The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy did not respond to questions from NPR.

In the past, Vought has been vocal about cutting what he sees as inappropriate spending on projects related to climate change. Before he joined the Trump administration, Vought authored sections of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 roadmap for remaking the federal government. In that document, Vought wrote that ""the Biden Administration's climate fanaticism will need a whole-of-government unwinding"" and argued that federal regulators should make it easier for commercial satellites to be launched.

The data from these missions is even more valuable than intended

The missions are called Orbiting Carbon Observatories because they were originally designed to measure carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But soon after they launched, scientists realized that they were also accidentally measuring plant growth on Earth.

Basically, when plants are growing, photosynthesis is happening in their cells. And that photosynthesis gives off a very specific wavelength of light. The OCO instruments in space measure that light all over the planet.

""NASA and others have turned this happy accident into an incredibly valuable set of maps of plant photosynthesis around the world,"" explains Scott Denning, a longtime climate scientist at Colorado State University who worked on the OCO missions and is now retired. ""Lo and behold, we also get these lovely, high resolution maps of plant growth,"" he says. ""And that's useful to farmers, useful to rangeland and grazing and drought monitoring and forest mapping and all kinds of things, in addition to the CO2 measurements.""

For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and many private agricultural consulting companies use the data to forecast and track crop yield, drought conditions and more.

The information can also help predict future political instability, since crop failures are a major driver of mass migration all over the world. For example, persistent drought in Honduras is one factor that has led many farmers there to migrate north, NPR reporting found. And damage to crops and livestock from extreme weather in Northern Africa has contributed to migration from that region. ""This is a national security issue, for sure,"" Crisp says.

Carbon-monitoring satellites have revolutionized climate science

The carbon dioxide data that the instruments were originally designed to collect has revolutionized scientists' understanding of how quickly carbon dioxide is collecting in the atmosphere.

That's because measuring carbon dioxide with instruments in various locations on the Earth's surface, as scientists have been doing since the 1950s, doesn't provide information about the whole planet. Satellite data, on the other hand, covers the entire Earth.

And that data showed some surprising things. ""Fifty years ago we thought the tropical forests were like a huge vacuum cleaner, sucking up carbon dioxide,"" Denning explains. ""Now we know they're not.""

Instead, boreal forests in the northern latitudes suck up a significant amount of carbon dioxide, the satellite data shows. And the patterns of which areas absorb the planet-warming gas, and how much they absorb, are continuously changing as the climate changes.

""The value of these observations is just increasing over time,"" explains Anna Michalak, a climate researcher at Carnegie Science and Stanford University who has worked extensively on greenhouse gas monitoring from space. ""These are missions that are still providing critical information.""

It is expensive to end satellite missions

The cost of maintaining the two OCO satellite missions up in space is a small fraction of the amount of money taxpayers already spent to design and launch the instruments. The two missions cost about $750 million to design, build and launch, according to David Crisp, the retired NASA engineer, and that number is even higher if you include the cost of an initial failed rocket launch that sent an identical carbon dioxide measuring instrument into the ocean in 2009.

By comparison, maintaining both OCO missions in orbit costs about $15 million per year, Crisp says. That money covers the cost of downloading the data, maintaining a network of calibration sensors on the ground and making sure the stand-alone satellite isn't hit by space debris, according to Crisp.

""Just from an economic standpoint, it makes no economic sense to terminate NASA missions that are returning incredibly valuable data,"" Crisp says.

NASA's recent call for universities and companies to potentially take over the cost of maintaining the OCO instrument attached to the International Space Station suggests the agency is also considering privatizing NASA science missions. Such partnerships raise a host of thorny questions, says Michalak, who has worked with private companies, nonprofit groups, universities and the federal government on greenhouse gas monitoring satellite projects.

""On the one hand the private sector is really starting to have a role,"" Michalak says. In recent years, multiple private groups in the U.S. have launched satellites that measure methane, a potent planet-warming gas that is poorly monitored compared to carbon dioxide.

""Looking at it from the outside, it can look like the private sector is really picking up some of what the federal agencies were doing in terms of Earth observations,"" she explains. ""And it's true that they're contributing."" But, she says, ""Those efforts would not be possible without this underlying investment from public funding.""

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act would streamline the requirements imposed by the National Environmental Policy Act on electric co-ops applying for federal permits to build new generation, transmission and distribution capacity, strengthen existing systems or perform crucial maintenance work.

The lead sponsors of the bill, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., and Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, say it would shorten permitting timelines and reduce the frequency of “frivolous litigation” that holds up construction of crucial infrastructure.

One of the big changes in the bill is that receiving federal grants or other types of funding would no longer automatically trigger NEPA, meaning co-ops wouldn’t have to go through the review process every time they get federal money for an improvement project.

“NEPA has become increasingly complex, unpredictable, and unworkable over time,” Matheson wrote in a July 30 letter to Westerman and Golden.

“The SPEED Act includes much-needed reforms to modernize environmental permitting and support electric co-ops’ energy development … Prolonged environmental reviews and legal challenges not only delay these new projects but also hinder vegetation management and routine maintenance for existing systems.”

The delays and hurdles created by NEPA increase costs for not-for-profit co-ops, which are forced to pass them on to consumer-members, Matheson said. He urged Congress to pass the bill.

“The SPEED Act offers meaningful solutions … These reforms would ensure agencies concentrate on direct, foreseeable environmental impacts within their expertise and legal mandate.”

The bill’s introduction comes as federal agencies under the Trump administration are releasing new NEPA procedures that will simplify the permitting process for co-ops’ energy and broadband projects.

NRECA has welcomed those changes while also lobbying Congress to update the law for a more permanent fix.

NEPA is well-intentioned, Westerman said, but it has become “bad for both our environment and the economy.”

“With commonsense upgrades, we can cut red tape and enable the United States to build once again while setting the standard for environmental stewardship,” the chairman said.

“The SPEED Act will help launch America into a future where we can effectively innovate and implement to revitalize our infrastructure, meet skyrocketing energy demands, lead the world in the AI race and work in harmony with our natural environment.”

Golden said that “being a good steward of our environment doesn’t mean we must tolerate a yearslong permitting process that is onerous, overly complex and ripe for litigation abuse.”

“America must get back into the business of building,” the congressman said. “We need modern infrastructure. We need robust power production that does not discriminate between energy sources. These investments will create jobs, support our economy, keep prices down and help us maintain energy independence.”",https://www.electric.coop/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/U.S.-Capitol-Getty-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 16:06:25.650045

Nexans, a leader in the world's energy transition which invested in the US with its subsea transmission cable manufacturing facility in South Carolina, announced a partnership with Crowley Wind Services, a leading American shipping and logistics company, to develop and operate a first-of-a-kind Jones Act Compliant U.S.-flagged cable lay barge.

Dedicated to supporting the installation of subsea transmission lines necessary for offshore wind energy, telecommunications, and other major industrial applications, this collaboration underscores both companies' commitment to providing solutions for the expansion of U.S. energy sources and other industrial uses that require underwater cabling.

The 300-foot barge will be crewed by American mariners. The vessel will play a critical role in laying and burying the subsea cables needed to deliver energy from offshore to the grid onshore. The barge boasts a dynamic positioning system and a multiple-anchors positioning system, which allow for accurate cable placement, even in challenging conditions.

The barge also carries a 3,500-ton capacity carousel to lay and bury subsea cable using burial tools such as a vertical injector, a jet sled, or a jetting ROV, with the potential to be upgraded to 7,000 tons with two carousels for bundle cable lay and burial.

The barge is currently supporting Equinor's Empire Wind offshore wind farm for New York and can be configured to lay or repair cable for a multitude of other subsea applications.

Pascal Radue, EVP of Nexans' PWR-Transmission Business Group, highlights the significance of the partnership: “This barge will support our existing fleet of cable laying vessels, the Nexans CLV Aurora, Nexans C/S Skagerrak, and Nexans CLV Electra, and we are pleased to be working with Crowley on developing the capability to lay nearshore subsea cable in the U.S.”

Greenwood Capital announced three additional employee owners to the firm. Claud W. (Will) Bond, IV, John W. Cooper, and Dr. Mark K. Pyles all recently joined the ranks of employee ownership.

“With 40 percent of our employees now holding ownership in Greenwood Capital, we’re especially proud to welcome Will Bond, John Cooper, and Mark Pyles, Ph.D. as partners in the future of our firm,” said Walter B. Todd III, president and CIO of Greenwood Capital.

“They bring exceptional dedication and unique insight to our leadership team. Their ownership not only reflects their commitment to Greenwood Capital but also ensures our clients and community benefit from leaders who are invested, both personally and professionally, in the success of those we serve.”

Bond, senior trading manager, has been a crucial part of the firm’s trading and operational systems for the past 23 years, since joining as the first trader hired in 2002. His expertise and commitment to excellence have been instrumental in enhancing trading systems, supporting portfolio managers, and reinforcing Greenwood Capital’s reputation for best-in-class execution and client service.

As senior private client adviser, Cooper’s work revolves around helping clients develop a complete view of their financial picture. He first joined Greenwood Capital in 2016 and has more than 20 years of credentialed experience in the financial industry.

Pyles is the most recent addition to Greenwood Capital’s Investment Committee. He first started working with Greenwood Capital in 2022 after an 18-year career in academics at the College of Charleston. Pyles oversees multiple investment strategies while providing analysis on portfolios, performance, securities, and risk management.

In addition to the new principals, three current owners expanded their share: Brian L. Disher, director of wealth management; John D. Wiseman, director of fixed income; and Denise H.

The Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE) is hitting the road to Myrtle Beach next week for the third stop on its nationwide BridgeUSA Celebration Tour, spotlighting how international exchange programs powered by the U.S. Department of State are making America safer through diplomacy, stronger through global collaboration, and more prosperous through innovation and shared opportunity.

The BridgeUSA Summer Work Travel program brings international college students to live and work in the United States during their summer break, helping more than 4,000 businesses, large and small, across the United States expand and extend the tourist season, leading to enhanced local economic benefits while injecting more than $1.2 billion into the broader U.S. economy each year.

In South Carolina, the CIEE BridgeUSA Celebration Tour will recognize and celebrate the community and business leaders of Myrtle Beach whose support makes the BridgeUSA Summer Work Travel program possible.

The tour will also celebrate the BridgeUSA Summer Work Travel participants at the 11th Annual Ambassador Johnny and Angie Young Civic Leadership Summit.

“BridgeUSA provides a significant economic and cultural benefit to hundreds of communities across the United States,” said Martine Mangion, senior vice president, Inbound Exchange Programs at CIEE. “Many seasonal businesses rely on BridgeUSA Summer Work Travel participants to enhance and extend their tourist season. In fact, some of our hosts are able to stay open an additional 30-45 days longer than they would have without BridgeUSA participants.”

“The BridgeUSA program is integral to our business success and community impact,” said Garrett Watts, chief operations officer of Lazarus Entertainment Group, an American company that operates amusement parks and attractions in the Myrtle Beach area. “We proudly welcome international participants who bring diverse perspectives and cultural insights that strengthen our workplace. This initiative creates meaningful opportunities for professional development and cross-cultural exchange, benefiting both the participants and our organization.”

Iconic Equities, a real estate investment and development firm focused on industrial assets, announced two significant achievements at Jedburg Logistics Park, marking major milestones for the company's inaugural development project.

The firm completed two transactions at the park, which comprises two Class-A industrial buildings totaling 780,000 square feet on 115 acres at 239 Jedburg Road in Summerville, South Carolina.

Iconic’s first deal at Jedburg Logistics Park was the sale of Building Two, a 158,340-square-foot facility that was fully leased to Amazon, to Clarion Partners. The second was a long-term lease agreement with Harbor Logistics for the entire 621,000-square-foot Building One, bringing the two-building park to 100 percent occupancy.

“Jedburg Logistics Park was Iconic's first development, and we are proud to have achieved these significant milestones over the 24 months we’ve been involved in the property,” said Tim Bishop, Founder and CEO of Iconic Equities.

“The two deals reflect the region's logistics strength and continued institutional demand for mission-critical last-mile assets in the Southeast. We remain focused on identifying and developing strategically located industrial assets in high-growth markets throughout the region.”

Iconic developed the park in partnership with Trinity Capital Advisors and Hartford Investment Management Company (HIMCO). Jedburg Logistics Park's success reflects the emergence of the Charleston market as one of the Southeast's premier industrial hubs. The facility offers direct access to Charleston International Airport and major regional manufacturers, while benefiting from the area's skilled workforce, low operating costs, and business-friendly regulatory environment.

In just over four years, Iconic has had 13 acquisitions, six exits, and seven institutional capital partners. On the development front, Iconic’s current pipeline continues to grow in the Southeast, with infill sites under contract in Charlotte, Savannah, and Jacksonville. In addition, Iconic recently completed a land closing near the Jacksonville airport, which was institutionally capitalized and recently signed its first pre-lease.

The Jedburg transactions were facilitated by JLL Capital Markets, with Kevin Coats representing the development partnership in the Harbor Logistics lease and Lee Allen representing the tenant.

The Environmental Protection Agency released a proposal last week to rescind its 2009 endangerment finding, which underpins the agency’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. As part of the justification for the move, the Department of Energy released a report on the climate impacts of greenhouse gas emissions that concludes the warming induced by carbon dioxide “appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and that aggressive mitigation strategies may be misdirected.” DOE Secretary Chris Wright tapped five scientists known to be skeptical of climate change impact assessments to produce the report, which criticizes aspects of global climate models and notes some positive effects of elevated carbon dioxide concentrations.

The EPA will hold a virtual public hearing Aug. 19 and 20 to receive comment on the proposal, while DOE issued a request for comment on the report that closes Sept. 2. “Speaking from the perspective of individuals who have commented on the IPCC and NCA reports only to see our comments ignored, we plan to take a different approach,” wrote Judith Curry, one of the DOE report authors, in a blog post. “Rather than primarily seeking to defend our report, we regard the open comments as an opportunity for dialogue, learning, and clarification of areas of disagreement,” she added. Curry wrote that she hopes for the “redirection of climate science… away from alarmism and advocacy and towards better understanding of the fundamentals of climate dynamics.”

Various scientists whose work is cited in the report have said it uses their research in a misleading way. One such scientist, Zeke Hausfather, wrote that the report “cherrypicks figures and parts of studies to support a preconceived narrative that minimizes the risk of climate change.” Mainstream climate scientists are now mulling ways to offer a coordinated rebuttal to the report.

Turmoil continues over university grant cancellations

The University of California, Los Angeles was cut off from funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health last week after the Justice Department concluded that the university had violated civil rights law in its “deliberately indifferent” response to students’ claims of antisemitism. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk protested the decision, stating the university has taken various actions against antisemitism and that “this far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination.”

Other universities hit with similar cuts have begun to strike deals with the White House to have research funding restored: Columbia University agreed to pay a $200 million fine to the federal government over three years while Brown University agreed to pay $50 million over ten years to workforce development organizations in Rhode Island. Both agreements also include restrictions on diversity and inclusion initiatives, among other provisions. Meanwhile, other universities such as Harvard and Northwestern have announced layoffs that are related to the funding cuts and other financial pressures, and the Massachusetts governor is proposing to allocate $400 million to offset cuts at universities in the state and at Boston hospitals.

The outlook for grant funding remains uncertain even for NIH grants that have already been judicially ordered to be restored. Some scientists whose grants were included on the list for reinstatements said they have not received the funding as of July. Meanwhile, five higher education associations asked NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya last week to restore not just the approximately 900 grants subject to the court rulings but all grants “terminated pursuant to the same directives, using the same process, and according to the same termination rationale,” which total more than 2,000.

Congress faces backlog of work after recess

The House and Senate will face a daunting slate of work when they return from summer recess in early September. Neither chamber has completed work on appropriations legislation for fiscal year 2026, which begins in October, and they still need to reconcile wide differences in their proposed allocations. Although both chambers have disagreed with the depth of cuts proposed by the Trump administration, the House has still proposed significant cuts to several science agencies, such as the National Science Foundation and NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. The Senate has mostly proposed small increases or marginal cuts to science agencies, though it has yet to release its proposals for the Department of Energy due to a push for cuts by the Senate’s top appropriator for DOE.

The Senate also still has a long list of presidential nominees to work through, a process that Democrats have slowed to a crawl by stretching out debate on each nominee. Senators were unable to reach a deal to accelerate nomination votes before departing Washington last week, and Republicans are now vowing to change the rules by simple majority vote when they return. Among the science agency nominations awaiting votes include those for DOE’s top science role, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration and its deputies, and the director of the U.S. Geological Survey.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has yet to make nominations for several key science posts, including the head of the DOE Office of Science, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation, whose director resigned in April. Trump also has not yet nominated a NASA administrator after withdrawing his earlier pick of Jared Isaacman, instead having the secretary of transportation fill the role on an acting basis.

Shannon Osaka and Naema Ahmed report for The Washington Post.

In short:

China’s EV subsidies, worth an estimated $231 billion since 2010, helped the country move 6.4 million electric cars last year, five times U.S. sales.

Beijing now controls about 85% of global lithium-ion battery production capacity and roughly 80% of the solar-panel supply chain.

“The Chinese have just cleaned our clock by having consistent policy.”

— David Kirsch, professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland

Why this matters:

Electric cars, advanced batteries, and cheap solar panels sit at the heart of any realistic plan to blunt climate change, yet the United States — where each technology was first proved — now relies on imports for them. Heavy dependence on Chinese supply chains increases geopolitical risk and exposes consumers to price shocks if trade tensions flare. It also concentrates the health and environmental burdens of mining, smelting, and manufacturing in provinces with laxer pollution controls, exporting airborne pollutants and water contamination along with finished goods. Meanwhile, domestic workers miss out on rapidly growing clean-energy jobs, and regulators have less leverage to enforce labor and safety standards abroad.

A statement issued for the Grain Belt Express expressed disappointment, calling the new transmission line “America’s largest power pipeline.” Construction has been set to start next year.","TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — The Trump administration has canceled a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee for a new high-voltage transmission line for delivering solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to the eastern U.S., but the company indicated that project would go forward anyway.

The U.S. Department of Energy declared that it is “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of Chicago-based Invenergy’s planned Grain Belt Express. The department also questioned whether the $11 billion project could meet the financial conditions required for a loan guarantee.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. The Department of Energy also said Wednesday that the conditional commitment to Invenergy in November was among billions of dollars’ worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” by former President Joe Biden’s administration after Biden lost the election.

Two prominent Missouri Republicans, U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley and state Attorney General Andrew Bailey, have been vocal critics of the project, describing it as a threat to farmland and landowners’ property rights. Hawley said on July 10 that he had secured a pledge from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to cancel the loan guarantee in a conversation with him and Trump.

“To ensure more responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources, DOE has terminated its conditional commitment,” the agency said in a statement.

A federal loan guarantee generally makes borrowing money less costly. A statement issued for the Grain Belt Express expressed disappointment, calling the new transmission line “America’s largest power pipeline.” Construction has been set to start next year.

The statement added: “A privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings, strengthening grid reliability and resiliency, and creating thousands of American jobs.”

Invenergy has said its project would create 4,000 jobs and new efficiencies in delivering power, and that it would save consumers $52 billion over 15 years. The line would deliver electricity from western Kansas about 800 miles (1,287 kilometers), across Missouri and Illinois and into Indiana, connecting there to the power grid for the eastern U.S. It could deliver up to 5,000 megawatts of electricity.

“When electricity demand and consumer power bills are soaring, it’s hard to imagine a more backward move,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a nonpartisan, Washington-based group supporting renewable energy.

The decision to cancel the loan guarantee came the same day Trump unveiled a plan for U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence that includes speeding up the permitting of new data centers and factories that will boost the demand for electricity.

“This gross mismanagement of our country’s energy needs will increase power bills for hundreds of millions of people while making the electricity grid less reliable,” said Laurie Williams, director of a campaign against fossil fuels for the Sierra Club environmental group.

Jigar Shah, who headed the Department of Energy office handling loan guarantees under Biden, said that if an applicant meets the requirements of a conditional commitment, the department is obligated to follow through.

“This decision is illegal,” he said in a post on the LinkedIn social media platform.

Hawley and Bailey have called the Grain Belt Express a “scam.” Critics object to what Hawley labels an “elitist land grab,” the company’s ability to use lawsuits against individual landowners along the line’s route to compel them to sell their property.

Online court records show that the company filed dozens of such lawsuits in Missouri circuit courts in recent years. The Missouri Farm Bureau’s president posted on the social platform X Wednesday that the project threatened to “sacrifice rural America in the name of progress.”

“We’ve won a major battle in the war for Missouri’s private property rights and farmers,” Bailey said. “At our urging, the DOE saw this boondoggle for what it was.”",https://s47626.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/OPED-CALIF-POWER-PRICES-EDITORIAL-GET.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 16:08:36.280403

During the election campaign President Trump expressed a strong interest for a complete repeal of the IRA credit provisions. Many pundits expressed their belief that any changes to the IRA would be more reflective of a scalpel than a sledgehammer. The final legislation lands somewhere in between, but with a preference for those technologies that can provide continuous power (e.g., nuclear and geothermal) over the intermittent power technologies (e.g., wind and solar).

Below are some of the key changes applicable to renewable energy investors and developers made in the OBBBA:

Wind and Solar

Wind and solar projects under Code Sections 45Y and 48E were particularly impacted by the OBBBA. Such projects must be placed in service by December 31, 2027, in order to remain eligible for the production or investment tax credits. A safe harbor is available for wind and solar projects that “begin construction” on or before July 4, 2026, however.

Notably, an Executive Order was issued on July 7, 2025, directing the Department of the Treasury to, within 45 days following the enactment of the OBBBA, “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.” Such action includes issuing guidance relating to the “beginning of construction” standard to limit the existing safe harbors with respect to the beginning of construction. Such guidance may not be in line with previously issued notices and may make the requirements for the beginning of construction much stricter.

Other Technology Neutral Clean Energy Credits

The technology neutral credits received a slightly shortened timeline for new clean energy projects, with the credit eligibility phaseout beginning after 2032 (other than for wind and solar).

Certain domestic content requirements for clean energy facilities were introduced in the OBBBA, raising the domestic content minimums from 40% to 45% for projects beginning construction after June 12, 2025, and incrementally thereafter up to 55% starting in 2027.

Carbon Sequestration

The credit for the sequestration of carbon oxides received a surprising benefit in bringing long sought after parity within the 45Q credit. As a result of the OBBBA, the $85 per metric ton credit ($180 for direct air capture) previously only available for carbon oxides permanently sequestered, and not used in enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects, will also apply to projects placed in service after July 4, 2025, that (i) use the permanently sequestered carbon oxides in EOR projects or (ii) utilize carbon oxides in other permitted forms. This represents an increase from the prior $60 per ton credit for such uses.

Clean Transportation Fuel Production

Code Sections 45Z and 40A (relating to small agri-biodiesel producers) received a much-needed extension, permitting such fuel producers to receive credits for sales taking place on or prior to December 31, 2026, in the case of small agri-biodiesel producers and December 31, 2029, for transportation fuel producers. The credit is limited, however, to fuels produced from feedstocks derived in the US, Canada, and Mexico.

Limitation of Covered Nation Influence

The OBBBA takes a strong stance against the ownership, control, and influence of clean energy projects by North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran. Specifically, tax credits will be prohibited for “specified foreign entities” and “foreign-influenced entities,” such as entities owned or controlled by foreign entities of concern, terroristic organizations, and entities controlled by governments, agencies, or citizens of North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran. The application of these limitations are phased in differently among the credits.

The production tax credit and investment tax credit are saddled with a limitation on components used to construct facilities and equipment in addition to the domestic content rules. Such facilities will be subject to increasing limitations with respect to materials acquired from specified foreign entities, with more stringent limits applied to energy storage. This “material assistance” limitation provides for a safe harbor for facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2026.

Additionally, no longer will transfers of tax credits to specified foreign entities be permitted under Code Section 6418.

The Executive Order issued on July 7, 2025, also directed the Department of the Treasury to, within 45 days following the enactment of the OBBBA, “take prompt action” to implement the “Foreign Entity of Concern” restrictions in the OBBBA.

10 stocks we like better than NextEra Energy ›

Energy demand is growing briskly, and that bodes well for the companies producing the hydrocarbons we need today and those delivering the cleaner energy we'll need tomorrow. These energy companies should generate strong returns for investors as a result.

TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE), NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) stand out to a few Fool.com contributing analysts as great buys in the energy sector. Here's why they're such attractive investments this August.

TotalEnergies is prepared for the clean energy transition

Reuben Gregg Brewer (TotalEnergies): The integrated energy model that's being used by TotalEnergies stands out from its closest peers in a very important way. Most energy giants focus on owning assets that span from the upstream (production) through the midstream (pipelines) and on to the downstream (chemicals and refining). That's great, and it provides a way for investors to get energy exposure while softening the impact of volatile commodity prices.

TotalEnergies adds electricity to the mix, with a collection of renewable power and electric generation assets. Although BP and Shell both professed to have similar ambitions in 2020, they have since walked back their plans on the electricity front. TotalEnergies, by contrast, has increased its focus on the space. And, notably, BP and Shell cut their dividends when they announced their clean energy shifts while TotalEnergies didn't cut, specifically stating that it recognized how important the dividend is to investors.

So, in the end, BP and Shell investors were really just left with a dividend cut. TotalEnergies investors got dividend increases and the diversification benefit of the energy company's shift into electricity and clean energy. The really big benefit here, however, is long-term in nature. As peers focus on oil while the world slowly shifts toward renewable power, TotalEnergies is preparing today for the future. Add in a lofty 6.4% dividend yield (U.S. investors have to pay French taxes and fees on the income they collect), and Total Energies is a great long-term option in the energy patch.

Powerful growth drivers

Matt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy is growing quickly, especially for a utility. Adjusted earnings per share rose 9.4% in the second quarter, powered by growth in its Florida electric utility and energy resources segment. The latter business continues to benefit from strong demand for renewable energy. NextEra's energy resource segment ended the first quarter with nearly 30 gigawatts of renewable projects in backlog, compared with 38 GW of operating assets.

Building on this momentum, the company expects to keep growing in the coming years. NextEra projects its adjusted earnings per share will rise 6% to 8% annually through 2027. CEO John Ketchum said he would ""be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each year through 2027, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings."" NextEra also expects about 10% annual dividend growth through at least next year.

NextEra Energy should keep growing at a healthy rate well beyond that. Analysts expect U.S. power demand to surge in the coming decades, driven by the growth of AI data centers, electrification, and the onshoring of manufacturing. This will require far more renewable energy capacity. As a renewable-energy leader, NextEra Energy should benefit from this sector's surging demand.

Given these strong growth prospects and its attractive dividend yield of more than 3%, NextEra stands out as a compelling long-term investment. With its share price having dropped nearly 10% since the company reported second-quarter earnings last month, it's a great buy this August.

A top-notch energy dividend stock

Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Renewable): The Trump administration's shift away from renewables won't stop the global energy transition. Global renewable electricity generation is projected to grow by nearly 90% between 2023 and 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. The BloombergNEF's new energy outlook 2025, meanwhile, projects renewable generation to grow by 84% between 2025 and 2030, and then double by 2050.

Buying a top-notch renewable energy stock like Brookfield Renewable could therefore be one of your smartest investing moves now. That's because Brookfield Renewable not only generates over 40% cash flows from markets outside North America but is also one of the most diversified renewable energy plays, with operations across hydropower, wind, solar, and distributed energy and storage.

Brookfield Renewable just signed a first-of-its-kind hydro power agreement with tech giant Google to deliver up to 3,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power in the U.S. This deal comes on the back of yet another solid quarter, with Brookfield Renewable generating record funds from operations (FFO) in its second quarter, up 10% year over year.

With an ever-growing pipeline and a projected boom in demand for electricity driven by data centers, Brookfield Renewable is in the sweet spot and expects to grow its annual FFO per unit by over 10% in the long term. With Brookfield Renewable also targeting 5% to 9% annual dividend growth and its corporate shares yielding 4%, this energy stock is also among the top 10 dividend stocks to double up on now.

The EPA’s Research Triangle Park campus is home to seven different offices under the EPA, including the Office of Research and Development.
Earlier this year, Reps. Foushee and Ross released a joint statement as Ranking Members of House Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittees alongside House Science, Space, and Technology Ranking Member Zoe Lofgren (CA-18) denouncing the Trump Administration’s plan to cut as many as 1,155 scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD).
On March 28th, the members led a letter sent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency demanding the immediate reversal of plans to cut the EPA's Office of Research and Development following reports that the Trump Administration was considering firing 75 percent of the Office of Research and Development’s (ORD) staff.
The FY26 Interior Senate report notes, “EPA has a long and proud tradition of being one of the world’s leading environmental and human health research organizations.","WASHINGTON, DC (August 4, 2025) – Today, Congresswoman Valerie Foushee (NC-04) and Congresswoman Deborah Ross (NC-02) sent a letter to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin warning of the immediate and long-term effects that closing the EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) will have on communities and ecosystems across the nation, and urged for the immediate reversal of all such plans.

In the letter, the members assert the importance of the work being done at the EPA’s Office of Research and Development, writing, “The Office of Research and Development, as listed on your agency’s website, “conducts the research for EPA that provides the foundation for credible decision-making to safeguard human health and ecosystems from environmental pollutants.” For over 50 years, ORD has conducted critical research that saves lives—including studying the health impacts of wildfire smoke inhalation, development of detection methods and toxicity assessments for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), improvement of water treatment technologies to ensure our communities have access to water free of lead contamination, and so much more.”

The members noted, “Americans across the political spectrum care about clean air, clean water, and the health of their children and loved ones. Americans care about their environment, whether it’s their back yard or their favorite national park. ORD’s work is not partisan. On July 24th, in a 26-2 bipartisan vote, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a Fiscal Year 2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill that would require EPA to maintain ORD.”

In closing the letter, the Members urged an immediate reversal of plans to close ORD “Again, we strongly urge you to reverse your decision to eliminate ORD. This disastrous decision is unwanted and unwarranted, and its consequences would be dire for our constituents and for communities across the country.”

The Research Triangle is home to the EPA’s Research Triangle Park campus, the largest in the country, where more than 2,000 full-time federal employees are at the forefront of the EPA’s critical work to ensure proper research and regulations are in place to deliver clean air, water, and land for all Americans. The EPA’s Research Triangle Park campus is home to seven different offices under the EPA, including the Office of Research and Development.

On July 17th, Rep. Foushee announced publicly that her office had received confirmation that the lease for the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment (CPHEA), an EPA air pollution lab in Chapel Hill within the Office of Research and Development, was not renewed. According to the EPA, the Chapel Hill lab was, “an important driver of scientific knowledge about the human health effects of environmental exposures and the impact of environmental actions and decisions on public health.”

Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump.
In December Delaware Chancellor Kathleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk’s multibillion-dollar pay package.
She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.
The rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk’s 2018 compensation package.","Tesla gave Elon Musk a stock grant of $29 billion on Monday as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented” growth despite a recent foray into right-wing politics that has hurt its sales, profits and its stock price.

In giving its billionaire CEO 96 million in restricted shares, the electric car company noted that Musk hasn’t been paid in years because his 2018 compensation package has been rejected by a Delaware court. The award comes eight months after a judge revoked the 2018 pay package a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling.

Tesla on Monday called the grant a “first step, good faith” way of retaining Musk and keeping him focused, citing his leadership of SpaceX, xAI and other companies. Musk said recently that he needed more shares and control so he couldn’t be ousted by shareholder activists.

“Rewarding Elon for what he has done and continues to do for Tesla is the right thing to do,” the company said in a regulatory filing, citing an increase of $735 billion in Tesla’s value on the stock market since 2018.

Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. But Tesla also faces intensifying competition from both the big Detroit automakers, and from China.

In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company fell short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.

The electric vehicle maker said in the regulatory filing that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package.

In December Delaware Chancellor Kathleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk’s multibillion-dollar pay package. She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.

The rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk’s 2018 compensation package.

That pay package carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla’s stock price.

Musk appealed the order in March. A month later Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it was creating a special committee to look at Musk’s compensation as CEO.

Musk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives feels Musk’s stock award may alleviate some Tesla shareholder concerns.

“We believe this grant will now keep Musk as CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 and removes an overhang on the stock,” Ives wrote in a client note. “Musk remains Tesla’s big asset and this comp issue has been a constant concern of shareholders once the Delaware soap opera began.”

Under pressure from shareholders last month, Tesla scheduled an annual shareholders meeting for November to comply with Texas state law.

A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders, which have watched Tesla shares plummet, said in a letter to the company that it needed to at least provide public notice of the annual meeting.

Tesla’s stock rose nearly 2% in midday trading.

EV drivers prefer chargers nearest to them. | Shutterstock

When asked which features make electric vehicle (EV) charging sites more appealing than others, almost a third (32%) of drivers said they would favor the chargers nearest to them, according to a survey of 1,000 U.S. EV owners commissioned by Konect, Gilbarco Veeder-Root’s EV Charging offering, which is operated by Vontier, based in Greensboro, North Carolina.

EV drivers also don’t expect to wait when they arrive. Thirty-six percent said they avoid locations with unreliable chargers, while 29% prefer to have more than one charger on site.

Detours of between 10 and 20 minutes are a dealbreaker for 21% of drivers, while almost twice as many (37%) won’t go more than 20 minutes off track to plug in, and they’re willing to pay for that convenience. Most respondents (93%) would accept higher charging costs to avoid a 20-minute detour, with an average price premium of 63%.

Survey respondents also prioritize convenience and sites with multiple chargers available.

At charging stations, WiFi is the most desirable feature, with 36% of consumers ranking it first. Next, consumers prefer clean restrooms (30%), loyalty perks (28%) and food and drink options (27%).

Charging station, port growth

The U.S. EV fast charging network is expanding, with newly opened U.S. charging ports surging by 23.3% in second-quarter 2025, according to Paren, an EV data and insights company based in San Francisco. As drivers prioritize convenience and added amenities, convenience-store and fuel site owners must consider these shifts to stay competitive in the evolving market.

While new EV station openings in the United States increased by 6.2% in second-quarter 2025, the rise in charging ports—where an EV can plug in—reflects a trend of major charge point operators building or expanding stations with eight to 12 or more ports, according to Paren. This means that at charging stations, the number of ports per charger is growing.

The total number of stations in the United States reached 11,687 in the second quarter, and ports climbed to 59,694, the data showed.

Fast charging ports in the United States are forecasted to grow by 19% year-over-year in second-quarter 2025, with 16,700 new fast charging ports expected despite regulatory and market challenges, Paren said.

That’s three times the number added in 2021, increasing the total direct current (DC) fast charging ports to 245%, according to Paren. DC fast charging delivers power straight to an EV’s battery, bypassing the vehicle’s onboard converter, allowing for much faster charging compared to AC (alternating current) options.

At this growth rate, the United States could surpass 100,000 fast charging ports by 2027, according to Paren, though meeting long-term EV adoption goals will also require addressing infrastructure gaps in rural areas and congestion in urban ones, Paren said.

Most new ports are being driven by private investment, with the NEVI (National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure) program accounting for only a small portion, Paren said.

Consumer preferences

Eighteen percent of consumers have a positive attitude toward battery electric vehicles (BEVs), up from 16% the previous year, according to a survey of 1,203 American adults nationwide by the Transportation Energy Institute (TEI) in partnership with the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), both based in Alexandria, Virginia.

Positive sentiment was strongest among younger adults (18–49), urban residents, college graduates, high-income earners and commuters, according to the survey. Among those who elaborated on their positive views, the top reasons cited were environmental benefits, financial advantages and advanced vehicle technology.

Older adults, rural residents and those in the Midwest made up much of the 15% of survey respondents with a negative attitude toward electric vehicles, the survey found. The most common concerns were about charging infrastructure and convenience. Financial issues were the second most cited reason, followed by skepticism about environmental claims and battery disposal.

Nearly one-third (31%) of consumers reported a more positive attitude toward BEVs this year, with the biggest shifts among younger adults (45%) and higher-income earners (49%). In contrast, more negative shifts were seen among older adults (25%), Midwestern residents (28%), and those with a high school education or less (25%).

Consumers significantly overestimate EV adoption, TEI said, believing 28% of vehicles sold in 2024 were BEVs, when the actual figure was just 7.79%. Visibility of EVs varies by demographics, with younger, higher-income, urban and Western U.S. residents seeing them most, while older adults, rural residents and those with lower incomes see them least.

The “Endangerment Finding” published by former President Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency found that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane and others threaten human life because they accelerate climate change. The EPA relied on the “endangerment finding” to install stringent regulations on a variety of industries, including auto, air travel and energy, that business leaders said threatened the viability of their companies.

Notably, the endangerment finding was part of the basis of the Biden administration’s so-called electric vehicle mandate which would have required over half of all cars sold to be EVs by 2032.

Zeldin announced that he was repealing the “holy grail of the climate change religion” during a speech at an Indianapolis auto dealership in July. He hailed the announcement as the “largest deregulatory announcement in US history,” and said he was ending over a decade of uncertainty for American automakers and consumers.

Zeldin told CNN Sunday that when the rule was passed, the administrators relied on optimistic and pessimistic predictions surrounding the future effects of climate change, and that the pessimistic predictions did not pan out. He said that his decision was relying on “2025 facts rather than 2009 bad assumptions.” He also said the endangerment finding went beyond the EPA’s legal scope, by “filling in gaps” in the law and essentially legislating itself.

He said the agency couldn’t bend the law to meet its own goals, and that issues surrounding regulating “mobile sources” of pollution like cars would need to be handled by Congress. He accused the Obama-era bureaucrats of engaging in “mental leaps” in order to justify the endangerment finding.

“I’m not going to get creative with the law, we’re going to read the plain language and if section 202 of the Clean Air Act gets amended by Congress, then we’ll follow that new law,” Zeldin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Section 202 of the Clean Energy Act allows the EPA to regulate motor vehicles. Zeldin alleged that the endangerment finding went beyond the agency’s mandate to regulate vehicles as stipulated by the law. He accused the Biden administration of using the endangerment finding as an attempt to regulate the coal industry out of existence. When pressed by CNN host Kassie Hunt why he didn’t just leave the finding in place, Zeldin said he doesn’t get to “make up the law.”

“The power comes from the law, I don’t just get to make up the law… in order to make America the A.I. capital of the world, in order to unleash energy dominance, to protect jobs, to bring down energy costs, we are not going to regulate out of existence entire sectors of our economy,” Zeldin said.

Across the city, many homeowners, renters, and businesses are seeing significant increases in their electricity bills. As Duke Energy shared in their most recent customer notice, energy prices are going up primarily due to two interconnected factors: rising capacity costs and wholesale electricity costs. Capacity costs are the fees utility companies pay to ensure enough energy is available for all customers during high-demand periods, especially during extreme heat or extreme cold. In the most recent capacity auction, prices increased by over 350%, marking the sharpest spike in recent years. In addition, wholesale electricity costs continue to climb. Both of these increases can be attributed to rising inflation, the increasing cost of fuel and maintenance at power plants, and expanding demand from large electricity users, like data centers.

The Office of Environment & Sustainability remains committed to building a long-term clean energy future that supports both affordability and sustainability as a part of the 2023 Green Cincinnati Plan (GCP).

The City of Cincinnati has various initiatives to support residents during this time:

Electric Aggregation Program & Energy Choice

Cincinnati’s Electric Aggregation Program offers residents a stable, vetted alternative to Duke Energy’s standard electricity pricing. While current market trends have led to higher rates across all providers, the City continues to monitor the market closely and advocate for fair, competitive energy prices for our residents. Learn more about the City’s Electric Aggregation Program here. If the City’s Aggregation Program does not meet your needs, residents can explore and compare rates to find the best fit. For more information about Energy Choice Ohio, check out this video or go directly to the Energy Choice Ohio Site.

WarmUp Cincy

WarmUp Cincy exists to increase household savings, safety, health, and comfort for the residents most vulnerable to high energy costs, including low-income residents, communities of color, and renters by incentivizing upgrades and energy use behavior change. Check out our WarmUp Cincy page to learn more about current program offerings and partners.

Electrify Cincy

Electrify Cincy is a community education effort that supports Cincinnatians to accelerate home and business electrification to help create more stable, comfortable, and healthy lives. The primary focus of the effort is educating building owners to prepare buildings through weatherization and to make the transition household appliances that provide heating, cooling, cooking, and more powered by electricity from increasingly renewable sources. Visit the Electrify Cincy site to learn more.

Going Solar Guide

Transitioning to solar energy is one way that the City of Cincinnati and its residents can help reduce the region’s reliance on fossil fuels and save money in the long-run on energy costs. Check out the Solar Landing Page for information about costs, installation, permits, contractors, and more.

Cooling /Warming Centers

When an extreme heat or cold advisory is issued, all Cincinnati Recreation Centers are open during normal hours to be used as warming or cooling centers. You can find all Cincinnati Recreation Centers here with their hours of operation. Residents are also encouraged to check out a local library branch for access to cooling or heating when needed for health and safety.

Energy Efficiency for Landlords and Property Owners

Keeping up maintenance on rental properties is the easiest way to help landlords and their tenants keep their energy bills low.

Make sure outdoor air conditioner units are free from overgrown grass and debris

Ensure vents are open and unobstructed to allow cool air to circulate

Adjust ductwork to allow for maximum airflow

Schedule maintenance checks for HVAC systems to replace air filters, make sure the system is cleaned and calibrated, and check that humidifiers or dehumidifiers are working properly

And share education resources with tenants to help them understand how to conserve energy!

Energy Efficiency Upgrades

If you want to make some energy efficiency upgrades to your space, consider upgrades that give you the most bang for your buck like insulation and air sealing, or ductwork repair. When switching to a new appliance, make sure it is Energy Star certified so you know you are getting the most efficient models.

What about tax credits and incentives?

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" passed by a Republican-led Congress and signed into law by President Trump, eliminates popular federal home energy tax credits years earlier than planned. But there is still limited time to act before the new deadlines! Rewiring America has a great guide to walk residents through what credits are available and for how long. Businesses interested in upgrades can apply for Ohio PACE financing to support bringing their energy efficiency projects to life.

By removing active cooling, fans, pumps and other moving parts, Peak Energy claims its 3.5 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) eliminates over 85% of the root causes behind historical BESS failures, dramatically reducing lifetime costs. According to Peak, this approach allows the battery to operate across a wide range of temperatures without requiring auxiliary systems, which are typically used to prevent overheating in lithium-ion systems.

Performance testing by Peak indicated the system could reduce auxiliary power use by up to 90%, saving approximately $1 million annually per gigawatt-hour installed compared to lithium iron phosphate (LFP) systems and cutting battery degradation by 33% over a 20-year period.

The company further notes that recent federal policy changes have elevated the urgency to develop domestic energy supply chains, adding that sodium-ion batteries do not require critical minerals like lithium, cobalt or nickel. The U.S. holds the world’s largest reserves of soda ash, a key ingredient for sodium-ion cells, and the company claims its supply chain can be sourced entirely from domestic or allied nations.

Peak said it is currently developing its first U.S. cell factory, which is expected to begin production in 2026

“We see energy storage not only as an economic imperative, but also as a national security priority. Time is of the essence if the U.S. wants to take ownership and maintain control of its energy future,” said Landon Mossburg, CEO and Co-Founder at Peak Energy.

The company’s pilot system is the first step in commercializing its technology. Peak plans to deploy “several hundred megawatt-hours” of sodium-ion storage over the next two years, with contracts under negotiation with IPPs and hyperscale data center operators.

The development of utility-scale solar power plants is a costly and complex undertaking that requires extensive expertise to avoid pitfalls. Most solar project developers rely on debt financing to fund their projects, and when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases, leading to higher project expenditures. Given the high cost of capital and the fact that O&M costs for renewable power plants are considerable, it is critical that developers, owners, and operators seek out project savings wherever possible.

One often overlooked area to optimize efficiencies is the solar cable management sector. The traditional “bundled” way in which solar cabling has been designed, procured, and installed has greatly lacked improvement over the years.

Affordable Wire Management (AWM), a leading provider of solar cable management systems (CMS), is pioneering a new approach. Leveraging a combination of software, utility-scale expertise, and engineering skills, they have developed a completely new approach that is changing the entire electrical Balance of Systems (eBOS) sector.

Located just north of St. Louis, the project is jointly owned by EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA) and Volt Energy Utility as part of their partnership with Microsoft to integrate social equity into the U.S. Energy Transition.

Once operational, it will cover more than 1,000 acres with bifacial tracking solar photovoltaic panels, generating enough clean energy to power nearly 28,000 homes in Illinois. The solar array will significantly lower electricity costs for local communities, support the Illinois electricity grid, and save 139 million gallons of water each year.

AWM was initially brought into the Hickory Solar Park project by the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) lead McCarthy, which suggested AWM after partnering with the company on two previous projects, Sun Mountain and Bright Arrow. McCarthy understood that AWM’s offerings, engineered to withstand heavy ice and snow loads, were ideal for the Midwestern-based project. Additionally, AWM had an excellent track record of working on utility-scale solar projects in Canada and other U.S. states prone to extreme weather, such as Washington, Oregon, and Montana.

AWM collaborated with two other partners, Stellavise Solar Engineering and Voltage, on the Hickory Solar Park project. Stellavise, founded in 2014, focuses on the utility-scale solar and storage industry and is the engineer-of-record (EOR). Voltage, the eBOS partner, provides balance-of-system solutions and services across a broad spectrum of the renewable energy sector. Voltage’s LYNX trunk bus system, an eBOS cable system, was selected for the project.

Although AWM’s offerings were chosen for their durability and reliability, AWM was selected as the CMS vendor for more strategic reasons. In fact, thanks to AWM’s holistic CMS and an innovative approach, its role in the project became quite pivotal.

AWM’s Groundbreaking Ampacity Optimization Analysis

AWM’s Ampacity Optimization Analysis, a proprietary analysis protocol which they developed in 2022, was the driver that led to substantial system-wide improvements. Thanks to AWM’s accurate assessment of cabling and ampacity, the Hickory Solar Park project was able to optimize the cable arrangements, which in turn led to design improvements and lower costs.

Originally, the Voltage DC trunk bus cables were specified at 500kcmil, which is typical for utility-scale solar projects of this size. However, when AWM created a project-specific cable arrangement, they found that the trunk bus cables could be reduced from 500kcmil to 350kcmil. The AWM team then validated that arrangement with their ampacity analysis.

Leveraging AWM’s calculations, smaller Voltage trunk bus cables were procured, resulting in a lower LCOE for the project. AWM and Stellavise worked collaboratively, as Brice Casebeer, co-founder and principal engineer for Stellavise, explained.

“With AWM’s guidance, we placed cables in the AWM hangers in accordance with their modeled scenarios, which added considerable cost benefits to the project,” Casebeer said.

Engineering Innovations and Benefits

All the commercial partners, and in turn EDP Renewables North America, the project developer, realized substantial improvements. McCarthy, impressed by AWM’s analysis, commended the team for the value engineering.

“Expert engineering talent is critical and rare in the cable management sector,” noted Casebeer. “AWM’s team is unbeatable in that regard. Not only do they have skilled engineering professionals on their staff, but they also have years of experience in utility-scale solar. Their ability to deliver accurate ampacity calculations gave us the opportunity to place smaller cables in strategic locations. Their offerings truly solve real-world engineering challenges in the solar cable wire management sector.”

The collaboration among AWM, McCarthy, Stellavise, and Voltage was key to the success of the project, demonstrating the power of partnerships and innovation. Hickory Solar Park will set the benchmark for future projects.

Such future tax legislation could provide an opportunity for the HTC and other housing and community development incentives that didn’t make the cut.","Affordable housing and community development won big and clean energy suffered a significant setback when President Donald Trump signed budget reconciliation legislation into law July 4.

The sweeping multitrillion-dollar legislation also drew criticism from many stakeholders for dramatic cuts to Medicaid funding and the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps) totaling more than $1 trillion over a decade, as well as a $100 billion increase through 2029 in funding for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, some funding of which may be targeted to tenants of affordable housing who are undocumented.

In the community development space, however, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)–as the reconciliation bill is titled by Republicans–includes permanent extensions of the new markets tax credit (NMTC) and opportunity zones (OZ) incentive, as well as the expansion of two major low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) provisions.

The OBBBA–which passed with only Republican votes in both the Senate and the House of Representatives–also made harsh cuts to clean energy tax incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, dramatically speeding the phasedown of the renewable energy investment tax credit (ITC), which typically finances solar panels, and production tax credit (PTC), which typically finances wind facilities. It also adds harsh penalties for significant involvement of specific foreign entities.

Here’s a look at the key elements, beginning with the good news.

LIHTC Provisions

After introducing the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act (AHCIA) in six consecutive sessions of Congress, LIHTC advocates got two of the top provisions enacted.

The OBBBA permanently increases 9% allocations for the LIHTC by 12% starting in 2026. That is a slight change from an AHCIA provision that called for a 12.5% increase (mirroring that which was in effect from 2018 to 2021). It will add an estimated $1 billion in LIHTCs equity each year.

The bill also reduces the financed-by threshold for properties financed with private activity bonds (PABs, which generate 4% LIHTCs if used for rental housing) from 50% to 25% of land and building costs for properties placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025, as long as at least 5% of the aggregate land and building costs are financed with PABs issued after Dec. 31, 2025. Acquisition and rehabilitation property can separately qualify, so that the rehabilitation portion placed in service in 2026 or later could qualify for the 25% test even for property acquired in 2025.

Novogradac estimates that the provisions could finance an additional 1.22 million rental homes over 2026-2035 if sufficient gap financing is available to be paired with the additional debt and equity provided by the reconciliation bill.

OZ Provisions

The OBBBA makes the OZ incentive permanent, with some changes to the statute.

The bill calls for new OZs to be designated every 10 years, with the new determination period beginning July 1, 2026, and the first new designations becoming active Jan. 1, 2027.

Under the OBBBA, the definition of low-income community (LIC) is narrowed from 80% to 70% of the area median income (AMI) and contiguous tracts are no longer eligible. Census tracts with a median family income of 125% of the AMI will be ineligible. Governors are still limited to designating 25% of their state’s eligible LICs, so there will be approximately 25% to 30% fewer designated OZ census tracts as compared to the first OZ designations. A special rule that allowed all Puerto Rico LICs to be designated as OZs expires after 2026, meaning that the 25% limit applies to Puerto Rico in 2027.

Capital gains invested in OZ funds can be deferred from paying taxes on a rolling basis for up to five years. In nonrural OZs, there will be 10% step up in basis for investments held at least five years. The legislation also features provisions designed to enhance investment in rural OZs. As long as at least 90% of qualified OZ property of a qualified opportunity fund are in rural OZs, as defined by U.S. Department of Agriculture rural business development programs, the investments in those funds will have a 30% step up in basis for investments held at least five years. The substantial improvement test for existing property in rural OZs is reduced from 100% to 50% of the adjusted basis. The OBBBA includes $15 million for the Internal Revenue Service to implement reporting and transparency requirements.

NMTC Provisions

The legislation makes the NMTC permanent at $5 billion in annual allocation authority (which will generate $1.95 billion in tax credits over seven years)–a major step forward after the incentive has been subject to periodic extensions since it was created 25 years ago.

The bill does not include annual inflation indexing as included for LIHTC, nor the ability to take the NMTC against alternative minimum tax liability, as allowed for both LIHTC and the historic tax credit (HTC). Both of those provisions will be sought in future tax legislation.

Other Notable Provisions

There were some other cross-cutting provisions that apply to multiple community development tax incentives:

The OBBBA makes the 100% bonus depreciation permanent for property acquired and placed in service on or after Jan. 19, 2025, as well as for specified manufacturing plants planted or grafted on or after Jan. 19, 2025. That provision increases attractiveness of tax credit investments, especially for private activity bond-financed rental housing with 4% LIHTC.

The legislation adds back depreciation and amortization to earnings before interest and tax in the calculation of the 30% limit on how much debt can be deducted from corporate tax liability under Internal Revenue Code Section 163(j).

The $750,000 limit on mortgage debt eligible for mortgage interest deductions is made permanent and the ability of mortgage insurance premiums to be deducted (subject to an income phaseout) is also made permanent.

Clean Energy Provisions

Most of the clean energy sector will scramble to adapt to the sudden elimination and rollback of key tax incentives that have been critical to the growth of renewable resources and other clean energy technologies. That growth has exponentially increased since the 2022 enactment of the IRA.

The OBBBA schedules the repeal of the ITC and PTC for solar and wind facilities, with a placed-in-service deadline and a few exceptions. Qualified solar and wind facilities must now be placed in service (PIS) no later than Dec. 31, 2027, unless they begin construction before July 5, 2026. Those facilities will have four years to be PIS. An exception is that energy storage property co-located and PIS at solar and wind facilities is exempt from the 2027 end of the credit and will be able to claim the full extent of the investment incentive until it is phased out after 2032.

The legislation makes the clean energy credits available to all other energy generation technologies that produce less than zero emissions through a phase-out schedule from 2032 to 2036.

Fuel cell property is now eligible to claim a flat 30% credit that is not otherwise eligible for any other bonus adjustments, adds nuclear communities to the definition of “energy communities” for the purposes of the bonus program when applied to PTC-financed facilities, leaves untouched the transferability program that provides projects not eligible for elective pay an option to monetize tax credits without traditional tax credit equity partnership, subject the general credit eligibility.

The bill steps up foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions for clean energy, lowering the threshold to 15%, for debt ownership by one or more specified foreign entities, primarily China, Russia, North Korea and Iran and businesses owned or heavily influenced by, or incorporated in them, making the restriction more stringent. Violation of FEOC restrictions may result in full recapture of the credits.

HTC Left Out

Despite the best efforts of historic preservation advocates, the OBBBA does not include any HTC provisions from the HTC Growth and Opportunity Act (H.R. 2941, S. 1459). Advocates were hoping the final bill would revert the HTC back to a one-year credit from the current law five-year credit and/or repeal the HTC basis reduction.

What Else Didn’t Make It In?

Single-family housing advocates also pushed to create the neighborhood homes tax credit, modeled after LIHTC and NMTC to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable owner-occupied housing, especially in distressed communities. Other housing advocates pushed to establish the workforce housing tax credit, which would finance affordable rental housing for households that earn a little more than the income limits for LIHTC housing. Given the post-pandemic distress in some commercial real estate, especially office properties, the big housing trade organizations were pushing to authorize $15 billion in tax credits to finance the conversion of that distressed commercial real estate into affordable housing. Lastly, a tax incentive to preserve rental housing owned by tax-exempt entities through tax loss syndication also didn’t

make it in.

Future Bills?

After the sweeping legislation passed, some congressional leaders said they might not be finished.

House Ways and Means Committee chair Jason Smith, R-Missouri, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, and House Budget Committee chair Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, all suggested that Congress will consider a second reconciliation bill this fall/winter, and possibly a third reconciliation bill next spring, while Smith and House Ways and Means Committee ranking member Richard Neal, D-Massachusetts, have also suggested the possibility of a year-end bipartisan tax bill to address tax provisions supported by both parties not included in the final reconciliation bill. Such future tax legislation could provide an opportunity for the HTC and other housing and community development incentives that didn’t make the cut.",https://www.novoco.com/static/images/favicon.4c5b39a4ae2a.ico,N,,2025-08-04 15:02:35.487590

Energy tax credits like §45W and §30C face 2025/2026 phaseouts, placing urgency on electric vehicle (EV) and charging station timelines for businesses planning capital expenditures.

Many mid-market companies haven't aligned project timelines with placed-in-service deadlines, risking partial or lost clean energy credits.

Wage rules, documentation, and foreign-sourcing bans can disqualify credits — early compliance checks help preserve full tax benefit.

For many businesses, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was a green light to pursue electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and other sustainable projects — backed by strong federal tax incentives. But in 2025, the rules have changed. And companies that haven't adapted to new deadlines and eligibility requirements may leave valuable credits behind.

Tax provisions like §45W and §30C — which offer up to $7,500/$40,000 per EV and $100,000 per charging port — remain available. But with stricter placed-in-service timelines, prevailing wage requirements, and supply chain sourcing restrictions now in effect, the process has grown more complex.

At MGO, we've seen a growing sense of urgency among tax leaders and CFOs looking to retain the full value of these incentives. The common thread? It's not enough to start building — you need to verify that your timeline, documentation, and sourcing all meet current standards.

What's Changing — and Why It Matters

Businesses investing in clean energy may qualify for:

§45W Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit: Up to $7,500 per eligible EV under 14,000 pounds (cars, vans, trucks, etc.) and up to $40,000 per eligible EV over 14,000 pounds (school buses, semi-trucks, etc.)

§30C Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Credit: Up to $100,000 per qualified charging port

§ 48 (Pre-2025) Investment Tax Credit for Energy Property/§ 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit: 6% of qualified investment increased to 30% if a taxpayer meets prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or exceptions. Eligible to be transferred to an unrelated taxpayer.

But, beginning in 2025, these credits are affected by key IRS updates. Most notably:

Credits are tied more strictly to placed-in-service deadlines

For EVs, the deadline to place in service is September 30, 2025

For charging ports, the deadline to place in service is June 30, 2026

For wind and solar, allowed to be placed in service in four calendar years if construction occurs prior to June 30, 2026; if not, then deadline is December 31, 2027

Bonus credits now require detailed compliance with wage and apprenticeship standards

The foreign entity of concern rule may limit credit access based on component sourcing, particularly for EV batteries

In short, technical compliance now carries real financial consequences. Projects that would have qualified two years ago may fall short today — even if the investment itself hasn't changed.

Where CFOs Stand on Readiness

During a recent MGO webinar, we asked mid-market tax leaders how ready they felt for the upcoming shift. Their responses reflected a common trend:

40% said they were not prepared

30% were somewhat prepared

Only 5% were fully prepared

25% said it was not applicable to their business

This signals a significant planning gap. Despite rising investment in electric fleets and infrastructure, many companies haven't realigned their tax strategy to fit the changing requirements. Without that alignment, even well-intentioned efforts can lose value.

Key Areas Where Companies Face Risk

Several issues have emerged as common barriers to full credit access:

Project delays that affect placed-in-service eligibility

Inconsistent wage documentation that disrupts bonus credit calculations

Foreign-sourced components that invalidate certain credits

Disconnection between tax and operations, leading to missed planning windows

As these rules evolve, companies that aren't regularly reviewing their compliance posture may struggle to capture the full benefits — or may face clawbacks if later audited.

Planning Priorities for 2025

To prepare for the upcoming changes and protect your tax position, MGO recommends focusing on four core actions:

1. Check Placed-in-Service Schedules

Review your project timelines to confirm that EVs, chargers, or facilities will be operational before IRS deadlines. Delays — even short ones — can affect eligibility.

2. Coordinate with Tax Early

Bring your tax team into capital expenditure planning discussions to evaluate credit exposure and prioritize projects with the most favorable timelines and tax treatment.

3. Review Wage and Sourcing Documentation

Work closely with contractors and procurement teams to track wage compliance and verify sourcing for battery or component parts.

4. Run Credit Risk Scenarios

Model potential loss of credits based on current projections, and adjust project sequencing or vendors accordingly to maintain incentive value.

Jason Plautz reports for E&E News.

In short:

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin proposes voiding the 2009 endangerment finding, removing EPA’s mandate to curb power-plant carbon.

Utilities already lean toward wind and solar because of cost, suggesting the rule change may not slow coal retirements.

Scrapping the finding could reopen nuisance lawsuits and force companies to navigate uneven state climate laws.

“We have enough cheap wind and solar available that there’s no economic reason to prop up inefficient old coal power plants, despite what regulations say.”

— Catherine Hausman, associate professor of public policy at the University of Michigan

Why this matters:

Greenhouse gases stay in the air for centuries, trapping heat that drives stronger storms, longer heat waves, and costly coastal floods. Power plants are America’s second-largest source of that pollution, after transportation, so the standards in question underpin much of the nation’s climate response. Repealing them would shift the burden to states, many of which lack the staff or political will to act, and could stall investment in cleaner technology just as electricity demand surges from electric cars and data centers. Higher emissions also mean more soot and smog, hazards linked to asthma attacks, heart disease, and premature births, especially in communities already squeezed by highways and industrial sites.",https://assets.rbl.ms/61426793/origin.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 15:03:03.709102

However, the growth of electric and hybrid vehicles fitted with lithium-ion batteries has created a fiery nightmare for maritime shipping companies. Matson, Inc., a multi-billion-dollar operation based in Honolulu, Hawaii, took a drastic step to protect its cargo ship last month by banning EVs and hybrids. Hopefully, the ban won't be permanent, as Matson stated that the suspension will be lifted once adequate safety solutions are implemented.

Unlike the dedicated car carriers that have caught fire, Matson uses container ships to transport cars along routes across the Pacific Ocean. This method creates two problems. First, how do you detect when a car catches fire inside a container? Second, how do you extinguish the blaze inside the metal box? Matson seemingly found a fire response solution, the HydroPen. The device can drill a hole into a container in under nine seconds before flooding the box with water. A solution for the second problem has yet to be found. According to the Maritime Executive, Matson sent out a letter to its customers, which read:

""Due to increasing concern for the safety of transporting vehicles powered by large lithium-ion batteries, Matson is suspending acceptance of used or new electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles for transport aboard its vessels. Effective immediately, we have ceased accepting new bookings for these shipments to/from all trades.""

It's not clear if Matson's decision was made in reaction to the fire onboard the Morning Midas in June. The ship burned to a crisp 300 miles southwest of Alaska as it was moving 3,048 cars from China to Mexico. There were 70 electric vehicles and 681 hybrids onboard. The fire raged uncontrollably for three weeks until the vessel sank. Thankfully, all 22 crew members evacuated and another merchant ship nearby rescued them.

It wouldn't be the first time that the company adopted new policies in reaction to a disaster impacting another shipper. Matson implemented its first set of lithium battery safety guidelines after the fire on the Felicity Ace in 2022. The mid-Atlantic inferno destroyed nearly 4,000 Volkswagen Group vehicles and led to the entire ship capsizing. It's estimated that as much as $400 million in cargo was lost. Understandably, Matson would ban vehicles fitted with lithium-ion batteries to protect its crews, its vessels and the cargo of other customers.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/hawaiian-shipping-giant-bans-evs-and-plug-in-hybrids-over-fire-risk/l-intro-1754329390.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 15:04:43.109094

The talking points also recommend that the U.S. government withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), something that the administration has not yet done.","Washington, D.C., August 4, 2025 - Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin met with longtime fossil fuel advocates Alex Epstein, Ted Ellis, and Marc Marie in a March 2025 meeting to discuss “novel ideas to help Administrator Zeldin deliver on President Trump’s energy dominance agenda,” according to documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the National Security Archive. But the agency refused to release talking points prepared for Zeldin in advance of that meeting, asserting that their release “could result in foreseeable harm” under FOIA exemption (b)(5), which allows agencies to withhold “pre-decisional” information related to the “deliberative process.” (Document 1)

The documents and partial documents released in this case show that the 30-minute, administrator-level meeting first reported by E&E news was listed on Zeldin’s calendar as “Meeting w/ Energy Talking Points,” the name of Epstein’s controversial Substack blog that propagates pro-fossil fuel industry information.[1] (Document 2) Three additional Energy Talking Points documents released by EPA lay out detailed strategies for how the EPA and Congress should comply with President Trump’s Executive Order 14154 on “Unleashing American Energy.” One document was “classified”—presumably by Epstein himself—as “confidential – do not share without permission.” (Documents 3-5).

Two of the Energy Talking Points papers released by EPA in response to the Archive’s FOIA—“Suggested EPA Actions” (Document 3) and “9 transformative policies to promote energy abundance” (Document 5)—advise Zeldin to “re-examine the agency’s 2009 ‘endangerment finding,’” the landmark opinion that sets greenhouse gas emissions standards. Last week, Zeldin announced a proposal to rescind the endangerment finding.[2]

The National Security Archive has filed an appeal for release of the documents prepared for Zeldin ahead of the meeting, arguing that the agency provided no justification for invoking the FOIA’s (b)(5) exemption to withhold the talking points and has not adequately described the “foreseeable harm” that would follow from the release of the information.

FOIA exemption (b)(5) allows government agencies to withhold from the public any privileged “interagency or intra-agency"" communications, including records related to the “deliberative process,” such as any record that the agency deems to be a “draft.” Originally intended to prevent government employees from “working in a fishbowl,” agency invocation of what has come to be known as the “withhold it because you want to” exemption has skyrocketed over the years.[3] Specifically, the “foreseeable harm” standard—which EPA’s determination is predicated on—states that an agency shall withhold information only if “the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one of the nine exemptions that FOIA enumerates.”[4] The standard was codified under the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016.[5]

The endangerment finding asserts that heat-trapping emissions are a danger to public health and welfare by fueling climate change and gives the EPA the ability to regulate climate pollution under the Clean Air Act.[6] Since President Trump’s inauguration, climate scientists and environmental activists have expressed concern that the EPA would roll back major regulatory cornerstones like the endangerment finding, especially after President Trump asked Zeldin in February to determine whether or not the agency could abandon the scientific finding.[7] Zeldin’s proposed retraction of the 16-year-old scientific finding would severely weaken the government’s ability to regulate climate pollution.

Author of multiple pro-fossil fuel books including The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels and Fossil Future, Epstein founded the for-profit think tank Center for Industrial Progress and has argued that fossil fuels have made “hurricanes like Hurricanes Helene and Milton better, not worse.”[8] Epstein characterized COP29—the annual climate conference held in Baku, Azerbaijan in 2024—as “immoral” for seeking net-zero pledges.[9] In recent months, Epstein has privately and publicly lobbied Congress against subsidies for renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles, playing an “enormous” role in influencing House Republicans during negotiations over the budget reconciliation package.[10]

The Epstein group’s presentation advises the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation to rescind and replace “unachievable” tailpipe emissions standards with “achievable standards” and to revoke Greenhouse Gas Emissions standards for power plants. The talking points also recommend that the U.S. government withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), something that the administration has not yet done. Epstein’s “EV Freedom Plan” outlines “every policy that must go” to achieve “true EV freedom” and encourages federal agencies to “minimize any EV subsidies that Congress doesn’t repeal.” (Document 4)

Declassified email correspondence between Zeldin and EPA Scheduling Director Ashley Brown indicates that fossil fuel advocates Theodore Ellis and Marc Marie also attended the meeting. (Document 2) At the time, Ellis, a former House Republican Study Committee staffer, was listed as Vice President of Government Affairs for another Epstein-founded fossil fuel advocacy group, the Energy Freedom Fund, although he is currently also the director of the America First Policy Institute’s “Power America” program.[11] Marie—a former Justice Department and Interior Department Official—was listed as President of the Center for Environmental Accountability, a non-profit organization “devoted to educating the public and government on the importance of transparency and accountability in environmental and energy policy,” according to the group’s website.[12]",https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/2025-07/banner_photo.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 15:03:07.686887

EPA reverses landmark climate policy, California could lead a resistance

Los Angeles Times – July 29

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on July 29 proposed to repeal its landmark finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health. The EPA’s so-called endangerment finding, issued in 2009, is a formal determination by the agency that planet-warming greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane pose a threat to human health and the environment. It forms the legal and scientific basis for regulating these emissions under the Clean Air Act. EPA’s July 29 proposal would also revoke the standards the agency has set for greenhouse gas emissions from all motor vehicles. The proposal will undergo a public comment period and review process before being finalized. Multiple environmental groups said they are prepared to challenge the rule in court. According to Ann Carlson, director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA, by curtailing the federal authority to regulate greenhouse gases, the rule could relinquish regulatory powers to California and other states to carry out their own climate agendas.

EPA delays methane restrictions for oil and gas

The Hill – July 30

Yesterday, EPA issued an interim final rule delaying implementation of restrictions on planet-warming methane emissions from oil and gas drilling, as it considers unwinding the requirements entirely. In 2023, EPA issued a rule designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas wells by limiting leaks, requiring monitoring and repairs, and phasing out the routine burning of excess gas, known as flaring. Under the interim final rule, companies will have 18 months before they need to install certain of the previously-required pollution controls.

EPA director announces ‘permanent 100% solution’ on Tijuana River sewage crisis

The San Diego Union-Tribune – July 25

EPA announced on July 24 that the agency has brokered a “100% permanent solution” to the Tijuana River sewage crisis. A memorandum of understanding signed by representatives of the United States and Mexico calls for increases in funding, reduced construction timelines, and adjustments to the scope of existing projects “to account for future population growth in Tijuana.” The six-page document calls for a range of infrastructure projects that must be completed no later than Dec. 31, 2027, a date that the administration says is “four years ahead of schedule.”

White House rescinds $20M for clean water in pesticide-contaminated rural California

The Guardian - July 24

For decades, thousands of residents in Monterey County, California couldn’t use their wells because the water was too contaminated with pesticides. In December 2024, EPA stepped in with a long-awaited $20 million grant to provide clean water, improve municipal sources, and relieve the region’s financial and health burden. EPA just took the money away, labeling the grant a “wasteful DEI program.” The funding, along with California state money, would have improved drinking water quality for about 5,500 people. The cuts are part of the Trump administration’s broader elimination of approximately $2 billion in environmental and climate justice initiatives made available through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

EPA to allow new dicamba herbicides despite two court bans

C&EN – July 25

EPA plans to register three new dicamba herbicides for use on soybeans and cotton that are genetically modified to tolerate the weedkiller. The proposal, announced July 23, comes despite two court orders, in 2020 and 2024, to ban such uses because dicamba is prone to volatilizing, making it more likely to drift off-site and harm nontargeted plants on neighboring land.

White House delays limits on gas used to clean medical equipment

Laist – July 29

President Donald Trump issued a proclamation this month that delays a 2024 EPA rule meant to tighten emissions of ethylene oxide, a carcinogen, at companies that use the gas to sterilize medical equipment. The decision grants two-year exemptions to several facilities, including two in Vernon, a city in southeast Los Angeles County. These facilities are currently involved in a lawsuit with local residents relating to alleged releases of the chemical to the environment.

In rare move, California steps in to find buyer for Valero refinery to avoid closure, sources say

Reuters – July 23

California government officials are trying to find a buyer for Valero Energy’s Benicia refinery near San Francisco, three sources familiar with the matter said, as the clock ticks down on the company's planned closure of the facility in April 2026. The rare attempt by a state government to broker the sale of privately-owned infrastructure reflects its growing concerns over protecting fuel supplies in the most populous U.S. state and keeping a lid on prices, where California’s nearly 28 million drivers already pay among the highest prices for gasoline in the country.

Organization sues Coastal Commission over Ballona Wetlands gas project

Yo Venice – July 29

A community coalition filed a lawsuit on July 25 against the California Coastal Commission, alleging the agency unlawfully approved a natural gas project that threatens the ecologically sensitive Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve in Playa del Rey. The suit alleges that the agency violated state environmental laws by allowing a gas company to plug and abandon two natural gas monitoring wells without proper review. The California Coastal Commission declined to comment due to the pending litigation but referred to its April 11 staff report, which asserted the project aligns with the California Environmental Quality Act and Coastal Act policies.

The company on Monday announced new energy-cutting agreements with Indiana Michigan Power and Tennessee Valley Authority through which Google will cut its energy usage during certain times of the day or year, a method called demand response. This is the first time Google is cutting back its energy usage for its AI workload, the company said in a release.

Google said this energy-saving method allows “large electricity loads like data centers to be interconnected more quickly, helps reduce the need to build new transmission and power plants, and helps grid operators more effectively and efficiently manage power grids.”

The tech giant said these new agreements build on its demonstration with Omaha Public Power District, through which Google reduced its power usage for its AI during three grid events in 2024.

“As we add new large loads to our system, it is critical that we partner with our customers to effectively manage the generation and transmission resources necessary to serve them,” I&M president and COO Steve Baker said in the release.

Google said using demand response (or ""flexible demand,"" as the company called it) helps its long-term goal of becoming carbon-free because it helps “bridge the gap” between immediate energy load growth and clean-energy solutions that will take longer to implement.

Last month, Google announced it is spending more than $3 billion in a deal to use hydropower for its data centers.

Google’s new agreements and investment in hydropower come months after its 2024 environmental report showed its carbon emissions have increased by 48% since 2019, in part due to the energy consumption by its data centers.

Detroit, Toronto among most polluted major cities in world Monday

Environment Canada has issued special air quality statements for southwestern Ontario as prairie wildfire smoke sits over swaths of the province.

The CBC News Climate Dashboard also showed Windsor and other southwestern Ontario cities had some of the worst air quality in the country.

Environment Canada warned of potential health effects, including ""mild and common symptoms such as eye, nose and throat irritation, headaches or a mild cough."" Wheezing, chest pains, or severe cough are less common but more serious symptoms.

Older people, young kids, people with chronic conditions, pregnant people, and those who work outside are at higher risk, Environment Canada said. ""If you think you are having a medical emergency, seek immediate medical assistance.""

The federal weather authority also urged people to limit time outside and consider rescheduling outdoor activities, adding that windows and doors should be kept closed as much as possible.

But over the last decade, the failing economics of coal shuttered those power plants.
That means the air on the Colorado Plateau—when not sullied by the ever-lengthening wildfire season—has become cleaner as the coal industry faded away.
It’s true that delaying implementation of the mercury rule will enable the Colstrip coal plant in Montana—one of the nation’s dirtiest facilities—to continue operating without expensive new pollution control equipment.
They just can’t compete with natural gas, solar, wind, and other, cleaner energy sources.","A few years back, my friend Norm told me that when he was growing up in northern New Mexico in the 1950s and early ’60s, his family often drove up to the La Plata Mountains in southwestern Colorado. From there he could see all the way to the Sandia Mountains outside Albuquerque, some 200 miles away.

His statement saddened me, since in all the time I spent on Four Corners high points, a persistent haze always limited my visibility to maybe 50 or 60 miles, blurring Shiprock’s sharp spires into a fuzzy silhouette. That’s because a fleet of massive coal-fired power plants in the region churned out haze-producing pollutants, harming humans and the ecology and blotting out vistas from the San Juans to the Sandias. It seemed as if I’d never get a view as clear as Norm’s.

But over the last decade, the failing economics of coal shuttered those power plants. That means the air on the Colorado Plateau—when not sullied by the ever-lengthening wildfire season—has become cleaner as the coal industry faded away.

The shuttered plants include Mojave, Navajo, Nucla, Escalante, San Juan and, most recently, Cholla. The closures certainly sharpened the view of folks all over the region. But more importantly, they kept tens of millions of tons of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere and oodles of harmful pollutants (arsenic, mercury, sulfur dioxide and soot) out of the lungs of nearby residents, many of them on the Navajo Nation.

Yet in defiance of the free market that has boosted renewables, the Trump administration is acting to undo those positive changes and make the air dirty again by throwing multiple lifelines to the flagging coal industry.

It has eviscerated environmental protections limiting mercury and other toxic air emissions, ended Obama-and Biden-era freezes on new federal coal leases, and rescinded limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The administration has also blocked utilities from shutting down plants that are old, dirty and more costly than other power sources.

Trump purports to do this in the name of “unleashing” coal from regulatory constraints so it can be mined and burned to achieve American “energy dominance.” Yet it’s unlikely that unleashing the industry will reverse its decline.

It’s true that delaying implementation of the mercury rule will enable the Colstrip coal plant in Montana—one of the nation’s dirtiest facilities—to continue operating without expensive new pollution control equipment. Generally, though, utilities such as Xcel Energy, Intermountain Power Agency and Tri-State Generation & Transmission are moving forward with plans to retire their coal plants, namely because the aging facilities are dirty, inefficient, inflexible and, most of all, no longer profitable. They just can’t compete with natural gas, solar, wind, and other, cleaner energy sources.

When signing one of his fossil-fuel-friendly orders, Trump said he would “save” the Cholla coal plant near Holbrook, Arizona, from destruction, adding, “We’re going to have that plant opening and burning the clean coal, beautiful clean coal, in a very short period of time.”

But its operator, Arizona Public Service, said it had already procured cleaner, cheaper generation for the plant, and had no desire to keep burning coal at Cholla. There was no save needed.

If Trump were truly interested in energy dominance and abundance, he would have supported the fastest-growing energy sources—wind and solar power. Instead, his administration is doing all it can to stifle them, from eliminating production tax credits for renewable energy in his “big, beautiful” budget bill, to slowing down permits for clean energy developments on public lands. Both utility-scale and rooftop solar will be affected, boosting the prospects of oil and gas, coal and nuclear.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, in an Economist column, revealed the philosophy behind the administration’s fossil-fuel fetishization. He wrote that climate change is “not an existential crisis,” merely a “byproduct of progress.” He said he was willing to take the “modest negative trade-off” of climate change—along, presumably, with ever more devastating heat waves, wildfires and floods—”for this legacy of human advancement.”

He is probably correct in saying that climate change and the sullied air over the Colorado Plateau are byproducts of so-called progress. But they are also nasty, deadly and avoidable. Ultimately, going backward toward coal will not only wreck progress, but perhaps life on earth as we know it.

I mean, it's a clear pivot that the company is doing, and you don't imagine anyone else leading it but Elon Musk.","It's interesting the board said that we needed to give him this grant to keep him focused on Tesla. I mean, he's got 13% of a trillion dollar company. That's 130 billion round numbers, close to half of his net worth. I don't know that he needs that to keep him focused on Tesla, but maybe they need to keep him in the picture. Uh, and that's exactly what they're doing here. I mean, with the EV tax credits going away, you're seeing the big three pivot away from EVs towards hybrids. And ex Chinese EV companies, I think Tesla is going to be the last man standing. Uh, and they do need Elon Musk, and they do need to pivot the company towards humanoid robots and towards robo taxis for it to continue to grow into its current valuation, because the EV numbers haven't been great, and they're not going to get much better.

Thomas, what bothers me about this is, um, so Elon may stay until 2027. Dan Ives thinking 2030. Yet we still have no clear plan on succession. Or am I wrong to care about that? Or does it even matter? Is Elon Musk still driving the story? No pun intended.

I think it's another equity grant in 2027 or 2030. Look, Tesla is Elon Musk. Elon Musk is Tesla. You take him out of the picture, all that premium goes away. He's the innovator, he's the guy who slept on the factory, he's the guy who took it out of bankruptcy, he's the guy who got the government to give him all the subsidies. Uh, without Elon, candidly, I don't think there is a Tesla. So, uh, they got to give him what they got to give him to keep him focused, to keep him staying, to true up what he was already promised in 2018 and what he delivered on in terms of performance. So, uh, to be continued, he'll be getting more stock uh, to keep him in 2030. That's for sure, unless the humanoid and the robo taxis takes off on a life of its own that uh, uh, it's so spectacular. It doesn't matter who runs it. You know, Buffett said, uh, buy a company that's so great that even a ham sandwich could run it because one day a ham sandwich will run it. Uh, Tesla is nowhere near that point, but maybe if the technology is strong enough, uh, four or five years out, uh, we can have a different conversation.

And as maybe that conversation is maybe the thing or the person, or whatever it is that succeeds Elon Musk, maybe it's just one of his robots. Maybe that's what we're looking at here.

Perhaps, and maybe, I mean, I think that Tom has a point that Tesla definitely is Elon Musk. This is a company that's run by a bigger than life sort of force, so to speak, when it comes to Elon Musk. And he has, he's running other companies as well. I mean, if you take a look at Neurolink, SpaceX, uh, putting internet access in remote areas. So really, when you're looking at Tesla, you are also looking, we've seen Tesla be sort of a cultish stock, so to speak, throughout the pandemic. I think that continues because you are betting on Elon Musk, and it's kind of hard to bet against somebody that is leading so many other companies as well. It's it's interesting that this, um, compensation comes sort of, it's it's, it's kind of doubtful that he would be leaving Tesla, right? I mean, when investors think about Tesla, uh, you you don't really necessarily think that Elon Musk would be leaving the company, so to speak, because he is spearheading this new direction towards these robots, towards robo taxis. I mean, it's a clear pivot that the company is doing, and you don't imagine anyone else leading it but Elon Musk.

Or maybe that robot in his. Let's just be honest. That's where things may be headed here.

Your Renewable Energy Questions Answered Why Is Renewable Energy Becoming So Important?","The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources. With concerns over climate change intensifying and fossil fuel reserves dwindling, nations and industries worldwide are prioritizing sustainable alternatives to meet their power needs. Renewable energy, derived from natural sources like sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat, has emerged as a viable and increasingly affordable solution.

Its rapid integration is reducing carbon footprints and fundamentally reshaping how the world generates, distributes, and consumes energy. As innovations in technology accelerate and policies evolve to support greener choices, the future of global power consumption is being reimagined. This transformation is both revolutionary and irreversible.

Why Global Investments in Renewable Energy Are Surging

The global energy sector is experiencing an unprecedented surge in investments focused on renewable sources like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. Countries around the world are prioritizing clean energy as a strategic solution to combat climate change and reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Both the private and public sectors are pouring billions into infrastructure, innovation, and workforce development.

What’s equally important is education in renewable energy, which is now at the core of long-term sustainability planning. This focus helps build the skilled workforce needed to operate and maintain the advanced systems driving this global shift. As investment continues to rise, so too does the momentum toward a greener, more resilient global future.

How Technology Is Making Sustainable Energy Affordable

Technological innovation is a cornerstone in the rapid expansion of renewable energy. The cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines has dropped by over 80% in the past decade, making renewables increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. Battery storage systems have become more efficient and affordable, while smart grid technologies allow for better integration of decentralized energy sources.

At the same time, breakthroughs in hydrogen fuel cells and floating wind farms are expanding renewable options for regions with limited land availability. These advancements enhance performance and reliability, making sustainable energy scalable for urban centers and remote communities alike.

The Role Of Policy In The Clean Energy Transition

Government policies are playing a pivotal role in accelerating the global transition to renewable energy. Countries are setting ambitious targets for carbon neutrality, often backed by incentives such as tax credits and subsidies. Major initiatives like the European Union’s Green Deal, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, and China’s Five-Year Plans all reflect a strong regulatory commitment to fostering clean energy ecosystems.

International agreements like the Paris Climate Accord further reinforce this collective push. By creating favorable market conditions and supporting research, policymakers are laying the groundwork for a resilient, renewable-powered future where sustainable energy solutions can thrive.

Decentralized Power: The Rise of Microgrids

Renewable energy is decentralizing the traditional power model, giving rise to microgrids and distributed energy systems. Unlike centralized power plants, microgrids operate independently or in conjunction with the main grid, often powered by localized renewable sources like rooftop solar panels or small-scale wind turbines. This model enhances energy resilience, particularly in disaster-prone or remote areas, and reduces transmission losses.

This shift is turning communities, businesses, and even individual households into “prosumers.” They are now able to simultaneously produce and consume their own clean energy. This democratization of energy empowers users and stimulates local economies. As more regions invest in decentralized solutions, the grid becomes more flexible and adaptive, reflecting a future where energy is a shared resource and a decentralized commodity.

The Environmental And Health Benefits Of Clean Energy

Transitioning to renewable energy delivers profound and far-reaching environmental and health benefits. Replacing coal, oil, and gas with wind, solar, and hydro significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which are the primary drivers of global warming. Cleaner air from reduced fossil fuel combustion translates into fewer respiratory illnesses, heart conditions, and premature deaths in urban areas.

The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution causes around 7 million deaths annually, many of which cleaner energy sources can prevent. Renewable energy systems also require less water for operation, preserving freshwater resources. These ecological and public health benefits underscore the urgency and importance of accelerating the global shift to renewables.

How The Green Economy Drives Job Creation

While some worry about job losses in traditional energy sectors, the renewable energy transition is proving to be a major driver of employment and economic growth. The renewable energy sector employed over 13 million people globally in 2023, a figure expected to grow substantially in the coming years. Jobs in solar installation, wind turbine maintenance, energy auditing, and battery manufacturing are in high demand. These roles often provide competitive wages and require a mix of high- and low-skill labor, making them accessible to diverse populations.

Investments in local renewable projects stimulate economic activity by keeping energy dollars within communities. As the green economy expands, it brings with it environmental dividends and robust, long-term economic gains.

Building Resilience with Sustainable Energy

Renewable energy enhances resilience against a range of global crises, including:

Geopolitical instability

Pandemics and public health emergencies

Extreme weather events

Unlike fossil fuels, which are subject to market volatility and supply chain disruptions, renewables rely on abundant and locally available resources. During global oil shocks or trade disruptions, solar and wind installations continue to generate power unaffected.

Climate-resilient infrastructure, such as wind farms designed to withstand hurricanes, ensures continuity in energy supply during natural disasters. When the main grid fails, decentralized systems quickly restore power to critical facilities. As global uncertainty increases, renewables offer a stable, secure, and adaptable energy solution that strengthens national and community resilience.

Renewable Energy And The Path To Global Energy Equity

One of the most transformative aspects of renewable energy is its potential to create global energy equity. Over 700 million people still live without reliable electricity, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia. Traditional grid expansion in these regions is often slow and prohibitively expensive. Renewable-based microgrids and standalone solar systems offer a faster, more affordable alternative.

Collaborative initiatives are deploying clean energy solutions to power schools, clinics, and homes in these underserved areas. This improves quality of life and opens doors to education, economic development, and gender equity. Renewable energy is transforming lives and communities.

Conclusion: A Sustainable and Equitable Energy Future

The global shift to renewable energy is more than a technological transition; it is a fundamental reimagining of our relationship with power. By harnessing sustainable energy sources, we are not only mitigating climate change but also building a more resilient, equitable, and economically robust future. Innovations in solar, wind, and geothermal technology, supported by forward-thinking policies, are accelerating this change, making clean energy more accessible and affordable than ever before.

As we move away from our reliance on fossil fuels, we unlock the potential to address energy poverty, improve public health, and create millions of jobs in a thriving green economy. The future of global power consumption is decentralized, democratic, and, most importantly, sustainable.

There are both primary and secondary markets for pipeline capacity. In the primary market, shippers can purchase capacity from an interstate pipeline and choose to contract for two main types of service: firm or interruptible.

Firm Service: Shippers pay a two-part rate consisting of a reservation charge and a usage charge to ensure high priority service by reserving a specified amount of capacity on the pipeline. The reservation charge is based on the amount of pipeline capacity reserved by the shipper, regardless of how much of that capacity the shipper uses. A firm shipper also pays a usage charge based on the amount of natural gas that it ships under its firm contract. Firm service is the highest quality transportation service offered to customers and anticipates no planned interruption.

Interruptible Service: Shippers pay a one-part usage charge to transport natural gas on a pipeline, but service is subject to interruption by higher priority customers at times when capacity is not available. Thus, while interruptible service is less expensive because transportation customers pay only a usage charge based on transported volumes, interruptible shippers are lower in priority than firm transportation customers.

A shipper with no firm service that requires natural gas during a period of high demand when interruptible service is unavailable can turn to the secondary market by participating in the capacity release program or by acquiring gas through a bundled sale. In the secondary market, firm shippers may sell their unneeded pipeline capacity to another shipper through the capacity release program. Natural gas can also be purchased at a negotiated rate from a party such as a producer or marketer that will transport its natural gas from a production area or gas trading location, using its pipeline capacity, to the location on the pipeline where the gas is needed. This is known as a bundled sale, as it combines the sale and transportation of the natural gas to the customer.

WHAT IS CAPACITY RELEASE?

The Commission adopted the capacity release program as part of the Order No. 636 restructuring of natural gas pipelines to create a transparent program for the reallocation of interstate pipeline capacity. The program was designed to increase the availability and maximize the use of firm capacity by permitting firm shippers to release their unused pipeline capacity to others.

Under a capacity release, a firm shipper on an interstate pipeline can resell some or all of its firm transportation and/or storage capacity to a replacement shipper. This is an important tool for natural gas-fired electric generators that do not have firm rights to capacity on interstate pipelines and need to purchase natural gas supply or pipeline capacity during periods of high demand such as winter storms.

HOW DOES CAPACITY RELEASE WORK?

Some capacity releases are subject to posting and bidding requirements. Releases subject to bidding must be completed during business hours, while those not subject to bidding can take place at any time, including weekends and holidays. There is also no maximum price cap for capacity releases of one year or less.

Bidding: A shipper wanting to release its firm capacity notifies the pipeline of the terms and conditions under which it will release its capacity subject to certain Commission requirements. The pipeline then posts the capacity for bidding on its website.

No Bidding: Bidding on available capacity is not required for the following:

Prearranged releases that the releasing shipper has arranged with a replacement shipper for a period of 31 days or less;

Prearranged releases for more than one year where the replacement shipper agrees to pay the maximum recourse rate; and

Capacity releases to either an asset manager or marketer participating in a state-regulated retail access program;

CAPACITY RELEASE PROHIBITIONS

The Commission prohibited certain practices to ensure shippers comply with its capacity release program.

Buy-Sell: A shipper holding interstate pipeline capacity buys natural gas at the direction of, on behalf of, or directly from, another entity; ships that natural gas using its interstate pipeline capacity; and then resells an equivalent quantity of natural gas to the downstream entity at the delivery point. This type of transaction is prohibited because it amounts to an end run of the requirement that capacity releases be conducted through the pipeline and comply with the capacity release rules.

Shipper Must Have Title: Shippers must hold title to the natural gas that they ship on the pipeline. Otherwise, capacity holders could simply transport gas over the pipeline for other entities and avoid the capacity release requirements.

Tying: The releasing shipper cannot tie the release of pipeline capacity to any extraneous conditions, such as terms unrelated to the capacity, the purchases of other unwanted capacity, or gas contracts.

Flipping: A releasing shipper is prohibited from making repeated discounted releases of 31 days or less to two or more affiliated replacement shippers, without bidding, on an alternating monthly basis.

ASSET MANAGER ARRANGEMENTS (AMAS)

In Order No. 712, the Commission recognized the benefits of AMAs and that those benefits can be frustrated by the existing capacity release .As a result, the Commission exempts capacity releases made as part of AMAs from the requirement of competitive bidding, from the restrictions of tying arrangements, and partially from the buy-sell prohibition.

WAIVERS

The Commission has granted case-specific waivers of the Commission’s capacity release regulations, pipeline capacity release tariff provisions, and policies supporting the capacity release program in situations such as the transfer of assets between companies, facilitation of state-approved retail access programs, and facilitation of LNG imports and exports. Upon request, the Commission would consider specific waivers to allow natural gas-fired electric generators to obtain natural gas and capacity during extreme weather.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Friends of the Earth (FOE), joined by Biofuelwatch, has formally submitted a public comment to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) opposing an experiment that would dump up to 20 metric tons – tens cars’ worth – of agricultural waste from sugarcane manufacturers into the Orca Basin, a deep, hypersaline, oxygen-free region in the Gulf of Mexico that is home to rare microbial lifeforms and has played an important role in Gulf Coast science for decades. FOE also submitted a petition opposing the project signed by 11,731 activists from across the country.

“The ocean is not a waste bin for corporations trying to cash in on climate change,” said Benjamin Day, Senior Campaigner for Climate and Energy Justice at Friends of the Earth. “Carboniferous is trying to turn a uniquely sensitive, poorly understood deep-sea ecosystem into a private carbon dump. That’s not science – that’s geoengineering, and it’s dangerous.”

Carboniferous has applied for a federal permit under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act to permanently sink the dried biomass. The project claims to be a scientific experiment exploring whether carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere by sinking carbon, in the form of agricultural waste, to the floor of the deep sea. However, the proposed experiment would not collect any direct samples from the 20 tons of biomass, and the waste would be permanently abandoned on the seafloor with no backup plan for retrieval if something goes wrong.

Friends of the Earth has called on the EPA to hold a formal public hearing on the proposed experiment and reject the permit.

Carboniferous, the for-profit company behind the experiment, also has a significant financial conflict-of-interest in the project, since their business model relies on eventually being able to sell “carbon credits” for dumping even larger quantities of agricultural waste into the ocean.

Friends of the Earth’s legal and scientific analysis found Carboniferous’ application to be riddled with red flags: there are no testable hypotheses in the proposed “scientific” experiment, no plan to directly measure carbon sequestration, no strategy for long-term monitoring, and no provisions for cleanup if something goes wrong. The analysis also highlights the serious risk of microbial contamination, methane release, and disruption of future scientific research in the area.

FOE also noted that starting last year the EPA illegally expanded the country’s ocean dumping laws to include marine geoengineering activities, which they did unilaterally without any public or expert consultation, in violation of multiple federal laws.

“The EPA must pump the brakes on all permit applications for marine carbon dioxide removal. These removals are out of line with the country’s restrictive ocean dumping laws and are not authorized by Congress,” said Day. “We need real solutions to the climate crisis – not speculative, profit-driven schemes that treat the ocean as a dumping ground.”",https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gulf-of-mexico-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 15:03:46.137240

Dive Brief:

A coalition of 26 Republican state finance officials sent letters to the top executives at 25 different U.S.-based asset management firms last week, pushing for the firms to “reaffirm … their commitment to traditional fiduciary duty” by ceasing to frame climate change and other “deterministic future outcomes as long-term risks.”

The July 29 letters went to executives at the “Big Three” asset managers — BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street — along with other high-profile banks, investment firms and asset management arms, including Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Goldman Sachs and Invesco.

The finance officials, representing 21 states, also urged the asset managers to “abstain” from incorporating net-zero climate commitments, natural capital frameworks and the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive into their “default investment strategies.”

Dive Insight:

The push against the use of ESG factors, such as climate considerations in investment decisions and proxy engagement, follows Wall Street’s exodus from climate alliances earlier this year, spurred by mounting pressure from Republican-led state probes and changes in federal leadership. Such departures and climate commitment walkbacks have led to some states dropping previous state-level probes into the banks, including in Texas and Tennessee.

The finance officials represent states including Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Utah. The letter tells asset management firms “seeking to do business” in those states that they should abandon framing climate change as a long-term risk and incorporating net-zero standards. the missive also asks firms to disclose any coalition or collaborative organizations they have memberships in and align proxy voting guidelines “with shareholder value, not environmental or social goals posed by activists.”

“While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” the letter said. “The number one issue is a recommitment to the foundational principles of fiduciary duty, loyalty, objectivity, and financial focus.”

The officials alleged that the “potential risks” of climate change “are framed as certain and catastrophic to justify forcing companies to take immediate actions that may not align with their long-term business interests.” Similarly, the letters frame issues like net-zero and CSRD incorporation and alignment as relying on “predetermined political outcomes, not fiduciary judgment.”

The other firms who received the July 29 form letter include Affiliated Managers Group, Alliance Bernstein, BNY Investments and Wealth, Capital Group, Dimensional Fund Advisors, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton, Geode Capital Management, MFS Investment Management, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, Neuberger Berman, Northern Trust, Nuveen, Prudential, Schwab Asset Management, T. Rowe Price, Wellington Management, and Wells Fargo Wealth and Investments.

The new rules require that leases can only be made if the renewable energy project can produce the same amount of energy as that of coal, gas, or nuclear per acre. Because solar and wind farms use more acreage than coal or gas plants, DOE’s new limitation creates an effective ban on new solar and wind projects on public lands. This rule does not account for the acreage used for coal mining and gas drilling or fracking, and also does not account for the significant, long-term environmental impacts from fossil production and burning.

Last year, renewable energy produced over 20 percent of the nation’s electricity, more than coal energy’s share, and it makes up the vast majority of energy waiting to be added to the grid. In the first full year of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the renewable energy sector added 142,000 new jobs, more than half of the energy industry’s total new jobs.

In response, Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Director Laurie Williams issued the following response:

“In the last few years, our country witnessed remarkable and rapid progress in the renewable energy sector. Domestic solar energy production was at a historic high, and renewables were significantly out-producing dirty, expensive, outdated coal. This is all simply because clean wind and solar are cheaper than coal. All Americans benefited from the green economy by seeing lower energy bills, more stable and good-paying jobs, and less pollution in our air and water.

“If the Trump administration truly cared about the high cost of energy Americans are facing, they would be doing everything they could to unleash our nation’s abundant and free clean energy resources. It appears the administration only wants to walk back all this progress just so their buddies in the fossil fuel industry won’t lose out on profits. In other words, they are taking money out of hardworking Americans’ wallets, and giving it away to corporate polluter friends. This obstructionist agenda to put polluter profits before people will hurt everyday Americans and delay our path to energy independence. We will fight back against this attack on Americans’ financial security and our domestic renewable energy sector.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-04 14:06:17.401183

Nessel and 18 other attorneys general assert that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law, appropriated $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program over five fiscal years. It is among more than two dozen lawsuits filed by Nessel against the administration.

The NEVI program was created to fund the nationwide deployment of EV charging stations to improve charging reliability and accessibility. Approximately $87 million was apportioned to Michigan for fiscal years 2022 through 2025.

But Trump on his first day in office mandated federal agencies to pause disbursement of all funding appropriated under the infrastructure act, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, including the EV infrastructure funding.

Those funds were mandated by Congress, but the administration has since unlawfully revoked previously-approved state highway plans and said it was no longer committed to funding those projects.

Nearly $29 million in congressionally-approved funding is currently unavailable.

The interview has been edited.

Kara Holsopple: So, for the layperson, what is the PJM auction?

Jon Gordon: The PJM capacity market — it’s where the auction takes place —we call it the capacity market. And that exists because at certain times of year, like today, where it’s summer, and it’s really hot, and everyone’s running their air conditioners, the demand for electricity spikes on days like this to way above average.

There’s this whole class of power plants that just run a few hours a year to meet these super-high peak demands. That’s not a very economical way for these plants to run just a few hours a year. So we sort of have to provide them a revenue stream to keep them maintained and up and running and available on these days when we desperately need them most.

The capacity market provides revenue to these plants that are critically important to meeting demand on these super-high-demand days.

Kara Holsopple: And there’s like a price decided, right?

Jon Gordon: The power plant owners, the folks that are going to provide this peak energy, it’s how much they need to be compensated to provide this generation. It reflects all of their costs of operation, maintenance, fuel, risk — all of those things. It’s an auction, so you’re trying to get the lowest price for consumers. But, you know, auction prices can go up when there’s not a lot of folks bidding in the auction.

Kara Holsopple: Why was this year different than previous years?

Jon Gordon: I would say this began in last year’s auction, that’s when prices shot up in the auction. So for many years, the portion of your bill for capacity was relatively stable; it was unchanging. So nobody really noticed it. For many years at PJM, load growth demand for energy was pretty flat, pretty stable, and they had plenty of power generation, almost an excess of supply relative to demand.

We suddenly saw this spike in demand that was driven largely by data centers and to a lesser degree, electrification, like electric vehicles, electric heat pumps, and all of that.

In last year’s auction, that kind of flipped. We suddenly saw this spike in demand that was driven largely by data centers and, to a lesser degree, electrification, like electric vehicles, electric heat pumps, and all of that.

We saw this really flat demand spike up at the exact same time that a lot of power plants began retiring. We have a lot of very old power plants on the system. As plants age, they become, like a car, less economical to run. They need repairs all the time. They’re dirty, they’re polluting, there are all sorts of reasons for these plants to retire. So we had two things happen at once. We had less supply, with retiring plants and increased demand, and that drives prices up.

Kara Holsopple: Why is it so difficult to get new power sources online?

Jon Gordon: That is kind of the heart of this matter, in my view. In PJM, it’s very difficult for new supply to come online. And the reason for that — it gets into a little bit of an arcane concept. I’ll try and explain it as easily as I can. PJM has what they call the interconnection queue.

If you’re a power generator who wants to supply energy – a solar plant, a natural gas power plant – you have to go to PJM and basically apply to connect to the grid. The reason for that is that PJM has to make sure the grid can support whatever your project is. You can’t just plop a power plant anywhere. There has to be enough capacity in the power lines, the transmission lines, to move the power. So they do an interconnection study. That lets you know when and where you can connect.

This interconnection queue is broken.

If we go back 15 or 20 years before the clean energy revolution, the clean energy transition, the interconnection queue would be just a couple of power plants a year. PJM was all about just these big centrally located power stations, these big old coal plants and natural gas plants, huge power generating plants. So they’d only get a handful of interconnection requests a year. They’re quite complicated, these interconnection studies. It’s a big engineering and economic analysis. It takes PJM several years, believe it or not, to do one of these interconnection studies.

Suddenly you have hundreds of solar developers wanting to put little solar fields everywhere…PJM quickly became overwhelmed with hundreds and hundreds of interconnection requests.

So, along comes the clean energy transition. Instead of having four or five large plants wanting to connect, suddenly you have hundreds of solar developers wanting to put little solar fields everywhere. They’re smaller, they’re distributed. PJM quickly became overwhelmed with hundreds and hundreds of interconnection requests. They just got they got buried in these.

It got so bad that in 2022, they closed the interconnection queue. No wonder we’re having trouble getting new supply online. They’re hoping it’ll be open in late 2026. PJM’s failure to effectively manage this queue and anticipate this change, this high-volume queue that we suddenly have, is really what has led, in my view, to these higher prices.

Kara Holsopple: How does PGM compare with other grid operators in the country when it comes to getting sources of energy into the grid?

Jon Gordon: It’s funny to ask that question because Advanced Energy United actually did a scorecard where we rated every RTO in the U.S. On their ability to interconnect new resources. That’s a regional transmission organization. That’s what PJM is known as in the business. Unsurprisingly, PJM had the lowest score of any RTO in America. They got a D minus, which I think was fairly generous considering their queue has been closed since 2022. There are some other RTOs that have a little bit of a slow queue, but nothing like the problem we see in PJM.

Kara Holsopple: So, in your opinion, what’s the solution?

Jon Gordon: Once the hole gets dug this deep, it gets a lot harder to dig your way out. It would have been a lot easier to have anticipated this. They get frustrated when we talk about the problems of the past; they want to look forward. There aren’t a lot of easy solutions. There’s no silver bullet.

PJM’s failure to effectively manage this queue and anticipate this change, this high-volume queue that we suddenly have, is really what has led, in my view, to these higher prices.

One of the things they tried to do when this problem became apparent was hire a whole bunch more people to do these interconnection studies. But the problem was, these are really complicated studies. You need transmission engineers with really unique expertise. Finding skilled, qualified engineers is generally a challenge, and people with transmission engineering expertise, even more so. So PJM couldn’t really staff up. There are ways to abbreviate these studies and complete them more quickly, and they’re starting to do that now. They’ve made those improvements, but again, you barely notice it when the hole is this deep.

We would like to see PJM just reopen the queue because we have to start restocking this queue with new projects. The projects that are in the queue are so old. They’ve been in there for so long. Many of them entered the queue before COVID, before we had the supply chain issues, inflation, tariffs, you know, the world has changed. Even though there are lots of projects in the queue – I just want to mention 95% of them are clean energy – there’s a concern that the economics have changed. When they finally do get permission to interconnect, they may no longer be economic.

So one of the things we want to see PGM do is really refresh this queue and start allowing new projects that reflect today’s economic realities of the queue, and just open the queue back up.

Kara Holsopple: How are federal policies impacting PGM’s ability to provide affordable electricity?

Jon Gordon: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is the body that oversees PJM. So that’s one of the unusual things about PJM, one of the things the states are learning. The states have taken, as you might imagine, a much bigger interest in PJM after this big range increase, and I think that really struck them how much what happens if PJM impacts states and their consumers.

The offshore wind projects have been canceled. PJM was counting on offshore wind to meet future demand, expecting these to come online eventually.

Honestly, if I’m going to get into it, some of the things the new administration is doing are shutting down a lot of projects that could have been new supply. The offshore wind projects have been canceled. PJM was counting on offshore wind to meet future demand, expecting these to come online eventually. A lot of what’s happened to the clean energy from a federal government policy perspective is going to harm consumers and increase prices, I think, for a long time.

Kara Holsopple: Are there other technologies besides adding more renewables to the grid that could help with costs or with demand?

Jon Gordon: There are. One of them is advanced transmission technologies. That’s sort of a broad term for all sorts of things that make transmission lines more efficient, allow them to carry more power. There are all sorts of new technologies where you can take an existing transmission line and increase its capacity by 20%. It’s almost like adding a new power plant. But again, there are obstacles: inertia and challenges in some cases to get the transmission owners to upgrade these transmission lines. So that’s an area that we really emphasize. We want to see that done. It’s kind of low-hanging fruit. We should do as much of that as we absolutely can.

PJM announced this year that they were partnering with the Google Tapestry, an affiliate of Google that does AI. They’re trying to find a way to apply AI to these interconnection studies. If we can somehow find a way to use AI to take that three-year interconnection study and do it in a few weeks or a few months, that would really be something. PJM just kicked this off. They don’t really have a lot of firm timelines on this, but maybe technology can come in and help us there.

Kara Holsopple: If data centers are really driving the electricity power needs here, then should data centers be more responsible for taking care of how they are powered?

Jon Gordon: Yes, absolutely. So in the business, people have coined the term, “data centers should bring their own power.” Meaning, if you’re going to build a data center, you better have a plan to build like a power plant right next to it, because you’re not going to take power plants from rate payers who desperately need them and have paid for them. But this is all happening so fast, this phenomenon. I’ve never seen anything like it, frankly, with data centers. And I know the regulatory wheels turn slowly. New rate structures and regulatory regimes happen over many years. We don’t really have structures to account for this phenomenon. It is the issue of the day, truly.

Living in a healthy environment means that you can trust that your basic living conditions – air, water, food, shelter, and the things in your built world – will not make you sick. Living in a healthy environment means that, no matter your identity, you trust the safety of public spaces, and do not fear bodily harm in your home, workplace, or street. The Trump Administration is systematically dismantling the conditions of a healthy and safe environment.

The Trump Administration has purged thousands of dedicated scientists and civil servants from the public sector – people who study the health impacts of toxic chemicals in air and water; who research ways to prevent firefighters, miners, and farmworkers from becoming sick or injured in their jobs; who test the safety of consumer goods like cribs, toys and electronics; who investigate and issue recommendations to prevent chemical disasters that poison communities; and who strive to eliminate sources of childhood lead exposure in food, schools and water. The Administration’s elimination of these essential services will cause more preventable deaths, illnesses and diseases, impacting middle and low-wage workers, children, and polluted communities hardest.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has all but renounced its mission statement to protect human health and the environment: it has denied that climate change is harming people, while hundreds of people in the U.S. die in floods each year and thousands die of heat; it has erased data on climate harms and environmental injustice; and it has announced plans to slash pollution rules that its own scientists have estimated would prevent thousands of premature deaths. In the meantime, the White House has given corporate polluters a free pass to ignore many federal pollution rules before they are officially rolled back. These rules are intended to prevent cancer in communities at the fenceline of chemical plants, and were fought for by environmental justice advocates, community members and workers who have lost loved ones to egregious health conditions linked to chemical pollution.

Adding insult to injury, President Trump lobbied for and signed a reconciliation bill that cuts health, food and energy benefits for working Americans in order to fund tax cuts for billionaires and subsidies for fossil fuel corporations. As increased environmental harms and hazards inevitably lead to more sickness and injury, many of the most impacted families will have less healthcare coverage and lower income to cover costs.

The federal government has broadly moved to criminalize immigration and expand state authority to suppress freedom of speech and assembly, making immigrants, people of color, and peaceful protesters fearful in their workplaces and homes. The White House has authorized the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to harass, violently detain, and deport farmworkers who are essential to our food system, detain lawful U.S. residents who have criticized the government, and arrest U.S. citizens for speaking out against attacks on their neighbors, including labor leaders and elected officials. Thousands of people have been arrested by masked unidentified agents and detained or deported without due process, the majority of whom have no criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. An environment where this is accepted threatens the safety of every single American.

These actions are designed to test the limits of the law and Americans’ willingness to accept a status of powerlessness against corporate interests and an increasingly authoritarian government. They send the message that families are on their own to protect themselves from toxic chemicals, corporate assault on health and the environment, and political violence.

Our network is committed to environmental health and justice. We will stand up for everyone’s right to safety in their homes, workplaces, and communities, regardless of their migration history, citizenship status, race, gender expression or identity. Everyone should be safe to participate fully in public life, gather in their communities, and engage in political protest.

We will resist the dismantling of federal agencies and federal rules that protect our air, water, food and built environment. At the same time, we will not pretend that these agencies and rules ever adequately protected everyone’s right to a safe and healthy environment. Our network stands in solidarity and partnership with the environmental justice movement, led by communities whose air, water and bodies have already been contaminated by the chemical industry. Together we will continue to fight for a world where no community’s health, safety, or well-being is considered an 'acceptable' sacrifice, and where a nontoxic economy can flourish.

This is a time not only to defend the limited environmental health protections that exist in law now, but to reimagine fundamental changes to our economy and regulatory systems that leave no community or worker in harm’s way. This is a time to build the trust, community, and alignment among our membership needed to rebuild our chemical management systems from the ground up.

Not every state should build every kind of cleantech, but every state has strong economic development potential for some part of the clean energy economy.","How states can optimize federal funding before it’s too late and fill in any funding gaps.

Cleantech economics keep shifting — some improving, some worsening. With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the costs of some technologies have changed more than others. What hasn’t changed is that most people recognize that clean technologies are the growth edge for the economy, both within the United States and globally.

Certainty enables action. The passage of the OBBBA means states can now move things forward according to this new policy landscape. With incentives phasing out at the federal level, states can take advantage before they’re gone. They also have a huge opportunity to grow their economies and address load growth through developing and deploying clean energy. By pursuing the best paths forward, states can secure investments, save money, improve health, and position their businesses and residents to thrive. Here are six recommended priorities for states to pursue.

1. Convert specific fleets to electric vehicles (EVs) immediately

The tax credits for EVs expire on Sept 30, 2025. Any major fleets within states (public or private) should consider an EV conversion immediately. Obviously not everyone can purchase fleet vehicles that quickly. Those that can are likely private fleets or already have a procurement effort underway. Those fleet managers will reap the financial benefits for years to come. We’ve even got a chart to show which fleets make the most sense to convert with the tax credits and how that varies based on charging infrastructure, local gas prices, and the repeal of the tax credits. The higher gas prices are, the better the deal for EVs. This is also a good idea if you want to hedge against future gas price volatility or are concerned about tariff impacts.

States can convert their own fleets and encourage businesses to convert theirs. The purchase just has to be made by Sept. 30, 2025.

2. Speed up permitting and build faster

With load growth increasing, most states are racing to address energy needs. And with the energy tax credits for solar and wind going away from projects that start construction after July 2026 AND are placed in service after December 31, 2027, it’s crucial to help those projects move faster through permitting and interconnection to meet that deadline. This can also speed up nuclear, geothermal, storage, and other energy projects that will start phasing out in 2034.

Permitting

Current permitting and siting practices can add many months to the process. While the federal government and local governments have a role here, states have much of the authority to address this. Some recommendations are:

Replicate the Virginia Permit Transparency (VPT) and Permitting Enhancement and Evaluation Platform (PEEP), which highlights permits that are considered gold-star models for improved processes that cut processing times 70 percent.

Help local communities become “clean energy opportunity zones” to attract development that can bypass the local opposition in other jurisdictions. Examples include Texas’ Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) and the Renewable Energy Zones in Illinois’ 2024 plan. Instead of fighting opposition and delaying projects, support communities that “raise their hand” to develop clean energy; provide incentives, support, or marketing; and possibly use model by-right permitting.

Explore the Foundation for American Innovation’s State Permitting Playbook and state permitting scorecard.

Review Washington State’s detailed report on siting and permitting reform from Beveridge and Diamond.

Consider adopting the policies recently passed in Texas and New Jersey to speed up home solar and storage permitting by allowing approved third-party systems to move permits quickly.

And stay tuned as RMI will be providing more guidance for states in 2025.

Interconnection

Interconnection processes are also a huge bottleneck. Over 2,600 gigawatts of clean energy projects — equivalent to more than double the current electricity generating capacity in the United States — are held up in interconnection queues right now. States with a regional transmission organization (RTO) can work with the RTO to improve their processes and speed up approvals. States without an RTO should quickly devote resources to modernizing interconnection approvals to speed them up.

Note that clean repowering — connecting to existing interconnection sites and facilities — is another way to get past interconnection slow-downs.

3. Fill financial gaps

While many solutions can help lower costs for clean energy (including permitting reform), two paths can make a big difference without requiring large, ongoing budget commitments from the state.

The first is building up public-private partnerships to deliver better financing for clean energy. Most states have established “green banks,” state energy financing institutions (SEFIs), or both. For example, Alabama’s Powering Growth Act went into effect June 1, 2025, and creates the tech-neutral Alabama Energy Infrastructure Bank and the Strategy Energy Procurement Fund. With a one-time infusion of dollars from a state budget or a state bond, these services can leverage private capital for decades to come and provide dedicated financing for energy projects, often with better terms.

The second is to coordinate aggregate purchasing of equipment and installations for specific technologies. Aggregate purchasing is too often overlooked as a financial solution for cleantech. It can reduce costs anywhere from 10 to 40 percent on equipment and labor, potentially outpacing the benefits of tax credits. And the outcome is even better if you can use both aggregation and tax credits. Combining aggregate purchase programs with reverse auctions can further lower costs. Creating a time-bound program for other entities to join an aggregate purchasing opportunity can also help spur action. Some states already have programs to allow local governments to bypass their own procurement requirements to participate in aggregate purchase efforts. States can make small investments to coordinate such efforts that pay for themselves in public savings while also benefitting others across the state.

We also have released resources to support financial solutions, including how to put together capital stacks, funding decision trees, and how to identify existing planned projects within each state. The EIA’s list of planned energy generation projects is also a useful resource to identify projects.

4. Prioritize energy affordability

Energy bills are causing real problems for consumers. Rising costs are driven by wildfires, natural gas price volatility, perverse utility incentives, and other problems in the market. But there’s a wealth of things states can do to keep electricity costs down. Best practices from governors include actions like starting utility cost controls, supporting efficiency and solar and storage systems for customers, and getting rid of unnecessary “riders” on bills. States can also move to end energy poverty. Our new Energy Poverty Policy Simulator shows states how.

These steps are especially important right now as new investments in fossil fuels threaten to make energy bills worse. Action is needed to keep costs down. And lowering electricity costs will improve the economics for electrification.

Stay tuned for our soon-to-launch legislative toolkit for energy affordability and more state resources for reducing consumer energy costs across sectors in the year ahead.

5. Launch home energy rebates

Almost every state signed up to participate in the home energy rebate program, but most state efforts were put on hold due to limited contract capacity. While this is still causing slower rollouts, the program was unaltered by the OBBBA, meaning states can continue moving those programs forward and start offering home improvement incentives. Moving these projects forward also helps make people’s energy bills more affordable.

6. Attract manufacturing and lead cleantech innovation

The tax credits to support manufacturing remain, and efforts to re-build America’s manufacturing capacity are politically broadly popular. Not every state should build every kind of cleantech, but every state has strong economic development potential for some part of the clean energy economy. RMI’s Clean Growth Tool clarifies which industries each sub-state region is well-positioned for in terms of existing business and workforce skills.

States stepping up on manufacturing helps the United States secure a competitive position in one of the fastest growing parts of the economy and stay at the front edge of innovation. States can enhance their global competitiveness by further investing in the research, development, and commercialization of cleantech. The exciting opportunities for innovation in this space are only growing, and states can position themselves to be new global leaders. A few key innovation spaces include:

New battery technologies

Virtual power plants (VPPs) including AI management

Grid enhancing technologies (GETs)

Geologic hydrogen exploration

Solid state cooling

And many others

The meeting had two guest speakers, both of whom are against the push for carbon capture and storage.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a clear gas composed of one atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen. Carbon dioxide is one of many molecules where carbon is commonly found on the Earth, according to the National Energy Technology Laboratory. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the separation and capture of carbon dioxide from the emissions of industrial processes prior to release into the atmosphere and storage of the CO2 in deep underground geologic formations.

CCS is a way of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, according to www.nationalgrid.com.

Keith Guillory, an Oberlin resident, is a part of the “We the People” organization. He first heard about CCS in January and the organization was formed shortly after among a group of residents in Allen Parish who were concerned about what they were hearing.

“We feel it’s important to support each other, individual groups are fine, but if we can work together it will be more effective,” Guillory said.

Guillory said he’s done a lot of research and homework and said he’s done more research on this than his last two years at McNeese State University. According to him, the unknown effects of CCS play a big factor in his concerns.

“ ‘Experts’ seem to speak on how they know it will behave, but the fact is it has rarely been done before,” he said.

He is also concerned about the CCS migrating beyond its boundaries and poisoning the aquifers and all that it will affect in the future.

“I know my land will be worthless because it would be hazardous waste under my property, and if we don’t have clean water we’re doomed,” he said.

Carolyn Miller and Phyllis Doxey, residents of Grand Lake, came to the meeting to hear what CCS is all about. Neither had been to a meeting regarding it before and wanted to see for themselves what all the talk is about. They said they’ve seen it talked about on their Facebook feeds and have seen people for it and also people highly against it.

“My biggest concern is it leaking into our drinking water and into the marshes,” Miller said.

“We want to see some actual facts on how this is going to work and what it will do in our parish,” Doxey said.

Michael Nichols, a Pitkin resident and speaker at the meeting, has been in natural resources and management for over 40 years and is a water resource specialist for the USDA in Alexandria.

“Your peace and tranquility is going to be gone because you can smell natural gas, but you can’t smell this,” Nichols said.

He said the biggest reason he’s doing this is for his grandchildren and their future. Nichols said the land he and his family live on has been in the family for over four generations, but if CCS is put in the ground he lives on he will be moving.

“This is the fight for our future,” he said.

Jon West, a Leesville resident and a 20-year Army veteran with a bachelor’s in environmental management, spoke against CCS as well during the public meeting.

“The purpose of science is to question science,” West said.

West, along with Nichols, answered questions from the public following the meeting.

It is among more than two dozen lawsuits filed by Nessel against the administration.
“The Trump Administration’s decision to unilaterally cut off these funds is not only unlawful – it jeopardizes Michigan’s EV infrastructure, while threatening our economic growth and environmental progress,” Nessel said in a statement issued Monday.
But Trump on his first day in office mandated federal agencies to pause disbursement of all funding appropriated under the infrastructure act, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, including the EV infrastructure funding.
Nearly $29 million in congressionally-approved funding is currently unavailable.","The administration of President Donald Trump is illegally terminating billions of dollars in congressionally-approved funding for electric vehicle infrastructure, Attorney General Dana Nessel alleged in a new joint lawsuit filed Friday.

Nessel and 18 other attorneys general assert that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law, appropriated $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program over five fiscal years. It is among more than two dozen lawsuits filed by Nessel against the administration.

“The Trump Administration’s decision to unilaterally cut off these funds is not only unlawful – it jeopardizes Michigan’s EV infrastructure, while threatening our economic growth and environmental progress,” Nessel said in a statement issued Monday. “I will continue working to protect this critical funding and the future of transportation in our state.”

The NEVI program was created to fund the nationwide deployment of EV charging stations to improve charging reliability and accessibility. Approximately $87 million was apportioned to Michigan for fiscal years 2022 through 2025.

But Trump on his first day in office mandated federal agencies to pause disbursement of all funding appropriated under the infrastructure act, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, including the EV infrastructure funding.

Those funds were mandated by Congress, but the administration has since unlawfully revoked previously-approved state highway plans and said it was no longer committed to funding those projects.

Nearly $29 million in congressionally-approved funding is currently unavailable.

The lawsuit was jointly filed by Nessel and the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, as well as Kentucky Gov.

,American Energy,2025-08-04 16:59:41+00:00,Factor This™,The war on wind and solar continues; Interior using 'capacity density' to prioritize fossil fuel projects,Paul Gerke,,,,,https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/energy-business/policy-and-regulation/the-war-on-wind-and-solar-continues-interior-using-capacity-density-to-prioritize-fossil-fuel-projects/,"“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment,” Secretary Burgum stated.
Other Attacks on Wind and Solar Last week, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced it is rescinding all designated Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) on the U.S.
WEAs were established to identify offshore locations deemed most suitable for wind energy projects.
Secretary Burgum also announced four policy measures “ending special treatment for unreliable energy sources, such as wind,” that further undercut offshore development.
Analysis conducted by Enverus Intelligence Research suggests most solar and nearly half of planned wind projects won’t survive.","In what appears to be an unwitting ongoing act of self-sabotage that threatens grid reliability in an era of rapid load growth, the United States federal government is making wind and solar development even more difficult.

On Friday, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum signed a Secretary’s Order that all but ensures developers of neither technology will break ground on federal lands by changing the way the department reviews energy projects. Now, in accordance with other anti-renewable proclamations from the President’s desk, Interior “will consider the proposed energy project’s capacity density when assessing the project’s potential energy benefits to the nation and impacts to the environment and wildlife.” Under the guise of more efficiently managing domestic resources, Burgum’s office will prioritize permitting those that “optimize energy generation while minimizing their environmental impact.”

In short, that means greenlighting gas and coal development, since fossil fuels provide more energy density. Burgum lumps nuclear energy into the same conversation, citing federal data showing an advanced nuclear plant is 5,500 times more efficient than an offshore wind farm. However, the comparison doesn’t mean much at the moment, considering there won’t be any new nuclear in the U.S. any time soon, if its renaissance can sustain momentum and reach scale.

“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment,” Secretary Burgum stated. “By considering energy generation optimization, the Department will be able to better manage our federal lands, minimize environmental impact, and maximize energy development to further President Donald Trump’s energy goals. This commonsense order ensures our nation is stronger, our land use is optimized, and the American people are properly informed.”

Under the law, Interior must consider reasonable alternatives to proposed projects and make land use decisions, both onshore and offshore, that are “judicious.” Interior goes as far as raising the question of whether the use of federal lands for wind and solar projects is permissible, “given these projects’ encroachment on other land uses and their disproportionate land requirements, especially when reasonable project alternatives with higher capacity densities are technically and economically feasible.”

In a slightly ominous reading coda to Friday’s order, Interior says it will also identify and make the necessary revisions, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to any regulations, guidance, policies, or practices necessary to implement the order. We’ll keep our eyes peeled.

The Waiting Game

Lead times for delivery of gas turbines are five years or longer, meaning Burgum’s rhetoric either flies in the face of Trump’s “energy dominance” edicts or isn’t grounded in reality. Only three companies make them: Siemens, GE, and Mitsubishi, and if you call right now, you might be able to get your hands on one of the 120-130 advanced class turbines annually available… in 2030.

Solar and wind technologies are the least expensive and fastest to market generation solutions available, but step-up transformers, necessary for utility-scale solar and storage projects, are also a hot commodity that developers will have to wait for. Lead times range from 18 months to four years or more, depending on voltage.

Regardless of the state of the supply chain, disincentivizing any power production while staring down the barrel of massive load growth is self-defeating. However, that’s precisely what the U.S. government continues to do, increasing risks of brownouts and blackouts while guaranteeing increased electricity rates in all 50 states.

Other Attacks on Wind and Solar

Last week, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced it is rescinding all designated Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). WEAs were established to identify offshore locations deemed most suitable for wind energy projects. By rescinding them, BOEM de-designated more than 3.5 million acres of unleased federal waters previously targeted for offshore wind development across the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, California, Oregon, and the Central Atlantic.

Secretary Burgum also announced four policy measures “ending special treatment for unreliable energy sources, such as wind,” that further undercut offshore development. Earlier this year, President Trump instituted a sweeping moratorium on offshore wind, likening turbines to “garbage in a field” that “litters” the country, assuring “no new windmills” would be built during his second term in office.

In July, at the behest of Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey and Republican Senator Josh Hawley, the Department of Energy (DOE) terminated its financial support for the Grain Belt Express (GBE) Phase 1 project, a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line intended to transport renewable energy, namely wind and solar, across Kansas and Missouri. The feds’ conditional commitment, which would have provided a loan guarantee of up to $4.9 billion, was issued in November 2024. President Trump’s DOE now argues that it was “rushed out the door in the final days of the Biden administration.” After a review of the Grain Belt Express’s financials, DOE concluded that the conditions necessary to issue the guarantee are “unlikely to be met” and it is “not critical” for the federal government to have a role in supporting it.

Jigar Shah, former director of the LPO, questioned the legality of DOE’s actions on LinkedIn.

“This decision is illegal,” Shah wrote. “When the Loan Programs Office (LPO) applicant meets all of the requirements that are set for the conditional commitment, then the Department of Energy is obligated to close the loan.”

Chicago-based Invenergy announced shortly thereafter that the project would continue with support from private funding.

The hotly contested budget reconciliation bill passed this summer, championed by Trump, greatly disincentivizes both wind and solar development by shortening the window to capitalize on tax credit incentives for such projects. In addition, tariffs on critical minerals and imported components are making construction (unpredictably) more expensive.

As one might expect, a growing list of well-intentioned developers has either paused work or pulled out of the U.S. market entirely.

“It's one thing for a city like Keene or Portsmouth to have people working on their flood mitigation proposals,” said Paul Friedrichs, a NH Health Climate board member.
The money was part of the Environmental and Climate Justice Program, a part of the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.
In Maryland, a US district judge recently ruled the EPA illegally terminated grants in the Environment and Climate Justice program.
Paul Friedrich says he believes the NH Healthy Climate grant funding was also wrongly canceled because of the EPA’s move away from DEI.","The federal Environmental Protection Agency is withholding funding that would have gone towards extreme weather education and disaster preparedness in Cheshire County.

The group NH Healthy Climate had planned on using $75,000 towards preparing rural Cheshire County towns for potentially disastrous flooding in the future.

“It's one thing for a city like Keene or Portsmouth to have people working on their flood mitigation proposals,” said Paul Friedrichs, a NH Health Climate board member. “But you take a town of Langdon with a population of six or 700 people, they're not going to have the resources to do that flood preparation planning.”

Friedrichs recalled parts of Cheshire County experienced a major flooding event in October, 2005 that killed seven people and destroyed over 100 homes. More recent flooding in 2021 and 2023 destroyed roads and buildings.

But this spring, the group, which focuses on climate change’s impact on health in the state, learned from the grant administrator that even though its grant application was accepted, the EPA wouldn’t be funding it. The money was part of the Environmental and Climate Justice Program, a part of the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The program includes a grantmaking process that funds community initiatives to address environmental issues.

“It’s very unfortunate that the EPA does not believe that these communities need this minimal funding – $75,000 for our grant compared to the millions of dollars lost in any given flood,” Friedrichs said.

Over 30 New England organizations and many more across the country had grant proposals accepted as part of the EPA’s environmental justice program but did not receive the funding. One of the regional grant administrators for New England, Boston-based Health Resources in Action, joined a class action lawsuit in June challenging the EPA’s move to terminate the grants.

“There are irreparable harms that have been a result of the termination,” Ben Wood, Senior Director of Policy and Practice at Health Resources in Action, said.

“[These organizations] are trying to solve incredibly important community-based issues that will address environmental harms and the impacts of climate change. And without those dollars, those communities have one less tool in the toolbox to address those immediate and critical needs.”

The EPA told NHPR it doesn't comment on any current or pending litigation.

In Maryland, a US district judge recently ruled the EPA illegally terminated grants in the Environment and Climate Justice program. The plaintiffs were three regional organizations selected by the EPA to distribute the grants to local community groups. In an initial grant termination letter to the organizations, the EPA told the plaintiffs it was no longer supporting environmental justice and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which it alleged the organizations were promoting with their grants.

The EPA told NHPR it is reviewing the decision.

Paul Friedrich says he believes the NH Healthy Climate grant funding was also wrongly canceled because of the EPA’s move away from DEI.

“Our grant award was focusing on helping small towns in southwestern New Hampshire prepare for and address the risk of recurrent flooding, as there was in 2005,” Friedrichs said.

“Rural New Hampshire [are] the people that we want to take benefits away from because somehow that's equity and inclusion? I just don't get it.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9023638/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1286x675+0+177/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2F99%2Fe81a3dbd48d9a172688d927e6675%2Fimg-1492.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 14:07:31.346906

Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission issued a statement supporting the case, and adding that the Trump administration “has vowed to fight left-wing ideologues who seek to make us weaker and poorer under the guise of ESG.
Notably, the asset managers have all exited or significantly reduced their participation in the climate initiatives.
According to the ruling, the asset managers’ motions argued that as passive investors, they can’t be liable under the Clayton Act due to their stock purchases, and that the suit fails to allege a plausible agreement to harm competition.
Today’s victory represents a major step in holding them accountable.” In their statements, the asset managers said that they would continue to fight the allegations, with Vanguard saying that it “looks forward to the opportunity to vigorously defend against plaintiffs’ claims,” and State Street adding that “there is no collusion here, and we remain confident that the facts and legal substance are on our side,” while BlackRock said that “this case is not supported by the facts, and we will demonstrate that.” BlackRock added:","A U.S. federal judge has denied motions to dismiss most of the claims in a multistate lawsuit accusing asset managers BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street of violating antitrust laws and conspiring to use sustainable investment initiatives to manipulate coal markets, allowing the case to proceed.

In statements received by ESG Today from the asset managers, Vanguard said that it was “disappointed in the court’s decision,” while BlackRock said that the “case is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.” State Street said that the lawsuit “remains baseless and without merit,” and focused on “efforts to advance a new and dangerous antitrust theory,” adding that it “poses unnecessary risk to investors and energy markets.”

The case, launched by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and joined by 10 other Republican states in late 2024, claimed that the asset managers acquired large shareholdings in major coal producers in the U.S., and used their combined influence to coerce the companies to cut coal production to accommodate clean energy investment goals, resulting in higher energy costs for U.S. consumers. Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission issued a statement supporting the case, and adding that the Trump administration “has vowed to fight left-wing ideologues who seek to make us weaker and poorer under the guise of ESG. “

The suit alleges that the firms violated the Clayton Act, which prohibits the acquisition of shares of companies in which “the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition,” and claims that the firms “effectively formed a syndicate and agreed to use their collective holdings of publicly traded coal companies to induce industry-wide output reductions,” by joining initiatives such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAM) and Climate Action 100+, noting that each initiative requires commitments from asset managers to engage with portfolio companies to align with climate goals. Notably, the asset managers have all exited or significantly reduced their participation in the climate initiatives.

According to the ruling, the asset managers’ motions argued that as passive investors, they can’t be liable under the Clayton Act due to their stock purchases, and that the suit fails to allege a plausible agreement to harm competition.

In the ruling, however, U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle said that the states’ claims “are not vague and conclusory but include dozens of specific examples of Defendants’ conduct supporting their theory,” noting as an example that the firms “allegedly joined certain “climate initiatives” in which they publicly committed to use their stock to “take necessary action on climate change” and “reduce greenhouse gas emissions.””

Kernodle added:

“Plaintiffs have identified enough circumstantial evidence to suggest that Defendants agreed to collectively pressure coal companies to reduce the output of coal in the relevant markets and disclose future output information.”

The ruling did point out, however, that the states “may ultimately be unable to prove” their claim that the asset managers used their stock holdings to decrease coal output,” or “that Defendants entered into an agreement to pressure the Coal Companies that led to anticompetitive effects in the relevant coal markets.” The ruling also noted that the states’ claims “lack direct evidence of a conspiracy,” and rely instead on the asset managers’ decisions to join the climate initiatives, and on circumstantial evidence, which the court conceded “is a close call.”

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called the ruling a “major victory against BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard,” adding:

“BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—three of the most powerful financial corporations in the world—created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets and squeeze more money out of hardworking Americans. Today’s victory represents a major step in holding them accountable.”

In their statements, the asset managers said that they would continue to fight the allegations, with Vanguard saying that it “looks forward to the opportunity to vigorously defend against plaintiffs’ claims,” and State Street adding that “there is no collusion here, and we remain confident that the facts and legal substance are on our side,” while BlackRock said that “this case is not supported by the facts, and we will demonstrate that.”

A pioneering ‘second-life’ battery startup begins major Texas expansion

Canary Media – July 29

Five years ago, B2U Storage Solutions proved that old EV batteries could hook up to the grid to store clean energy, safely and cheaply. Now the company is taking the concept to Texas. B2U just broke ground on a second-life grid battery project in Bexar County. In the next 12 months, B2U will complete four projects in the region, totaling 100 MWh of storage, CEO Freeman Hall said. B2U stores up to 28 MWh at its first project, in Lancaster, California, and also developed two other smaller facilities in the state.

From October 2024 to January 2025, hybrid and electric vehicles accounted for 25% of new vehicle sales in the United States — a 32% year-over-year increase, according to S&P Global.

The American EV segment may be showing electrifying growth these days, but global tiremaker Nokian Tyres has developed tires with EVs in mind for many years. Way back in 2012, the inventor of the winter and all-weather passenger tires set a world record for the fastest electric vehicle on ice. Every tire the company makes comes with an Electric Fit marking that certifies it's a seamless fit for EVs.

What does Nokian Tyres have to say about EV tires? And how are tiremakers working hard to meet the needs of this emerging market?

It starts by recognizing the unique demands electric vehicles place on tires.

Weight

Electric vehicles are generally 10 to 15% heavier than internal combustion engine vehicles. That places extra wear and tear on traditional tires. Rubber that isn't durable enough to withstand the added bulk will wear out more quickly, and sometimes irregularly.

That makes blowouts more likely and driving less efficient. The added weight can also increase braking time and cause handling issues on challenging surfaces, such as rain or wintry precipitation.

Tiremakers seek to account for the heavier load by constructing tires with heavier-duty materials and formulating rubber compounds to be more responsive to the road. Nokian Tyres reinforces its EV-compatible products with robust internal structures and advanced materials that maintain stability and durability under heavier loads. The result is a tire that delivers confident handling and long-lasting performance, even under the increased demands of electric mobility.

Noise

Without the hum of an engine, EVs make road noise more noticeable. The main sound drivers notice in the cabin is the noise of tires touching the road. Tire manufacturers seek to mitigate noise frequencies by using tread patterns, rubber compounds and materials that dampen sound waves.

Nokian Tyres addresses this with innovative noise-reduction technologies, including silent sidewall designs and optimized tread patterns that absorb sound and reduce vibration. Nokian Tyres inserts acoustic foam into its dedicated EV winter products, the Nokian Tyres Hakkapeliitta 10 EV and R5 EV. The result is a smoother, quieter ride that complements the serene driving experience EV owners expect.

Torque

Electric vehicles are powerful. They often deliver two to three times more torque than comparable ICE vehicles, especially in the mainstream and luxury segments. And because that torque is available instantly, EVs feel quicker and more responsive in everyday driving.

That extra acceleration power presents a challenge to tires, since rapid changes in speed can cause them to wear more quickly. Drivers should pursue tires that can withstand high torque and deliver grip that maximizes their vehicles' acceleration power. The key: tread patterns and rubber compounds that balance durability and responsiveness.

Nokian Tyres engineers its EV tires with advanced tread compounds and reinforced structures that resist abrasion and maintain grip under sudden acceleration. This helps drivers enjoy the full performance of their EVs without compromising safety or longevity.

Range

Tire design plays a critical role in EV range. High rolling resistance can drain battery life, while optimized tires can help extend it.

How do tiremakers lower the rolling resistance of their tires, helping to optimize EV range? Design plays a big role. According to Nokian Tyres, a tire's sidewall construction, tread pattern and rubber compound play a role in reducing rolling resistance.

Nokian Tyres' EV-compatible products feature low-rolling-resistance compounds that reduce energy loss and improve efficiency; in fact, more than 90% of Nokian Tyres products rank in the lowest categories of rolling resistance. This means drivers can go farther on a single charge — an essential benefit for those looking to maximize their vehicle's potential.

For the right driver, electric vehicles can offer big advantages over rides powered by internal combustion engines. But that's only true if the tires are up to the challenge.",https://d372qxeqh8y72i.cloudfront.net/b084602e-9175-45a7-bfb3-865ed13136aa_wide.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 13:09:29.958579

Enbridge has approved $2 billion in energy projects, including a $900 million solar facility for Meta and major natural gas infrastructure expansions to support industrial demand.

Strong Q2 results and a $30 billion project backlog position the company to capitalize on rising energy needs in data centers, LNG, and the industrial sector.

Strategic Indigenous partnerships and disciplined capital allocation underscore Enbridge’s long-term focus on sustainable growth and investor value.

Enbridge Inc. is accelerating its infrastructure investments with the launch of projects worth approximately $2 billion, designed to meet rising power demand from data centers, the industrial sector, and LNG markets across North America.

The Canadian energy giant reported a record adjusted EBITDA of C$4.6 billion in Q2 2025, a 7% year-over-year increase. “Our diversified energy investment strategy continues to generate strong results and predictable returns,” said President and CEO Greg Ebel, citing a project backlog that now exceeds $30 billion across four business segments.

Solar Power for Meta’s Data Demands

The Clear Fork Solar project is the centerpiece of Enbridge’s latest investments. Located near San Antonio, Texas, the 600-megawatt facility represents a US$900 million commitment and is backed by a long-term power purchase agreement with Meta Platforms Inc. The project is slated for commissioning in 2027.

This initiative supports Meta’s need for sustainable, reliable energy to fuel its expanding data center operations. Enbridge noted that recent U.S. tax credit changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will not affect Clear Fork or other late-stage renewable projects.

Natural Gas Network Expansions

Enbridge is also strengthening its natural gas infrastructure to support growing industrial activity. The Line 31 expansion of Texas Eastern Transmission, a US$100 million project, will add up to 160 million cubic feet per day of capacity with a new lateral in Mississippi. This is underpinned by firm long-term contracts.

In British Columbia, the company is investing C$300 million in the Aitken Creek expansion, adding 40 billion cubic feet of storage—the only underground facility of its kind in the province. Ten-year storage contracts tied to LNG export demand have substantially de-risked the project.

Strategic Asset Moves and Pipeline Growth

Enbridge has closed its acquisition of a 10% stake in the Matterhorn Express Pipeline, a key Permian Basin asset delivering 2.5 billion cubic feet per day to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

It also announced the expansion of the Traverse Pipeline, increasing capacity from 1.75 to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day to serve growing demand between Agua Dulce and Katy, Texas. Additionally, Enbridge secured new commitments on the Southeast Supply Header Pipeline to meet rising demand in the southeastern U.S.

Operational Performance and Project Pipeline

Despite market volatility, Enbridge’s diversified model continues to perform. Its Mainline system transported 3 million barrels per day in Q2, with strong apportionment continuing through July and August. The company also closed an oversubscribed open season for the Flanagan South Pipeline, supporting approval of Mainline Optimization Phase 1 later this year.

Gas distribution saw adjusted EBITDA rise to C$840 million in Q2, up C$273 million year-over-year, driven by U.S. utility acquisitions, rate increases, customer growth, and colder weather in Ontario.

Indigenous Partnership Milestone

Enbridge closed a C$700 million transaction with the Stonlasec8 Indigenous Alliance, granting the group a 12.5% stake in the Westcoast Pipeline. The deal includes a C$400 million loan guarantee from the Canada Development Investment Corporation and marks a significant step in Enbridge’s commitment to Indigenous inclusion and capital recycling.

“This partnership with 38 First Nations delivers lasting economic value to communities and reflects our broader sustainability approach,” the company stated.

Financial Outlook and Capital Discipline

Enbridge reaffirmed its 2025 guidance, targeting adjusted EBITDA between C$19.4 and C$20 billion and distributable cash flow per share of $5.50 to $5.90. Its debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 4.7x, below the midpoint of its target range.

The company updated its Woodfibre LNG investment exposure to US$2.9 billion, with return parameters to be finalized closer to project completion. Backed by 15-year offtake agreements with BP Gas Marketing for 100% capacity, the project ensures stable cash flows.

With annual investment capacity of $9–10 billion and a longer-term $50 billion opportunity set, Enbridge’s disciplined strategy supports annual dividend growth and secures its position as a leading North American energy infrastructure investment.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Enbridge-Commits-2-Billion-to-Solar-and-Gas-Projects-to-Power-Data-Centers-and-Industrial-Growth.webp,N,,2025-08-04 14:08:59.953746

“That’s not just the best US sales month ever for Equinox EV – it is the best ever for a non-Tesla EV in the US,” GM stated.

The Equinox EV starts below $35,000 and offers a range of up to 319 miles.

GM’s EV sales rose 115% year-on-year in July. In the first half of 2025, the Detroit automaker delivered more than 78,000 electric vehicles — more than double the volume recorded in the same period last year.

Chevrolet ended the first half as the second best-selling EV brand in the US, surpassing Ford and Hyundai, and helping GM secure a 12.9% share of the domestic EV market, second only to Tesla — according to Cox Automotive.

GM’s total US vehicle sales rose 7% in the second quarter and 12% in the first half of 2025.

Despite the strong top-line growth, analysts remain cautious.

Bernstein said last week that GM’s second-quarter results “looked fine on paper,” but pointed to deteriorating margins in North America and renewed losses in the EV business, exacerbated by tariffs.

Still, some analysts remain constructive. Bernstein’s Daniel Roeska raised his price target on GM shares to $41 from $36 last week, citing improved visibility on trade-related headwinds.

These credits have aided Tesla's overall margins, even when car sales were under pressure. But that extra boost is shrinking fast now. And if the trend continues, it could just worsen things for the company.

Tesla has been selling billions of dollars’ worth of regulatory credits to legacy automakers who needed them to offset their gas-guzzling vehicle fleets and avoid fines. The revenues—more than $10.6 billion since 2019—have been a critical boost to Tesla’s profits, especially during times when the core business struggled to stay in the black.

In Q2’25, Tesla reported $439 million in regulatory credit revenues. On the surface, that still looks solid. But the trend tells a different story. Credit sales have fallen sharply from $890 million in Q2’24, marking a nearly 50% drop in just a year. And it’s not a blip—it’s a steady slide. From $739 million in Q3’24 to $692 million in Q4’24, then $595 million in Q1’25—and now $439 million.

Policy Shifts and EV Competition Add Pressure

Last month, President Trump’s tax and spending bill officially scrapped the penalties for automakers failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. That’s a game-changer. Automakers who previously bought credits from Tesla to avoid hefty fines—over $1.1 billion worth from 2011 to 2020—now have no reason to do so. The penalty is effectively gone.

That removes the key incentive behind Tesla’s regulatory credit windfall. And it couldn’t come at a worse time. Tesla is already facing a slump in deliveries and profits. The company recently posted two straight quarters of delivery declines. Without credit sales to somewhat plug the gap, Tesla’s core business will face more pressure.

Some automakers may still have long-term credit purchase agreements with Tesla, but those contracts may be renegotiated—or even canceled—early. In fact, the credit revenues could disappear by next year.

And it's not just the policy shift. Many legacy automakers like General Motors GM, Ford F and Stellantis STLA are also shifting their gears to electric. As they scale up their EV output and reduce emissions, they need fewer regulatory credits.

A Fading Lifeline Tesla Can’t Ignore

While headlines are busy tracking CEO Elon Musk’s political battles or the loss of $7,500 EV buyer tax credits, this regulatory credit risk of Tesla has not gotten much attention. But the risk is real—and growing.

Regulatory credits have quietly propped up Tesla’s profits for years. But the safety net could be vanishing. Unless Tesla can make up for the loss with stronger sales, tighter cost controls or big wins in robotaxis, the road ahead could get bumpier.

The Zacks Rundown for Tesla

Dominion Energy’s 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is still on schedule for completion by the end of 2026, and should qualify for Inflation Reduction Act tax credits under the new safe harbor deadlines, the utility’s leadership said in a Friday earnings call.

However, the company expects a slightly higher price tag for the project due to President Trump’s new tariff policies. Dominion estimates that the new tariffs will make the project more expensive by $506 million, increasing the total cost of the project to $10.9 billion. The added expenses will increase customer bills by an average of three cents a month over the entire life of the project, said Bob Blue, Dominion’s president, CEO and chairman.

The utility has slightly lowered its expectations for tariff-related price increases since last quarter “despite a doubling of the steel tariff,” Blue said, “due to both working with vendors to identify cost mitigation strategies as well as completing our analysis of the final trade regulations and appendices.”

Dive Insight:

Blue said that the proposed tariff increases for Mexico and the European Union would add an additional $134 million to the project’s costs.

“The project fabrication and installation are going very well, and CVOW continues to be one of the most affordable sources of energy for our customers,” he said. “We will install our first turbine in September, which is in line with our original schedule … In fact, we’re well ahead of plan, installing monopiles at a pace that exceeds any other U.S. offshore wind project to date.”

Blue said the project has installed 134 of its 176 monopiles, or 76%, and all of its pin piles.

Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Congress appropriated $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI) over five fiscal years. The NEVI program was created to fund the nationwide deployment of EV charging stations to improve charging reliability and accessibility for the public. Of the appropriated funds, $87 million was apportioned to Michigan for fiscal years 2022 through 2025.

On January 20, President Trump mandated federal agencies pause disbursement of all funds appropriated under the IIJA and the Inflation Reduction Act, including NEVI program funding. Despite being mandated by Congress to fund the NEVI program, the Federal Highway Administration notified states in February that the agency was unlawfully revoking previous state plan approvals and would not obligate additional funds for the program. Approximately $29 million in congressionally appropriated NEVI funding for Michigan is currently unavailable for obligation.

Sign up for their newsletter here.

East of San Antonio in Bexar County, 500 electric vehicle batteries at the end of their automotive lives will soon be repurposed to provide energy storage for Texas’ electric grid, a California company, B2U Storage Solutions, announced on August 29.

The batteries, housed in 21 cabinets the size of shipping containers, create a second life for the technology made from critical minerals, including lithium, nickel and cobalt, for another eight years, said Freeman Hall, co-founder and CEO.

Once the site is built and in operation later this year, the batteries will charge when there is an excess of renewable energy production on the grid and the cost of power is cheap. The Texas facility will have a total capacity of 24 megawatt hours.

B2U Storage Solutions, based in Los Angeles, plans to deploy three more grid-storage projects in Texas throughout the next year, totalling 100 megawatt hours across the state, the company said. Assuming the average household uses 30 kilowatt hours per day, it’s enough energy to power 3,330 homes for a day, Hall said.

The site near San Antonio will interconnect to the CPS Energy distribution system, one of the nation’s largest city-owned utility companies.

“We’re really helping to pioneer and demonstrate to the automotive industry that repurposing makes a lot of sense for a pretty healthy number of batteries before they’re truly ready for end of life and recycling,” Hall said in an interview.

An epiphany in novel energy storage

Hall and chief operating officer Michael Stern began building industrial-scale solar projects almost 20 years ago in the California cities of Palmdale, El Centro and Mojave, installing some 100 megawatts, or enough electricity to power more than 15,000 homes.

But soon, as more solar began connecting to the grid, their bids to utilities were undermined by a developing “duck curve” – industry shorthand for when higher penetration of renewables on the grid depresses energy prices during sunlit hours followed by a cost spike in the evening as there’s a loss of sun.

“That’s what inspired us to realize that we needed to add storage to our projects,” Hall said. “Along the way, we had an epiphany.”

How subsidized leasing can drive EV adoption

Who’s trying to kill the $17,000 electric car?

Lack of charging stations in high-rise buildings is cutting off access to EVs

In looking for battery storage options for their solar projects, the two developers realized the first wave of commercial EV batteries were beginning to wrap up their roughly 10-year automotive life. Aware of research that these batteries’ state-of-health, measuring the difference between a new battery and a used one, circled up to 80 percent, Hall and Stern hypothesized that they could build technology to use the battery packs as they came from the vehicle, avoiding any repurposing costs.

So the two solar developers purchased 300 Nissan Leaf batteries. The carmaker had run into a powertrain warranty issue with the world’s first mass-market EV, as the range they promised in the lease with the customer fell short.

To fix the warranty and guarantee, Nissan swapped out the battery packs and found themselves with thousands of batteries that were still useful, Hall said, just not for driving. The batteries still had thousands of cycles left in a less-demanding scenario, like stationary storage for renewable energy.

That’s when the solar developers initiated the EV pack storage technology fundamental to B2U, which currently operates three facilities using retired batteries from electric vehicles like Teslas, the Honda Clarity and Nissan Leaf in California.

B2U’s technology allows the company to buy the retired EV battery packs without having to modify them, creating large-scale storage projects for less than if they were installing new batteries.

A coming wave of available energy storage

The global electric car fleet reached almost 58 million by the end of 2024, or about 4 percent of all cars on the road, according to an International Energy Agency 2025 EV Report. It’s more than triple the amount of electric cars in 2021.

The batteries in electric vehicles are typically replaced once they reach around 70 to 80 percent of their capacity as its range begins to diminish. As more EV batteries retire throughout the coming decade, the second-life EV battery market is forecasted to grow into a $4.2 billion industry by 2035, according to a December report by IDTechEx, a technology market research firm.

You haven’t heard about it much to date. But you will be hearing a lot more about it going forward.

– Freeman Hall, co-founder and CEO, B2U Storage Solutions

As the burgeoning industry in the U.S. advances, second-life battery reuse will become less expensive to operate, the report said, as new technology develops and speeds up the process. For instance, quality assurance currently can take hours to complete but the report suggests that soon technology will pare the process down to minutes. These cost savings will be especially important as loans and incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act that supported a growing domestic recycling industry expire.

The opportunities within Texas’ competitive, wholesale grid market are what led Hall and his company to consider operating outside of their California headquarters, Hall said.

As a storage power generator, B2U is able to sell power after cheaply charging it and provide ancillary services to the grid, or get paid by the grid operators to help curb frequency deviations and imbalances.

Batteries have made significant capacity contributions within Texas’ electric grid in recent years and have been credited with helping prevent summer blackouts by bolstering grid reliability. Nearly 4,000 of the 9,600 megawatts of capacity added to the grid since last summer came from energy storage, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

The latest generation interconnection report shows that more than 700 standalone battery storage projects and more than 300 battery plus solar projects are in line to connect to ERCOT.

Last year, another California-based company, Element Energy, began storing electricity using 900 second-life EV batteries within ERCOT. The West Texas site totals 53 megawatt hours of storage capacity, making it one of the nation’s largest retired EV battery projects, according to Element.

Solving the technical challenges for second-life batteries

B2U manages more than 2,000 retired batteries through its system, which coordinates the performance of the batteries, cabinet and overall power plant. The data they collect in real time allows them to monitor the temperature of the battery packs and voltage levels. The firm has another 2,000 end-of-automative life batteries at some stage of deployment, Hall said, that will soon be ready to plug into the grid.

Each time the firm receives a batch of EV batteries, B2U performs its own diagnostic tests, with some 5 or 6 percent rejected due to substandard health.

The testing, coupled with how they configure the batteries in their cabinets, allow the retired batteries to operate despite variance in their capacities. In laymen’s terms, if a weaker battery has charged up and reached its voltage limit, the way B2U links their battery packs ensures that the stronger batteries can keep charging until they’re full.

“That’s kind of key to solving the problem of second-life batteries,” Hall said.

Repurposed EV batteries aren’t something you hear of much in ERCOT, or in other grids across the U.S. As one of the early innovators, it’s taken B2U nearly five years to get the core technology ironed out, cost effective and ready to scale, Hall said.

He said they got their timing just right. Since they started B2U in 2019, EV car sales in North America have nearly tripled. It means a steady flow of retirement-ready batteries available for their next career stabilizing the grid and staving off early recycling of critical minerals.

“You haven’t heard about it much to date,” Hall said about second-life EV battery use. “But you will be hearing a lot more about it going forward.”

The funding was secured by members of the Oregon delegation as an essential community project included in the Fiscal Year 2024 government funding package.

“I’m thrilled Gresham will receive nearly $1 million in funding to make our community’s water cleaner and our environment healthier,” said Congresswoman Dexter. “This is just the beginning.

In Port of Tacoma, the petitioners challenged a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruling that allowed environmental groups to enforce state-issued Clean Water Act (“CWA”) permits in federal court, even when those permits contained requirements more stringent than federal law. This case centered on alleged violations of Washington State’s Industrial Stormwater General Permit, with Puget Soundkeeper Alliance arguing for accountability for polluted runoff from a wharf.

The Supreme Court’s denial of cert in this instance means that the Ninth Circuit’s expansive interpretation stands. This outcome is crucial because it allows citizens in circuits aligned with the Ninth (and Fourth and Eleventh) Circuit to continue to enforce the full scope of state-issued National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permits. This is a considerable win for states seeking to implement stricter environmental protections and for citizen groups dedicated to upholding them.

It also highlights a continuing circuit split on this issue, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has a narrower view. But for now, the broader interpretation prevails in a significant portion of the country.

ExxonMobil: Affirming Broad Standing and Penalties

The ExxonMobil case involved a prolonged battle over air pollution from ExxonMobil’s Baytown, Texas, petrochemical complex. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had upheld a substantial $14.25 million civil penalty against Exxon, the largest ever in a Clean Air Act (“CAA”) citizen suit. ExxonMobil had urged the Supreme Court to revisit its 2000 precedent in Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., which established that civil penalties paid to the government could satisfy Article III’s “redressability” requirement for citizen plaintiffs. The company also sought to impose a more restrictive standard for demonstrating “traceability” of injuries to specific violations.

By denying cert, the Supreme Court left the Fifth Circuit’s decision undisturbed, affirming the broad interpretation of standing for citizen plaintiffs and reiterating that civil penalties can serve as a deterrent and redress injuries in citizen suits. This outcome is a significant affirmation of the fundamental principles underpinning environmental citizen enforcement, ensuring that groups like Environment Texas and the Sierra Club can continue to pursue accountability for environmental violations and secure substantial penalties that discourage future noncompliance.

The Landscape Ahead: More Citizen Suits Expected

The implications of these denials are clear: Environmental groups are poised to leverage these victories to intensify their citizen suit efforts. The CWA and CAA, along with over a dozen other federal environmental statutes, explicitly include citizen suit provisions, recognizing that government enforcement agencies may not always have the resources or the political will to pursue every violation.

As federal enforcement priorities potentially shift, citizen suits are expected to become an even more vital backstop, filling any perceived gaps in regulatory oversight. This means regulated entities should anticipate a heightened risk of litigation from environmental organizations, underscoring the critical importance of robust environmental compliance programs. The ability of citizens to seek both injunctive relief and significant civil penalties payable to the U.S. Treasury provides a powerful incentive for companies to adhere to environmental regulations.

In essence, the Supreme Court’s recent order list has reinforced the power of the public in environmental protection, solidifying the legal avenues for citizens to act as guardians of the nation’s air and water. This decision ensures that citizen suits will continue to be a formidable force in environmental litigation for the foreseeable future.

What This Means for Industry

Increased Legal Risk: Industries should anticipate a rise in citizen-led litigation, particularly from well-organized advocacy groups capable of using regulatory data and compliance reports to build strong cases.

Compliance Pressure: Regulatory compliance will no longer be a shield only scrutinized by the government. Any violation, even minor or self-reported, may trigger a lawsuit from a citizen group.

Litigation Costs: Even unsuccessful suits can entail significant legal costs and reputational damage. For example, ExxonMobil’s litigation spanned over a decade, involving appeals and millions in legal fees.

How Companies Can Protect Themselves

To mitigate this new landscape of liability, companies—especially those operating in manufacturing, energy, and logistics—should adopt proactive risk-management strategies.

Robust Compliance Systems: Implement and document environmental controls in real time. Use third-party audits to verify compliance with discharge, emissions, and permit conditions.

Transparency and Community Engagement: Foster open communication with local communities and environmental groups. Transparency can reduce adversarial relationships and build trust.

Rapid Incident Response: Ensure that any environmental release, even if minor, is addressed immediately and logged properly. Self-correction and voluntary reporting may reduce the likelihood of a lawsuit.

Legal Risk Assessments: Conduct periodic assessments to identify areas where past or current practices may be vulnerable to citizen suits. Remediate proactively.

Looking Ahead

The Supreme Court’s June 30 decision sends a clear signal: Citizen suits are here to stay—and may even be growing in power and frequency. While this strengthens environmental accountability, it also places added pressure on industries to go beyond minimum legal compliance and embrace more holistic environmental governance practices.

Potential for Broader Industry Transformation Ford’s strategy extends beyond vehicles to ecosystem building, including partnerships for charging networks and software updates.","Ford Motor Co. is gearing up for what its chief executive calls a “Model T moment,” a bold pivot aimed at democratizing electric vehicles in an era dominated by high costs and foreign competition. CEO Jim Farley has been vocal about the company’s strategy to introduce a new family of affordable EVs, drawing parallels to the revolutionary 1908 Model T that transformed personal transportation. This initiative comes as Ford seeks to counter the surge of low-cost Chinese EVs flooding global markets, with Farley warning that without adaptation, Western automakers risk obsolescence.

Details emerging from recent announcements suggest the lineup will kick off with a compact electric pickup, potentially priced around $25,000, designed to appeal to budget-conscious consumers and small businesses. Ford’s sustainability chief, Bob Holycross, has indicated a broader shift toward hybrids and extended-range models to address range anxiety, a persistent barrier to EV adoption. This move aligns with Ford’s broader electrification goals, even as the company navigates profitability challenges in its EV division.

Ford’s Strategic Shift Amid Global Pressures

The push for affordability stems from intense competition, particularly from Chinese manufacturers producing over 70% of the world’s EVs with advanced tech integration. As reported in a recent article by WebProNews, Farley has described this as an “existential threat,” prompting Ford to develop a secretive skunkworks project in California. This team, led by former Tesla engineers, is focused on a breakthrough platform that could underpin multiple models, emphasizing cost efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Insiders note that Ford’s approach involves innovative manufacturing techniques, such as modular battery designs and simplified assembly processes, to slash production costs. The company plans to reveal more details on August 11, as teased in coverage from TechCrunch, though the first vehicles aren’t expected until 2027. This timeline allows Ford to refine technologies like extended-range capabilities, blending small batteries with gasoline generators for longer trips.

Innovation Drawing from Historical Roots

Echoing the Model T’s impact, Farley envisions these EVs as game-changers for mass adoption, potentially including crossovers and SUVs alongside the initial pickup. According to insights in Autoblog, the family will prioritize radical cost reductions, aiming to undercut rivals like Tesla’s entry-level models and emerging Chinese imports. Ford’s future vehicle lineup, detailed on its official site, hints at enhanced fuel economy and smart tech integration, building on successes like the F-150 Lightning.

Industry analysts see this as a calculated response to slowing EV sales growth in the U.S., where high prices and charging infrastructure gaps have tempered enthusiasm. Ford’s hybrid pivot, as outlined in a Bloomberg report, could bridge the gap, offering consumers flexible options while battery tech evolves. Recent posts on X from automotive enthusiasts reflect optimism, with many praising Ford’s proactive stance against Chinese dominance, though some express skepticism about delivery timelines.

Challenges and Market Implications

Despite the hype, Ford faces hurdles, including supply chain vulnerabilities and regulatory pressures for emissions reductions. The company’s EV losses have been substantial, prompting a reevaluation of its all-electric ambitions. As Farley stated in an interview with the Detroit Free Press, beating the Chinese requires not just innovation but speed to market.

Looking ahead, this affordable EV family could reshape Ford’s portfolio, potentially boosting its market share in emerging segments like urban delivery and personal mobility. Competitors like GM and Stellantis are watching closely, with their own low-cost EV plans in the works. For industry insiders, Ford’s reveal on August 11 will be a litmus test of whether this “Model T moment” lives up to its historical billing, or if it’s merely another chapter in the turbulent transition to electrification.

Potential for Broader Industry Transformation

Ford’s strategy extends beyond vehicles to ecosystem building, including partnerships for charging networks and software updates. Insights from TechRadar highlight expectations for models that rival Chinese efficiency, with features like over-the-air updates and AI-driven interfaces. This could pressure suppliers to innovate, fostering a ripple effect across the auto sector.

Ultimately, success hinges on execution. If Ford delivers on its promises, it might not only regain competitive footing but also accelerate global EV adoption, making sustainable transport accessible to millions. As the August reveal approaches, the industry holds its breath, anticipating whether this initiative will indeed echo the Model T’s legacy or fall short in a fiercely competitive arena.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-df0cc6a1-4f7d-4544-b8bc-6c4f83af5683.jpeg,N,,2025-08-04 14:08:10.766613

The National Grid Summer College Scholars Program provides full scholarships to 20–25 students annually to attend Summer College – On Campus at Syracuse University. Funded by National Grid, the program covers tuition, housing, and fees, allowing students to explore STEM-focused courses—many with energy themes—while gaining exposure to college life and careers in clean energy.

“We are looking to tomorrow as we partner with Syracuse University to invest and develop the skills and mindsets of the next generation of engineers today,” said John Pettigrew, CEO of National Grid, at the August 2025 launch event.

Long-Term Vision for Energy Equity

Over the next three years, this sustained investment aims to build both energy literacy and opportunity across underserved communities in Central New York. Courses offered will span both credit and noncredit tracks and include new curricula designed around energy systems and sustainability.

“This partnership is a shared investment in equity, education, and the future of energy,” said Christopher Cofer, executive director of Syracuse’s Office of Pre-College Programs.

National Grid’s Vice President for U.S. Social Impact and Community Engagement, Robert Simmons III, emphasized the broader impact:

“More than inspiring young minds and preparing students for energy-related careers, this program strengthens our communities and drives progress for decades to come.”

How It Compares: A National Movement

The National Grid initiative joins a growing ecosystem of corporate-backed STEM and energy education programs designed to prepare students—especially from underrepresented or underserved backgrounds—for careers in sustainability, engineering, and clean technology:

Comparable Programs:

ExxonMobil STEM Camps (Texas)

Full-day, hands-on STEM camps for 4th–7th graders in underserved Texas communities, with field trips to NASA.

Diamondback Energy STEAM Camp (Midland, TX)

A free, weeklong all-girls STEAM camp incorporating art, tech, and mentorship for elementary and middle schoolers.

LevelTen Energy Scholars Program

Offers underrepresented college students a fully paid summer program focused on clean energy, in partnership with Microsoft and Google.

UIC Energy STEM Scholars

A Chicago-based, multi-semester program focused on energy efficiency and engineering for high school students.

TEALS by Microsoft

What Sets National Grid Apart

Unlike many one-time summer camps or remote programs, the National Grid initiative:

Integrates college-level, in-person coursework

Prioritizes energy-specific literacy

Operates on a multi-year timeline

Targets local high school students with high-need backgrounds

That sustained commitment—combined with full funding, university resources, and National Grid’s industry expertise—positions it as a replicable model for other utilities and regions.

Broader Implications

This program reflects a larger trend: energy companies investing early in talent pipelines that align with the transition to a cleaner, smarter grid. By integrating STEM, energy systems, and real-world exposure, these initiatives help build the skilled, diverse workforce needed to support tomorrow’s infrastructure.

David Jacobs / Ashgate / Hardback £50 / ISBN 978-1-4094-3909-7

As a politician in the 1970s, I spoke out in favour of renewable energy. Wind, wave and solar power together seemed to offer an alternative to the official enthusiasm for all things nuclear, but it’s taken 40 years for renewables to start to play a significant part in the energy mix.

A 20% by 2020 target has been set at the European level, and member states are force-feeding the development of renewables by throwing subsidies at them. Feed-in tariffs (FITs) have become the instrument of choice and this book explains how they were designed and how they have evolved in Germany, Spain and France.

Despite the absence of a legal obligation for governments to meet EU policy objectives in a particular way, a great deal of cross-border policy coordination has developed. Jacobs shows how the different schemes have converged, stimulated in part by European Commission reporting procedures.

Jacobs says his book will be of interest to academics and renewable energy experts. More superficial politicians wanting a quick, best-practice guide to FITs will prefer the information distilled into a 20-minute PowerPoint presentation.

That’s a big deal, with expansive implications. The 2009 Endangerment Finding determined six greenhouse gases (GHG) are air pollutants that endanger public health and welfare, and subsequently allowed EPA to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles. EPA’s Repeal Proposal, which relies heavily on recent Supreme Court decisions in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and West Virginia v. EPA, is an early product of the January 2025 Executive Order Unleashing American Energy specifically referencing the finding. It’s also an outgrowth of the February 2025 Executive Order Ensuring Lawful Governance, which directed agencies to review regulations for consistency with the Constitution and the “best reading of the authorizing statute.”

On its face, this proposal is limited to EPA’s findings under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act to regulate mobile sources of pollution. But it’s not so narrow. EPA has referred to and relied on the 2009 Endangerment Finding to regulate other sources of GHGs using its Clean Air Act authority. Repeal of this foundational Finding is like removing a critical block in the game of Jenga®. As EPA moves forward with the reconsideration or repeal of various standards, including methane standards for oil and gas and carbon pollution standards for fossil-fuel fired power plants, those regulations are on increasingly unstable footing without the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

Key Takeaways

EPA’s Repeal Proposal focuses on the auto industry, but signals a broader deregulatory effort. In the past, EPA has pointed to this foundational legal Finding to regulate GHG emissions across multiple sectors, including oil and gas, power plants, and commercial aviation.

Litigation over EPA’s ultimate decision is all but guaranteed. Comments submitted in this rulemaking may build the record for far-reaching decisions.

Staying aware and involved in the rulemaking process is essential to a cohesive long term legal strategy.

Why the Endangerment Finding Is the Critical Block: Sector Impacts and Legal Uncertainty

The proposal to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding represents a dramatic shift in the foundation of U.S. climate policy and regulatory authority. The Finding, issued in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, provided the prerequisite for EPA’s regulation of GHG emissions from motor vehicles under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act.

Over the years, EPA has used the Finding under section 202(a) as a building block for regulations of other sectors under different provisions of the Clean Air Act. For example, EPA relied on the Finding, and its cited science, in the 2015 methane standards for oil and gas, 2016 finding that GHG emissions from aircraft similarly endanger public health and welfare, 2021 (and subsequent) regulations to phasedown and regulate hydrofluorocarbons, and 2024 carbon pollution standards for fossil-fuel fired power plants. The EPA’s recent proposal rejects the essential underpinnings of the 2009 decision. While EPA’s proposal purports to be limited to motor vehicles, its questions and rationale will likely further destabilize a multitude of other regulations too.

What’s in the Proposal

In short, in the Repeal Proposal, EPA is proposing to repeal all GHG emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines. EPA has offered three potential pathways to this result, all of which illuminate the Agency’s overall policy and likely approach to climate regulations still on the books.

As the primary proposal, EPA asserts that section 202(a) doesn’t authorize standards based on global climate change or allow EPA to make an endangerment finding without simultaneously issuing emission standards. Here, EPA cites to Loper Bright, West Virginia, and Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, positing that global climate change is a major question that Congress did not authorize EPA to regulate. EPA proposes that the best reading of section 202(a) is that Congress only permits EPA to regulate pollutants that are themselves dangerous in localized concentrations (or that interact with airborne constituents to then become dangerous—like SO2 and acid rain). That GHG emissions have “indirect” impacts means they may not be “air pollution” in EPA’s view.

As an alternative, EPA proposes to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding and resulting motor vehicle standards because the finding analyzed endangerment and contribution in an unreasonable manner. Relying on a draft report issued this month by the Department of Energy’s Climate Working Group, EPA posits that reality has not borne out the temperature increases, heat waves, sea level rise, or extreme weather events prognosticated in the 2009 finding.

Finally, as its third option, EPA proposes that independent of any action on the endangerment finding, the GHG standards for motor vehicles should be repealed because there is no “requisite technology” to reduce GHG emissions to zero from vehicles because it wouldn’t measurably impact GHG concentrations in the atmosphere or rate of global climate change. Essentially that the Clean Air Act’s tools here won’t have a material impact on global emissions.

EPA repeatedly make statements that attempt to limit this proposal to motor vehicles and flags that other regulations for other sectors will be handled in separate regulatory efforts. That said, much of EPA’s rationale here, especially pronouncements regarding global climate policy as a major question, will transfer easily to those efforts.

What Happens Next

The comment period for EPA’s proposal ends on September 21, 2025. Comments received during this period will form the record for EPA’s ultimate decision and any resulting litigation. Entities outside of the auto sector should consider getting involved given the potential ripple effects of the Agency’s reasoning, or at least stay informed.

With the revocation of the California waiver and the repeal of the 2009 Endangerment Finding, EPA has dismantled the state and federal regulation of GHG emissions from cars and light duty trucks. However, fuel economy standards issued by NHTSA remain in place.

We might see enhanced regulatory activity in some states inclined to impose stricter climate regulations on stationary sources within their jurisdiction.

EPA signaled in this proposal that it will handle GHG standards in other sectors in separate rulemakings. However, it is clear that this proposal is a precursor to additional deregulatory action.

Today, the company announced two new demand response agreements with the utilities Indiana Michigan Power and Tennessee Valley Authority. During times of grid stress, certain Google data centers will reduce the power use associated with machine learning workloads.

Michael Terrell, Google’s head of advanced energy, noted in a blog post accompanying the announcement that this is the first time that Google is “delivering data center demand response by targeting machine learning workloads.” This follows a successful demonstration with the Omaha Public Power District, which reduced power demand during three emergency grid events in 2024.

Google has been using demand response tools to enhance the flexibility of its data centers since 2023, when it announced it had developed a way to reduce a data center’s energy use at times of grid stress by shifting some of its compute tasks to other times and locations. Until recently, however, the tool only targeted non-urgent tasks, such as the processing of YouTube videos.

“Incorporating ML workloads is an important step to enable larger-scale demand flexibility,” Terrell wrote.

And that demand flexibility is increasingly important as load growth fundamentally reshapes the grid. The artificial intelligence boom is inflating the data center sector’s energy demand, flooding utilities with load requests and straining an already congested grid, so much so that in some areas, new data centers have to wait nearly a decade for power.

To alleviate the problem, industry players have been experimenting with flexibility solutions, which could unlock over 100 gigawatts of load in the existing U.S. power system, according to recent studies. For instance, Google is a member of DCFlex, a coalition led by the Electric Power Research Institute bringing together hyperscalers, utilities, RTOs and ISOs to explore ways to turn data centers into flexible grid assets, rather than just drains on power resources.

Google’s load-shifting tool is only one potential flexibility solution; others include batchable workloads and load curtailment supported by on-site generation. Last month, DCFlex shared its first set of results from a flexibility “hub” in Phoenix, Arizona, at an Oracle data center. The pilot project used the startup Emerald AI’s platform to reduce power use by 25% at peak demand, by choreographing clusters of Nvidia GPUs in real time.

One of the key benefits of these flexibility opinions is that they can reduce the need for new infrastructure and can be deployed quickly, according to Terrell, who also said that they can help “bridge the gap between short-term load growth and long-term clean energy solutions.”

‘Holistic approach’

These solutions, however, are far from being deployed widely. As Terrell put it, “data center demand flexibility is still in the early stages and will only be available at certain locations,” given that critical services such as Google Search, Maps, and Cloud for essential industries like healthcare need “high levels of reliability.”

The Indiana Michigan Power project will be at a new data center in Fort Wayne, Indiana; president and COO Steve Baker said in a statement that “Google’s ability to leverage load flexibility as part of the strategy to serve their load will be a highly valuable tool to meet their future energy needs.”

And grid flexibility has the potential to benefit Google as well, as the company balances its ambitious net-zero commitments with the emissions that are already increasing as a result of the AI boom. The company said in its 2024 environmental report — its first since the AI race really ramped up — that its emissions increased by nearly 50% in just five years, and its data centers devoured 17% more electricity in 2023 than in 2022. Terrell described a “holistic approach” to achieving net zero by 2030, which also includes procuring a range of clean firm energy.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-08-04T113429.559.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 13:06:25.650124

He wants to have prices low at the pump and to do that, you need lower oil prices.","President Donald Trump’s campaign promise of U.S. energy dominance is running into some crude realities, one of them rattling the oil markets on this Monday.

Matt Smith, energy analyst at Kpler, joined Texas Standard to break it all down. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: That promise for U.S. Energy dominance is running into a flood of OPEC crude oil. Apparently, on Sunday, the Saudis [announced] they’re stepping on the gas – surging fuel production. What’s going on with OPEC?

Matt Smith: So yesterday, they announced another monthly production increase. So back in mid-2023, they made a voluntary cut across eight different countries and kingdoms there of 2.2 million barrels per day. And so what they’ve been doing since earlier this year is gradually bringing those barrels back to the market.

That said, it seems unlikely that these increases can be sustainable going forward here, just because we’re passing through the peak demand period of summer when you have a lot of demand for crude to run through refineries to produce gasoline for summer driving season.

But also on the supply side of the picture, we have a wave of non-OPEC supply coming to market from the likes of Guyana and Brazil and all others. So all prices are likely to drop in the coming months here.

So don’t expect these production increases to keep continuing. They’ll likely have to hit that pause button in the months ahead.

What does this mean for oil prices on the marketplace? If you flood the market with oil, doesn’t that tend to drive down the prices?

Yeah, exactly. What OPEC did was back in mid-2023, they took oil off the market to keep prices higher there, but all that did was incentivize production in these non-OPEC countries like I mentioned with Brazil, et cetera, but also in the U.S.

Now coming into the spring of this year, they were like, okay, well, prices aren’t as high as we want them to be. But we’re losing market share here. So what we need to do is start to push barrels back onto the market. If the market can take those and prices don’t swoon, that will give us some market share back there.

Okay, well then what does this mean for the U.S.? I was seeing some quarterly earnings out from some of the key producers – Exxon, Chevron – last week. As you read the tea leaves there, what’s that telling you?

Well, Chevron and Exxon are still doing really rather well. Actually, Exxons pumps more oil than it has done in any second quarter since, like, Mobil took them over 25 years ago.

Chevron’s just hit production at an all-time high, and so they’re pushing out a lot, but they are focusing on efficiencies there, and their profits did shrink.

But a bigger picture for these producers, they’ve been doing really well. But again, it’s focusing on efficiency as much as anything here.

» GET MORE NEWS FROM AROUND THE STATE: Sign up for Texas Standard’s weekly newsletters

Trying to save some money. Well here’s something interesting and I’m sure you must have seen this, too. According to Baker Hughes, the rig count has now dropped 13 out of the last 14 weeks. What’s that mean for “drill, baby, drill”?

It’s not good, right? So that rig count includes oil and gas rigs, but if you just strip out and look at the all-directed rigs, they’ve dropped 15% since beginning of May, something like that. And so even in the shale, in the Permian shale there at the Basin – which has been kind of the poster boy or girl for the U.S. shale revolution – that’s down 15% in terms of the rig count, too.

And so ultimately what this will do is likely result in stagnation at best. But if we do see all prices drop by $5 to $10, we’ll see that’s dropping prices below the breakevens of some producers and they will halt operating.

So we could see prices gradually dropping from here on out. And that will only accelerate if we see oil prices really dropping here because that production drop will accelerate.

So what does that mean? Good for consumers, good for folks who use gasoline, not so good for the industry?

Yeah, it’s not so good for the industry, but if we do see a drop of $5 to $10 for the oil price there per barrel, that will result in lower prices at the pump.

So it’s always that kind of seesaw effect, where it’s good for the consumer, bad for the producer, or vice versa. So at least there’s the silver lining of that for consumers.

I guess fair to say Russia is the biggest wild card right now when we try to project what’s going to be happening in the next few weeks or months.

Absolutely, yeah. So if President Trump follows through on his threat of secondary sanctions there, then that could really bring oil off of the market and spike prices.

But that’s in complete contrast to what he really wants. He wants to have prices low at the pump and to do that, you need lower oil prices.

The electric vehicle maker said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company's CEO.

In December Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package. She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.

At the time McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.

The rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk's 2018 compensation package.

That pay package carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla's stock price.

Musk appealed the order in March. A month later Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it was creating a special committee to look at Musk's compensation as CEO.

Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year, largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump. But Tesla also faces intensifying competition from both the big Detroit automakers, and from China.

In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company fell short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.

Under pressure from shareholders last month, Tesla scheduled an annual shareholders meeting for November to comply with Texas state law.

A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders, which have watched Tesla shares plummet, said in a letter to the company that it needed to at least provide public notice of the annual meeting.

Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajection of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16062134_032125-wls-abcn-elon-musk-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-04 13:06:59.818681

Waymo, formerly known as the Google self-driving car project, also has driverless cars in Austin as well as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix and Atlanta.
As a result, Chinese companies are accumulating databases of real-world driving they can use to train their autonomous driving models.
Driverless technology works better with electric cars than with gasoline-powered cars.","China’s automakers have teamed up with software companies to go global with their driverless cars, which are poised to claim a big share of a growing market as Western manufacturers are still preparing to compete.

The industry in China is expanding despite tariffs imposed last year by the European Union on electric cars, and despite some worries in Europe about the security implications of relying on Chinese suppliers.

Baidu, one of China’s biggest software companies, said on Monday that it would supply Lyft, an American ride-hailing service, with self-driving cars assembled by Jiangling Motors of China. Lyft is expected to begin operating them next year in Germany and Britain, subject to regulatory approval, the companies said.

The announcement comes three months after Uber and Momenta, a Chinese autonomous driving company, announced their own plans to begin offering self-driving cars in an unspecified European city early next year. Momenta will soon provide assisted driving technology to the Chinese company IM Motors for its cars sold in Britain.

While Momenta has not specified the model that Uber will be using, it has already signaled it will choose a Chinese model. In China, “the pace of development and the pressure to deliver at scale push companies to improve quickly,” said Gerhard Steiger, the chairman of Momenta Europe.

China’s state-controlled banking system has been lending money at low interest rates to the country’s electric car industry in a bid for global leadership.

Chinese driverless cars are starting to move into other markets as well. Baidu and Uber announced last month that they would start offering their self-driving cars this year in Asia outside China and in the Middle East.

Automakers in China have not yet tried to offer driverless cars in the United States. That is partly because of concerns about the high costs of personal injury lawsuits and the 100 percent tariffs imposed last year on electric cars imported from China. In addition, the United States, citing security, severely limited in January the use of Chinese assisted-driving systems.

For navigation, the cars use cameras that take dozens of high-resolution images per second of the road and roadside areas. Automakers and software companies have said that very little information from these photos is uploaded or stored. But collection of the data has raised concerns among U.S. policymakers and companies. China also has stringent restrictions on driving-related data.

Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, began offering driverless cars in Austin, Texas, in June. Waymo, formerly known as the Google self-driving car project, also has driverless cars in Austin as well as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix and Atlanta. In Europe, Volkswagen has said it is developing a driverless version of its electric ID. Buzz minivan.

But automakers outside China face very high costs for radars, cameras and other technology required for so-called robot taxis. The price of the electric cars themselves is also higher. An ID. Buzz, without self-driving gear, retails for $62,000 to $72,000. The somewhat smaller Jiangling RT6 is less than $30,000.

Self-driving car experiments are already underway in more than a dozen Chinese cities and are being conducted by at least 19 automakers. Last year, Baidu turned its experiment in Wuhan, a city in central China, into the world’s largest.

As a result, Chinese companies are accumulating databases of real-world driving they can use to train their autonomous driving models. Momenta and Baidu trained their driverless car systems in China

In the United States, personal injury lawyers have begun focusing on the industry.

On Friday, a jury in Florida found that flaws in Tesla’s self-driving software bore one-third of the responsibility for a crash in 2019 that killed a 22-year-old woman and severely injured her boyfriend. The jury verdict, if upheld on appeal, would require Tesla to pay as much as $243 million in punitive and compensatory damages to the woman’s parents and to her boyfriend.

Driverless technology works better with electric cars than with gasoline-powered cars. This is because computers can vary the power going to the wheels in an electric car extremely quickly. China is the world’s main producer of electric cars.

Expanding robotaxi services to new cities, not to mention new countries, is not easy. While the individual cars do not have drivers, they typically require one controller for every several cars to handle difficulties and answer questions from users. And the cars often need to be specially programmed for traffic conditions unique to each city.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/04/multimedia/04Biz-Baidu-Europe-01-vfzg/04Biz-Baidu-Europe-01-vfzg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 13:07:04.582550

Senator Cruz speaking to energy industry and African leaders sends a loud message: the U.S. is not sitting out the future of African energy.","African Energy Week (AEW): Invest in African Energies, the continent’s premier energy event, is set to welcome U.S. Senator Ted Cruz as a featured speaker at its 2025 edition. Senator Cruz, a senior member of the U.S. Senate Commerce and Foreign Relations Committees and one of Washington’s most prominent energy voices, will address delegates in Cape Town, highlighting the strategic value of deeper U.S. commercial and diplomatic engagement in African energy markets.

At a time when global powers are racing to secure energy and critical mineral supply chains, Senator Cruz’s participation underscores a broader push by the U.S. to reinforce ties with African energy producers, particularly as the continent emerges as a pivotal source of hydrocarbons, LNG and transition minerals. From Nigeria to Namibia, American companies are ramping up activity, yet competition from China, Russia and others has intensified, prompting renewed attention from U.S. lawmakers and policy leaders.

On the exploration and production front, U.S.-based companies to the likes of ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Vaalco Energy are driving transformational projects in Africa. ExxonMobil is maximizing output at producing fields across the continent, through projects such as the Erha and Owowo fields in Nigeria and the Kizomba deepwater development in Angola’s Block 15. On the gas front, ExxonMobil is leading projects such as the Rovuma LNG development in Mozambique, targeting 18 million tons per annum. The company plans to reach a final investment decision in 2026. Meanwhile Chevron is driving exploration in West and Southern Africa through projects in Nigeria’s Niger Delta, Equatorial Guinea’s offshore Blocks EG-06 and EG-11 and Namibia’s Walvis Basin. The company has also expanded gas production capacity in Angola through the Sanha Lean Gas Connection Project and the upcoming New Gas Consortium project.

Houston-based ConocoPhillips strives to reach between 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) and 700,000 bpd at the Waha concession in the Sirte Basin. The company is prioritizing collaborations, work-over programs and pipeline integrity at the concession, which currently produces 375,000 bpd. Another Houston-based player, Vaalco Energy, is modernizing FPSO infrastructure in Africa to support production growth. The company is active in Ivory Coast and Gabon, where it plans a drilling campaign in 2026 and 2025 respectively. In Egypt, Vaalco Energy brought five wells online in 2025, while in Equatorial Guinea, is targeting first oil at Block P in 2026.

U.S.-based service providers are also strengthening their presence across the African market. Baker Hughes’s African footprint includes markets such as Nigeria and Namibia, where it offers world-class oilfield services and skills development programs. NOV is involved in strategic initiatives across the African energy value chain, from offshore exploration and production to processing and logistics. Focusing on digitalization and efficiency, Halliburton supports a variety of African energy projects. The company brings advanced technology solutions to enhance production efficiency and optimize resource extraction.

Stepping into this picture, Senator Cruz’s participation at AEW: Invest in African Energies is expected to further strengthened U.S.-Africa energy ties. Known for his strong advocacy of energy independence and market-driven growth, Senator Cruz’s message at the event is expected to center on expanding private-sector investment, supporting American energy companies operating in Africa, and bolstering energy infrastructure that aligns with both African development goals and U.S. strategic interests. His appearance follows recent signals from Washington – including a bipartisan call for deeper energy cooperation with Africa – as the U.S. seeks to reclaim ground in a region critical to global energy security.

“Being a Senator from Texas, Senator Cruz not only understands what oil and gas means to the economy of Texas but also for the transformation of Africa. Senator Cruz speaking to energy industry and African leaders sends a loud message: the U.S. is not sitting out the future of African energy. He understands the stakes – from gas deals in to infrastructure buildouts– and his presence proves America is serious about competing, investing and showing up where it matters,” states NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber, adding that Senator Cruz recognizes that the key to African countries’ economic prosperity lies in embracing free markets, minimizing government intervention, promoting individual responsibility and upholding the rule of law.

“We at the AEC strongly believe that markets – rather than pseudo-intellectuals – should drive the future and foster innovative growth and development,” he notes.

His participation comes as African nations are seeking to scale production, expand infrastructure and attract capital to meet growing domestic and global energy demands. The U.S., with its technological expertise and investment capital, is poised to play a pivotal role in supporting Africa’s ambitions, from deepwater exploration to gas-to-power projects and beyond. With major discoveries across oil, gas and hydrogen, and a wave of African governments prioritizing energy security and local beneficiation, the continent is ripe for strategic partnerships built on mutual interest and long-term impact.

As AEW: Invest in African Energies 2025 approaches, Senator Cruz’s participation is expected to galvanize support for deeper U.S. involvement in African energy markets and sends a clear signal to American companies: Africa is open for business, and the U.S. intends to compete. His presence is also likely to draw increased attention from private investors, service providers and project developers seeking access to emerging upstream and infrastructure opportunities across the continent.",https://aecweeks3.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/04085642/US-Senator-Ted-Cruz-.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 14:09:05.507709

This targeted attack might dramatically reduce the number of solar projects that will secure safe harbour in the next year, with real impacts on deployments.
We understand that you think that the solar industry is self-interested, but we, as the utility industry, are not self-interested.
The situation has changed, and the government has made moves to directly hamstring renewables, particularly solar energy.
“Americans will still demand energy choices, and the solar and storage industry will continue to deliver them.”","It’s now clear the White House is attacking renewable energy and the federal apparatus which sustained its growth over recent years.

With MAGA tanks parked firmly on its lawn, the path forward for the solar industry is uncertain. Alongside tariffs, sweeping changes at the Department of Energy and orders to clamp down on solar and wind permits, tax credits are on the chopping block.

The rules of the game have changed, but many of the facts haven’t. Energy demand will continue to grow, driven largely by data centres and the growth of AI. Fossil fuel emissions still cause climate change. Solar is the fastest-growing new source of US energy generation.

We spoke with leading US industry analysts, participants and lawyers to understand the state of play for the solar sector and look forward to what might come next.

The state of play – ITC, PTC

July’s budget reconciliation bill – the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ – introduced an early end to the 30% 48E Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC) previously available under the IRA.

Solar and wind projects that begin construction before 4 July 2026 – one year from when the bill became law – are eligible for the credit under current “safe harbour” regulations. Those that start construction after that date must be placed in service by 31 December 2027. Projects which begin construction within that 12-month window are not required to be in service by the end of 2027. Projects which began construction before 2025 are generally safe from repeals.

The safe harbour also protects projects from Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, which prohibit exposure to financial backing or “material support” from Chinese firms (as well as Russian, Iranian and North Korean).

The dates are key. The safe harbour for the 30% ITC or PTC is contingent on the definition of “start construction”. Under the bill’s wording, that may require developers to spend 5% of the project’s total estimated cost by the deadline. They can also start “physical work of a significant nature” to access the safe harbour, “which can be something as simple as having a custom transformer made for you in a factory”, according to Christian Roselund, senior policy analyst at Clean Energy Associates (CEA), who spoke to us for this piece.

Bob Moczeluwski, director at accountancy and tax advisory firm Baker Tilly, says similarly. “Ordering transformers has been a traditional one because they’re [already] in some guidance on establishing the beginning of construction, and they’re bespoke.” We also heard that building maintenance roads for a project might count as “significant” physical work.

But the reconciliation bill’s definition of starting construction might become irrelevant. The law was signed on a Friday; on the following Monday, president Trump issued an executive order which could rewrite the rules.

‘Cruelty is part of the point’

The executive order gives the Treasury 45 days to assess stricter safe harbour rules than those in the bill. It wants to combat “artificial acceleration or manipulation” of safe harbour rules, and orders that “a substantial portion” of a project must be built for it to be eligible.

This targeted attack might dramatically reduce the number of solar projects that will secure safe harbour in the next year, with real impacts on deployments.

“The [order’s] full impact is hard to predict,” says Aaron Halimi, president and founder of US developer Renewable Properties. “One way or another, it’s going to change the economics of building solar.”

Roselund says: “That order will be a significant challenge for the industry. Our estimates were that there were 100GW of projects that planned to start construction by the end of the year, but now much of that is at risk.”

It’s not clear what a “substantial portion” of construction means. “The wording of the executive order suggests that you may have to do significant work on-site to claim start of construction,” Roselund says. He also sees a “significant risk” that the order could be applied retroactively.

Despite some speculation, Robert Romeshko, partner at law firm Husch Blackwell, says the administration would “have trouble” applying new guidance retroactively; “There’s relatively little precedent out there”. However, he says that as the guidance is under review, the industry shouldn’t assume it won’t change. “Certainly [there is] a line of precedent which says that if you’re on notice that they’re re-examining something, you [risk] having the rug pulled from under your guidance.”

The executive order represents the first move in a direct attack on clean energy, going beyond Congress’s provisions. At Trump’s behest, the Department of the Interior has also introduced tighter restrictions on permitting solar and wind on federal land, to combat what it calls “the Green New Scam”.

As Jigar Shah, former director of the Department for Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), sums it up to us: “It feels intentional. It feels like the cruelty is part of the point of the whole thing. The problem is that once a bill passes, to then have an executive order that says we are going to deliberately put more uncertainty into the process on purpose – that feels personal. And that, I think, is the part that is the most upsetting. Because you’re talking about hundreds of thousands of people in the United States, millions, even, who are working every day to make sure that we have the essential electricity generation added to the grid to be able to meet our economic development goals. And what signal exactly is it that you’re sending to them about how important their role is in the energy system?”

You can read more of what Shah has to say in the box below.

Plenty of capital, no projects to invest in

The veteran clean energy entrepreneur Jigar Shah speaks to Ben Willis about the impact of recent legislation on investment

The term ‘solarcoaster’ is well known in PV industry circles. It is popularly used to describe the highs and lows of a technology that, in most markets where it has appeared, has been supercharged by government backing of some kind before plunging to earth again as that support is withdrawn.

The solar industry has been around long enough now to see that the dips in the ride usually even out and eventually return to some kind of upward trajectory, as the economics of PV, especially coupled with increasingly cost-effective battery storage, win the day. Often, the second wave of growth is more sustainable than the first, as it is less cuopled to the whims and shifting priorities of politics.

According to US clean energy veteran, Jigar Shah, the highs may yet come again for the US solar business, but right now it’s hard to look beyond the current crisis. The immediate challenge for solar industry stakeholders is weathering what Shah says looks like a personal, indeed cruel, attack on their business.

“We can talk about the longer term in rosy ways, in terms of the continuing cost reduction of solar and battery storage,” he says. “But, right now, developers have a hard time keeping their promises to investors because they have a president in place who’s not honouring deals made with the legislators that passed the bill. I thought we had a deal when the bill was signed. But then, right after, the President came out and said I’d like to create a whole bunch of additional confusion.”

Shah is referring to the executive order issued only days after the passing of the “one big beautiful bill”, the budget reconciliation package that has rolled back much of the support underpinning the US clean energy sector’s rapid advances in recent years.

As explored in our main feature, the bill and subsequent executive order have created multiple layers of complexity and anxiety for US clean energy businesses as investors, developers and the wider supply chain scramble to understand what the new rules mean for them.

Of particular concern to Shah is the question of what energy investors will do with capital that is still looking for a home, regardless of recent political events. Even technology-agnostic energy investors will find life difficult because the alternatives for their money to clean energy—coal and natural gas—lack shovel-ready projects ready for investor dollars.

“Investors feel like they are not being given clear direction as to what to invest in,” says Shah. “Even if you’re talking to investors who have no climate agenda, they still need projects that have met the checklist. And what you find is that most of the natural gas projects in the United States have not met the checklist. They’re still three years away from having all their paperwork in place. So if you’re in the business of investing capital, and your bosses have given you US$50 billion to invest in clean energy or whatever it is, they’re saying, ‘Why have you not put the money out the door?’ Everybody has to put money out the door.

Right now, all eyes are focused on the US Treasury’s response to Trump’s executive order and how that will be implemented. The 45-day deadline given to the Treasury was due to pass after this journal went to press. Once the new rules are known, there will be a period of time for them to be implemented and, most likely, court challenges, says Shah.

“In the meantime, there are many electric utility companies and others saying to the administration, hey, if you mess with these rules in a way that will make it difficult for us to deploy, then we may, in fact, have rolling blackouts,” Shah warns. “So you need to be careful with how you do this, because if you do this incorrectly, then we will not be able to maintain service. We understand that you think that the solar industry is self-interested, but we, as the utility industry, are not self-interested. We’re happy to install coal or natural gas or whatever it is, but we’re just telling you that those are not options that are ready in the near term.”

A further irony not lost on Shah is that if the net intention of federal policy is to push utility investors towards coal or gas projects, the result will be further reliance on China as the source of the necessary hardware.

“Many of those supply chains … are coming from China,” Shah says. “I mean, the US doesn’t manufacture coal components anymore, right? So we would have to import Chinese coal components.

‘Be prepared for an audit’

Whatever the language means, it seems certain there will be a rush to get projects moving before June 2026 and prove the start of construction.

“The plan was to lock in 100GW or more of projects in the next 12 months,” Roselund says. “Based on conversations with developers, we estimate that 30GW of projects have already locked in start of construction from the beginning of this year.

Aaron Halimi says the industry must “move quickly” and have “robust documentation to prove project eligibility before potential rule changes”.

Indeed, developers should “be prepared for an audit”, according to Romashko. “People need to assume someone’s going to want to look at that [documentation] at some point, and you don’t want to have holes in it.” He predicts that the IRS will increase enforcement on renewables, even as the Treasury itself is cut back. Given the “cruelty” on display against the industry already, it’s hard to argue.

But there may be workarounds.

“As smart as the politicians like to think they are, the tax professionals and industry leaders ultimately become a lot smarter in the whole process,” Moczeluwski says. “There are creative ways within the industry to set things up.”

Last year, overturning the “Chevron defence”, the US Supreme Court granted courts more freedom from federal agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous laws. With a federal government hostile to renewables – and a lot of ambiguity – this could benefit the industry, though its impact will likely be case-by-case.

“You can [now] look at any regulation, IRS regulations included, and ask how much water they really hold,” Moczeluwski says.

“Guidance is just guidance,” Romashko says, “and you’re always free to say we don’t think this meets the statute and try to take another position. But you assume risk by doing so.”

It’s another turn of the solarcoaster

This year will be a big year for new projects as the industry rushes to start building. After that, things start changing.

“2026 will likely be a big year for putting projects in service,” Roselund says. “And then in 2027, the changes made to eligibility for these tax credits will likely start to affect deployment levels. In 2028, all major market analysts expect to see a significant decline in deployment. And after that, the size of the market will depend on what deployment levels look like without the tax credits.”

“It’s another turn of the ‘solarcoaster’”, he continues. “There’s still a solar market without the tax credits. CEA’s analysis estimates that it is roughly half as big and it’s a lot more geographically focused in states that have renewable energy mandates.

“Based upon binding renewable energy mandates, we expect that the Northeast will still install solar; Minnesota will still install solar, for the same reasons; Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada will also still install solar.

“Texas doesn’t have renewable energy mandates, so the market is more dependent on federal subsidies. FPL in Florida has plans to build a lot of solar, but we will see how changes in incentives affect that. There are large parts of the country, including the South, the plains states, and much of the Midwest, where the loss of incentives will likely affect the market more.”

Energy mix could become another divide in polarised modern America.

‘A flight to quality’

The industry will likely consolidate. Noam Yaffe, vice president at market intelligence firm Pexapark, expects big developers and investors to succeed and grow, while for smaller firms, “this is the most painful thing that you’ve experienced in the last decade plus. It’s in many ways catastrophic for these businesses.”

Aaron Halimi predicts a “flight to quality”. “Investors will prioritise experienced developers with proven track records,” he says. “In the short term, the uncertainty may put a lot of pressure on smaller developers, but I think any consolidation is going to make the solar industry stronger and prepared for an unsubsidised market.”

But changes to the solar industry have implications beyond its own immediate concerns.

“What we’re talking about today is powering the entire US economy. We’re no longer talking about the solar industry,” Jigar Shah tells us.

“AI, growth, manufacturing, all those priorities are at risk because of these dislocations in the market. It used to be that when we called things the ‘solarcoaster’, we were talking about the commercialisation of solar power. Today, we’re fully commercialised and actually providing essential services to the US economy.”

Some forecasts say that US electricity demand will grow by 50% by 2050, driven by transportation and data centres. The International Energy Agency (IEA) identified the US and China as the predominant development markets for data centres and AI. In Yaffe’s words, “Solar is the best” solution for cheap, fast power.

The US might have shot itself in the foot if these policy changes collapse the solar market as much as Roselund and others predict. On the other hand, demand from big tech and other industries won’t disappear overnight.

“I think [big tech companies] will continue to buy renewables,” Yaffe says. “It’s the right thing to do, and these companies genuinely want to reduce their carbon footprint.” This optimism will be tested in the coming months and years, as will the eco-conscious claims made by firms like Meta.

But it’s unlikely everyone will do the right thing. Markets don’t have a conscience, nor do businesses.

“I was talking to someone who was going to buy between 3-4GW of renewables in ERCOT over several years,” Yaffe says. “But now they’re building data centres and trying to co-locate them with gas plants. Renewables are a nice plus, but it makes no difference to them.”

We know that energy prices will go up as supply drops. The government will back more gas plants, which have a lead time of around seven years. We know some small developers will disappear. But demand for renewables won’t; states will keep mandating new clean energy and the industry will find ways to realise its projects. But this is only one side of the story.

Even bigger impacts to manufacturing

“We at CEA expect this bill to result in a decline in US solar deployment, but we expect even bigger impacts to clean energy manufacturing,” Christian Roselund says.

The roughly 50GW of US module manufacturing capacity represents millions in investment and thousands of jobs. But that expansion is under threat, too.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing tax credit is preserved under the OBBB act, which accords with Trump’s stated aim to bring back American jobs, particularly manufacturing jobs.

But one industry analyst who spoke to us called this aim “doublespeak”, and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) previously warned the bill could risk over 300,000 jobs in the solar sector.

The problem is the FEOC restrictions. Projects directly owned by, under “effective control” of, or receiving “material assistance” from a designated foreign entity (read: Chinese entity) cannot receive the 45X credit. China and Chinese-controlled firms dominate over 80% of every stage of the solar supply chain, putting particular strain on the “material assistance” provision.

“If you’re making modules, you have to get your cells from a non-FEOC company in order to access 45X,” Roselund explains. US cell capacity is currently below 10GW, massively behind module capacity.

“And if you’re making cells, you have to get your wafers from a non-FEOC company, and there is a limited supply of those that is both non-FEOC and not subject to AD/CVD duties,” he continues. There is currently no US wafer manufacturing capacity.

Elissa Pierce, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said in July: “Despite billions in tariffs and years of diversification efforts, Chinese companies still control manufacturing through regional subsidiaries. When Malaysian glass suppliers and Vietnamese frame manufacturers are Chinese-owned operations, we’re not achieving energy security. We’re simply paying higher prices for the same supply chain risk.

“These new market distortions could ultimately harm [US] renewable energy deployment while potentially precluding domestic manufacturers from receiving the 45X tax credits due to the FEOC restrictions.”

As with the developer market, big players will likely weather the storm and secure the credits.

First Solar will likely be able to secure the credit, as its cadmium telluride (CdTe) technology is largely isolated from Chinese supply and it’s well established in the US market. Qcells’ integrated factory in Cartersville, Georgia, will also likely receive the credit, as it can access non-Chinese supply deals through its Korean owner, Hanwha.

Indian firms, like Waaree – which owns a module production facility in Texas – will be able to import Indian cells and secure the 45X credit for that facility.

“CEA expects the FEOC-owned companies to divest a portion of their ownership rather than have to close down factories, which can’t compete without the 45X”, Roselund says.

More concerningly, he says, “To build and operate a solar factory in the US, you need to be able to sell the goods that you make in that factory into the US market. There is no business case to export overseas. That means that if or when the domestic solar market shrinks, domestic solar factories are at risk.”

When the ITC and PTC phase out, they will take the domestic content bonus credit with them – Roselund says this removes the financial incentive to buy domestic modules. Coupled with inability to access the 45X credit, a number of US module factories may be stuck in limbo.

The potential fate of those factories is hardly rosy, with a shrinking market and no federal support. And there’s a kicker.

“Foreign entity rules only come into play when you’re trying to qualify for the ITC or the PTC,” Roselund says. “But once those incentives phase out, companies will naturally look to source modules from wherever they can get the best price globally.”

This could result in uncompetitive US products and all but a few leading producers closing down or selling up.

Once again, this is prediction, not prophecy. Halimi says: “In general, developers are going to prioritise US-owned manufacturers with documentation that they’re free of FEOC concerns.” He continues: “Of course, everyone’s going to have that strategy, pushing up module prices. If the economics are better procuring equipment from outside the US, we’ll have to do that to reduce our costs and, ultimately, electricity prices.”

Supply chain, pricing and tariffs

Wood Mackenzie says the “complex web of tariffs and policy restrictions” is reshaping global solar supply chains.

Modules will get more expensive, adds Mike Hall, chief executive of solar supply chain platform, Anza. “It’s possible that we’ll see, over the coming weeks and months, a pricing spread between Chinese and non Chinese companies. We haven’t seen it yet, but that could emerge.”

As developers rush to buy modules before the bill’s deadlines, Hall says he’s seen a divergence in strategy. Some “[who] want to purchase from the handful of suppliers they feel confident are not going to be subject to FEOC” have “focused on non-Chinese modules”, says Hall. “But we also see a lot of companies purchasing from Chinese [manufacturers] now because they’re concerned about their ability to do so in the future.”

Trump’s “reciprocal” tariff regime will also make solar products more expensive. That increase will likely be passed on in higher power prices.

The Middle East, North Africa and Turkey are expected to become alternative supply sources. However, Wood Mackenzie said most planned capacity there will not be online until 2026 at the earliest, and most is Chinese-owned, which may prevent developers using those products from accessing tax credits thanks to FEOC.

‘We want to do the right thing’

“I think the industry can survive this. We’ve survived storms before, we’re going to get through it,” Yaffe says. “The difference with this industry and other industries is we’re all here because we want to make a difference and do the right thing.”

Beyond the specifics of market dynamics and uncertain policy, the industry believes it will continue to progress. “The US solar and storage industry can certainly stand on its own without subsidies. I wish the fossil fuel industry could say the same after over 100 years of subsidies,” Halimi says. “AI data centre demand is too high, and with or without subsidies, solar is still going to be the fastest and cheapest way to meet that demand. Compared with gas, solar and wind are still the least expensive source of energy, even without subsidies, and there’s a five-year wait for natural gas turbines.”

Big utilities will also still set and meet green energy targets, states will mandate renewables and companies have international emissions targets they’ll be unlikely to abandon. “A significant portion of the country lives in states that have binding aggressive renewable energy mandates,” Roselund concludes.

But rose-tinted glasses serve nobody. The situation has changed, and the government has made moves to directly hamstring renewables, particularly solar energy. In a few short months, the industry is facing the removal of mechanisms which have enabled its recent boom.

Yaffe is right. The difference between renewables and other energy industries is the urge to “do the right thing”—to transition away from fossil fuels and combat man-made climate change. Can you trust a market to do the right thing? What about one where sourcing and permitting for renewables are deliberately made difficult? The US is the second-highest carbon emissions producer and the largest economy in the world—what it does matters.

“This is my hot take: I think we need to get away from government intervention in renewables,” Yaffe says at the end of our conversation. “I think this could be when the history books say, ‘this was the beginning of when renewables broke free, became a thriving and scalable industry.’ I don’t think we can rely on the government anymore. I think the uninterrupted free market can absolutely create incredible things, like a renewables boom.”

The same free market drove the climate change that necessitates renewables, and big fossil fuel firms like bp and Shell have rowed back on energy transition commitments under shareholder pressure, putting short-term profit over long-term priorities. They never drove the renewables market, but they show the priorities of some market forces. Then again, Yaffe is right that the industry can’t rely on this particular government, so maybe it’s better off on its own two feet.

Uncertainty is the operative word, for now. Abigail Ross Hopper told PV Tech Power: “Here’s what I know to be true—the solar and storage industry is resilient. Our industry has a value proposition no other sector can match: clean, fast, local power that lowers costs and boosts resilience.

“Americans will still demand energy choices, and the solar and storage industry will continue to deliver them.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pexels-and-ramaz-bluashvili.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 13:06:29.670175

The US, Malaysia and others looking at a gas power boom face stiff competition for gas components – thus, heftier price tags.
Vyakaranam believes that renewables alone cannot yet power the world through its AI revolution – instead, gas power has to be part of the mix.","Texas is renowned for its ranching industry, but this oldest of American vocations is fast becoming entwined with icons of modern life: solar and wind farms. Among the cattle, Texas is also home to more than 15,300 wind turbines across 239 projects and 197 utility-scale solar farms.

“Solar and wind energy now frequently provide more than 45% of the state’s electricity needs,” says Dennis Wamsted of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

With such strong credentials in renewables, it is little wonder that proposals to build more than 100 new gas-fired power plants were met with furore among some. According to non-profit environmental group Environmental Integrity Project (EIP), as of April 2025, plans were afoot to build 108 new facilities and expand 17 others, adding as much as 58GW; there were also proposals, without specific detail, for five other projects.

In a June report, the EIP said many of the proposals included requests to access the Texas Energy Fund, which meant using state taxpayer dollars, adding further fuel to the fire. The group identified proposals such as the 930MW three gas‐turbine project near Corpus Christi; the 900MW two gas-turbine project west of Houston; and another 900MW facility to the south-west of the city.

Wamsted notes that how many of the proposals EIP identified will actually be built is left unanswered and believes Texas will continue to lead US renewables. However, “Texas is also the leading market for gas-based thermal power”, caveats Pavan Vyakaranam, energy analyst at Power Technology’s parent company GlobalData. According to GlobalData, Texas was home to 81.53GW of gas power capacity in 2024, far beyond runner-up Florida’s 54.96GW.

It is becoming increasingly likely that the state’s clean energy push may not go hand in hand with equal efforts to reduce thermal power as the energy transition requires – but why is Texas, alongside other US states and industrialised countries, looking at gas again?

Tech needs gas

Data centres are increasingly in demand as AI and automation markets boom. In the US, data centre investments nearly quadrupled between 2019 and 2024, according to International Energy Agency (IEA).

Wamsted says it is clear that in Texas, data centre buildout is a strong driving force behind the projected increase in power demand placed on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

This is not just a problem for Texas. IEA data shows that globally, data centre electricity consumption is expected to more than double to around 945 terawatt-hours by 2030.

The Trump administration has pushed for data centre and energy co-expansion across US states through favourable conditions such as tax incentives. The latest state to signal its intent to bank on this opportunity was Pennsylvania, which secured investment in excess of $90bn from technology, energy and finance companies to become an AI hub backed by state and federal economic incentives.

Although many of the rumoured projects for this hub include clean energy, some are said to contain plans for new natural gas facilities, raising questions of which energy source is best suited to meet date centres’ needs.

In the US at least, with the Trump administration’s preference for hydrocarbons, gas power holds a significant advantage, says Vyakaranam. “In order to meet such a huge increase in demand [from data centres], there is a need for large capacity additions. With [Trump’s] pro-fossil fuel policies in place, it is both more economical and, from clearances perspective, easier to roll out gas-based projects than others like renewables.”

He also notes that gas power offers better grid stability with flexibility – able to be quickly started and stopped – and reliability – providing constant power generation to ensure continuous operations for data centres – in comparison to renewables. “Renewable power, due to its intermittent nature, cannot be a sole solution [for data centres] without any backup power or storage.”

However, Wamsted is dismissive of the notion that gas is absolutely needed, saying any rise in demand can be met reliably and economically by renewable sources in markets like Texas with significant renewable capacity. “[In Texas] the 24/7 power demand sought by data centres and other high load users can be supplied by the ERCOT system. Saying data centres require gas or nuclear since they are supposedly more reliable is misleading,” he argues.

Do renewables have the power over gas?

Wamsted notes that Texas’ growing renewables capacity meets much of the state’s needs even as demand on the ERCOT climbed by 31.3% between 2016 and 2024. “Texas actually is a prime example of how quickly we can transition grids from fossil fuels to renewable energy, even without state support,” he says.

In theory, Texas could prove it is possible to power the AI future with clean energy.

Many Texas-based data centres are already trialling this. In 2024, Sabey Data Center Properties completed the construction of a Tier III two-storey 19,875m² facility in Austin, with a commitment to operate on 100% renewable energy. Similarly, Equinix built a Tier IV facility in Dallas to be entirely powered on renewables. As recently as April 2025, Soluna Holdings’ said its 120MW South Texas data centre project, Project Hedy, will also be powered entirely by wind.

There are others outside of the US, notes Vyakaranam. Malaysia’s Bridge Data Centres is actively integrating 400MW of renewable energy into its operations, with a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040. The country’s AirTrunk Operating is also constructing a data centre with the capacity to generate up to 30MW of renewable energy.

Despite these noteworthy blueprints, however, it seems Malaysia will also go big on gas as it tries to reduce coal use, yet balance the economic benefit of a growing data centre industry with the power it needs. With projections that the country will see demand triple in the five years to 2027, it plans to add 6–8GW of gas-fired capacity by the beginning of the next decade, according to the CEO of state utility provider Tenaga Nasional Berhad, Megat Jalaluddin.

While the country also has a goal of doubling its renewable capacity by 2030, overall, the transition to clean energy is more a long-term goal than one to meet the urgent demands of data centres.

Meanwhile, Vyakaranam says the US renewables sector is facing major challenges under the current administration, with Texas being no exception. “Trump’s position is poised to result in a significant increase in the growth of gas-powered energy production and stagnation of the renewables market,” he says.

This approach has its own difficulties. The US, Malaysia and others looking at a gas power boom face stiff competition for gas components – thus, heftier price tags.

The substantial increase in the gas-based project pipeline has seen the lead time for gas turbines reach around 5–7 years, according to GlobalData, meaning equipment manufacturers have had to ramp up production as they contend with huge order backlogs. “Power generation companies, in order to secure turbine supplies, are engaging in aggressive procurement strategies such as making order requests years in advance, diversifying their supplier network, and coming up with different project designs and configurations to avoid any grid reliability shortfalls,” Vyakaranam notes.

These considerations threaten Texas’ new gas turbine plans as they “cannot be resolved quickly, if at all”, warns Wamsted, adding that engineering, procurement and construction companies have “limited capability to meet the rapid proposed buildout”.

“Both of these capacity problems are raising the cost of gas-fired generation, which could put a brake on planned additions,” he continues. “New gas pipelines will be needed for many of the planned expansion efforts, which will take time and have significant capital costs.”

Are Malaysia and Texas part of a bigger picture?

Vyakaranam believes that renewables alone cannot yet power the world through its AI revolution – instead, gas power has to be part of the mix. “Although there will be a continued push towards renewables and battery storage innovations, which will eventually help meet data centres’ demand,” he says, “gas and nuclear will have to do some of the heavy lifting in the meantime.”

Wamsted takes a different view: “I would say it is renewables that can quickly and affordably meet the US’ rising electricity needs, not gas, which may be sold out through 2030, or nuclear, which is unlikely to add significant new capacity before 2035 at earliest.”

He also cautions against relying on gas alone. “All generation systems require maintenance and have unforced outages during the year […] Relying on one resource – or worse, one facility – would be highly risky,” he says.

However, the same could be said about renewables, particularly given their reliance on weather conditions and without the support of energy storage.

With data centres – and everything they enable – now part of our world, it seems energy transition hopes are destined to do battle with our thirst for technology. With strong support and opposition for both renewables and gas power to support the AI boom, the reality is likely somewhere in between.

Therefore, perhaps Texas and Malaysia have got it right, in spite of the raised eyebrows their approaches elicit. With battery storage still lacking, new gas turbines backlogged and nuclear, at best, a long-term investment, the best way to meet the exponentially increasing demand from data centres may be for renewables and gas power to work together.",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/08/shutterstock_175757288.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 13:07:40.054775

The dashboard also connects users to regional ag climate products and a variety of state-specific resources. State-specific pages, such as Indiana’s, link to tools and resources like the Purdue Mesonet and the Indiana State Climate Office.

“We want to provide as much clear, well-organized information to producers and advisors as possible so they can make confident management decisions, whether that’s on their own farms or helping clients,” said Austin Pearson, climatologist at the MRCC and Indiana State Climate Office.

By placing these tools in a single, easy-to-navigate platform, the dashboard allows users to make better-informed decisions and support profitability and yield.

The idea for the dashboard stemmed directly from farmers. “In 2023, we hosted workshops with farmers and one of the biggest takeaways was that while many ag climate tools exist, they aren’t found in one location,” Pearson said.

The dashboard hosts tools both developed by Purdue University and trusted external sources. For example, MRCC’s Corn Growing Degree Day tool helps track crop progress and predict maturity, while the Pest Forecasting Map from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet alerts farmers to threats like alfalfa weevil. Within the dashboard, users also have access to the Climate Prediction Center outlooks for temperature and precipitation, interactive maps, crop and disease forecasting, fieldwork planning tools, and localized climate summaries — all designed to support timely, informed decision-making throughout the year.

“The forecasting tools help farmers understand what pests — whether weeds, insects or diseases — could be an issue and when management is crucial,” Pearson said. “I encourage users to get into the dashboard and explore, as new tools are frequently added.”

Users can also consult climatologies through the platform to gain insights into historical weather patterns that may influence marketing and management strategies.

Beth Hall, director of the MRCC and Indiana State Climate Office, emphasized the broader vision of the project. “We’re discovering that individual states provide tools that are limited geographically. While searching for information, we found that there are missing tools — those that cover the full soybean production region. This inspires us to keep growing the dashboard to create a dynamic system that’s helpful for both a small geographic area and the whole region.”

Future enhancements will be guided by feedback from farmers and advisors. One requested addition is an irrigation planning tool, as several farmers are seeking region-specific guidance on how much water to apply to minimize waste. While isolated tools like this exist, they often lack the geographic specificity needed for practical field use.

Looking ahead, the MRCC plans to incorporate more interactive, user-friendly features, such as location-based maps that respond to ZIP code input, providing a customized experience for each user.

“This is just round one of the dashboard,” Hall said. “We really wanted to provide people a taste and hopefully get them excited about the future. I envision more and more of our tools offering a greater user experience.”",https://ag.purdue.edu/news/_files/images/tcam-8340-024-1801-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 14:09:43.493731

Quantum Computing’s Potential Impact on Energy Sector

The unit commitment problem refers to the challenge of determining the optimal schedule that would enable power generators to meet electricity demand at minimum cost. Scheduling is made complex due to the scale of power systems and the use of dispatchable energy resources, such as nuclear plants and natural gas, and intermittent sources like solar and wind.

According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, over 60 percent of energy used in electricity generation is lost. Optimized scheduling enabled by quantum computing offers opportunities for significant waste reduction in the grid.

“This case study, completed by ORNL in partnership with IonQ, demonstrated the feasibility of using an ion-trapped quantum computing device to solve the Unit Commitment problem in the power grid,” shared Suman Debnath, a senior research and development staff member at ORNL.

IonQ expects quantum computing to reach 100 to 200 high-fidelity qubits as early as 2026.

Another classic American model that has joined the EV revolution, even if in a slightly different way, is the Ford Mustang.
Even pickup trucks, which seem culturally about as far from the world of electric vehicles as you can get, can now count EVs among their ranks.","The automotive world is rapidly accelerating the electrification process. While combustion-powered vehicles still make up the majority of wheels on American roads, many gas-powered models are being replaced by EVs, and many more are leaning towards hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains.

The electric vehicle revolution may have been a long time in the making, with early examples of battery-powered cars going as far back as the dawn of automotive history itself, but it’s only in the past decade that it really started to pick up speed. American companies such as Tesla have played a pivotal role in bringing EVs to the world’s roads. Both established automakers and startups have been a crucial part of the rapid expansion of electric cars on the global automotive market.

Let’s explore the history of three American startups that have become major players in the automotive electrification movement, along with the legacy automakers that have helped make EVs mainstream.

Tesla: Where It All Began

When most people think about electric cars, one of the very first brand names that will inevitably come up is Tesla. Even in light of any controversial associations the Tesla brand may have in the present day, it is undeniable that the company has been one of the most important players in the electric vehicle revolution.

Originally founded under the name Tesla Motors, before it was shortened to simply Tesla, the company was created by entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003. A year later, Elon Musk became chairman; four years after that, he became CEO. Around this time, the company’s very first vehicle, the first-generation Roadster, was released.

Over the course of the next decade and a half, an entire lineup of Tesla models arrived on the market. The Model S sedan arrived in 2012, followed by the Model X SUV, the Model 3 sedan, the Model Y crossover, and most recently, two trucks: the Tesla Semi in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup in 2023.

Tesla’s models had an edge over the competition as they were not just all-electric, but also extremely high-tech, with sophisticated infotainment features, large touchscreens, and capabilities like over-the-air updates. The latter allowed drivers to upgrade their cars at any time, adding or removing features (sometimes through the controversial subscription model, which Tesla also helped introduce).

Not only did Tesla help popularize electric vehicles, it was also responsible for greatly expanding charging infrastructure, which had been one of the biggest obstacles to the expansion of the EV market around the world. The “Supercharger” fast charging network, which for many years was reserved exclusively for Tesla vehicles, is now open to models from several other automakers. Today, Tesla continues to be the biggest company in the EV market, representing around half of total EV sales in the United States.

Rivian: Eco-Friendly, Futuristic Ruggedness

Another American start-up focused on EVs that has rapidly grown bigger and more popular is Rivian, the quirky, planet-friendly brand responsible for the R1T and R1S. Rivian was initially founded under the name of Mainstream Motors in 2009, by engineer and entrepreneur Robert Scaringe. Later on, the company’s name was changed to Avera, before eventually settling on Rivian in 2011.

Around this time, the start-up firm also began to find its feet in the world of all-electric vehicles and exploring the world of autonomous driving. An initial design for a possible sports car was penned, but eventually shelved in 2011. It would be a few more years before any model with hope of a production run would be revealed: in 2017, the early versions of a pickup truck and SUV were revealed. These vehicles were initially named the A1T and A1C, however the names were later changed to R1T and R1S. Towards the end of 2018, the vehicles (and their updated names) were displayed at the Los Angeles Auto Show.

Production was initially due to begin in 2020, however delays related to the Covid pandemic and the chip shortage pushed the date back to 2021. Both models were eventually launched on the market for the 2022 model year. They are available with a variety of powertrain configurations, including a Quad-Motor layout that combines four electric motors to produce upwards of 800 hp. Their design takes inspiration from the natural world: every aspect of the vehicles, from color options to sustainable interior materials, reflects the company’s eco-friendly ethos.

Rivian is now expanding, with a couple of new SUV models in the pipeline: the R2 and R3. While the company currently only has one active factory in Illinois, there are plans to open a second facility in Georgia. A few years back, Rivian also had plans to establish its own Supercharger-style charging network, however the company eventually went on to adopt the NACS (North American Charging System).

Lucid: Sleek, Shiny, All-Electric

Next up, we have Lucid: leaning towards the luxury end of the market, with some models ranging well into six-figure price tag territory, Lucid is a brand with a futuristic, high-tech image. The company started out as a very different firm called Atieva, founded by a group of three entrepreneurs including Tesla’s then-vice president Bernard Tse. Atieva’s initial goal was not to build vehicles, but rather EV batteries and powertrains for other manufacturers.

In 2013, another former Tesla employee joined the fray: Peter Rawlinson, who had worked as vice president of engineering and chief engineer for the Model S. Rawlinson joined Atieva as chief technology officer, and soon after the company changed both name and direction. The newly-christened Lucid Motors was now focused on building a car of its own: a high-performance EV with a long driving range.

Work on the company’s first manufacturing facility started in 2016, around the time the earliest prototype of Lucid’s first model, the Air sedan, was being introduced. The first car eventually rolled off the production line in 2021. The Air lineup was eventually expanded to include several different versions, including the tri-motor Sapphire which can reach 60 mph in under two seconds.

Lucid unveiled its second model, the Gravity SUV, in 2020. The Gravity sports similar design features to the Air, adapted for an SUV body style. Production began in 2024, with the Gravity going on sale for the 2025 model year. Lucid has also announced that there is a new midsize SUV on the way, although at this stage details are still thin on the ground.

Not Just Startups: American Automakers' Electrification Journey

Start-ups may have been crucial in bringing the EV market to life, but legacy automakers have also had a very important role to play. As America helped bring the EV movement to life, its own automotive culture had to keep up with the changes as well. The muscle car, which is considered a staple of American car culture, has also adapted to the times: the legendary Dodge Charger now has an all-electric version, dubbed the Charger Daytona after the legendary nameplate from the model’s decades of history.

Another classic American model that has joined the EV revolution, even if in a slightly different way, is the Ford Mustang. The combustion-powered Mustang does, of course, still exist, but Ford has also repurposed the iconic nameplate (in a move that infuriated many car enthusiasts) for the Mustang Mach-E, an all-electric SUV.

Even pickup trucks, which seem culturally about as far from the world of electric vehicles as you can get, can now count EVs among their ranks. The Chevrolet Silverado, one of the best-selling pickup trucks in the United States, has had an EV version since last year. American automakers, whether startup or legacy, have played – and continue to play – a fundamental role in increasing the number of electric vehicles on the world’s roads.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/how-america-schooled-the-world.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 13:07:07.798588

By Laila Kearney

NEW YORK, August 4 (Reuters) - Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has signed agreements with two U.S. electric utilities to reduce its AI data center power consumption during times of surging demand on the grid, the company said on Monday, as energy-intensive AI use outpaces power supplies.

Utilities in the country have been inundated with requests for electricity for Big Tech's AI data centers, with demand eclipsing total available power supplies in some areas.

That power crunch has led to concerns about spiking bills for everyday homes and business and blackouts.

It has also complicated the technology industry's expansion of AI, which requires massive amounts of electricity - fast.

Google's agreements with Indiana Michigan Power and Tennessee Power Authority would involve scaling back power use at the technology giant's data centers when called upon by the electric utilities to free up space on the grid.

They are the first formal agreements by Google in demand-response programs with utilities to temporarily curtail its machine learning workloads, a subset of artificial intelligence.

""It allows large electricity loads like data centers to be interconnected more quickly, helps reduce the need to build new transmission and power plants, and helps grid operators more effectively and efficiently manage power grids,"" Google said in a blog post.

Demand-response programs have typically been used by other energy-intensive industries like heavy manufacturing or cryptocurrency mining. In exchange, the businesses generally receive payments or reduced power bills.

The programs involving AI activity in data centers is generally new, and details of the commercial arrangements between Google and the utilities were not clear.

While demand-response agreements apply only to a small portion of demand on the grid, the arrangements might become more common as U.S. electricity supply tightens.

“We aim to develop it into VinFast’s largest export hub for South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.” The 400-acre facility was inaugurated by Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin.
Speaking at the inauguration, CM Stalin said Tamil Nadu accounts for 40% of India’s EV production, with companies such as Tata Motors, Hyundai, Renault-Nissan, BYD and Ola Electric establishing or expanding EV manufacturing facilities in the state.
“Tamil Nadu is already recognised as the EV capital of India,” he said.","Vietnamese auto giant VinFast on Monday operationalised its $2 billion electric vehicle (EV) plant at Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu, marking the fastest manufacturing scale-up by any foreign carmaker in India.

The plant, its first in India and third globally, has been commissioned within 17 months of signing an agreement with the Tamil Nadu government.

“We feel very, very proud because this is the first manufacturing facility outside Vietnam,” said Pham Sanh Chau, CEO of VinFast Asia. “We aim to develop it into VinFast’s largest export hub for South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.”

The 400-acre facility was inaugurated by Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin. In March 2024, VinFast signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government for a potential $2 billion (Rs 16,000 crore) investment, with an initial commitment of $500 million (around Rs 4,500 crore) over the next five years. The company has invested Rs 1,300 crore so far to roll out 50,000 EVs annually. The plant will initially focus on premium electric SUV models, including the VF 6 and VF 7.

India to be key export and production hub

Chau said the company has already secured initial orders from several countries across South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The India facility, along with upcoming plants in Indonesia and North Carolina (USA), will support VinFast’s long-term goal of producing one million vehicles per year by 2030.

The Thoothukudi plant includes workshops for body, paint, assembly, quality control & logistics and also features an auxiliary cluster for local suppliers, which is expected to expand in the coming years. At full capacity, the facility will produce 150,000 vehicles annually and will employ 3,000–3,500 directly. “A lot of machinery is coming in. We are going to expand and will invest Rs 4,000 crore more,” Chau said, without giving a timeline.

Bookings open, retail expansion underway

VinFast opened pre-bookings for the VF 6 and VF 7 on July 15, with customers able to reserve their vehicles through showrooms or the company’s website, VinFastAuto.in, for a fully refundable booking amount of Rs 21,000. Chau said the company has been receiving interest from neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mauritius, and Bangladesh. “We have a very good online pre-booking response. I think momentum will explode the day we launch the cars, when we announce the feature list and pricing,” he said.

VinFast is following a comprehensive EV ecosystem model in India, spanning vehicle assembly, distribution, after-sales services, and battery recycling. It has partnered with multiple dealer groups in major cities and collaborated with RoadGrid, myTVS, and Global Assure to build a digital and service support network. It has also tied up with BatX Energies for battery recovery and reuse, aligning with its circular economy and sustainability goals in the world’s third-largest automobile market.

The company has also launched its retail operations in India, opening its first showroom in Surat, Gujarat, followed by its largest outlet in Chennai last week. VinFast plans to open 35 dealerships across over 27 cities by the end of the year.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) made its way to President Donald Trump’s desk and was signed into law on Independence Day. Fortunately for those of us in the clean energy industry — though also unfortunately — this is not our first rodeo. We have dealt with tariffs in the past, along with nearly two decades of dead stops, step-downs and extensions. Tax credits expire, then get resurrected last-minute. Projects move forward, then stall, then move forward.

While these policy pendulum swings can make long-term planning feel impossible, we shouldn’t confuse complexity with catastrophe. Our sector’s secret weapon is agility. We move fast, adapt faster and often turn policy hiccups into competitive advantage. If solar and wind are indeed the fastest and cheapest sources of energy, we can solve the rest.

In the distributed generation space, our real edge is speed: going from development, construction to operation in months rather than years, even under OBBBA’s compressed timelines. Companies in our space are typically nimble and able to pivot quickly, more so than many of our utility-scale counterparts.

Early in my career, I identified universal truths that all renewables stakeholders, big and small, live by, and that now underpin my best practices.

Migraines per megawatt

One hard truth is this: big projects, big problems; small projects, big problems.

Distributed generation project development suffers many of the same headaches that our grid-scale brethren do. Uniquely for distributed generation is that every project has a ZIP code, and every ZIP code has an opinion. It is just as debilitating when we’re dealing with multiple small assets, and sometimes even more, than one large project.

I call this the “migraines per megawatt” ratio — the number of local hurdles per megawatt of capacity. To scale, developers must drive that ratio down. This is where standardized processes and repeatable playbooks for site evaluation, engineering, procurement and construction selection, and financing allow scaling faster while maintaining flexibility.

Policy risk is the only constant

No matter how robust the legislation, incentive frameworks, trade policies and interconnection rules will shift. Planning for policy volatility via flexible financing, risk sharing and adaptive schedules is non-negotiable.

Bridging the financing chasm

Additionally, regardless of project size, bridging the chasm from early-stage development to financial close and construction is a monumental task. Projects can sit for months in limbo, waiting for permits, interconnection or capital partner decisions. In that time, you’re fronting engineering, legal, interconnection deposits and safe harbor costs, without revenue or committed capital. That warehousing period is intensive and risky, especially for smaller platforms that aren’t well capitalized. The carry costs can pile up, and if a deal slips or dies, that sunk cost directly hits the developer’s balance sheet.

These lessons inspired four survival tactics that are more critical now than ever:

Capital counts: Having strong parent backing with dry powder and long runway are today’s superpowers, de-risking projects and unlocking better debt and tax equity terms.

Lock in safe harbor: Remember the great safe harbor rush of 2010s? It’s back! This time, expect twists in the form of executive orders that may make it even more difficult to get certainty. Keep top-tier tax counsel on speed-dial to secure your credits.

Sharing (risks) is caring: Expect more risk sharing between buyers and sellers of “notice to proceed” assets. Strong local developers and EPC partners will make all the difference.

Cost discipline trumps growth: Deals will continue to get done, but the market has moved from open bar to bring your own beverage. Developers that continue to be disciplined will be rewarded by the market.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/l4YNAUJwe08a3S68l6zoktSRkARAdQ8bdFBYdX6AWPc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDIwODM5NTAzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-04 12:14:34.446386

The development of utility-scale solar power plants is a costly and complex undertaking that requires extensive expertise to avoid pitfalls. Most solar project developers rely on debt financing to fund their projects, and when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases, leading to higher project expenditures. Given the high cost of capital and the fact that O&M costs for renewable power plants are considerable, it is critical that developers, owners, and operators seek out project savings wherever possible.

One often overlooked area to optimize efficiencies is the solar cable management sector. The traditional “bundled” way in which solar cabling has been designed, procured, and installed has greatly lacked improvement over the years.

Affordable Wire Management (AWM), a leading provider of solar cable management systems (CMS), is pioneering a new approach. Leveraging a combination of software, utility-scale expertise, and engineering skills, they have developed a completely new approach that is changing the entire electrical Balance of Systems (eBOS) sector.

Hickory Park Solar: Project Overview and Partners

Hickory Solar Park, a 110-megawatt (MWac) project under construction near Jerseyville, Illinois, is an excellent example of AWM’s transformative approach. Located just north of St. Louis, the project is jointly owned by EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA) and Volt Energy Utility as part of their partnership with Microsoft to integrate social equity into the U.S. Energy Transition.

Once operational, it will cover more than 1,000 acres with bifacial tracking solar photovoltaic panels, generating enough clean energy to power nearly 28,000 homes in Illinois. The solar array will significantly lower electricity costs for local communities, support the Illinois electricity grid, and save 139 million gallons of water each year.

AWM was initially brought into the Hickory Solar Park project by the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) lead McCarthy, which suggested AWM after partnering with the company on two previous projects, Sun Mountain and Bright Arrow. McCarthy understood that AWM’s offerings, engineered to withstand heavy ice and snow loads, were ideal for the Midwestern-based project. Additionally, AWM had an excellent track record of working on utility-scale solar projects in Canada and other U.S. states prone to extreme weather, such as Washington, Oregon, and Montana.

AWM collaborated with two other partners, Stellavise Solar Engineering and Voltage, on the Hickory Solar Park project. Stellavise, founded in 2014, focuses on the utility-scale solar and storage industry and is the engineer-of-record (EOR). Voltage, the eBOS partner, provides balance-of-system solutions and services across a broad spectrum of the renewable energy sector. Voltage’s LYNX trunk bus system, an eBOS cable system, was selected for the project.

Although AWM’s offerings were chosen for their durability and reliability, AWM was selected as the CMS vendor for more strategic reasons. In fact, thanks to AWM’s holistic CMS and an innovative approach, its role in the project became quite pivotal.

AWM’s Groundbreaking Ampacity Optimization Analysis

AWM’s Ampacity Optimization Analysis, a proprietary analysis protocol which they developed in 2022, was the driver that led to substantial system-wide improvements. Thanks to AWM’s accurate assessment of cabling and ampacity, the Hickory Solar Park project was able to optimize the cable arrangements, which in turn led to design improvements and lower costs.

Originally, the Voltage DC trunk bus cables were specified at 500kcmil, which is typical for utility-scale solar projects of this size. However, when AWM created a project-specific cable arrangement, they found that the trunk bus cables could be reduced from 500kcmil to 350kcmil. The AWM team then validated that arrangement with their ampacity analysis.

Leveraging AWM’s calculations, smaller Voltage trunk bus cables were procured, resulting in a lower LCOE for the project. AWM and Stellavise worked collaboratively, as Brice Casebeer, co-founder and principal engineer for Stellavise, explained.

“With AWM’s guidance, we placed cables in the AWM hangers in accordance with their modeled scenarios, which added considerable cost benefits to the project,” Casebeer said.

Engineering Innovations and Benefits

All the commercial partners, and in turn EDP Renewables North America, the project developer, realized substantial improvements. McCarthy, impressed by AWM’s analysis, commended the team for the value engineering.

“Expert engineering talent is critical and rare in the cable management sector,” noted Casebeer. “AWM’s team is unbeatable in that regard. Not only do they have skilled engineering professionals on their staff, but they also have years of experience in utility-scale solar. Their ability to deliver accurate ampacity calculations gave us the opportunity to place smaller cables in strategic locations. Their offerings truly solve real-world engineering challenges in the solar cable wire management sector.”

The collaboration among AWM, McCarthy, Stellavise, and Voltage was key to the success of the project, demonstrating the power of partnerships and innovation. Hickory Solar Park will set the benchmark for future projects.

Smoke from Canadian wildfires has continued to drift over the Midwest, blanketing the region with haze and poor air quality, prompting the National Weather Service (NWS) to issue alerts across several states, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa.

Newsweek reached out to the National Weather Service via email for comment.

Why It Matters

The increased concentration of airborne fine particulate matter, PM2.5, from wildfires can worsen respiratory and heart conditions, making sensitive groups particularly vulnerable, especially people with asthma, heart disease or other preexisting respiratory conditions.

Air quality alerts have been in place for a couple of days, with individual National Weather Service offices previously reporting unhealthy conditions. Earlier this week, wildfire smoke from Canada was so thick over Chicago that the city recorded the worst air quality in the world.

What To Know

On the World Quality Air Index, which measures global pollution, Detroit saw a sharp spike as ash and other particulates drifted over the border from Canada.

At the time of writing, Detroit ranks third in the entire world, behind Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Toronto, which is also being affected by the Canadian wildfires.

The current rankings indicate that Detroit is more polluted than Kolkata, one of India's largest cities, and every other city in the United States.

The Air Index assigned Detroit an air quality score of 155, making it one of only five cities in the world currently considered ""unhealthy"" to be in.

Across the eight affected states, the NWS warned that when pollution levels are elevated, people should ""consider limiting strenuous outdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health effects.""

In addition to limiting outdoor physical activity, the agency has urged people and businesses to ""avoid activities which lead to ozone formation,"" listing out activities like refueling vehicles or using gasoline-powered lawn equipment.

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy said that ""high pressure settling overhead will limit dispersion and keep smoke at the surface through today.""

What People Are Saying

Matt Taraldsen, a meteorologist at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, told The New York Times earlier this week: ""This is the first time that we've had a weeklong worth of alerts across the entire state. Especially at levels that weren't just unhealthy for sensitive groups, at levels that are unhealthy for everyone.""

AccuWeather wrote in a Friday X post: ""Wildfire smoke from Canada smothered Chicago yesterday, giving the city the worst air quality in the world for several hours and blanketing the skyline in haze.""

What Happens Next

The smoke is expected to continue to impact the region throughout the weekend, with some alerts until Saturday afternoon and others until Monday.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2696026/detroit.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 12:18:28.706967

Will other hyperscalers follow suit and find a couple of hours each year to support the grid in collaboration with local utilities?","Hyperscaler Google has reached an agreement with Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) that could serve as a model for future demand response structures between utilities and large load customers.

I&M, an American Electric Power (AEP) company, recently filed a special, joint contract with Google that is designed to support I&M’s capacity needs through clean generation and the use of a demand response structure. The collaborative effort between I&M and Google was filed with the Indiana Utilities Regulatory Commission (IURC) on July 30. It outlines a custom demand response structure that aligns with Google’s operational abilities, which apparently are becoming more elastic thanks to the very processes going on inside its data centers.

Through its participation, Google will leverage “new capabilities” that allow it to make machine learning (ML) more flexible, allowing the company to reduce or shift electricity demand to carry out non-urgent tasks during hours when the electric grid is under less stress. This is huge for I&M, which can accordingly decrease its peak load in times of high energy demand. As a large load customer, Google’s participation in the program boosts Indiana Michigan Power’s ability to manage peaks, which helps lower overall energy costs for ratepayers.

“As we add new large loads to our system, it is critical that we partner with our customers to effectively manage the generation and transmission resources necessary to serve them. Google’s ability to leverage load flexibility will be a highly valuable tool to meet their future energy needs,” said Steve Baker, president and chief operating officer of I&M.

The program is similar to those currently available to residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) customers. If approved by the IURC, the utility says this agreement will reduce I&M’s long-term generation requirements and financial commitments to benefit all of its customers.

In April 2024, AWS announced an $11 billion investment in a data center campus west of New Carlisle, Indiana, and Google announced a $2 billion data center in Fort Wayne, where I&M is headquartered. Those investments are among the most significant economic development projects in the state’s history, and they’re expected to deliver substantial benefits to local communities.

“As AI growth accelerates, we recognize the need to expand our demand response toolkit and develop capabilities specifically for machine learning workloads. Working closely with I&M to include load flexibility as part of the overall supply plan, we can support future power needs even where power generation and transmission are constrained. We want to be thoughtful about how we can continue to be a good grid citizen and see this as a vital tool for enabling responsible data center growth,” added Amanda Peterson Corio, global head of data center energy at Google.

More than 85% of the energy delivered by I&M in 2023 was emission-free. The utility’s portfolio includes 2,278 megawatts (MW) of nuclear generation in Michigan, 450 MW of purchased wind generation from Indiana, more than 22 MW of hydro generation in both states, and approximately 35 MW of large-scale solar generation in both states. The company’s generation portfolio also includes 1,497 MW of coal-fueled generation.

A Little Flexibility Goes a Long Way

Electricity demand is increasing across the United States, particularly in the Midwest, a hot region for data center development. Such intensive computing operations, which can draw as much power as a small city, are straining the grid, demanding new generation and transmission infrastructure development.

But as much as data centers can be a problem for grid reliability, there are good reasons to believe they can be part of a solution. A recent study out of Duke University indicated that 76 gigawatts (GW) of new load could be added if those customers could curtail 0.25% of their maximum uptime.

“Our study demonstrates that existing US power system capacity—intentionally designed to handle extreme peak demand swings—could accommodate significant load additions with modest flexibility measures,” explained lead author Tyler Norris, a Ph.D student at the Nicholas School of the Environment. “Overall, the findings suggest that load flexibility offers a promising near-term strategy for regulators and market participants to more quickly integrate new loads, reduce the cost of capacity expansion, and enable greater focus on the highest-value investments in the electric power system.”

According to the study, the average duration of load curtailment would be relatively short, around 1.7 hours if limited to 0.25%, 2.1 hours at a 0.5% limit, and 2.5 hours at a 1.0% limit.

Will other hyperscalers follow suit and find a couple of hours each year to support the grid in collaboration with local utilities? It sounds like a win-win, and now there’s a roadmap to follow.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ChatGPT-Image-Aug-4-2025-11_09_01-AM.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 12:14:52.872524

The new law handed out billions of dollars in fossil-fuel subsidies while actively dismantling EV and clean energy incentives, programs, and regulations. We’re calling it the dirty dozen, 12 ways this legislation directly or indirectly targets electric vehicles.

The most significant impacts

1. Termination of consumer clean vehicle tax credits – September 30

The last reconciliation package passed in 2022 reauthorized and expanded consumer tax credits for new, used, and commercial electric vehicles. It also extended and expanded tax credits for building out EV charging stations, including incentives for home chargers and large commercial projects. Tax credits were designed to be user-friendly, as upfront incentives and could be used by those without tax liability, including consumers and tax-exempt entities like municipalities, states, and nonprofits. The tax credits were originally set to expire at the end of 2032, but will now expire on September 30, 2026.

How this hurts EV adoption

Eliminating these tax credits hurts EV adoption in multiple ways. Over the course of more than 100 years, automakers have optimized the process of manufacturing internal combustion engines. Switching to an entirely new technology requires investment and a learning curve that creates some inefficiencies. This generally results in a higher upfront cost of EVs.

These tax credits entice buyers to try out electric technology while simultaneously offering a bit of a buffer to automakers to account for the losses associated with making the switch. While EVs save drivers money over time through fuel and maintenance savings, repealing these tax credits makes it harder for consumers–especially working-class consumers–to afford the upfront cost of an EV. Terminating these tax credits will hurt consumers who want to drive electric vehicles while making it harder for legacy automakers to make the switch to electric.

2. Additional restrictions on manufacturing tax credits

Another important tax credit for EV adoption is the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit. This tax credit supports the build-out of a domestic supply chain for EV batteries and components. Even though lithium-ion batteries were first developed in the U.S., China invested heavily in the mass production of lithium-ion batteries as traction batteries and now leads the world in battery production and technology. It also dominates the global mineral supply and processing for these batteries.

The Act modifies the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit to restrict access to credits for taxpayers with prohibited foreign entity relationships. This means that automakers interested in relying on material assistance from China to develop battery plants in the U.S. to manufacture batteries like Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries may not be able to access the tax credits. (LFP batteries are a popular, stable, durable, inexpensive type of EV battery that don’t need cobalt or nickel.)

How this hurts EV adoption

One in four vehicles sold globally this year will have a plug. For U.S. automakers to remain globally competitive, they need to manufacture EVs and build a domestic supply chain that includes EV batteries. Placing additional restrictions on these tax credits that prevent the credits from being used to reestablish important battery technology in the U.S. will hamstring the U.S. auto industry in its transition to domestic EV and battery manufacturing.

3. Elimination of monetary penalties for the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards

CAFE standards were passed by Congress in 1975 to address the oil crisis by requiring vehicles to be more efficient. Since then, the average fuel economy of vehicles has nearly tripled, saving trillions of gallons of gasoline. More efficient vehicles save drivers hundreds of dollars each year in fuel costs and directly reduce tailpipe pollution and climate-changing emissions. The reconciliation bill kneecaps these standards by reducing the penalties to $0, for noncompliance.

How this hurts EV adoption

Eliminating penalties for noncompliance hurts EV adoption in two ways. First, the way CAFE standards work is that automakers must meet a minimum average fuel economy across their entire fleet. As mentioned earlier, automakers transitioning to EVs typically lose money on them at first. But EVs have been powerful tools in meeting CAFE compliance targets. Since EVs are so efficient, they can drive up fleet efficiency averages, allowing automakers flexibility in meeting the standards.

The second way this change hurts EV adoption is that EV-only automakers will take a huge hit from the loss of credit revenues. Automakers that manufacture gas guzzlers and don’t meet the standards buy credits from automakers that do meet these standards. EV-only manufacturers like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid rely heavily on these credits for revenue to help them establish their fledgling businesses. This year, credit sales will contribute $2.17 billion to Tesla’s bottom line, making up about 75% of Tesla’s revenue. In 2024, Rivian generated $325 million in revenue from regulatory credits, which helped the company remain financially viable as it gained traction.

Direct impacts

4. Cancellation of remaining funds from Department of Energy loan programs

Congress rescinded, or took back, any funds that have not been committed through signed contracts from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program.

How this hurts EV adoption

Loans like these support major investments in U.S. EV manufacturing. The loans’ effects catalyze private capital to build facilities that create jobs, develop local economies, and make EVs less expensive for consumers. One of these DOE loans helped Rivian build its Georgia manufacturing site. General Motors used one of the loans to work with LG Energy Solution to establish a battery plant to manufacture Ultium battery cells. Ford, Nissan, and Tesla have also used these loans to advance cleaner vehicle technology manufacturing. Companies that were planning on using these loans to build manufacturing facilities, but have not yet signed agreements, are out of luck, and the companies and communities relying on the jobs from these plants will suffer.

5. Clawback of uncontracted funding for the EPA Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicle program

This program supports the replacement of diesel heavy-duty vehicles with electric heavy-duty vehicles, including electric school buses across the country, but particularly in communities with poor air quality.

How this hurts EV adoption

Heavy-duty vehicles only make up about 10% of vehicles on the road, but they produce 28% of greenhouse gas emissions and 57% percent of particulate matter emissions, which cause serious health impacts. These pollutants disproportionately affect the health of people living in lower-income neighborhoods and communities of color. The market for heavy-duty electric vehicles is less established than the light-duty EV market, and providing funding to support the heavy-duty clean vehicle industry while reducing pollution in the hardest-hit areas is a win-win. Without this funding, EV manufacturers go without support, and more heavy-duty diesel vehicles get replaced with heavy-duty diesel vehicles, not EVs, keeping air quality harmful in many places.

6. Repealed authorization for Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds (GGRF) and rescission (clawback) of unobligated program funding

The GGRF was designed to support disadvantaged communities that are disproportionately affected by pollution. The program provided resources for clean energy, including electric transportation.

How this hurts EV adoption

Eliminating unobligated funds from GGRF removes funding for transportation electrification in the communities that need it most. It also takes away funding that can be directly used to purchase EVs or install infrastructure in these communities.

7. Cancellation of any remaining funds for Climate Pollution Reduction Grants

These grants can be used to electrify vehicles to reduce pollution in states, cities, tribes, and territories.

How this hurts EV adoption

This removes Congressionally-approved federal funding to address pollution, air quality, and climate issues through EV and charging infrastructure investments. It means fewer EVs will be purchased and fewer chargers installed in cities, states, tribes, and territories. Not only does this directly reduce EV sales, but the lack of charging infrastructure investment and buildout erodes consumer confidence in driving electric vehicles and poses a barrier to EV adoption.

8. Clawback of unobligated funding for Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants

Electric vehicle and infrastructure projects that benefit disadvantaged communities were eligible for funding through this program.

How this hurts EV adoption

Eliminating support for projects that include vehicle electrification directly reduces EV adoption.

9. Elimination of additional funds for low-income and disadvantaged communities appropriated through the Diesel Emissions Reductions Act (DERA) program

The Inflation Reduction Act included $60 million of funding specifically to reduce diesel emissions from trucks and vehicles in disproportionately impacted communities, typically lower-income communities and communities where people of color live, to address the negative health impacts of vehicle pollution in these communities. Vehicle electrification projects are eligible for these grants.

How this hurts EV adoption

Similar to the answer to No. 5, this rescinded or clawed-back funding disrupts programs that transition dirty diesel vehicles to clean electric vehicles. This means that older, high-polluting vehicles will stay on the roads longer and that fledgling heavy-duty electric vehicle manufacturers will sell fewer vehicles.

10. Cancellation of additional funding for GSA Emerging Technologies.

This includes funds that can be used for the electrification of the federal government fleets.

How this hurts EV adoption

The General Services Administration manages over 650,000 vehicles. Based on EVs’ cost savings and reduced maintenance, the vast majority of these should be electric. Removing incentives to electrify this massive fleet slows EV adoption and makes the government more reliant on oil and gas. It also eliminates an incentive to install charging infrastructure, which supports range confidence and drives EV adoption.

Indirect impacts

11. Termination of Clean Energy Tax Credits

While the termination of solar and wind tax credits doesn’t directly impact EV sales, they are likely to slow EV market growth indirectly. Solar photovoltaics and onshore wind generation are the least expensive options for electricity generation today. By withdrawing subsidies for these options, affordable clean energy capacity will decline, and electricity prices will become more expensive. Numerous analyses predict U.S. household electricity expenses to go up by between $78 and $192 annually.

How this hurts EV adoption

One of the big selling points of electric vehicles is that they cost less to fuel with electricity. If electricity costs rise and gas prices stay low, EV cost savings are reduced; these cost savings are a major driver of EV adoption. Rooftop solar tax credits are also being cancelled. EV drivers are three times more likely than gas car drivers to have home solar panels. We hear from EV drivers that they love being energy-independent when they power their cars with energy they create. Eliminating tax credits on solar panels will remove an incentive for consumer clean energy investments and clean vehicles at the same time.

12. Elimination of unspent funds for programs to support the electric grid

These include loan programs for Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment and Transmission Facility Financing, Grants to Facilitate the Siting of Interstate Electricity Transmission Lines, and Interregional and Offshore Wind Electricity Transmission Planning, Modeling, and Analysis.

The rescission of the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program will undermine consenting Tribal energy development organizations’ efforts to grow technical capacity to develop energy resources on Tribal lands, integrate energy resources, and build resources for energy-related environmental programs.

How this hurts EV adoption

Similar to the repeal of solar and wind tax credits, this will lead to higher energy costs and will reduce cost savings from driving electric if gas prices continue to stay low.

The kicker

American taxpayers spend roughly $20 billion each year to subsidize the oil and gas industry through tax breaks and consumer subsidies for things like home heating oil.

In addition to eliminating clean energy subsidies and programs, this bill handed oil and gas drillers a major victory by directing the IRS to factor “intangible drilling costs” into corporate tax liabilities. According to Kingdom Exploration:

The 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act transforms oil and gas investing by allowing 100% immediate tax write-off of working interest investments against any income source. This unprecedented tax incentive makes oil well investments one of the most powerful wealth-building and tax-reduction strategies available to high-income earners.

This is expected to cost taxpayers an additional $1.1 billion in lost tax revenue, as it effectively allows oil and gas drillers to avoid the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax completely. In addition, the bill mandates oil and gas lease sales and requires lease auctions in Alaska at least four times over the next 10 years. The bill allows oil and gas companies to leap ahead in line and expedite permits by paying a fee, and discounts the royalty rates that oil and gas companies pay to drill and extract on public lands to the lowest levels in nearly two decades. The bill also adds $171 million to the taxpayers’ bills to buy crude oil from oil companies to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

But, EVs are here to stay

In spite of the regressive, environmentally, economically, and socially harmful provisions in this bill, there are a few things we are optimistic about. Plug In America’s 2025 EV Driver Survey was recently published, and it showed that EV loyalty continues to grow among EV drivers. EV drivers consistently love their cars, and this year, we saw more younger EV drivers join the fan club. Nearly 92% of EV driver respondents said it is likely or very likely their next vehicle will be an EV, an increase from the 89% of EV driver respondents who said the same last year.

We also found that as people are exposed to EVs more, they become more likely to purchase or lease one. So, sharing your EV adventures with neighbors and family members is key to accelerating EV adoption. Plus, our survey found that once drivers get their own EV, the vast majority of concerns they had about batteries, range, technology, reliability, and cost fade.

The rest of the world is moving to EVs. China now sells more EVs each year than all vehicles sold in the U.S., including gas-powered vehicles. This bill will isolate the United States and cede leadership on clean energy and EVs to more ambitious countries. Still, the global momentum of clean energy and clean vehicles will continue. The U.S. will eventually follow along, sacrificing this opportunity to address climate change, reduce pollution and related public health damages and costs, build the economy, catalyze innovation, and create millions of good-paying jobs, making it more likely that we will buy future vehicles from other countries.",,N,,2025-08-04 15:02:30.279344

PSE&G's energy efficiency programs—proven to deliver financial, environmental, and social returns—offer a blueprint for this transformation.","In an era where climate goals and affordability crises collide, utility-led energy efficiency programs are emerging as a scalable, high-impact solution. Among the leaders in this space, Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&G) has demonstrated a compelling model for investors: a dual focus on environmental stewardship, social equity, and financial returns. For PSE&G, energy efficiency is not just a regulatory obligation—it's a strategic asset that aligns with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) priorities while delivering tangible value to ratepayers and shareholders alike.

PSE&G's Energy Efficiency ROI: A Data-Driven Case Study

PSE&G's 2025 Clean Energy Future – Energy Efficiency II Program has become a benchmark for utility innovation. By 2025, the program had served 1.9 million customers, with over 415,000 actively participating in initiatives like home energy assessments, appliance rebates, and on-bill repayment financing. These efforts have yielded $640 million in annual savings for customers, while avoiding 1.8 million metric tons of CO2 emissions—equivalent to removing 400,000 gasoline-powered vehicles from the road.

The financial returns are equally impressive. For every dollar invested in energy efficiency, PSE&G projects a $4.30 return in net benefits (cost savings minus program costs) over the program's lifecycle. This is driven by reduced energy demand, lower infrastructure strain, and deferred capital expenditures. For example, the Whole Home Energy Solutions program offers rebates of up to $6,000 and interest-free on-bill repayment of up to $25,000, enabling customers to finance upgrades without upfront costs. The result? A win-win: customers see lower bills, and the utility avoids the need for costly grid expansions.

Environmental Impact: A Catalyst for Decarbonization

PSE&G's programs have achieved 2.5 million megawatt-hours of annual electricity savings and 64 million therms of natural gas savings, directly supporting New Jersey's goal of reducing emissions by 85% below 2006 levels by 2050. The FlexPower Program, which incentivizes demand-response measures like smart thermostat adjustments, has further reduced grid stress during peak periods.

These outcomes are not isolated. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) ranked New Jersey #8 nationally in its 2025 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard, a testament to PSE&G's role in advancing the state's clean energy agenda. For investors, this alignment with state policy creates a stable regulatory environment and long-term growth potential.

Affordability and Social Equity: The Human Side of ESG

PSE&G's programs also address energy affordability, a critical ESG component. In 2024, the utility provided $265 million in bill assistance to 226,000 customers through programs like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and SHARES. Additionally, the Equal Payment Plan and deferred payment arrangements help vulnerable households manage bills without sacrificing service.

The Clean Energy Jobs Program further underscores PSE&G's social impact, having placed 2,700 workers in clean energy roles. This workforce development not only supports local economies but also strengthens the utility's operational capacity, creating a virtuous cycle of job creation and program scalability.

A Model for Future Utility Investments

PSE&G's success lies in its ability to balance competing priorities: decarbonization, affordability, and profitability. The utility's $2.9 billion Clean Energy Future – Energy Efficiency II Program (2025–2029) aims to expand these initiatives, targeting an additional $1.2 billion in customer savings and 3.5 million metric tons of CO2 avoided by 2030.

For investors, PSE&G's approach offers three key takeaways:

1. Scalability: Energy efficiency programs can be replicated across regions, creating recurring revenue streams and long-term asset value.

2. Regulatory Tailwinds: State-level clean energy mandates (e.g., New Jersey's Clean Energy Act) provide a predictable policy framework.

3. Shareholder Value: By reducing infrastructure costs and extending the life of existing assets, utilities can enhance margins while meeting ESG goals.

Investment Implications: Why PSE&G's Model Matters

PSE&G's track record positions it as a bellwether for the next phase of utility evolution. As climate risks intensify and energy costs rise, utilities that prioritize efficiency and equity will outperform peers. For investors, this means:

- Diversifying portfolios to include utilities with robust ESG-aligned programs.

- Monitoring policy shifts in states like New Jersey, where clean energy targets drive demand for efficiency solutions.

- Evaluating governance structures that prioritize stakeholder capitalism, as seen in PSE&G's customer-centric approach.

In the coming years, the utility sector will face pressure to transition from cost-of-service models to value-driven strategies. PSE&G's energy efficiency programs—proven to deliver financial, environmental, and social returns—offer a blueprint for this transformation. For those seeking to align capital with purpose, the message is clear: invest in utilities that turn sustainability into scalability.

This article synthesizes PSE&G's achievements to highlight a broader investment thesis: energy efficiency is not a niche initiative but a cornerstone of future-proof utility strategy. As the world grapples with climate and affordability challenges, PSE&G's model proves that ESG and profitability are not mutually exclusive—they are mutually reinforcing.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-04 12:12:59.693356

Duke Energy's recent expansion of energy efficiency and demand response programs in South Carolina exemplifies this triad of priorities, positioning the company to deliver long-term shareholder value while advancing its clean energy transition.

A Blueprint for Efficiency-Driven Growth

Approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) and launched on August 1, 2025, Duke Energy's updated initiatives reflect a strategic recalibration. For residential customers, the introduction of free home energy assessments—complete with complimentary smart power strips, efficient showerheads, and caulking—addresses immediate cost-saving needs. Expanded rebates under the Smart $aver® program for insulation, water heaters, and smart thermostats further incentivize low-carbon upgrades. Meanwhile, programs like Power Manager® and EnergyWise Home® now offer increased bill credits for shifting energy use, directly tying customer savings to grid stability during peak demand.

Business customers, too, benefit from a 20-25% average increase in incentives. The PowerShare® program, which pays businesses to reduce energy use during high-demand periods, now offers $5 per kW in capacity credits (up from $3.50), a move that rewards corporate participants while bolstering grid resilience. These enhancements align with the S.C. Energy Security Act's emphasis on energy efficiency, ensuring Duke remains a proactive partner in state-level decarbonization efforts.

Financial Metrics: From Cost Savings to Shareholder Returns

Duke Energy's strategic investments in South Carolina are not just customer-centric; they are underpinned by a robust financial framework. The company's $75 billion in rate base investments since 2023—including grid modernization and renewable energy projects—has been instrumental in securing regulatory approvals. These investments are part of a broader $145 billion, 10-year capital plan, which is projected to generate $250 billion in economic output and support over 20,000 jobs annually.

The alignment with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) further amplifies Duke's competitive edge. By leveraging federal tax credits for clean energy technologies, the company reduces customer costs while accelerating its path to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and net-zero methane emissions from its gas business by 2030. These milestones are not just environmental targets—they are financial levers. In 2024, Duke Energy reported adjusted EPS of $1.18, exceeding analyst expectations, and maintains long-term EPS growth guidance of 5–7% through 2028.

The Clean Energy Transition as a Strategic Differentiator

Duke Energy's exit from its unregulated Commercial Renewables business—selling it to Brookfield Renewable for $2.8 billion—further sharpens its focus on regulated clean energy projects. This capital reallocation strengthens its balance sheet and enables continued investment in grid modernization, nuclear energy, and energy storage. The company's disciplined approach to capital allocation—prioritizing projects with strong regulatory tailwinds and customer affordability—has been a key driver of its 5.1% dividend yield as of Q3 2025, a metric that appeals to income-focused investors.

For shareholders, the synergy between Duke's energy efficiency programs and its clean energy roadmap is clear. By reducing energy waste and deferring costly infrastructure upgrades, these initiatives lower long-term grid costs while accelerating decarbonization. The result is a virtuous cycle: lower customer bills, enhanced regulatory approval, and sustainable revenue growth.

Investment Implications

Duke Energy's South Carolina initiatives underscore a broader trend: utilities that integrate energy efficiency into their core strategy outperform peers in both ESG metrics and shareholder returns. With a leveraged capital structure that balances debt and equity, and a regulated earnings model insulated from commodity price swings, Duke offers a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to the clean energy transition.

However, risks remain. Regulatory delays or cost overruns in grid modernization could pressure margins. Investors should monitor Duke's return on equity (ROE) and debt-to-equity ratio as key indicators of financial health. For now, the company's alignment with state mandates, IRA incentives, and customer-centric innovation positions it as a leader in the next phase of energy evolution.

In conclusion, Duke Energy's strategic expansion in South Carolina is more than a regulatory compliance play—it is a calculated move to secure long-term value. As the clean energy transition accelerates, utilities that prioritize efficiency, affordability, and sustainability will lead the pack.

Why it matters: Surging power bills could further stress many Americans' budgets as pretty much everything else gets more expensive, too.

By the numbers: The nationwide average retail residential price for 1 kilowatt-hour of electricity rose from 16.41 cents to 17.47 cents between May 2024 and May 2025, per the latest available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a gain of about 6.5%.

Some states saw much larger increases, such as Maine (+36.3%), Connecticut (+18.4%) and Utah (+15.2%).

Just five states saw a decrease, including Nevada (-17.7%) and Hawai'i (-7%).

Between the lines: Electricity prices vary regionally and have many influences, from basic supply and demand to fuel rates and infrastructure costs.

Yet many analysts point to power-hungry data centers as a driver of rising rates, especially in data center hotspots.

That's partly because of data centers' immediate demand for energy, but also because grid operators are investing in new transmission lines and other gear to handle their expected proliferation — and passing those costs along to customers.

What they're saying: ""Anywhere you're seeing a massive takeoff in load growth, the most likely cause is data centers, and that is almost certainly going to have an impact on electric rates,"" says Cathy Kunkel, energy consultant at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

A new IEEFA analysis highlights a dramatic spike in capacity market prices set at auction by PJM — an electric grid operator covering many Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states — largely tied to data centers, like those in Northern Virginia's ""data center alley.""

One estimate found that data centers accounted for over 60% of the increase in prices in a PJM auction held last year, the report says — representing $9.3 billion that will be passed along to customers.

Zoom in: A December 2024 report from the Virginia General Assembly's Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found that data centers in the area are covering their own usage for now, but predicts that locals could see a $14-$37 increase in their monthly bills by 2040, before inflation.

Friction point: Data centers' need for power may outstrip electric utilities' ability to feed them, the JLARC report found, slowing their growth.

Meanwhile, utilities that invest in new infrastructure to power the AI boom could find themselves in trouble should that boom turn out to be a bubble.

What good are a bunch of new transmission lines if there's no power-thirsty customer at the other end?

What's next: The Trump administration is pushing ""coal, natural gas, nuclear and hydropower plants to feed AI demand,"" Axios' Daniel Moore reports — but is hostile towards wind and solar.

Adding new generation of any kind, meanwhile, takes time and money.

When we left office, we had committed $108B for clean energy and manufacturing projects across America.
Constructive is actively fielding invitations to help stand up national clean energy deployment platforms across the UK, the EU, and Australia and to accelerate regional deployment of geothermal technologies in the U.S.","Governments around the world are working to enhance energy security by reducing energy imports and relying more on homegrown fuels, as recently laid out in the Carlyle Group’s New Joule Order. To do this, governments must focus relentlessly on reducing the costs of energy by using existing public tools alongside private capital to scale clean energy infrastructure quickly—the fastest, surest path to affordable power.

Five lessons every government can apply today:

1. Put Affordability First

Low, predictable energy bills must be the north star for any national energy strategy.

Several climate solutions are already reducing costs for consumers and delivering local energy security at a modest scale. Governments should focus on scaling these tools nationwide. This could mean focusing on the cultural change needed to drive up adoption of solutions like virtual power plants (VPPs) and grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) to get more out of existing grids. Or providing financing for energy efficiency upgrades.

Commercializing next‑gen clean tech is crucial for long‑term decarbonization and industrial competitiveness, but it’s a complementary mission to keeping today’s energy bills low. Give next-gen commercialization its own budgets, timelines, and metrics, while a national clean energy strategy zeroes in on delivering abundant, affordable, and secure power—clear lines that prevent public confusion and ensure the right tools tackle the right problem.

2. Define the Goal—Not the Tech

Governments must resist the urge to play favorites. Set a science‑based goal—cheap, reliable power with the lowest emissions—and let the most cost‑effective solution win, whether that’s nuclear, geothermal, or carbon capture on a fossil plant.

At the US DOE, our mantra was “private-sector led, government-enabled.” This kept us focused on using public tools to unlock private sector enthusiasm. We set the goalpost but allowed the private sector to tell us where they were prepared to see a solution through to the finish line.

3. Proactively Support Entrepreneurs and Innovators

Announcing public funding alone isn’t enough. Many CEOs and entrepreneurs are not naturally inclined to partner with governments. Beyond just providing monetary support, governments must do active private sector engagement and listen to companies on how to make their lives easier by fixing red tape (e.g., permits, paperwork, compliance) to slash transaction and construction costs. Otherwise, only well-resourced players will be the main users of public programs, while the next wave of clean energy innovators may be left out.

In my first six months at the Loan Programs Office (LPO), I called over 100 CEOs to see if they would take a second look at the LPO. We built an outreach team, split our application into an easy-to-fill-out quick screen first step and a more exhaustive second round, and published plain‑language guides to make it easier for clients to use the program.

This aggressive outreach strategy paid off. Within a year, applications jumped from one every three months to two a week. And we refocused our proactive outreach into areas of national interest—such as transmission, nuclear, virtual power plants, and critical minerals processing. In the end, we attracted over $400B in high-quality applications for the Loan Programs Office. This is replicable on every continent.

4. Rebalance Risk and Returns with Investors

Governments need to crowd in private sector capital to drive energy expansion long-term. This requires a dedicated effort to win over investors.

Large infrastructure investors have raised money from their limited partners for low-risk, low-return models. This works for mature tech (like solar) but prevents them from investing in other sectors that might feature more development risk, merchant risk, or operational risk (like clean steel, critical minerals, and enhanced geothermal).

Governments should engage with and educate private investors on new-to-them technologies. This may require reforming public financing tools to boost equity returns using government debt. This can be done by increasing the flexibility of public tools without increasing the overall risk taken by taxpayers.

At LPO, we built an Investing with LPO Toolkit to explain how our commercial and technical diligence process was rigorous enough to derisk energy investments, serving as a “golden ticket” for companies and a “stamp of approval” for investors. LPO’s default rate (~3%) was half of what was anticipated, proving that disciplined underwriting works—even in emerging sectors.

5. The Tools Already Exist—Use Them

Many countries already have state financing mechanisms, such as Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Brazil’s Energy Transition Acceleration (Paten) program, India’s Power Finance Corporation, Canada’s Growth Fund, and the UK’s National Wealth Fund. Yet most aren’t being used to their full potential. Governments should proactively use these tools in better coordination and with more risk tolerance to supercharge deployments.

When I joined in 2021, LPO had ~$40B in unused authority that had barely been touched over the last decade. We put LPO to work. Our rigorous outreach combined with relatively low-cost private sector engagement efforts (like the Liftoff reports and Deploy summits) catalyzed industry and investor action. We also questioned every assumption and often were most limited by our own imagination, not the governing laws of the office. When we left office, we had committed $108B for clean energy and manufacturing projects across America. We also had an additional $250B of active loan applications ready to be processed. Most importantly, this was all at almost no net cost to American taxpayers—LPO was generating interest and fee income that exceeded the cost of running the office and our modest losses. An affordability-focused energy strategy doesn’t have to break the public bank.

Putting it into Practice, Constructively

A new nonprofit, Constructive, launched last week to help governments put these lessons into practice. Drawing on years of DOE and industry experience, the Constructive team designs data-rich and collaborative engagement platforms, sustained dialogues, and flagship events to help governments turn energy ambitions into real outcomes. I am excited to be part of Constructive’s founding Board of Directors.

Constructive is actively fielding invitations to help stand up national clean energy deployment platforms across the UK, the EU, and Australia and to accelerate regional deployment of geothermal technologies in the U.S. It will be producing several upcoming events to build momentum for clean energy deployment, including the U.S. national distributed energy conference DERVOS 2025 and ASME Catalyze 2026—a new landmark sustainability conference for the engineering ecosystem. There is tremendous opportunity for public-private collaboration to drive impact.

That’s what made America great, and it’s still great … It’s never not been great, but it’s starting to fade,” he said.
For the past 12 years, he has led the task force that provided the statistical backbone for the National Climate Assessment, the nation’s most comprehensive, authoritative and widely used climate report.
The latest version, the 1,834-page Fifth National Climate Assessment published in 2023, contained both the latest climate data and the most advanced projections about future trends.
That information is in the report, Easterling said.","Climate scientist David Easterling decided it was time to seriously think about retirement from the National Centers for Environmental Information after President Donald Trump took office in January.

There was the immediate withdrawal of the United States from the international Paris Agreement, which was signed by 196 countries in 2015 to limit greenhouse emissions. There were the mass layoffs of federal employees, the moves to increase production of fossil fuels and to cut investment into renewables.

Easterling, the centers’ chief of scientific services – and, peers say, one of the nation’s top climate-change researchers – first set his departure date for November.

He moved it up to April 30 after he was offered a small retirement bonus and learned he was on a list of centers’ staffers eligible for reclassification as political employees.

That would mean he could be fired without cause, which he almost certainly would have been, he said, “because I was leading a group that was looking at climate change.”

Easterling, 69, said he is one of 58 employees who have retired or resigned under similar circumstances from the NCEI – about one third of the workforce at the Asheville headquarters and smaller installations in Maryland, Colorado and Mississippi.

“It’s been a brain drain for them, for sure,” said Ken Kunkel, principal research scholar with the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies at North Carolina State University.

Though important work will continue at the centers – the largest repository of climate information in the world – its once-central role in addressing climate change has been all but eliminated, Easterling said.

It’s part of a bigger picture revealed in actions that have only accelerated since he decided to retire, he said, including the slashing of research at the Environmental Protection Agency, the 40 percent budget cut at the National Institutes of Health, the loss of billions of dollars worth of research grants for colleges and universities.

The Trump administration has touted such reductions as improving government efficiency. And U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-Hendersonville, has said the same about the recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which could further cut research funding. His July 4 statement also praised the law’s tax reductions and deregulation measures. He did not respond to requests for further comment from Asheville Watchdog.

But any benefits of cuts in research will be far outweighed by long-term losses, Easterling said, citing federally backed advancements such as the creation of the internet and the mapping of the human genome that have shaped the modern world and fueled the American economy.

“All these different innovations. That’s what made America great, and it’s still great … It’s never not been great, but it’s starting to fade,” he said. “We’re losing our scientific edge.”

Tracking the “everything issue”

If the dismissive treatment of his colleagues and him is far from the whole story, it’s a significant part of it, Easterling and other climate scientists said.

For the past 12 years, he has led the task force that provided the statistical backbone for the National Climate Assessment, the nation’s most comprehensive, authoritative and widely used climate report.

The assessments were mandated by a 1990 federal law and have been regularly updated since 2000.

The latest version, the 1,834-page Fifth National Climate Assessment published in 2023, contained both the latest climate data and the most advanced projections about future trends. It detailed the consequences of warming and strategies to contain them in a wide range of environmental and economic sectors, in every section of the country.

The document “clearly illustrates how climate change is not only an environmental or a scientific issue, but an everything issue,” Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and one of the assessment’s authors, said at the time of its publication.

A major source of the report’s authority, said Kunkel, the lead scientist on Easterling’s task force, is the consensus it represents.

The report is the “synthesized work of hundreds of authors who have sifted through the evidence,” he said. “Scientists agree that the climate will change if we continue to increase greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. There’s essentially 100 percent certainty on that.”

Easterling’s responsibilities included verifying the soundness of the science used in the last three assessments, Kunkel said.

And as evidence of Easterling’s contributions to this base of knowledge, he is named 110 times in the 5th assessment, including dozens of citations for research published independently of his work on the report.

To explain the usefulness of the document, he cited the example of farmers who want to know if they need to expand irrigation systems to address the impact of extended droughts. That information is in the report, Easterling said.

Should landowners in the North Carolina mountains invest in growing heat-sensitive Fraser firs as Christmas trees? The assessment can give them the answer.

It could be employed by city leaders in Atlanta to know if they need to build more emergency cooling centers for extreme heatwaves, he said.

And it has been used by the city of Charleston, South Carolina, to guide investment of tens of millions of dollars to upgrade its ancient storm sewer system to handle sea levels that have already risen by about a foot over historic levels.

“That’s just a great example of what climate change is going to end up costing,” Easterling said.

His team also played a big part in spreading the assessment’s message, creating graphics and translating scientific language into lay terms to make the report as accessible as possible.

That access has been undermined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which runs the NCEI and did not respond to repeated requests from Asheville Watchdog for comment or to address the number of departures that Easterling documented. This mirrors a figure previously reported by the Asheville Citizen-Times.

The 2023 assessment and all earlier versions have been removed from NOAA’s website and work on the next update, due to be completed in 2028, has come to a standstill. The agency has also told hundreds of scientists volunteering their time to create this report that their services are no longer needed.

Among other examples of declining access to information – the agency recently announced it has stopped updating the webpage showing the increased frequency of “billion dollar disasters,” events that have created at least that inflation-adjusted amount of damage.

This trend reflects the growing severity of storms and the growing value of development in disaster-prone areas, Easterling said, and the NCEI scientist responsible for this webpage is among those who have recently departed.

Easterling is more concerned about what such cutbacks mean for science than his own life.

He is continuing to research and write scientific papers, he said. He will probably do some consulting. He has volunteered his services – and the extensive knowledge he has developed researching extreme precipitation – to one NOAA effort that is still moving forward, updating a massive rainfall database.

His retirement has also allowed him to spend more time with his wife, Kimberly, their two adult daughters and their four grandchildren, he said during an interview last week, overlooking dense forest from the back porch of his Henderson County home.

But he would have liked to have stuck to his original plan, which was to keep working for maybe two more years, until he was sure the next assessment was well on its way to completion.

“I liked what I was doing,” he said. “I felt like I was doing some good for society and wanted to keep going.”

The growing connection between LNG exports and electricity markets in the U.S. is happening because of two long-term trends.
EIA is not alone in its concern about the impact of rising LNG exports.
Moody’s, one of the major credit rating agencies, has repeatedly said that U.S. LNG exports will lead to higher domestic gas prices.
This is a particular concern given the significant increase in U.S. LNG exports projected by 2029.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook provides insights into how it expects domestic energy prices and fuel consumption to play out over the next 12-to-24 months. A key topic for EIA this year has been the threat that liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports will raise the cost of electricity and home heating for U.S. consumers, with the data agency warning every month about the impact of LNG exports.

The growing connection between LNG exports and electricity markets in the U.S. is happening because of two long-term trends.

First is the dominant role of gas in electricity generation. Twenty years ago, in 2004, just 16.5% of U.S. electricity was generated using gas, far behind coal (51.4%) or nuclear (20.7%). That balance has shifted dramatically in the years since the fracking boom vastly increased supply while generally lowering and stabilizing prices. In 2016, gas surpassed coal as the leading fuel for producing power, and by 2024, 42.4% of the country’s electricity was generated using gas. Coal had slipped to just 15.6%, behind both nuclear (18.8%), and wind and utility-scale solar (16.2%).

Second, the surge in U.S. gas production also enabled a new option: exporting LNG in specialized cargo ships to global markets. Huge new export facilities have been built, mostly along the Gulf Coast, and more export projects are under construction or in planning. In 2014, LNG exports were a tiny 0.06% of U.S. dry gas production, amounting to just 44.5 million cubic feet per day. By 2024, that had soared to 11.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d), or 11.6% of production, and it is expected to keep rising as additional LNG export facilities come online over the next several years. In March and April, for the first time, the amount of gas going to LNG exports totaled more than 50% of the amount of gas being used to produce electricity in the U.S.

EIA now says, “Higher natural gas prices in 2025 and 2026 are the result of strong export growth that persistently outpaces U.S. natural gas production.” In other words, the high demand for gas exports is also pushing up the price of the gas that supplies 40% of U.S. electricity—a cost that will be passed on to consumers.

Consumers will not just be paying for that higher-priced gas generation, either. Because gas generation is such a large component of the overall electricity market, it now sets the marginal price for all generation in many markets across the U.S., particularly during peak demand periods. This means the rise in gas exports is contributing to higher electricity prices across the board—the costs of which will be passed through to consumers.

EIA is not alone in its concern about the impact of rising LNG exports. Moody’s, one of the major credit rating agencies, has repeatedly said that U.S. LNG exports will lead to higher domestic gas prices.

EIA’s concerns are also not hypothetical. The experience following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which sparked a massive global increase in gas prices that hit consumers hard, still reverberates across the U.S. utility sector.

In Virginia, for example, Dominion went through a years-long process at the state corporation commission (SCC) to get approval to collect $1.28 billion in fuel costs amassed from July 2020 to June 2023.

As Dominion executives explained during the regulatory proceedings, the uncertainty following the invasion and the effort by European countries to replace Russian gas supplies “caused liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices in Europe and Asia to increase, leading to increased LNG exports by domestic suppliers.” U.S. exports climbed as high as 18% of total domestic gas production in March 2023, Dominion said, driven by producers seeking “considerably higher prices from overseas (primarily LNG) markets.”

Ultimately, the state approved a plan to securitize the uncollected fuel costs. This plan, adopted in February 2024, allowed Dominion to sell bonds to be repaid via a non-bypassable charge on ratepayers and collected over a 7.25-year period. Given the potential for future international price spikes, Virginia ratepayers may still be paying for the last LNG-driven cost runup when the next one occurs.

Dominion’s experience is not unique. Utilities and regulators in Ohio, Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi, Wyoming, Colorado, and Indiana have gone on record blaming LNG exports for higher energy bills.

Previous IEEFA research (hereand here) also has shown that rising LNG exports leads to greater gas price volatility in the U.S. We believe this rising volatility poses unwarranted risks to consumers and that utilities and regulators must more thoroughly analyze these issues when considering plans for new gas-fired power plants.

This is a particular concern given the significant increase in U.S. LNG exports projected by 2029. IEEFA data shows that current operating LNG export capacity is 15.43 bcf/d. This total rises to 16.49 bcf/d when the gas used in the liquefaction process is included. By 2029 an additional 12.97 bcf/d of export capacity could be online (14.01 bcf/d when the gas used during liquefaction is included). This would be an 84% increase in export capacity in just four years, further exposing domestic consumers to global price volatility.

These new projects will certainly expand U.S. exposure to international events and potential price spikes. And the new export demand, coupled with rising domestic gas consumption driven largely by rising electricity demand for new AI-related infrastructure, is likely to put upward pressure on U.S. gas prices. The upshot for U.S. consumers is that the risks of both greater price volatility and higher prices in general are rising.

As TradingNews summarized recently: “Gas exports have reshaped domestic pricing. U.S. production, once trapped by local constraints, is now fully exposed to global arbitrage. LNG terminals draw down Gulf Coast gas, pressuring the balance for Midwest and Northeast utilities.”

Utilities should be factoring these risks into their proposals for new gas-fired power plants since they could have a major impact on project economics, particularly in comparison to fuel-free renewable alternatives. If those comparisons are not made, regulators would be well-advised to require them, or they risk approving new generation projects that could impose significantly higher costs on ratepayers.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-08/electricitygenerationfromgas.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 12:14:59.945213

“Domestic partnerships are critical to meeting rising demand, and by leveraging U.S. manufacturing, Avangrid has an opportunity to support local jobs and economic opportunity in states like Texas, while advancing a reliable energy future powered by American-made products,” said Avangrid CEO Jose Antonio Miranda. “Our work with SEG Solar demonstrates not only our commitment to building out the domestic supply chain, but the benefits of investing in American energy infrastructure.”

Avangrid is the first utility-scale customer to tap SEG Solar’s new U.S. plant, marking a key milestone in both companies’ efforts to fortify the domestic clean-energy supply chain and boost U.S. manufacturing.

The 250,000-square-foot Houston facility, which opened last summer, represents a $60-million investment and already more than 300 workers have been hired to work there, with plans to expand to more than 500 jobs at full capacity, according to Avangrid.

The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, based in Richland, Washington and Portland, Oregon, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, would see their funding in the year ahead nearly halved under the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 budget for the U.S. Department of Energy. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate are negotiating spending bills for the next fiscal year that begins in October and will decide on the energy agency’s budget after Sept. 2, when they return from their August recess.

The national labs are meant to lead research and scientific experimentation in climate and clean energy strategies, including measuring extreme weather risks by collecting and analyzing atmospheric data from around the world and improving battery and grid technologies to get more wind and solar energy flowing to homes and businesses. They also study energy efficiency across U.S. infrastructure and commerce, all of which is meant to save Americans and businesses money and to curb climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Andrea McMakin, a former communications specialist and 34-year veteran of the Northwest Laboratory in Richland, said the U.S. risks losing its best scientists if the proposed funding cuts go through.

McMakin is part of the group Friends of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which has been raising concerns about the cuts. McMakin said the group learned in June that the lab’s former director told staff in a meeting that up to 1,000 people could be cut if the current budget passes, a number that’s been echoed by state leaders.

“Those people leave. They have to find jobs someplace. And we’re seeing that a lot of other countries are stepping up their recruiting to get U.S. scientists and engineers,” McMakin said. “We don’t want to see that. We want to keep our energy competitiveness and we want to keep our brain power here in the U.S.”

A recent report from Politico cites two sources familiar with U.S. Department of Energy facilities who said up to 1,000 people could be cut from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado.

Heather Lammers, a spokesperson for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said in an email that the lab is talking with the federal energy department to fully understand the impacts of its proposed spending cuts.

The Northwest Laboratory’s public affairs officer, Dawn Zimmerman, did not confirm figures for potential staff cuts and said the U.S. Department of Energy requires all queries involving the federal budget to be directed to its public affairs office. An unnamed energy department spokesperson said in an email that personnel decisions are dictated by the labs directly, not the federal government.

“The Department of Energy is committed to making the American people’s government more efficient while also growing the output of top-quality science at our national labs,” the spokesperson wrote.

Proposed cuts

Trump proposed in May cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. energy department by about $3.5 billion. Of that, $2.5 billion would be cut from the agency’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy — a 74% reduction from its current budget.

The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office, established following the 1973 oil crisis, in recent years has focused on researching, developing and deploying technologies meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the country’s electricity sector. That technology includes batteries that can hold large amounts of wind and solar power, and white LED light bulbs that require far less energy than incandescent and fluorescent lights.

The budget also cuts 14%, or $1.15 billion, from the department’s Biological and Environmental Research program, meant to collect and analyze climate change data.

Both the Colorado lab and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory get most of their funding from those two programs. But under Trump’s proposed 2026 budget, the Renewable Energy Lab would lose $387 million in funding – more than half of its current budget.

Lammers, the spokesperson for the National Renewable Energy Lab, said it also receives funding from state and tribal governments and some private industry partners.

“We remain committed to our mission of delivering integrated solutions for an affordable, secure and reliable energy future through research, innovation and strategic collaboration,” she said.

The Northwest National Lab would lose about $280 million, a third of its current budget.

The lab, which employs more than 5,000 people, is the largest employer in Washington’s Tri-Cities area, which includes Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, according to the area’s development council.

State lawmakers weigh in

Washington’s U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, said the Republican budget for the energy department would be a “devastating blow” to the Northwest National Lab.

“Make no mistake: if Trump’s budget request were to become law, it would result in the loss of over 1,000 jobs at PNNL. On top of that, this administration is defying the law right now by redirecting millions of dollars away from wind and solar research and development happening at our national labs — this move alone could force major layoffs at PNNL,” she said in a statement.

Murray, the lead Democrat and vice chair on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she would fight the proposed cuts.

“President Trump’s budget is dead on arrival in the Senate as far as I’m concerned,” she said. “I’m working to write a bipartisan funding bill that will protect investments in our national labs and save the jobs President Trump is thoughtlessly seeking to eliminate.”

Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, also a Democrat, said in an email the Republican budget is “anti-science” and will harm clean energy industries gaining traction and growing in parts of the state.

“I just had five town halls in eastern Oregon where wind turbines and solar panels are taking full advantage of renewable energy options that lower prices for consumers and fight the climate crisis,” Wyden said. “That’s but one clear example of how this latest Republican scheme to slash research investments in clean energy would be both nonsense and anti-science.”

Wyden said he voted against confirming oil executive Audrey Robertson as Trump’s appointee for assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy at the federal energy agency, in large part because Trump said he wanted to cut renewable energy investments.

Trump threatened nearly identical cuts for the energy department during his first presidency in 2017, but Congress ultimately ignored the president’s suggested budget for the agency. McMakin said she remembers staff of the Northwest National Lab starting to change the way they talked about their work so they wouldn’t draw Trump’s attention.

“I remember at that time it was like, we have to change. We can’t say ‘atmospheric climate science’ anymore, we have to say ‘earth sciences,’ because it was just one of those language things that if you said climate science or anything about climate you are in danger of getting your funding cut,” she said.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/48490542231_45af12abd8_o-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 12:17:08.950067

Clean Air Act Permitting Scheme The Clean Air Act (Act) establishes a system of progressively more complete and comprehensive air emissions controls depending on the amount and hazardousness of a facility’s emissions.

Changes to the Policy When the EPA in the first Trump administration considered the “once in, always in” policy, it issued guidance in 2018 and subsequently adopted a rule in 2020 that struck the policy down as a violation of a plain, simple reading of the Clean Air Act.
This was the case even if the facility later voluntarily adopted innovative technology or production limits to get below the major source threshold.","EPA’s controversial “Once in, always in, Rule” (Once in Rule) was recently rescinded under the Congressional Review Act, a statute which gives Congress the authority to overturn agency rules if such action is taken within specified time frames after the rules is adopted. A joint resolution Congressional resolution disapproving the rule, adopted by both the Senate and the House, was signed into law by President Trump on June 20, 2025.

Sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) may once again voluntarily install air control technology or adopt production limits to reclassify as “area sources” and avoid installing more expensive air pollution control technology necessary for “major sources” of HAPs. Moreover, because the rule was disapproved under the CRA, Congressional approval will now be required for a similar rule to be adopted by EPA in the future.

Clean Air Act Permitting Scheme

The Clean Air Act (Act) establishes a system of progressively more complete and comprehensive air emissions controls depending on the amount and hazardousness of a facility’s emissions. The more comprehensive, more expensive controls apply to “major sources” of HAPs, while less complex and less expensive controls apply to “area sources,” which emit less than 10 tons per year of an individual HAP and less than 25 tons per year of all HAPs. 40 CFR 63.1 (a)(1)-(3).

The “Once In, Always In” Policy

The original ""once in, always in"" policy by the EPA mandated that facilities classified as major sources of HAPs would remain under stringent regulations even if their emissions fell below the major source thresholds. The ""once in, always in"" policy was established in 1995 by EPA under Act, stating that once a facility became a major source of HAPs, it would always be classified as such, regardless of any reductions in emissions. This interpretation of the Act was not promulgated as a rule, but rather was seen by EPA as a policy required by the terms of the Act.

Changes to the Policy

When the EPA in the first Trump administration considered the “once in, always in” policy, it issued guidance in 2018 and subsequently adopted a rule in 2020 that struck the policy down as a violation of a plain, simple reading of the Clean Air Act. “Today’s memo finds that EPA had no statutory authority under the Clean Air Act to place a time limit on when a facility may be determined to be an area source, and that a plain language reading of the Act must allow facilities to be reclassified as area sources once their potential to emit hazardous air pollutants falls below the levels that define major sources.” See here. Therefore, under the first Trump administration EPA, major sources were able to voluntarily reduce compliance burdens by reclassifying as area sources through the addition of air emission control technology or restrictions on production rates such that air emissions remain below major source thresholds.

The Once in Policy Reinstituted as a Rule

Not surprisingly, the Biden EPA reversed course and the “once in, always in” concept was promulgated as regulation, undoing the effect of the prior 2020 rulemaking. The Once in Rule was finalized in the waning days of the Biden Administration to stop industries from reducing emissions to avoid the enhanced technology required of major sources. 89 Fed. Reg. 73293 (Sept. 10, 2024). “This action amends the General Provisions of 40 CFR part 63 to require sources subject to certain major source NESHAP subparts to remain subject to those NESHAP regardless of whether they reclassify to area source status.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 73298. This was the case even if the facility later voluntarily adopted innovative technology or production limits to get below the major source threshold. Id.

The Once in Rule was not unlimited, however. It only applied to sources subject to MACT standards for seven specific persistent and bio-accumulative pollutants. The seven pollutants in question are: Alkylated lead compounds, Polycyclic organic matter (POM), Mercury, Hexachlorobenzene, Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofurans (TCDF), and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.

Review of the Once in Rule

Under Section 801(d) of the CRA, any regulation submitted to Congress either less than 60 days of session in the Senate or less than 60 legislative days in the House of Representatives before Congress adjourns a session of Congress sine die, begins a new period for congressional review of that rule becomes available in the next session of Congress. That is the case with the Once in Rule, since it passed so late in the Biden Administration. The Senate resolution disapproving the rule passed on May 1, 2025, the House resolution was adopted on May 22, 2025, and the resolution was signed by the President on June 20, 2025.

Conclusion: Next Steps

Due to this Congressional action the 2020 regulation adopted under the first Trump administration remains in effect and industry will be free to explore innovative ways to extricate itself from the more complex air technology requirements of the MACT regulations. In addition, as noted above, any rule reinstating the “once in, always in” concept would first have to be authorized by Congress. This means the days of the policy as a regulatory football are likely at an end.",https://www.williamsmullen.com/themes/custom/williams_mullen/images/williams-mullen-finding-yes-logo.png,N,,2025-08-04 15:03:29.216278

Unless you’ve been living under a rock – a valid lifestyle choice these days – you’ve been hearing a lot about tariffs. Last April, the Trump administration launched a trade war against pretty much everyone. This included a baseline ten-percent tariff on most U.S. imports, plus country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs that were allegedly based on the misguided notion that all trade deficits should be eliminated.

The Trump administration argues that these aggressive import tariffs will reinvigorate American manufacturing, fill Treasury coffers, and create bargaining leverage with trading partners. The substantial costs—higher consumer prices, damaged relationships with allies, and policy uncertainty that makes capital budgeting feel like tariff roulette—have been downplayed.

While it’s too soon to assess the lasting impacts of these latest tariffs, we’re not flying blind. The U.S. has some recent experience with protectionist import tariffs, particularly in the solar energy sector. This new working paper by Todd Gerarden and co-authors uses rich data from the global solar PV market to investigate how U.S. tariffs on solar cells and modules have played out.

How the US solar PV sector became a tariff test bed

Before diving into the paper, a quick review of U.S. tariffs on solar cells and panels will help set the stage:

In 2011, U.S. solar panel manufacturers filed a petition arguing that Chinese PV cells and modules were being subsidized and dumped into the US market.

In 2012, the Obama administration put anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese solar cells and modules. Chinese firms responded (predictably) by finding work-arounds (more on these below).

In 2018, the Trump administration implemented a more sweeping “safeguard” tariff on all global PV imports. These tariffs are still in place today, albeit with some modifications.

The chart below (shared by the authors) summarizes how these PV tariff rates have been increasing since 2010.

—

Post-2020, tariffs have climbed off this chart. Several major Southeast Asian suppliers now face triple-digit duties on PV cells and panels when trying to sell into the US market. In the paper, the authors use rich data on firm-level solar PV manufacturing around the world to study the effects of these trade barriers and restrictions over 2010-2020.

To disentangle the role of these import tariffs from the many other factors that have shaped supply and demand in the domestic solar PV sector, the authors take a variety of approaches to estimating what the market would have looked like absent protectionist trade policy. The details can be found in the paper. I want to focus on four key findings.

—

1. Chinese producers avoided tariffs by relocating production (not to the U.S.)

When Chinese manufacturers were confronted with the 2012 U.S. anti-dumping duties and tariffs, they did not pack up and move to the United States to avoid paying the tariffs. Instead, they shifted manufacturing operations to affiliate plants in Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia where manufacturing costs are significantly cheaper than the U.S..

In 2018, US tariffs were applied to *all* imported PV modules, regardless of origin. In this billion-dollar game of whack-a-mole, Asian producers pivoted to shipping just the solar cell components into the US under a duty-free quota and then assembling modules in the U.S. The graph below shows how these geographically diversified operations now account for the vast majority of PV-cell imports into the U.S.

—

2. Import tariffs increased U.S. PV panel prices

The authors use prices across ten regional markets to estimate the impacts of US import tariffs on US panel prices. Following the 2014 tariffs, prices in the U.S. increased by roughly 10 percent relative to prices in other markets. Following the 2018 tariffs, US prices increased by approximately 20 percent relative to other markets. These estimates imply pass-through rates on the order of 60 percent.

—

3. Consumer-side pain exceeded U.S. gains

These authors are particularly interested in the net impacts of these tariffs on the US economy. They build an equilibrium model of supply and demand in the US PV industry and use it to simulate outcomes – including the strategic location and quantity responses by solar panel manufacturers – with and without the US import tariffs.

The table below summarizes the estimated impacts of the tariffs on producers, consumers, and government revenues. The categories in the table are defined by the firm’s headquarters (not by where production occurs). As a result, a substantial portion of the “US” producer surplus in the table reflects surplus generated by US-headquartered firms with offshore manufacturing activities. US-headquartered firms were exempt from tariffs, despite having foreign manufacturing locations.

—

Overall, US consumer costs (estimated at $5.5 billion due to higher solar PV prices) significantly exceed domestic producer benefits plus tariff revenues. This cost-benefit calculus looks even worse when the authors account for the environmental costs associated with slower renewable energy deployment.

The authors also consider a “without relocation” scenario where solar PV manufacturers are somehow locked into their pre-2014 production location footprint. They find that Chinese manufacturers’ ability to dodge tariffs by moving production actually made these tariff policies less harmful overall. The extra tariff revenue and additional benefits to U.S. manufacturers are completely swamped by the increase in consumer losses and increased environmental damages.

—

4. Jobs and factories did not “come roaring back”

Comprehensive modeling of domestic employment impacts is well beyond the scope of this paper (this would require figuring out how workers across the entire economy were impacted by the tariffs). The authors take a first crack at estimating employment impacts within the solar PV sector by multiplying their estimates of changes in domestic manufacturing and solar PV system demand by the average labor intensity of each activity, respectively. Using this simple accounting approach, the negative impact on PV installation jobs is much larger than the positive impact on PV manufacturing jobs. Intuitively, the demand for manufacturing jobs depends on the number of solar panels that are produced domestically, but installation jobs depend on the total number of solar panels installed domestically.

—

The new stakes of U.S. trade tariffs

This solar PV case study offers valuable lessons about the unintended (but predictable) costs of import tariffs. There are, of course, some important differences between import tariffs of the past and what we are looking at right now. This latest tariff blitz is more than targeted trade protection. It’s a global shakedown designed to extract maximum surplus from our trading partners. This strategy will force some concessions —e.g. promises to purchase American jets and LNG. Time will tell whether these promises deliver value enough to offset the significant tariff costs. Meanwhile, coercing allies into hasty deals risks damaging relationships that provide value beyond any single trade agreement.

When it comes to clean energy, we are not only gearing up to repeat past trade policy mistakes on a larger scale, we’re also dialing back policies that were designed to give American manufacturers a fighting chance. The IRA subsidies weren’t perfect, but Gerarden and co-authors find that they would have significantly outperformed import tariffs in terms of job creation, domestic manufacturing, and overall economic welfare. Rage-quitting clean energy won’t stop the clean energy transition – it will just ensure that it moves ahead without us.

This innovative solution is designed to handle the extreme challenges of measuring flare gas streams with carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentrations of 90% and higher.

This installation marks a significant step forward in addressing one of the most complex challenges in emissions monitoring. Ultrasonic measurement offers huge advantages in measuring fast-flowing and changing gases due to the widest turndown ratio and the independence of accuracy from knowing the exact gas composition. However, when CO2 is present in concentrations higher than 30%, it presents a very specific challenge, and other ultrasonic measurement systems fail rapidly. Fluenta’s Bias-90 FlarePhase configuration offers a new approach to tackling these challenges.

The Bias-90 Configuration: Expanding FlarePhase Performance. Fluenta’s FlarePhase technology utilizes advanced signal processing to deliver industry-leading measurement accuracy, even in difficult operating conditions. The Bias-90 FlarePhase configuration enhances this performance by angling the transducer heads at 90 degrees and placing them a fixed distance apart. This design minimizes the attenuating effects of CO₂’s molecular density and structure, ensuring that signals remain strong and measurable in gas streams with extreme CO₂ levels.

Rigorous testing at the Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnológicas (IPT) in Brazil validated the Fluenta FlarePhase system capabilities, proving its accuracy and resilience under real-world conditions with high CO₂ concentrations. Now, for the first time, Fluenta have also proven this approach in a Bias-90 FlarePhase configuration. This innovation allows operators to achieve reliable, compliant emissions monitoring where traditional ultrasonic systems cannot.

“This first installation of the Bias-90 configuration at Pelican is a game-changer,” said Julian Dudley-Smith, Managing Director at Fluenta. “It demonstrates the versatility and innovation of the FlarePhase technology in solving complex measurement challenges. The Bias-90 FlarePhase setup enables accurate data collection under conditions that were previously considered too extreme for ultrasonic measurement systems.”

The Pelican Installation: A Milestone for High-CO₂ Measurement. The installation provides several critical benefits to the Pelican Amine Treating Plant:

Regulatory Compliance: The Bias-90 system ensures precise measurement of CO₂ emissions, enabling the plant to meet stringent EPA and state-level reporting requirements.

Enhanced Process Efficiency: Accurate flare gas data supports better operational decisions, reducing waste and optimizing performance.

Reliable Performance: The system’s resilience to extreme CO₂ levels ensures consistent operation, even in challenging conditions.

Driving Innovation for High-CO₂ Applications. Fluenta’s mission is to empower the energy and heavy industries with accurate, reliable measurement solutions that enable regulatory compliance and sustainability. The Bias-90 FlarePhase configuration exemplifies this commitment, addressing a critical need for operators working in high-CO₂ environments.

“This installation is more than just a milestone for Fluenta – it’s a step forward for the entire industry,” said Dudley-Smith, “The Pelican project showcases how cutting-edge technology can transform operational practices, helping operators achieve both compliance and efficiency in some of the toughest conditions.”

Now along comes geothermal energy to throw a honking big monkey wrench into the works, competing against both nuclear and conventional fuel for a generous slice of the baseload power generation market.

The Geothermal Energy Advantage

If you’re wondering why a renewable resource like geothermal energy is poised to compete for baseload power within the constraints of today’s federal energy policy, that’s a good question. If you know the answer, drop a note in the comment thread. Nevertheless, the American Energy Dominance plan excludes wind and solar from federal support, but it does embrace geothermal energy.

The magic word is baseload. Geothermal energy can compete directly against coal and gas for baseload power generation, delivering a reliable stream of electricity on a 24/7 basis regardless of the weather.

For that matter, the American Energy Dominance plan also embraces two other renewable resources, biomass and hydropower, under the baseload umbrella. However, on closer inspection neither of those options offers a broad opportunity to knock coal and gas power plants out of the box. Sites for new biomass plants are limited by supply and storage challenges, and hydropower depends on suitable geographic and water resource elements.

Site selection has also dogged the geothermal energy industry. Under a conventional technology scenario, geothermal power plants are economical only where nature provides an optimal combination of heat, water, and rock. In the US, that means a handful of sites scattered around several Western states.

Now the script has flipped. Geothermal stakeholders are deploying techniques borrowed from oil and gas drillers to create their own enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and deep-rock, advanced closed-loop systems (ACLs). These new innovators also have the advantage of advanced underground mapping tools in their pocket. In the tri-state Great Basin region alone, for example, US Geological Survey researchers recently assessed that 135 gigawatts of potential geothermal resources are potentially recoverable with next-generation geothermal technology (see more geothermal background here).

For the here and now, the Department of Energy has estimated that 90 gigawatts of geothermal-sourced electricity could be tapped across multiple states by 2050 with next-generation technology. That estimate includes states east of the Mississippi River, far afield from the nation’s current fleet of geothermal power plants.

US Geothermal Energy Policy In Action

Issuing a new policy by Executive Order from the White House is one thing. Getting Congress and federal agencies to follow through is another kettle of fish. Initial versions of the new tax bill, for example, indicate that leadership in Congress did not get the hydropower memo. Under the new law, the industry would have faced new restrictions and tight deadlines virtually impossible to meet. Industry stakeholders mounted a vigorous campaign to restore their status as a preferred baseload resource under the American Energy Dominance plan in the final version of the tax bill (the “OBBA”). For the most part they were satisfied with the final result.

Geothermal energy stakeholders also had a nail-biting moment or two as the bill wound its way through Congress in June. When the dust settled, the industry escaped the dreaded tax credit clawback, though the tariff situation could raise the expense of systems equipment.

White House tariff policy aside, multiple federal agencies have also continued to support expansion of the US geothermal industry:

The US Geological Survey released the results of the Great Basin assessment in May.

Also in May, the Department of the Interior announced fast-track status for geothermal projects on federal lands.

On June 26 the National Renewable Energy Laboratory updated its geothermal resources pages, including a batch of information and resources covering market acceleration.

The US Department of Defense continues to host a suite of geothermal power plant demonstration projects at its facilities.

Next Generation Geothermal Systems: Follow The Money

As indicated by the state of DOD’s involvement, next-generation geothermal systems are still largely in the demonstration phase. However, McKinsey is among the market analysts anticipating that a mass market breakthrough is in view.

“Our analysis suggests that declining costs, the ability to scale quickly, and established supply chains and workforce may be aligning with increasing energy demand to establish geothermal as an important piece of the United States energy mix,” the firm posted on July 17.

“Our analysis suggests next-generation geothermal energy could supply up to 100 gigawatts of power in the United States by 2050, with approximately 40 gigawatts by 2035,” McKinsey added, which loosely aligns with the Energy Department’s analysis.

That’s a sharp contrast with the existing state of affairs. As described by McKinsey, the US currently has less than 3 gigawatts of geothermal power plants in operation. That could expand under a conventional technology scenario, but it will hit a ceiling of less than 40 gigawatts due to the limited availability of suitable natural conditions.

Citing a 2024 US Department of Energy report, McKinsey puts the next-generation geothermal potential at 5,500 gigawatts nationwide, including ESG and ACL systems. That helps explain why investors have put up $900 million in private capital in support of next-generation projects, according to McKinsey’s calculations. “Anticipated cost decreases and the urgent need for additional power supply may draw even more attention to the sector in coming years,” the firm concludes.

Faster, Cheaper, Better

One key difference between today’s geothermal technology and that of yore is drilling speed. Faster drilling saves time, a crucial point for an energy-sucking nation on the prowl for more electricity. The revved-up timetable also frees up equipment and workforce to move on to the next project.

The ability to upgrade existing geothermal energy resources can also help speed things along. A case in point is the Utah-based company Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals. Zanskar is among those selected to demonstrate new technology for the Defense Department.

To put its system to the test, Zanskar acquired the existing Lightning Dock geothermal power plant in Hidalgo County, New Mexico, in May of 2024. The facility sits on a geothermal anomaly identified in 1974, making it the easternmost geothermal power plant in the US. Before the plant was built, hot water from the field was used to heat greenhouses and aquaculture operations. The electricity generation didn’t follow until 2013, when Cyrq Energy brought a 4-megawatt power plant online with plans for expansion to 10 megawatts.

In May of this year, just 12 months after the acquisition, Zanskar described its Lightning Dock project as “the most productive pumped geothermal well in the U.S. and quite possibly the world.”

“With just one well, we’re now powering the entire 15 MW plant and setting a new bar for conventional geothermal in the U.S.,” Zanskar reported in May this year, citing 35% faster drilling than the fastest drill ever used on the same geothermal field, a 75% reduction in surface infrastructure costs, triple the net output, and record-breaking flow rates and heat content compared to other geothermal power plants in the US.

It represents a departure from a wave of enthusiasm around progressive climate policies that Newsom was stoking as recently as a month before the presidential election.
Fast forward to earlier this month, when Newsom announced he was taking action to stabilize in-state oil supplies.
He also spearheaded a lawsuit to hold major oil companies liable for climate change damages and legislation to consider a cap on oil industry profits, while castigating the industry as a corrupt force fleecing Californians.
“I don’t think they believed the industry was in trouble,” Walz said of California officials.","The about-face is emblematic of Democrats’ course correction on cost-of-living issues in the wake of the presidential election — and provides a real-time demonstration of the political risks of pursuing an aggressive transition away from fossil fuels.

“The reality is, if those refineries close and we have increased gas prices, it’s going to be a problem for everybody,” said Andrew Acosta, a veteran California Democratic campaign consultant. “Not just Gavin Newsom, but every Democrat running for office.”

Democrats are grappling with that reality as they attempt to claw back voters from President Donald Trump and Republicans in an acknowledgment that conservative messaging that blue-state officials are out of touch with daily life has stuck. And while recent polling in deep-blue California shows voters still want their leaders to fight climate change, the state is not immune to this dynamic.

It represents a departure from a wave of enthusiasm around progressive climate policies that Newsom was stoking as recently as a month before the presidential election.

“They have been raking in unprecedented profits because they can,” Newsom said in October while signing a bill requiring refiners to store more gas to prevent shortages, a concept the industry warned would backfire. ”They’ve been screwing you for years and years and years.”

But then a fifth of the state’s gasoline refining capacity started drying up. Phillips 66 announced in October that it would close its Southern California refinery by the end of 2025. Valero followed suit in April with the planned closure of its Northern California facility in 2026.

Fast forward to earlier this month, when Newsom announced he was taking action to stabilize in-state oil supplies. “It’s not rolling back anything — that’s actually marching forward in a way that is thoughtful and considered,” Newsom told reporters in July, after his administration proposed steering clear of the oil-profits cap the governor had championed as a way to keep refineries open.

Newsom spokespeople pointed to the governor’s comments during a Thursday press conference where he called the approach “completely consistent” with the state’s climate agenda, which has “always been about finding a just transition.”

He also touted a 2023 law that requires oil refiners to provide data about their operations, saying it tipped off the state about Valero’s closure plan.

“We would not have had that benefit of having information in advance, which has given us a year to begin the process of figuring out what to do,” Newsom said.

But oil companies’ unexpectedly hasty retreat from the Golden State is forcing officials to reckon with their awkward transition away from gas that until now has largely been theoretical. And it has created a real threat for Democrats if they fail to respond adequately heading into the 2026 midterms after cost-conscious voters resoundingly returned Trump to office last year.

Even some environmentalists are having second thoughts.

“I think Democrats sort of failed to read the room, perhaps in a way that, unfortunately, Trump did,” said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California director for the Environmental Defense Fund. “If we’re not acknowledging people’s day-to-day reality and the challenges they face, it’s really hard for them to care about the existential threat that is climate change.”

Newsom took over from former Gov. Jerry Brown in 2019 and quickly went even further than his predecessor by not only pushing for policies that reduce demand for gas — like electric vehicle incentives — but also by attempting to reduce supply. He announced a ban on fracking in 2021 and signed a law that restricts oil drilling near sensitive sites like schools and hospitals. He also spearheaded a lawsuit to hold major oil companies liable for climate change damages and legislation to consider a cap on oil industry profits, while castigating the industry as a corrupt force fleecing Californians.

“[Brown’s] view was that we really need to change the demand and that the supply issues are less relevant,” said Ken Alex, who was a climate adviser to Brown and is now the director of Project Climate at the University of California, Berkeley. “Governors are always worried about gas prices because they’re so visible to voters, so, of course, you have to consider where you want to pick your battles.”

Now the oil industry has Newsom over a barrel. Two days after he signed a law last year authorizing state officials to require refiners to store more gas and share resupply and maintenance plans with the state, Phillips 66 announced it would close its Los Angeles-area refinery. Six months later, Valero did the same with its Bay Area refinery.

Republicans pounced, and Newsom began his pivot. “I can assure you, beginning last night, we had all hands, and we’re in the process of addressing any anxiety that may be created or any market disruption that may be created by that announcement,” he said in April.

Andy Walz, Chevron’s president of downstream, midstream and chemicals, said California officials have made the state “uninvestable” for companies like his and that it had been only a matter of time before a refiner pulled the plug.

“I don’t think they believed the industry was in trouble,” Walz said of California officials. “I think they misread what was really going on, and it took some real action by some competitors to get them woken up.”

Walz intends to continue pressing his advantage. He called Newsom’s proposal to increase in-state oil drilling “a recognition that there’s a problem,” but is pushing to unwind key pieces of the state’s climate agenda, like its cap-and-trade program and rules aimed at reducing emissions from oil tankers and other ships that dock in the state’s ports.

“The transition is slower than a lot of people thought,” he said. “We need to see some action; they’ve got a chance to do some good things.”

While the move away from fossil fuels poses challenges to all policymakers pursuing aggressive decarbonization goals, California faces a unique set of circumstances that complicate its transition. Throughout its history, the state has operated as a fuel island isolated from the rest of the country and it doesn’t have the infrastructure necessary to pipe in refined gasoline from its neighbors. That means the state can’t quickly respond to gas shortages when refineries go offline, leading to price spikes like in 2022 and 2023, when average prices soared past $5 per gallon.

Colin Murphy, deputy director of the University of California, Davis’ Policy Institute for Energy, Environment and the Economy, said that isolation has given the handful of oil companies that operate refineries in the state outsize power to control the market. But he also argued that California lawmakers underestimated the industry’s willingness to wield that power.

“The core lesson from this story is this is what happens when you let an industry gain market power and put itself in a position where there just aren’t any alternatives,” Murphy said.

California leaders are still positioning the state as the front line of defense against the Trump administration’s assault on clean energy and environmental programs at a national level. It is taking the lead on a slew of lawsuits to loosen the president’s stranglehold on federal grants for electric vehicle chargers and environmental justice groups, and defending its authority to set stricter-than-federal vehicle emissions standards that Trump revoked last month.

That’s all well and good, but an intense focus by voters on affordability has underpinned policy debates in Sacramento this year, leaving some allies in the environmental community feeling burned, as they’ve watched their hard-fought momentum slip.

Newsom’s office began circulating a draft bill last month that would ease permitting for more in-state drilling in oil-rich Kern County, an effort that environmental justice groups have fought for years. The proposal includes measures that are an olive branch to these groups — including a well stimulation ban and a requirement for drillers to plug two wells for every new well they make — but that hasn’t dampened their frustration.

“It seems like a lot of our elected officials are driven above all by a fear that they’ll be blamed for high gas prices,” said Bill Magavern, policy director at Coalition for Clean Air.

Their odds of shifting lawmakers’ focus with six weeks left in the legislative session are steep, as the idea has gained traction even amongst lawmakers known as climate stalwarts.

“Call me born again, but I have seen the light on exactly what you’re talking about,” Sen. Henry Stern told Republican colleagues during an April legislative hearing. “Kern County should be unleashed, and I’m there. … Don’t send that to the White House, please.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F1a%2Ff8%2F593200c742a89dbee339843e4985%2Fcalifornia-oil-wells-11320.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 12:17:13.404710

The only real CRA development of the week was another set of resolutions introduced by a Democratic senator against a Trump Administration rule.","After a steady stream of relatively quiet weeks, the Trump Administration – and, in particular, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) – finished off July 2025 with a bang. While EPA also had a sizeable final rulemaking delaying the compliance dates for a major Biden-era rule, the main item of the week came on the proposed rule side of the ledger. The agency’s proposal to simultaneously rescind the “endangerment finding” underlying essentially all recent climate change rules as well as recent vehicle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards represents the most significant addition to the administration’s deregulatory canon thus far. Across all rulemakings, agencies published $801.4 billion in total cost savings and cut 87,007 paperwork burden hours.

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 23

Final Rules: 41

2025 Total Pages: 36,295

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$77.2 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: -$626 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

As mentioned above, the most consequential action of the week was the EPA proposed rule on “Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards.” The proposal, released last Wednesday and then quickly published in the Federal Register by Friday, seeks “to rescind the Endangerment Finding and all resulting GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines, including the light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicle and engine standards for model years (MY) 2012 to 2027 and beyond.”

The endangerment finding in question is the 2009 document that provides the legal basis for EPA to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. The American Action Forum (AAF) in March reviewed the implications of rescinding the endangerment finding here. Assuming this rule becomes final and survives additional legal scrutiny, the effects of the endangerment finding’s repeal would be broad and profound, albeit difficult to quantify in many respects.

As for the GHG standards portion of this rulemaking, however, EPA was able to conduct a preliminary analysis of economic impacts resulting from those provisions. While the proposal seeks to rescind relevant standards going all the way back to 2010 rulemakings, most of the rules since then have already been implemented. The items this proposed rule focuses on in its analysis are the most recent rounds of these standards for light-and-medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles, respectively, that combined for nearly $900 billion in total “vehicle technology” costs (the expected “rise in the average purchase price for consumers”).

EPA includes a series of alternative cost-benefit estimates in the rule’s Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). For the purposes of RegRodeo measurement, AAF is recording the estimate for Vehicle Technology savings of $800 billion (found in Table A-2 of the RIA). This estimate largely utilizes the same methodology as EPA used for its 2024 rule estimates but also factors in the implications of repealing certain clean energy tax credits under the reconciliation package, as well as the end of California’s state-level emission standards due to the passage of a series of Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions. The one main incongruity between these estimates is the discount rate, with the 2024 rules using a 2-percent rate under the Biden Administration’s short-lived adjustment to regulatory analysis procedures. Nevertheless, the respective estimates are within the same order of magnitude.

Since this rulemaking is still in the proposed rule stage – and likely faces a long and winding road to finalization – these savings will not yet officially count toward the administration’s regulatory budget under Executive Order 14192. Another EPA rule issued last week, however, will provide the agency with a sizeable savings estimate to add to its deregulatory tally. The aptly titled rule on “Extension of Deadlines in Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review Final Rule” delays the full implementation of another 2024 final rule. The agency expects such extensions to yield roughly $1.4 billion in regulatory relief for covered entities.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

With various trade policy developments drawing the bulk of the administration’s attention last week, there was virtually nothing new in terms of broader regulatory policy pronouncements from the White House. The only real CRA development of the week was another set of resolutions introduced by a Democratic senator against a Trump Administration rule. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) added on to the cohort of resolutions he introduced the week prior by filing resolutions on the following Trump Administration actions:

“Estate Tax Closing Letter User Fee Update”

“National Volatile Organic Compound Emission Standards for Aerosol Coatings: Interim Final Rule”

“Pipeline Safety: Editorial Change To Reflect the Name Change of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America”

Be sure to check the AAF CRA tracker for a full survey of activity under the law during the first part of 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 57 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

TOTAL BURDENS

Since January 1, the federal government has published $703.2 billion in total regulatory net cost savings (with $77.2 billion in cost savings from finalized rules) and 85.5 million hours of net annual paperwork cuts (with 47.8 million hours coming from final rules).",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/regrodeo-8-1-25.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 12:17:37.822480

There can also be multiday periods, often lasting days and even a week, when there is little or no wind (a wind drought) and multiple cloudy days when little solar power is generated.
Thus, wind and solar are often most available when the electricity they generate has the least value.
Comparing levelized costs, such as fixed mortgage payments for different homes, provides little insight into actual value.
Promoting misleading claims about wind and solar power distorts policymaking and will only exacerbate the growing inadequacy of electric supplies to meet increased demand in the wake of continued electrification efforts.","In a just-released report, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) claims that renewable energy is the most cost-competitive source of new electricity generation worldwide, The report further claims that “91% of new renewable power projects commissioned last year were more cost-effective than any new fossil fuel alternative” based on levelized costs, which can be thought of as the energy equivalent of a fixed mortgage.

If those claims sound too good to be true, it’s because they are. IRENA’s boasts ignore a fundamental reality: the intermittent electricity generated from wind and solar is fundamentally different than electricity generated by traditional generating resources that are not subject to the whims of the weather.

In the U.S., the Energy Information Administration (EIA) makes the same mistake. The EIA claims that wind and solar will account for the lion’s share of new generating capacity for the next decade and will provide electricity at a lower levelized cost than any traditional resource, including new natural gas generators.

But the episodic nature of wind and solar power has critical impacts on both supply adequacy and cost, which, while recognized by some, are nonetheless not incorporated into how bottom-line data. Traditional coal, natural gas, nuclear, and hydroelectric generating plants can be scheduled to run when needed. Some of them, especially nuclear and most coal plants, are designed to operate continuously and are referred to as “baseload” facilities. Others, especially natural gas plants, can quickly be turned on or off (“dispatched”) to match changes in demand. Collectively, traditional generation can be both scheduled and dynamically managed, enabling the operators of electric grids to reliably meet demand at the lowest cost.

The inherent intermittency of wind and solar reduces the physical and economic value of their capacity relative to traditional generating resources, as sufficient reserves or storage must be maintained to meet demand when they are unavailable. Merely reporting total wind and solar capacity misleads because it does not account for the adequacy of the electrical energy generated to meet demand and the actual costs to do so.

Here's an analogy. Imagine that a city and its citizens are offered two types of buses for commuting. One is with new buses and free fares. However, these run only one-third of the time, are often unpredictable, and are less likely to show up on bad-weather days. If you wait for one of these new free buses but it fails to show up, you must suffer the inconvenience of having to take a relatively expensive Uber ride, which can cost even more on busy or bad-weather days. Meanwhile, the other option is to pay a modest fare (say, one-tenth of an Uber ride) on a conventional bus—but one that’s reliable, regardless of weather. Over a year of commuting, the total costs for the “free” bus service are likely to be much higher and the value much lower than commuting on the conventional bus service.

In the context of electric grids, Uber rides represent the cost of either backup generating capacity or battery storage to compensate for wind and solar unavailability. Adding to these costs is the fact that, when electricity demand is greatest—typically, during the early morning and early evening hours—little, if any, solar power will be available. Similarly, meteorological records show that on the hottest and coldest days, there is often little wind. There can also be multiday periods, often lasting days and even a week, when there is little or no wind (a wind drought) and multiple cloudy days when little solar power is generated. Thus, wind and solar are often most available when the electricity they generate has the least value.

Fundamentally, cost and value are not the same thing. Comparing levelized costs, such as fixed mortgage payments for different homes, provides little insight into actual value. For example, a monthly mortgage payment of $2,000 for one house, versus one of, say, $2,500 for another, provides no information about either house’s value in terms of size, location, condition, and so forth. Similarly, the levelized cost doesn’t reveal power plant attributes, especially intermittency. The lowest levelized cost resources may not be the highest-value ones, or even the cheapest ones, when operated over time in the real world.

For electricity planners and regulators to identify the highest true value, they must compare costs and operational benefits. Just like the commuter bus that doesn’t arrive on a rainy morning, intermittent capacity that is unavailable when it is most needed has far lower economic value.

Promoting misleading claims about wind and solar power distorts policymaking and will only exacerbate the growing inadequacy of electric supplies to meet increased demand in the wake of continued electrification efforts. It will lead to more frequent electricity rationing, as the Netherlands has recently imposed.

Redesigning Catalysts for Maximum Efficiency

The quest for sustainable energy has led scientists to focus on materials that can efficiently convert sunlight into fuel. Researchers at the Institute of Science Tokyo and Hiroshima University have taken a significant step forward by redesigning the catalyst used in this process. They concentrated on lead-based oxyhalides, known for their ability to absorb visible light and resist harsh environments.

One of the critical components of this innovation is the creation of highly porous particles. By increasing the surface area of these particles from 2.5 to approximately 40 square meters per gram, the team dramatically improved their activity. Professor Kazuhiko Maeda, a co-leader of the study, emphasized the importance of controlling the morphology of these materials to unlock their full potential.

According to the findings, electricity demand in the United States is projected to rise by 2% per year and increase by 50% by 2050.

NEMA attributes the spike in demand to several sources, with data centers leading the way, accounting for 32% of demand growth between 2023 and 2037. It expects a 300% increase in data center energy consumption over the next decade, or about 90% of consumption growth expected through 2050. Through 2030, 25% of this growth will be fueled by artificial intelligence (AI). Notably, some AI and machine learning capabilities are expected to increase energy demand by a factor of ten. Investments in a reliable baseload will be necessary to meet this demand and to guard against data breaches and cyber or physical attacks.

Second, the trade association predicts that electric vehicles (EVs) will be the second-largest driver of electricity demand in the next decade, accounting for 24% of demand growth between 2023 and 2037. It also projects a 9,000% growth by 2050 in power consumption fueled by e-mobility and charging solutions, accounting for 51% of growth between 2038 and 2050. By 2035, NEMA expects about 55 million light-duty EVs to be deployed across the nation. The increase in EV adoption will be fueled by favorable state policies, improved access to public charging, advancements in range and technology, and declining component costs. For example, the price of batteries has declined by 80% since 2013.

Finally, NEMA projects electricity’s share of final energy use to increase from 21% to 32% by mid-century. According to the report, all generation sources will be needed to meet this demand. Renewables, in particular, will play a bigger role in this effort, as more intermittent sources are needed to meet grid demand. For example, while solar accounted for 125 GW and wind accounted for 145 GW in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, those numbers are expected to surge to 922 GW and 762 GW by 2050, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

As NEMA president and CEO Debra Phillips expressed in the press release, “America’s electrical system will face dramatic changes over the next 25 years. As electricity demand is set to rise for the first time in decades, we need an all-of-the-above approach that focuses on investing in innovative technologies and prioritizing policy and regulatory certainty that will help us create the reliable and affordable energy system of the future.”

The report notes that there will be variations in these trends based on region, though. The Mid-Atlantic and Texas, for example, will experience the most growth in data center demand through 2035. Meanwhile, the Northeast and the West will see the most growth in demand for EVs between 2035 and 2050. In New York, the Southeast, and the West, clean energy will account for more than half of generation capacity.

NEMA also highlighted numerous technology solutions that will play a role in this transition. The trade association suggests upgrading transmission lines by adding advanced conductors to improve capacity and using dynamic line rating to enhance power flows based on the weather. It also suggests adding smart grid technology like digital substations with sensors to enhance reliability and advanced metering infrastructure to improve responses based on demand and outages.

A particular highlight concerns improvements to the performance of data centers. For example, technologies like air flow management, lighting, and HVAC controls, and efficient transformers can save energy and costs. Using liquid cooling and conducting the cooling during times of less demand will lower the strain at peak times and improve the reliability of the grid as a whole.

Additionally, grid-scale and long-duration energy storage can act as backup resources during times of high demand or low generation. Storage solutions located at customer sites, or behind-the-meter storage, should also play a role by meeting local demand. The report estimates that the storage connected to the grid will increase by 1100% over the next 15 years.

Finally, the report notes that the increasing prevalence of EVs can be used to the grid’s advantage. Through vehicle-to-grid integration, EVs can send power into the grid during peak hours, and as mobile power sources, they can provide power to homes and businesses during outages. Smart charging can also be used to make sure EVs are only pulling power from the grid during times of low demand.

Finally, the report suggests numerous policy changes that can contribute to a more reliable American energy system, especially an all-of-the-above energy strategy that uses generation from a variety of sources. Also essential will be a large and skilled energy workforce, trained through apprenticeship and certification programs and assisted by workforce development legislation to build, operate, and maintain these systems.

Permitting and transmission reform are also critical. Permitting and siting for mining, generation, transmission, and distribution projects needs to be accelerated to get projects up and running on more expedited timelines. Transmission systems need to be updated and grid-enhancing technologies need to be adopted to get energy to where it is needed more expeditiously, as well.

Finally, NEMA highlights the importance of certainty. For example, tax incentives and incentives should be harnessed to encourage investments in energy technologies and infrastructure and to secure supply chains. Additionally, trade and tariff policies should be both transparent and consistent.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1711548247809-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-04 13:07:49.491917

These capabilities, often referred to as demand response, have several advantages, especially as we continue to see electricity growth in the US and elsewhere.
These agreements represent the first time we’re delivering data center demand response by targeting machine learning (ML) workloads.
“I&M is excited to partner with Google to enable demand response capabilities at their new data center in Fort Wayne, IN.
The first data center demand response capabilities we developed involve shifting non-urgent compute tasks — like processing a YouTube video — during specific periods when the grid is strained.","Technologies like AI are poised to spur a new wave of innovation and economic growth — and meeting AI’s energy needs efficiently and reliably also presents a unique opportunity to modernize our entire energy system.

That’s why we’ve been working to bring flexible demand capabilities into our data center fleet, which enables us to shift or reduce power demand during certain hours or times of the year. These capabilities, often referred to as demand response, have several advantages, especially as we continue to see electricity growth in the US and elsewhere. It allows large electricity loads like data centers to be interconnected more quickly, helps reduce the need to build new transmission and power plants, and helps grid operators more effectively and efficiently manage power grids.

We’re pleased to report on our progress in the implementation of these capabilities, including two new utility agreements with Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). These agreements represent the first time we’re delivering data center demand response by targeting machine learning (ML) workloads. This builds on our successful demonstration with Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) where we reduced the power demand associated with ML workloads during three grid events last year — paving the way for us to pursue opportunities at other locations.

“I&M is excited to partner with Google to enable demand response capabilities at their new data center in Fort Wayne, IN. As we add new large loads to our system, it is critical that we partner with our customers to effectively manage the generation and transmission resources necessary to serve them. Google’s ability to leverage load flexibility as part of the strategy to serve their load will be a highly valuable tool to meet their future energy needs,” said Steve Baker, president and chief operating officer of I&M.

Delivering flexibility to strengthen grids

Advancing Google’s 24/7 carbon-free energy ambition requires a holistic approach, to both procure clean energy and support the grid through demand-side solutions. Flexible demand is an important piece of this portfolio — it can be deployed quickly, helping bridge the gap between short-term load growth and long-term clean energy solutions, and delivers immediate benefits.

The first data center demand response capabilities we developed involve shifting non-urgent compute tasks — like processing a YouTube video — during specific periods when the grid is strained. Through our ongoing partnerships with Centrica Energy and transmission system operator Elia in Belgium, and Taiwan Power Company in Taiwan, we've leveraged this capability to help grid operators maintain reliability during those periods of the year when demand is the highest.

As AI adoption accelerates, we see a significant opportunity to expand our demand response toolkit, develop capabilities specifically for ML workloads, and leverage them to manage large new energy loads. By including load flexibility in our overall energy plan, we can manage AI-driven growth even where power generation and transmission are constrained. We believe this is a promising tool for managing large new energy loads and facilitating investment and growth.",https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Hero-1.width-1300.png,N,,2025-08-04 13:06:47.913341

The company’s change at Middletown reflects an overall flatlining of green steel projects in the U.S.
“There’s a lot of hurdles to go through to make green steel,” said Kathy Hipple, a research fellow who studies the advancement of green steel in Appalachia at the Ohio River Valley Institute, an economic research firm.
Butler County, Pennsylvania, where Butler Works is located, was not part of the 2025 analysis because data was not available.
But its recent acquisition of U.S. Steel means those goals now have to align with the Trump administration’s emphasis on fossil fuels.","Jamie Sychak, a third generation employee at a steel manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania called Butler Works, was looking forward to his facility decarbonizing with a federal grant awarded in March 2024.

The plant where Sychak has worked for 30 years was one of two owned by steel manufacturing giant Cleveland-Cliffs. Together, they were granted up to $575 million from the Department of Energy between facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania to decarbonize production and push forward industry-wide plans for what environmental groups call “green steel,” or steel manufactured with lowered greenhouse gas emissions.

The most popular pathway for green steel involves electrifying the process with hydrogen created with renewable energy, also known as green hydrogen. The projects would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated one million tons annually by installing a hydrogen-ready blast furnace and two electric melting furnaces.

“Our workforce was incredibly happy to have this modernization of our facility,” said Sychak, who’s now president of United Automobile Workers Local 3303 after decades as a maintenance technician. “It’s a step into the future and it makes us more secure in our jobs.”

While President Donald Trump pushes for increased domestic steel production, including approval for the $14 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japanese steelmaker Nippon in June, projects that could have reduced the industry’s reliance on coal for electricity and steel production are now in doubt. The Trump administration has moved to cut grants awarded during the Biden administration and the shifting regulatory environment has led companies to rethink their plans.

Cleveland-Cliffs, for example, previously touted its role as the first steel producer to conduct hydrogen trials in the Americas but recently said it no longer plans to pursue a hydrogen project at its Middletown, Ohio, location.

“Everyone seems to agree that we need to grow domestic manufacturing and we believe it’s here that those investments need to happen,” said Amanda Woodrum, co-director of Reimagine Appalachia, a coalition of nonprofits working to vitalize the region’s economy through greener industries. “Growing those domestic industries like Cleveland-Cliffs that are already local should be a priority. It would be a travesty if those investments get undone.”

Updating an old industry

While the industrial world has progressed on the promise of steel production, the building materials used in skyscrapers, cars, and windmills come at a price: steel is the single largest industrial emitter on the planet, accounting for about 10% of global carbon annually, when including indirect electricity emissions from production.

U.S. iron and steel demand is projected to rise 40% by 2050 percent, according to DOE. While the industry has moved toward adopting cleaner steel-making technology, emissions have continued to rise over the last decade. The global steel industry won’t reach net zero emissions by mid-century unless it goes through a serious overhaul, according to a 2024 Breakthrough Report by the International Energy Agency.

DOE’s Industrial Demonstrations Program, meant to decarbonize high-polluting industries, awarded $1.5 billion across six projects last year in an effort to mitigate steel’s environmental side effects. The bulk of that funding was awarded to Cleveland-Cliffs’ Butler Works in Butler County, Pennsylvania and Middletown Works in Butler County, Ohio, where Vice President J.D. Vance grew up.

Sychak’s Butler Works plant was granted $75 million for an induction reheat furnace, an all-electric furnace that could replace the natural gas forced-air furnaces the plant currently uses. Along with lowering, if not eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, the electric furnace would provide more uniform, controlled heat that would produce a better steel product, Sychak said. He said no jobs would be lost and the new heating process can increase the yield in the steel by 4%.

“We heard our grant was on the list for review, not necessarily to be cut,” Sychak said in late June, who sent a letter of support for the grant to the Trump administration. “I’m comfortable with no news being good news.”

Cleveland-Cliffs did not respond to a request for comment.

The company said during a May earnings call that part of its investments, including replacing a coal-fired blast furnace with a new unit running on hydrogen and natural gas at Middletown Works, could change “to better align with the administration’s energy priorities.” In a July 21 earnings call, CEO Lourenco Goncalves confirmed the company “informed the DOE that we would not be pursuing that project” because “we will not have availability of hydrogen.” He said discussions were ongoing with the agency about rethinking the project to use fossil fuels such as coal.

Meanwhile, the company announced in June that it had opened $150 million project at a Coshocton, Ohio, steel facility that replaces an acid-based system with a 100% hydrogen-based annealing line that can reduce emissions.

The company’s change at Middletown reflects an overall flatlining of green steel projects in the U.S. While announcements for new near-zero steel projects more than doubled between 2022 and 2023, according to the 2023 IEA report, those projects did not increase by 2024. While about 10 million metric tons of near-zero emission projects remained in the global pipeline, more than 100 million metric tons were needed by 2030 to stay on a net zero pathway, according to the 2024 report.

“There’s a lot of hurdles to go through to make green steel,” said Kathy Hipple, a research fellow who studies the advancement of green steel in Appalachia at the Ohio River Valley Institute, an economic research firm. “The cost of making green hydrogen is significantly higher than other forms of electricity so without a tax subsidy or incentive or some kind of support it’s going to be very difficult. Even if companies are willing to pay a premium for green steel, it still isn’t enough at the moment to justify the cost.”

Looking ahead

Appalachia’s Ohio River Valley has historically been the epicenter of the U.S. coal and steel industries. Green steel could boost production in the region, according to researchers, while lowering negative health impacts and high carbon emissions that have increased the frequency and severity of some natural disasters under climate change.

Pollution from steel production can lead to increases in particulate matter and ozone, both of which can cause shortness of breath, respiratory infections and worsen asthma conditions. Particulate matter can lodge in the bloodstream, decreasing lung function or causing premature death for people with heart or lung disease, according to the U.S. EPA.

Butler County, Ohio, where the Middletown plants are located, received an F grade for ozone and particulate matter in the air in the American Lung Associations 2025 State of the Air report. Butler County, Pennsylvania, where Butler Works is located, was not part of the 2025 analysis because data was not available.

In its 2024 sustainability report, Cleveland-Cliffs reported 15,499 metric tons of particulate matter emissions across all of its operations. The company stated that it had lower a GHG emissions intensity than the global average of integrated steel mills, and lower than the averages in Europe and China. Specific emissions for the U.S. were not included in the chart for comparison. The company has a long-term goal to reduce its GHG emissions to “near net zero” by 2050, with interim targets along the way.

Nippon Steel also has a goal to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But its recent acquisition of U.S. Steel means those goals now have to align with the Trump administration’s emphasis on fossil fuels. The transaction includes a “golden share” that gives the U.S. government more control over the future of the company, including the ability to appoint one independent director and grant the president or a designee consent rights over reductions in capital investments, and moving or closing facilities.

Prior to the sale, U.S. Steel was moving ahead with projects to lower or eliminate carbon emissions. A partnership between U.S. Steel, Molten Industries, and CFPD Software aimed to build a pilot project to eliminate carbon emissions from iron production by using hydrogen.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/iGyzdc6mOEdh3OfLkGWbypOqLb_Onh1k9xkS-zfqkzA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE3MTU5MzYzXzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-08-04 12:13:28.969968

As an explorer of lower-impact critical metals from seafloor polymetallic nodules, TMC has a dual mission: (1) supply metals for energy, defense, manufacturing, and infrastructure with net positive impacts compared to conventional production routes, and (2) trace, recover, and recycle the metals that they supply to help create a metal commons that can be used in perpetuity.

The company has conducted more than a decade of research into the environmental and social impacts of offshore nodule collection and onshore processing.

In May, TMC announced a $37 million registered direct offering through a securities purchase agreement with Michael Hess and his associated private investment vehicles. The financing will be used to advance the company’s deep-sea commercial development plans for critical metals essential to various industries and for general corporate purposes.

This financing comprises a Registered Direct Offering at $3 per share and warrants exercisable at $4.50 per share, with mandatory exercise if shares trade above $7 per share for 20 consecutive days. Proceeds are expected to be sufficient to fund operations through the potential issuance of a commercial recovery permit.

The investor group also brings decades of experience in large-scale resource development and deep global relationships across industry, government, and capital markets.

TMC’s Chairman and CEO, Gerard Barron, commented: “In recent weeks, both our company and the industry have made major strides. On April 24th, President Trump issued an Executive Order to accelerate seabed mining through expedited permitting, evaluation of offtake rights, and potential federal investment. Just days later, TMC submitted the world’s first commercial recovery application for nodules in international waters — more than two months ahead of schedule. We’re thrilled to welcome Michael Hess as a strategic partner. He brings over 15 years of exploration and production experience, as both an investor and operator, along with deep relationships across the US.”

Michael Hess also commented: “It is exciting to support the emergence of an entirely new resource category of ocean minerals and to help accelerate its development in service of the national interest.”

Mintz is proud to support the team at The Metals Company, and we look forward to witnessing their continued growth and success in the sustainable energy field.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.13290_5342.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 13:06:10.744645

This special contract, which is the result of collaborative efforts between the two organizations, further supports I&M's ability to provide reliable and affordable service for all customers as communities continue to experience significant economic growth.

The contract filed with the Indiana Utilities Regulatory Commission (IURC) on July 30 outlines a custom Demand Response structure, aligning with Google's operating capabilities. By participating in this program, Google will leverage new capabilities that allow it to reduce or shift electricity demand to carry out non-urgent tasks during hours when the electric grid is under less stress.

This offering will be used to reduce I&M's peak load in times of high energy demand, similar to programs currently available to residential and commercial/industrial customers. As a large load customer, Google's participation in this program boosts Indiana Michigan Power's ability to manage electricity demand during peak times. This helps lower overall energy costs, delivering savings to all I&M customers.

""I&M is excited to partner with Google to enable demand response capabilities at their new data center in Fort Wayne, IN. As we add new large loads to our system, it is critical that we partner with our customers to effectively manage the generation and transmission resources necessary to serve them. Google's ability to leverage load flexibility will be a highly valuable tool to meet their future energy needs,"" said Steve Baker, president and chief operating officer of I&M.

Weather serves as a primary contributor for changing energy demand throughout the year. As energy usage increases, so does the need to balance the demand on the power grid. Demand Response programs target the reduction or shift in energy used by customers out of the peak timeframe. Typically, peak hours, or the time of day when energy use is the highest, are most common on weekdays during the late afternoon and evening timeframe.

""As AI growth accelerates, we recognize the need to expand our demand response toolkit and develop capabilities specifically for machine learning workloads. Working closely with I&M to include load flexibility as part of the overall supply plan, we can support future power needs even where power generation and transmission are constrained. We want to be thoughtful about how we can continue to be a good grid citizen and see this as a vital tool for enabling responsible data center growth,"" said Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy, Google.

The contract represents a significant commitment by Google to support sustainability and affordability of I&M's electric service, while reducing operational impacts it may have on peak energy needs. If approved by the IURC, this agreement will reduce I&M's long-term generation requirements and financial commitments to benefit all I&M customers.

Google announced plans to build a $2 billion data center in Fort Wayne in April 2024. This investment is among the largest economic development projects in the state of Indiana, bringing significant benefits to local communities.

Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) is headquartered in Fort Wayne, and its approximately 2,000 employees serve more than 600,000 customers. More than 85% of its energy delivered in 2023 was emission-free. I&M has at its availability various sources of generation including 2,278 MW of nuclear generation in Michigan, 450 MW of purchased wind generation from Indiana, more than 22 MW of hydro generation in both states and approximately 35 MW of large-scale solar generation in both states. The company's generation portfolio also includes 1,497 MW of coal fueled generation.

Much of news around renewables and climate has grown downbeat as the Trump Administration kills federal incentives for most forms of clean energy, seeks to accelerate fossil fuel production and prepares to jettison the basis for the EPA’s regulatory efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions since 2009. But there are still some bright spots.

One of is the continued rapid expansion of the EV charging network in the U.S. In the year’s second quarter, the pace of installation of new charging ports and stations grew at a record pace. By the end of the year, about 16,700 fast-charge ports will likely be built, which is 2.4 times the level across the country in 2022, according to EV industry researcher Paren. If the current rate of growth continues, the number of U.S. fast-charging ports could top 100,000 in 2027, up from 59,694 ports at the end of June. The total number of EV charging stations rose to 11,687 at the end of the quarter from 10,761 in Q1.

Even with the pullback in federal support for EV charging, Paren estimates a 20% annual increase in new ports this year. Charging costs have also dipped a bit, to 48 cents/kWh from 50 cents/kWh a year ago, the result of both increased competition and new pricing systems, such as those offering discounts at off-peak times.

Even Tesla, which operates the biggest U.S. charging network, is upping its game. In July, the Elon Musk-led company opened its first Tesla Diner in Hollywood that features, along with cheeseburgers, fries and drive-in movie screens, 80 Supercharger stations—the biggest urban charging station in the country.

The Big Read

Waymo’s Growing Electric Robotaxi Fleet Is Headed To Dallas

Waymo, the leading U.S. robotaxi operator, plans to launch the autonomous ride service in Dallas next year, its second market in Texas, where it’s partnering with Avis to keep its growing fleet of electric vehicles in service. The Alphabet Inc. unit’s steady expansion pace draws a sharp contrast with Tesla, which remains in test mode despite CEO Elon Musk’s continued claims of its autonomous tech prowess.

Mountain View, California-based Waymo said in a blog post it’s launching commercial rides in Dallas in 2026, where it’s also been testing, without specifying exactly when. It already operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and Atlanta, and previously said it would launch service in Miami and Washington, DC, next year as well. The company said Dallas is of interest as it thinks it can help road safety in a city with the highest traffic fatality rate among U.S. cities with populations above 1 million people.

The news comes a week after Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo could soon triple the number of cities it’s operating in. “The Waymo driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads, and the team is testing across more than ten cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia,” he said on Alphabet’s July 23 results calls. “We hope to serve riders in all ten in the future.”

Along with Dallas, New York and Philadelphia, Waymo has confirmed that it’s testing electric robotaxis in Houston, San Antonio, Miami, San Diego, Nashville, Washington, Boston and Tokyo. Currently, it’s providing over 250,000 paid rides a week in the five cities where the service is available. That could be worth at least $5.1 million a week, based on an average fare of $20.43 per ride, an estimate by Obi, an app that aggregates real-time ride-hail prices.

Hot Topic

Costa Samaras, director of Carnegie Mellon University’s Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, on upgrading infrastructure for a rapidly changing climate

After a year of natural disasters, including massive Canadian wildfires, the hurricane that devastated Asheville, North Carolina, L.A. fires in January and Texas flooding this summer, are extreme weather events the new normal?

Yes. A lot of times we fall back on this: “Nobody could have foreseen this.” That’s just not how it works. We're foreseeing it right now. It's been foreseen. That thing of saying “oh, this is a once in a generation” or a “once in a thousand years” kind of thing, that's not how we think about risk anymore.

It's not just about assuming the worst all the time. It's more about not being unaware of what could happen, so that you don't say that you're surprised when we're telling you not to be surprised.

It’s virtually certain that it's going to be hotter. So we should be planning for our social systems, our health system, our infrastructure systems, our energy systems to be able to withstand more intense and prolonged heatwaves. These are things that we might not think about, the way that it affects our electricity grid or our water system or our transportation system or even our rail system. More intense heat stresses our systems in ways that they weren't designed for.

The most important thing that we should be worried about is that heat is deadly, and it's especially deadly for vulnerable households, elderly people with weakened immune systems and very young children. For example, air conditioning is an adaptive technology that we don't think about as a technology for resilience, but it absolutely is. If people can't use air conditioning or can't afford to use air conditioning or don't have air conditioning and it's really hot, they can die. And on a super hot day, the grid and power plants become a little bit less efficient. Transmission lines become a little less efficient. The distribution system, the transformers and the wires that come to our homes, every little bit of power that moves from the power plant to our homes, on a very hot day gets eroded a little bit. And that coincides with days of the year when we need extra power.

It's everybody turning their air conditioning on as the grid is becoming a little less efficient. And sometimes power plants can't operate when it's really hot. For example, ones that may use a river for water cooling, but the rivers are too hot to be effective. We have a power system that has been designed for the weather of the 20th century. That's not the weather that we have anymore.

What kinds of changes should we be making to the power transmission system to adjust to a hotter climate or just more severe weather?

We should be making changes to our supply system, our transmission system, and the way that we use electricity for a warming world. On the supply side, we should be adding more clean energy, solar and wind and geothermal, so that we stop the emissions that are making things worse. On the transmission side, there are new technologies that are called grid-enhancing technologies. There are opportunities to make power lines out of different materials that you can put more electricity through on hot days, but that also don't sag as much when it’s hot. The materials used in conventional power lines expand. If you think about holding a string between two points, when it's hot it expands and starts to go closer toward the ground. That’s dangerous because if it starts to sag too much, it gets close to a tree, it hits a tree and can spark a wildfire. That part of our electricity system is very susceptible to very high heat, so you should be thinking about new technologies to both reduce the sag but also enable us to put more electricity through the same infrastructure on very hot days.

In the distribution system, depending on where we are in the country, we might want to put more of those lines underground because even though it's more expensive, so that they're less susceptible to getting knocked down in an extreme storm or iced over in many parts of the country when there's a lot of ice.

And then finally at home, we need more distributed generation like solar and batteries, more intelligence to manage electricity loads with virtual power plants and so that if there's a problem with the transmission line or there's problem with power plants that are further away, we have some opportunity for resilience to still generate electricity when we need it close to where we are.

One last thing is we definitely can't give up on energy efficiency. The more that we make our homes and businesses efficient, the less energy we'll need to draw from the grid on those super-hot days. What's not acceptable is that we assume people are going to have to go without air conditioning, especially low-income folks. That’s just not an equitable, resilient solution. People should not be in danger because of high heat.

What about coastal regions that are at ever greater risk for more intense storms, such as Florida or the Gulf region? What should we be doing there?

We know in addition to heat, we're going to be facing increased intensity of storms, increased sea level rise and storm surge on the coasts, challenges in different parts of the water system and water availability and wildfire risk. In places like Florida, you're facing high heat, storm surge, sea level rise and extreme storms like hurricanes. There are opportunities–very low, no-regret opportunities–where we should be building our homes and infrastructure in places that are exposed to hurricanes to withstand high winds, heavy storms and the types of storm surge that push water onto land. Those are things we should be doing as a matter of standard, but we're not doing it in a systematic way to ensure that the infrastructure we have and the infrastructure we're building is going to be able to perform under increasingly intense climate-induced weather events.

Lots of parts of Florida are heavily exposed to current and future climate risks, but it's important to understand that climate risks affect every part of the country. You don't have to be on the coast to be exposed to the dangers of climate change. A lot of people thought North Carolina was safe or different parts of the upper Midwest or different parts of inland California were safe. There are always ways we can improve our communities to be more resilient toward climate impacts.

What's clear is climate change is causing damage right now, and the more emissions we generate, the worse it’s going to be in the future. So it's on us to get the world's emissions to zero as fast as possible, while also building infrastructure, human and social systems, to be able to withstand the types of climate impacts that we see now and are going to see in the future.

Others pointed out that the EPA’s proposal challenges widely accepted science.","HealthDay News — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is looking to remove the legal underpinning for most regulations against climate change.

If approved, the EPA’s proposal would rescind the 2009 decision that set forth a legal basis to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. Known as the “endangerment finding,” it allowed the EPA to limit emissions from vehicles, power plants, and oil and gas companies under the Clean Air Act.

The new proposal argues that Congress didn’t give the EPA permission in the Clean Air Act to regulate these emissions and that the agency essentially overstepped its power.

“If finalized, today’s announcement would amount to the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said, as reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA issued the endangerment finding in 2009 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are air pollutants.

The finding said these gases endanger public health and welfare, allowing the EPA to set rules to limit them. These rules have led to stricter standards for car emissions and limits on pollution from power plants.

Former EPA adviser Zealan Hoover told The Post that the new proposal was “not just an attack on science but on common sense.”

“The National Climate Assessment provides over 2,000 pages of detailed evidence that climate change harms our health and welfare, but you can also ask the millions of Americans who have lost their homes and livelihoods to extreme fires, floods and storms that are only getting worse,” Hoover explained.

A spokesman for Ford said the automaker supports clearer rules and hopes for “a single, stable standard” that helps reduce emissions while protecting manufacturing jobs.

Zeldin said the agency still supports clean air and water but wants to balance environmental protection with economic growth, The Post reported.

Others predicted the EPA’s legal arguments won’t hold up in court.

“They think this is a holy grail to get rid of the whole thing in one fell swoop as opposed to having to weaken regulations one by one,” Richard Revesz, a law professor at New York University, told The Post.

He said he was surprised by the EPA’s arguments, which he characterized as “haphazardly thrown together.”

“They just kind of pile it on, maybe hoping that one of them will stick,” he told The Post.

Others pointed out that the EPA’s proposal challenges widely accepted science. For example, it disputes reports by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which many scientists view as the global standard.

Rachel Cleetus, a climate expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said, “They are fringe arguments. They do not have credibility, and they go against the established science.”

The EPA’s move dovetails with a separate report from the U.S. Department of Energy. That report claimed that “CO2-induced warming appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed” and “U.S. policy actions are expected to have undetectably small direct impacts on the global climate.”

But critics say the costs of climate-related disasters and health issues far outweigh the savings from cutting regulations.

Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA estimated emissions rules would save $1 trillion through 2055, in part by reducing hospital visits and early deaths.

If the proposed rule is finalized and survives court challenges, it could limit how future presidents respond to fossil fuel emissions.

David Doniger is a legal expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“The law unambiguously includes greenhouse gases as air pollutants, and the law unambiguously makes it clear that the endangerment and contribution findings limit that to public health and science issues, not to broad economic and policy issues,” he told The Post.

“You’re asking the American people who are living through wildfires, floods, hurricanes, heat domes and so on, not to believe what they’re going through, not to believe their own eyes,” Doniger continued. “At some point what they’re claiming is going to appear to people to be mind-bogglingly false and out of touch.”

This special contract, which is the result of collaborative efforts between the two organizations, further supports I&M's ability to provide reliable and affordable service for all customers as communities continue to experience significant economic growth.

The contract filed with the Indiana Utilities Regulatory Commission (IURC) on July 30 outlines a custom Demand Response structure, aligning with Google's operating capabilities. By participating in this program, Google will leverage new capabilities that allow it to reduce or shift electricity demand to carry out non-urgent tasks during hours when the electric grid is under less stress.

This offering will be used to reduce I&M's peak load in times of high energy demand, similar to programs currently available to residential and commercial/industrial customers. As a large load customer, Google's participation in this program boosts Indiana Michigan Power's ability to manage electricity demand during peak times. This helps lower overall energy costs, delivering savings to all I&M customers.

""I&M is excited to partner with Google to enable demand response capabilities at their new data center in Fort Wayne, IN. As we add new large loads to our system, it is critical that we partner with our customers to effectively manage the generation and transmission resources necessary to serve them. Google's ability to leverage load flexibility will be a highly valuable tool to meet their future energy needs,"" said Steve Baker, president and chief operating officer of I&M.

Weather serves as a primary contributor for changing energy demand throughout the year. As energy usage increases, so does the need to balance the demand on the power grid. Demand Response programs target the reduction or shift in energy used by customers out of the peak timeframe. Typically, peak hours, or the time of day when energy use is the highest, are most common on weekdays during the late afternoon and evening timeframe.

""As AI growth accelerates, we recognize the need to expand our demand response toolkit and develop capabilities specifically for machine learning workloads. Working closely with I&M to include load flexibility as part of the overall supply plan, we can support future power needs even where power generation and transmission are constrained. We want to be thoughtful about how we can continue to be a good grid citizen and see this as a vital tool for enabling responsible data center growth,"" said Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy, Google.

The contract represents a significant commitment by Google to support sustainability and affordability of I&M's electric service, while reducing operational impacts it may have on peak energy needs. If approved by the IURC, this agreement will reduce I&M's long-term generation requirements and financial commitments to benefit all I&M customers.

Google announced plans to build a $2 billion data center in Fort Wayne in April 2024. This investment is among the largest economic development projects in the state of Indiana, bringing significant benefits to local communities.

Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) is headquartered in Fort Wayne, and its approximately 2,000 employees serve more than 600,000 customers. More than 85% of its energy delivered in 2023 was emission-free. I&M has at its availability various sources of generation including 2,278 MW of nuclear generation in Michigan, 450 MW of purchased wind generation from Indiana, more than 22 MW of hydro generation in both states and approximately 35 MW of large-scale solar generation in both states. The company's generation portfolio also includes 1,497 MW of coal fueled generation.

The Endangerment Finding has allowed the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from a wide range of sources, including cars, trucks, power plants, airplanes, and oil and gas operations.
The EPA estimates that rescinding it would save Americans approximately $54 billion annually by rolling back all greenhouse gas standards.
The newly proposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding would eliminate all greenhouse gas standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines.
Zeldin’s proposed rule to rescind the endangerment finding must go through a public comment period that ends September 21, and the rule is likely to face lawsuits challenging the change.","Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin has announced a proposal to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding, a key legal basis for more than $1 trillion in federal climate regulations — including the Biden administration’s electric vehicle mandate. If finalized, the move would eliminate EPA climate regulations on motor vehicles and engines, restoring greater consumer choice in the auto market. The Endangerment Finding has allowed the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from a wide range of sources, including cars, trucks, power plants, airplanes, and oil and gas operations. Zeldin argues that the finding imposes excessive regulatory burdens on both transportation and stationary emission sources. The EPA estimates that rescinding it would save Americans approximately $54 billion annually by rolling back all greenhouse gas standards.

In 2007, the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA gave the agency authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions if the EPA determined that global warming threatened public health or welfare. In response, the Obama administration issued the Endangerment Finding, which the Biden administration later used to mandate that by 2032, two-thirds of light-duty vehicles and 46% of medium-duty vehicles manufactured must be electric — effectively limiting consumer choice. The newly proposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding would eliminate all greenhouse gas standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines. It would also include provisions such as off-cycle credits.

According to American Trucking Association President and CEO Chris Spear, “This electric-truck mandate put the trucking industry on a path to economic ruin and would have crippled our supply chain, disrupted deliveries, and raised prices for American families and businesses. Moreover, it kicked innovation to the curb by discarding available technologies that can further drive down emissions at a fraction of the cost. For four decades, our industry has proven that we are committed to reducing emissions. The trucking industry supports cleaner, more efficient technologies, but we need policies rooted in real-world conditions.”

While announcing the repeal, Zeldin explained how the finding was based on obsolete data and misrepresented evidence on the impact of carbon dioxide emissions, calling the repeal the “most significant deregulatory action in U.S. history.” He added that “[t]here are people who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country.” Zeldin is challenging the endangerment finding on a legal and procedural basis. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking repealing the finding argues that the section of the Clean Air Act does not authorize the EPA to regulate emissions standards to address climate change.

The EPA cited a U.S. Department of Energy report that was also released on the same day. This report reviews underreported aspects of climate science, indicating that climate models exaggerate estimates of future global warming, carbon-dioxide-induced warming may be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and that excessively aggressive mitigation policies could prove more detrimental than beneficial. The report was written by five scientists who conducted the analysis independent of the Trump administration’s Department of Energy.

Since 2005, carbon dioxide emissions in the United States have declined by over 20%, primarily due to innovation and a shift from coal to natural gas in the power generation sector. That compares to China, whose carbon dioxide emissions have grown 85% since 2005 and is still building an average of two large coal-fired plants a week. Environmentalists, however, prefer to highlight China’s increased solar and wind capacity — inefficient technologies that produce a fraction of the energy that coal plants are capable of producing.

Zeldin’s proposed rule to rescind the endangerment finding must go through a public comment period that ends September 21, and the rule is likely to face lawsuits challenging the change. Zeldin is requesting people on both sides of the issue to submit comments.

Sustainability Amidst Growing Energy Needs: As global energy consumption rises, the quest for sustainable solutions becomes increasingly critical.","BALTIMORE (Aug. 4, 2025) — Constellation (Nasdaq: CEG), the nation’s largest producer of emissions-free energy and a leading supplier of energy products and services, is now accepting applications for its 2025 E2 Energy to Educate grant program, which provides funding for student projects focusing on energy innovation. Educators and students in grades six through 12 can apply for program grants of up to $25,000, and those in two- and four-year colleges can apply for grants of up to $50,000. The deadline for applications is Oct. 1, 2025.

“Solving the energy challenges of tomorrow starts with developing the next generation of energy and STEM leaders,” Kathleen Barrón, executive vice president and chief strategy and growth officer, Constellation. “Entering its 16th year, Energy to Educate has supported tens of thousands of students and teachers who bring real passion, fresh ideas and genuine curiosity to STEM learning. We’re eager to see and support the projects they’ve dreamt up this year.”

The E2 program granted $500,000 across 20 projects and reached nearly 12,000 students nationwide in 2024. Last year’s selected projects, which spanned eight states, included a hydrogen fuel cell training program, mobile STEM labs, wind and solar energy design build competitions and initiatives focused on preparing youth for careers in STEM. To date, the grant program has provided nearly $6.5 million for research and education projects that have empowered more than 300,000 students to explore STEM fields.

Joliet Junior College in Illinois used 2024 E2 grant funding to create the Constellation Rising Stars Endowed Scholarship, the first scholarship established for low-income students enrolled in the college’s Process Control Instrumentation Technology (PCIT) and Electrical/Electronic Automated Systems (EEAS) programs.

“With support from Constellation, our Rising Stars Scholarship is already transforming lives and futures,” said Amanda Quinn, Joliet Junior College’s director of Institutional Advancement. “This fall, five students will receive financial support to pursue their education and career goals in our PCIT and EEAS programs – two fields that are essential to the energy and manufacturing sector. These students are driven, determined, and rising stars in the technical trades. Constellation’s investment is not only easing financial burdens, it’s developing tomorrow's energy leaders, today.”

To be eligible for E2 funding, applications must align with the following energy innovation themes:

Access in Energy: How can we empower and engage underserved groups in the energy sector, and inspire students from all socioeconomic groups to pursue STEM and energy careers? Projects showcase effective strategies to support increased access to good-paying careers in the energy industry, and to deliver clean energy solutions to underserved communities. Projects may also address inclusion of economically disadvantaged communities in the energy transition.

Sustainability Amidst Growing Energy Needs: As global energy consumption rises, the quest for sustainable solutions becomes increasingly critical. Innovations in electrification, transportation and artificial intelligence are poised to revolutionize energy usage in homes and communities and can help address climate change. Projects show the enhancement of existing products or new technologies for a cleaner energy future, and how we can pave the way for a more sustainable world through decarbonization and energy-efficient choices. Projects may also showcase artificial intelligence as a pivotal ally in both pioneering new advancements and refining existing technologies.

Nuclear Technology & Clean Energy: How can we harness the power of nuclear technology and other forms of emissions-free generation to address climate change, using innovative and cutting-edge solutions, such as advanced nuclear, emissions-free energy generation systems, and smart energy storage devices? Projects should show how they can create positive impacts for society, economy, and environment, and how they can collaborate with various stakeholders, such as businesses, schools, governments and communities, to scale up their solutions and pilot programs.

DEC Application:

Article 19 Air Title V Facility (ID No. 8-5736-00004/00017)

Project Description:

Greenidge Generation LLC (Greenidge) filed an application to renew its Title V air permit 8- 57360-00004/00017, effective September 7, 2016, for the continued operation of a natural gas-fired electric generating facility (facility) in the Town of Torrey, Yates County, on Seneca Lake.

The facility is a primarily natural gas-fired electric generating plant, with a generating capacity of approximately 107 megawatts (MW) with a maximum heat input which is limited to 1,117 million BTUs per hour.

The renewal application requests renewal of the existing permit, with revisions limited to:

removal of the diesel fire pump permit conditions because the diesel fire pump has been taken out of service and removed from the facility, and minor revisions to the monitoring requirements for particulate emissions (PM-10, PM-2.5 and Particulates), which includes the use of a flowmeter for the facility to demonstrate continuous compliance with the existing PM-10, PM-2.5 and Particulates permit conditions.

Proceedings:

On September 8, 2021, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC or Department) issued a combined notice titled, Notice of Complete Application, Availability of Draft Permits and Announcement of Virtual Legislative Public Comment Hearings, in the Environmental Notice Bulletin (ENB) commencing the public review and comment period for the referenced permit and associated application materials.

Virtual legislative public comment hearings were held on October 13, 2021. The DEC Division of Environmental Permits denied the renewal request on June 30, 2022, pursuant to title 6 of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules, and Regulations of the State of New York (6 NYCRR) 621.10(f).

The plant, which sprawls over 408 acres near the strategically located Thoothukudi Port, is VinFast’s first integrated electric vehicle and battery production facility in India. The company aims to manufacture 1.5 lakh EVs annually once fully operational. In the initial phase, the facility will produce 50,000 vehicles per year and create more than 3,500 jobs over the next five years.

The company, which aims to be a global challenger to Elon Musk’s Tesla and China’s BYD, has identified India as a cornerstone of its expansion strategy. The company intends to use the Thoothukudi plant not just to serve the domestic market but as a regional export hub for South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

“We aim to develop this into VinFast’s largest export hub in South Asia,” said Pham Sanh Chau, CEO of VinFast Asia. “We already have confirmed orders from countries across the region.”

At the launch, Stalin signed the bonnet of a VF7 model on the shop floor, symbolically flagging off the firm’s Indian journey. The company, part of Vietnam’s largest conglomerate Vingroup, has rapidly scaled its international presence despite a rocky entry into the US market. With the Thoothukudi launch, it now competes head-on with Tesla, which is still negotiating with the Indian government for import duty concessions, and BYD, which assembles vehicles from a Kanchipuram facility near Chennai.

Breaking ground just 50 days after signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Tamil Nadu government in January 2024, construction of the plant started on February 25 last year, and the first cars rolled out less than 15 months later.

Industries Minister TRB Rajaa said that 18 months ago, “many didn’t believe a car plant could be built here. Today, it’s a reality.”

VinFast’s presence, he said, would trigger the development of a supplier ecosystem in Thoothukudi, with plans for a dedicated suppliers’ park already in motion.

Beyond Chennai

The location of the plant in Thoothukudi is part of the state’s broader strategy to decentralise industrial growth away from congested zones like Chennai. The city’s port access, availability of land, and logistical advantages played key roles in attracting VinFast. The project aligns with Stalin’s vision of “distributed industrial growth” and job creation for youth across all districts.

The company’s job creation efforts have already tapped into Tamil Nadu’s ‘Naan Mudhalvan’ skill development initiative. Stalin also used the occasion to invite Vingroup to invest further in Tamil Nadu in its other verticals, including education, real estate, and hospitality, promising “all necessary support” from the state.

VinFast’s India venture comes at a time when Tamil Nadu accounts for over 40% of all planned EV investments in the country, further cementing its reputation as India’s electric mobility hub. Alongside VinFast, global players like Tata Motors–Jaguar Land Rover are also establishing EV plants in nearby districts.

“If we want to create fuels and chemicals from CO2, we can.
By enabling selective production of fuels or chemicals, this research could help industries reduce costs, improve efficiency and adapt to changing market demands.
“For example, the paper and pulp industry or ethanol refineries often emit high-purity CO2,” Shetty explained.
“Historically, the idea was that the closer you bring two components, the better the reaction,” Shetty said.","Researchers at Texas A&M University have uncovered how to more efficiently convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into useful fuels and chemicals, offering a potential boost to both environmental sustainability and local economies.

Led by Dr. Manish Shetty, assistant professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering, the study, published in the journal Chem Catalysis, explores how certain metals interact with a material called SAPO-34.

“This work is about understanding how to control what we make from CO2,” said Shetty. “If we want to create fuels and chemicals from CO2, we can. But we need to know how to mix the ingredients in the right way.”

A Circular Economy

Rather than focusing solely on emissions, Shetty’s work emphasizes the idea of circularity, reusing carbon as a resource.

“We’re not just thinking about CO2 as a greenhouse gas,” he said. “We’re asking, can we build a circular economy where carbon is reused instead of wasted?”

The implications extend beyond environmental benefits. By enabling selective production of fuels or chemicals, this research could help industries reduce costs, improve efficiency and adapt to changing market demands.

“If someone comes to us five or 10 years from now and says, ‘I want to make propane from CO2 and hydrogen,’ we want to be able to say, ‘Pick this metal, pair it with this catalyst, and here’s how to put them together,’” he said. “It’s like a toolkit for designing the chemical industry of the future.”

That future could include not just large-scale refineries, but also smaller, decentralized systems that benefit rural communities.

“For example, the paper and pulp industry or ethanol refineries often emit high-purity CO2,” Shetty explained. “Right now, that CO2 is just released. But what if we could use it to make propane for local heating or cooking? That’s a way to turn waste into value and support local economies.”

The Perfect Recipe

Traditionally, chemical engineers say that bringing different catalyst components closer together improves efficiency. But the team’s study challenges that assumption.

“Historically, the idea was that the closer you bring two components, the better the reaction,” Shetty said. “But we’re finding that’s not always true. Sometimes, being too close lets the metal interfere in ways that hurt performance.”

The process involves two main steps: first, converting CO2 and hydrogen into methanol using metal oxides like indium oxide, zinc-zirconium oxide or chromium oxide. Then, methanol is transformed into hydrocarbons using SAPO-34, a material with acidic sites that help drive the reaction.

But when these materials are placed very close together, at the nanoscale, something unexpected happens. The metal ions can migrate and swap places with the acid sites in SAPO-34, changing how the reaction unfolds.

“People often think about how molecules move in these systems, but not how the metals themselves move,” Shetty explained. “We’re showing that these metals are not innocent bystanders. They move, and that movement has consequences.”

Findings

The team found that indium ions tend to shut down the desired chemical pathways, leading mostly to methane, a less useful product in this context. Zinc ions, on the other hand, promote the formation of paraffins, which are more fuel-like. And chromium showed little interaction, allowing the reaction to proceed as intended.

“This research is about process intensification — making things more economical, using smaller reactors, saving on capital and operating costs,” Shetty said. “But it’s also about giving us control over what we make and how we make it.”

As the researchers continue to refine their methods, they hope to offer practical solutions that transform scientific discovery into real-world application.

“This is just one step in a larger journey,” Shetty said. “But it’s a step that brings us closer to a more sustainable and economically resilient future.”",https://stories.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/manish2.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 10:00:33.117297

The reconciliation law includes $1.1 trillion of health care savings and nearly $200 billion of SNAP (food stamp) savings.
Some Members of Congress who voted for the reconciliation law claim that their support was contingent on the promise of a second reconciliation bill that would include additional spending cuts and reduce deficits.
There should absolutely be a second reconciliation bill that contains only savings, ideally enough to offset the deficit impacts of the first reconciliation bill.
The reconciliation law includes about $370 billion of one-time appropriations for defense, border security, immigration, and other purposes.","Earlier this month, the President signed the 2025 reconciliation law – also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA). The law extended and expanded the expiring portions of the 2017 tax cuts while boosting defense and immigration spending and partially offsetting the cost with savings from energy tax credits, health care, higher education, and other areas . Below are 10 items we’ll be looking for following the enactment of OBBBA from its fiscal and economic effects.

Do Deficits Decline as Claimed? Although the reconciliation law is estimated to increase debt by over $4 trillion through 2034, advocates claim it will largely pay for itself through the dynamic feedback from faster economic growth. Including the effects of tariffs and regulatory reform, the Council of Economic Advisers projects deficits will remain about $1.6 trillion per year through 2028 and fall to less than $1.5 trillion by 2034 while debt will gradually fall to 94 percent of GDP by 2034. We’ll be tracking where deficits and debt end up.

Does Long-Term Economic Growth Significantly Accelerate? The Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 concurrent budget resolution assumes real (inflation-adjusted) economic growth will average 2.6 percent per year for at least a decade, while CEA projects real growth will average 2.8 percent. Most forecasters expect a short-term ‘sugar high’ that will largely fade, with growth over the next decade averaging closer to 2 percent per year. We’ll be tracking the actual changes in economic output.

Do Bill Supporters Tout Large Tax Cuts Despite Insisting They Were Just Current Policy Extensions? Many proponents of the reconciliation law claim that it did not add to deficits because it was an extension of “current policy” and thus had no cost (though the costs were not recognized when the tax law was first passed.) At the same time, the White House is claiming this is the “largest tax cut in history.” It cannot be both. We remind those Members of Congress who claimed this should not be scored as a tax cut that changing their tune to claim that it was would not be consistent or credible.

Do IRA Tax Credits Phase Out as Scheduled? The reconciliation law includes $540 billion of savings through 2034 by phasing out most of the energy- and environmental-related tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The earliest phase-outs are scheduled to begin on September 30, 2025, but others will begin phasing out at the end of 2025, halfway through 2026, and – most significantly – the clean electricity production and investment tax credits will phase out only for facilities placed in service after 2027. These phase-outs should not be delayed or canceled absent an adequate replacement that results in even more savings.

Do the Medicaid and SNAP Reforms Take Effect? The reconciliation law includes $1.1 trillion of health care savings and nearly $200 billion of SNAP (food stamp) savings. While some of the savings will begin next year, much of the savings starts phasing in in 2027, with the Medicaid work requirements and tightening of provider tax limits going into effect that year. Some lawmakers have already proposed repealing some of these offsets. These savings should not be delayed or cancelled, unless lawmakers include a sufficient replacement that results in even more savings.

Is There a Second Reconciliation Bill, As Promised? Some Members of Congress who voted for the reconciliation law claim that their support was contingent on the promise of a second reconciliation bill that would include additional spending cuts and reduce deficits. The Republican Study Committee in the House has launched a working group to discuss a second reconciliation effort. There should absolutely be a second reconciliation bill that contains only savings, ideally enough to offset the deficit impacts of the first reconciliation bill.

Are Temporary Tax Cuts and Spending Extended Without Offsets? The reconciliation law reduces taxes on tips, overtime pay, seniors, auto loans, and factory investment through 2028 and increases the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction through 2029. It also massively expands compensation for radiation exposure and authorizes contributions to “Trump Accounts” through 2028, while establishing a new $10 billion per-year rural hospital fund through 2030. Making these temporary provisions permanent would cost about $150 billion per year. Lawmakers should let these provisions expire as scheduled, or else fully offset any extension – ideally using “Super PAYGO” so that offsets are larger than costs. There is no good reason to deficit-finance extensions, and trying to use the “current policy” gimmick to justify the extension would be highly irresponsible and hypocritical given the numbers currently used.

Do One-Time Appropriations Get ‘Built into the Baseline’? The reconciliation law includes about $370 billion of one-time appropriations for defense, border security, immigration, and other purposes. Most of these funds must be spent by the end of FY 2029. Although these funds are mandatory, they closely resemble some discretionary funds appropriated each year, and appropriators may use them to backfill normal annual spending. Congress should not build these funds into their assumed ordinary appropriations and boost appropriations spending beyond 2028 to continue this funding. We estimate doing so would cost at least $400 billion through 2034 and potentially much more.

Will Future Reconciliation Bills Circumvent the Byrd Rule? The Senate Byrd rule forbids reconciliation bills from adding to long-term deficits. To circumvent this rule, the Senate allowed the Chairman of the Budget Committee to incorporate a score based on the “current policy” gimmick, rather than normal current law scorekeeping – asserting that there was no fiscal impact associated with extending temporary provisions from the 2017 tax law. Future Congresses should not use the same current policy gimmick to circumvent the Byrd rule or any other gimmicks that weaken the fiscal constraints of reconciliation, and they should not go further in abusing the authority to insert a directed score.

How Many of the Bill’s Supporters Will Refuse to Support a Future Debt Limit Increase, Citing Fiscal Concerns? The reconciliation law included a $5 trillion increase in the debt limit. While it was important to raise the debt limit and avoid default, previous debt limit increases have been paired with fiscal reforms that improve the fiscal situation, most recently with the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act. Furthermore, some Members of Congress who voted for this bill (including its debt limit increase) had never voted to increase the debt limit in prior years, citing the nation’s fiscal health and their unease with condoning further borrowing. Those who voted for this bill thus voted to increase the debt limit by $5 trillion and increase projected debt by a further $4 trillion.

As we wrote after the reconciliation law’s passage, adding more than $4 trillion to the debt – especially given our current unsustainable fiscal situation – was fiscally reckless. Proponents of the law have made substantial assertions on its potential benefits, and we will be tracking the data to see whether those claims become reality. Regardless, policymakers should turn towards putting in place fiscal reforms that reduce deficits, secure our trust funds, and leave future generations with a sustainable national debt.

Located in Gaston County, Carolina Lithium's site focuses on the prospect of doing everything in one place, from the initial mining and refining of the raw material to the production of lithium hydroxide. This non-organic substance is a necessary component of EV batteries. By keeping everything in-house, the project keeps costs down and gives carmakers in the states a more secure supply of EV battery material.

Carolina Lithium is ideally located in the Tin-Spoudumene Belt, an area of the country that led worldwide lithium production at one time. It's also near local battery manufacturers, and these companies have established infrastructure, as well as experienced crews ready to go. When Carolina Lithium is at full strength, it's expected to triple America's current output of lithium hydroxide.

Battery-grade lithium used for electric vehicles is primarily processed in China, which is dominating the market. Because of this, costs are high, timelines are long, and concerns over supply are always at the forefront. But EVs are becoming more popular with American drivers, and since the lithium hydroxide used in EV batteries is necessary, producing it in the United States is the ideal way of doing business.

However, as car manufacturers in the U.S. rush to get domestic solutions to their supply problems, China is tightening its grip on the lithium supply chain. China discovered a new hard-rock deposit in July of 2025 that could increase its already ample reserves. Located in the country's Hunan Province, this new find would make it easier for China to process and deliver EV battery materials. Since China is already far ahead of the U.S. in terms of EVs, it's clear that this new development could potentially keep them even further ahead.

The situation isn't improving for U.S. automakers, thanks to the high duties on imported graphite from China, which could directly impact American EVs. This is due to China tightening controls on exports in retaliation, which may increase costs and stretch timelines for EV battery material delivery. While the U.S. is working to increase production stateside, the transition will, unfortunately, take time, which car manufacturers already don't have.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/why-north-carolina-is-critical-to-ev-battery-production-in-the-us/l-intro-1753883003.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 10:01:31.023284

MONTGOMERY, N.Y., Aug. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Lightstar Renewables LLC proudly announces the launch of the Plains Road Agrivoltaics project, an initiative that seamlessly integrates solar energy production with agricultural use on the DiMartino Farm in Montgomery, New York. The agricultural consultant on the project was Solar Agricultural Services, Inc. (SolAg). This project demonstrates the new way farmers can both feed and fuel New York state - a forging together of both needed clean energy generation and vital agricultural production.

The Plains Road Agrivoltaics project was designed as an agricultural project from the beginning. The solar installation is tailored to accommodate hay planting and harvest equipment— the core agricultural activity of the DiMartino Farm— and will see an addition of two acres of vegetable production that will provide turnkey access to prime farmland for a new entry farmer. This trailblazing effort is expected to generate enough energy to power 466 homes annually while bolstering the long-term viability of the farm.

""Plains Road stands as a beacon of what is possible when we are committed to problem solving and centering farmers' needs. There is so much more that we can do as an industry to listen to agricultural stewards and learn how growing food and powering homes can work in concert."" said Lucy Bullock-Sieger, Chief Strategy Officer at Lightstar.

A critical foundation of this project was the adjustment of local bylaws to allow for agrivoltaics projects. The Town of Montgomery is one of the first in the State to tailor their bylaws to allow for agrivoltaics projects to maximize agricultural production – such as considering specific height restrictions, setbacks, and lot coverage. This shift highlights the growing acknowledgment of innovative land-use strategies to address the difficult challenges municipal leaders face when considering solar for their towns.

Lightstar is proud that the project aligns with American Farmland Trust's Smart Solar principles, embodying a vision for responsible solar development that prioritizes farmers, communities, and the environment.

""Lightstar's project is a prime example of the Smart Solar principles and reaffirms our commitment to fostering partnerships that benefit communities and protect our agricultural heritage,"" said Linda Garrett, New York & New Jersey Regional Director at American Farmland Trust (AFT).

The Plains Road agrivoltaics project is more than just a local success; it serves as a replicable model for sustainable development across the Empire State and the country. By supporting landowners like the DiMartino family, Lightstar Renewables is helping to create a future where farms can thrive economically while contributing to a safe, low-cost, resilient energy system; strengthening rural communities, supporting farms, improving grid reliability.

Lightstar will be hosting a ribbon cutting ceremony to commission this project, showcasing this groundbreaking milestone in sustainable development in September 2025. This event marks the official launch of a project that redefines the synergy between New York agriculture and New York renewable energy.

Here at home, Maine scientists have clearly demonstrated growing impacts on our environment, communities, and people through their work on the Maine Climate Council.
The Maine Climate Council’s Scientific and Technical Subcommittee’s latest scientific assessment is deeply troubling but recommended reading.
EPA’s proposal to scrap the federal government’s response to climate change will now go through extensive public comment and litigation.
—Jack Shapiro, NRCM Climate & Clean Energy Program Director","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) this week announced that it plans to scrap its legal authority to address the threat of climate change. It’s an inexplicable move in an era of rising temperatures, escalating extreme weather, and climate-linked damage to infrastructure, communities, and human life.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is proposing to overturn the “endangerment finding,” which establishes the patently obvious scientific fact that climate change poses serious threats to human health, and thus is an air pollution problem that EPA must address through its regulatory authorities under one of our bedrock environmental protection laws: the Clean Air Act.

Earthjustice has a great explainer on why the endangerment finding matters:

In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that greenhouse gases are air pollutants that endanger public health and welfare by driving climate change. As such, gases like carbon dioxide and methane are subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act.

This determination — rooted in scientific consensus and affirmed by the Supreme Court — is known as the endangerment finding. It is the foundation of several Clean Air Act protections that limit climate pollution from such sources as power plants, cars and trucks, and fossil fuel drilling operations.

With this move, the Trump Administration’s EPA is deliberately turning a blind eye to the threats climate change pose to people and environment. The Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM) is determined to be part of the strong opposition to this radical attack on the nation’s legal foundation for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.

Why Do the Endangerment Finding Matter for Maine?

Climate change is here. It is caused primarily by burning fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal. And ignoring it won’t make it go away.

The impacts of climate change are already harming our communities in the form of extreme weather, flooding, warmer waters, and storm damage. These impacts are taking a toll, costing us billions in recovery costs. The best way to address them is to reduce our reliance on polluting fossil fuels.

NRCM has always used the best available science to make our decisions. When it comes to climate change, the science is clear. The level of scientific consensus on the fundamental causes and trends around climate change is overwhelming and unprecedented. Here at home, Maine scientists have clearly demonstrated growing impacts on our environment, communities, and people through their work on the Maine Climate Council.

The Maine Climate Council’s Scientific and Technical Subcommittee’s latest scientific assessment is deeply troubling but recommended reading. Its findings – backed by peer-reviewed scientific research – make clear that:

Maine’s climate is getting warmer and wetter, with more high-intensity rainstorms. Temperature projections for Maine are for a 2–4°F increase by 2050 and up to 10°F by 2100

The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 97% of the world’s ocean surface and is experiencing near-constant ocean heat waves.

Sea level is 7.5 inches higher than in early 20th century Maine, and the rate of sea-level rise has nearly doubled in the past 30 years. Rising sea levels have caused recent increases in devastating coastal flooding, such as the record-breaking storm events of January 2024.

Maine is vulnerable to increasing illnesses and deaths stemming from extreme weather—especially heat, cold, and storm impacts such as flooding.

Smoke from wildfires in Canada and the western U.S. and increased aeroallergens such as pollen are impacting air quality in Maine and resulting in recent poor air quality alerts.

Maine homeowners saw the second-largest home insurance rate increase in the country in 2024.

Mainers particularly vulnerable to climate change include rural, older, and lower-income residents, as well as those people and places with economies tied to climate-sensitive resources—those often overlooked when needing help.

Weather variability is reducing crop yields, causing economic impacts to farms, and mental and physical health impacts to farmworkers in Maine.

There are many more impacts detailed in the report, but the bottom line is that when there is a clear threat with a clear cause to our health, our communities, and our environment, we have a moral obligation to stand up and act.

What’s Next and What Can I Do About It?

EPA’s proposal to scrap the federal government’s response to climate change will now go through extensive public comment and litigation. NRCM will join national and state partners in opposing it by every means possible. Sign up for our emails, and we’ll keep you posted on how you can help. Donating to NRCM to support our climate and clean energy program is always a great way to help.

We find hope in the stories of everyday Mainers who are taking action – coming together to make their communities more resilient, supporting local clean energy jobs that install heat pumps and rooftop solar, and taking action to protect our future.

As much as the Trump Administration and their allies in the fossil fuel industry may hope we’ll just give up, we’re not going anywhere. We won’t ignore climate change and its impacts on our nation and our state.

Across Maine, from the coast to the mountains, from north to south and west to east, our rural state is experiencing the impacts of climate change already. But we don’t have to accept a diminished future and a damaged environment. We will continue to stand alongside Maine people and communities to confront this threat as we always do—by rolling up our sleeves and getting to work to make this world a better place.

We need to recognize that climate change is one of the most important issues facing humanity, not only for us, but especially for our children and grandchildren.","CHAMPAIGN, Ill. ­— On Tuesday, July 29, President Trump’s administration proposed revoking the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s “endangerment finding,” a 2009 scientific finding that underpins U.S. policy on greenhouse gas emissions. By identifying the gases as a threat to public health and welfare, the finding provides the basis for many emissions regulations. Donald Wuebbles, a professor emeritus of climate, meteorology and atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, has been a leader of numerous national and international climate assessments, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He also served as an assistant director in the U.S Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Obama. Wuebbles discussed the proposed repeal of the endangerment finding and its implications for policy and the environment with News Bureau biomedical sciences editor Liz Ahlberg Touchstone.

What is the endangerment finding?

The endangerment finding was an analysis by the EPA published in 2009 that found that human-related emissions of certain heat-trapping gases, referred to as greenhouse gases, could significantly endanger public health and welfare. That finding was based on an extensive series of peer-reviewed publications in major science journals and in national and international assessments of the science. Essentially, it means the EPA determined that the six key well-mixed greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, threaten current and future generations. The importance of this finding is that it was determined to be a crucial legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.

How are regulations in the U.S. tied to this finding?

By linking the changes in climate to effects on the public health and welfare of the American people, the EPA was able to then justify using the Clean Air Act as a basis for limiting future emissions of those greenhouse gases. Since action to reduce emissions would largely mean transitioning our energy production and transportation systems away from the use of fossil fuels, those policies would otherwise require new legislation from the U.S. Congress. Such legislation is currently unlikely because the Republican Party opposes any action despite many members of Congress from both political parties telling me and other scientists privately that they understand the importance of this issue for our future.

What scientific basis does the administration have for repealing the endangerment finding?

The reality is, there is no real science basis for its repeal. The scientific evidence is very clear that our changing climate is almost entirely due to human activities, especially from the burning of fossil fuels along with some effects from land-use change. Through a series of reports using misleading and cherry-picked analysis, the administration is currently trying to paint a picture telling the American people that climate change is too uncertain and won’t affect us all that much. Or like the new head of NASA did recently, saying climate change is too political — the science is just science, the politics come in when we have to decide to do something about it.

There does not appear to be any supportable basis for the appeal of the endangerment finding other than to support the continued use of oil, coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels. In fact, a number of economic analyses show that the costs of inaction on climate change are likely to be far greater than the costs of action.

What could happen to emissions regulations and standards in various industries if this finding were repealed?

Repealing the endangerment finding would not have much effect immediately on industry. The regulations and standards were still largely yet to be developed. However, the first step has been to promote the use of alternative, renewable energy sources — and the administration is also removing many of the existing incentives for moving to the use of alternative energy while doing everything it can to encourage the use of fossil fuels in the U.S.

The vast majority of companies recognize the importance of climate change and have significant concerns about the potential impacts of extreme weather events and sea-level rise on their assets and supply chains. This all leaves much uncertainty for companies as how to respond: Should they continue to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, or should they aim to appease this administration?

How could repeal affect the quality of life in the U.S.?

All Americans need to understand that climate change is already affecting us and will be affecting us much more in future decades unless we take action now both in terms of mitigation — reducing emissions — and adaptation, resilience to the unavoidable changes in our climate. The significant increase in extreme weather events resulting in over a billion dollars in damages has already affected all parts of the U.S. and has affected our economy. Repealing the endangerment finding would not benefit any of us except for the near-term financial gains of a few in the fossil fuel industry.

In addition, it is worth noting that eliminating our burning of fossil fuels would largely eliminate human emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide and other pollutants that result in concerns about air quality and would therefore save thousands of American lives annually — this was the basis for the Clean Air Act in the first place!

We need to recognize that climate change is one of the most important issues facing humanity, not only for us, but especially for our children and grandchildren. Making the transition away from using fossil fuels is not easy, but it is doable, and we need to meet that challenge.",,N,,2025-08-04 12:17:21.584404

Because governments in the U.S. and worldwide are doing too little about climate change, people are turning to the courts again.
So long as corporations try to profit from environmental degradation and human misery, we must insist that governments protect us.","EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has launched “the biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history,” involving more than 30 environmental protection rules. He says it will result in “the Great American Comeback.”

It’s more like the great American backslide into the 1960s, when dirty air, massive oil spills, and a burning river demonstrated what happens when corporations prioritize profits over people and the planet.

In those days, a book about dangerous pesticides served as a wake-up call for the government to regulate the industry. The Trump administration is influenced by another book, Project 2025, which calls for weakening or killing the rules that protect public health and the environment.

As the Trump administration implements recommendations like these, it boasts that laissez-faire government will save money. However, it doesn’t mention the many costs of deregulation. According to the Associated Press, the rules Zeldin is targeting prevent 30,000 deaths and save society $275 billion every year they remain in effect.

EPA regulations are designed to prevent industry’s pursuit of profits from causing maladies such as cancer, asthma, strokes, heart disease, pneumonia, neurological disorders, gastrointestinal problems, kidney and liver diseases, skin disease, bronchitis, and more. They protect the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat.

If all corporations had social consciences, or if all industries were self-regulated, there would be little need for government regulations. But as one organization that trains business executives observes, the corporate sector “harbors the capacity for immense damage when ethical lines are crossed. The biggest business scandals in history…driven by greed, negligence, or the pursuit of unchecked growth, reveal the vulnerabilities that exist within corporate structures and the profound consequences when integrity is compromised.”

Numerous scandals have proven this point. One of the biggest in memory was the tobacco industry’s behavior in the 1990s. The industry knew its products were linked to cancer, and that nicotine was addictive, but it denied both of those realities. Its advertising strategy was to encourage young people to smoke (presumably because its older customers were dying of smoking-related diseases).

State attorneys general sued the industry to recover health-care costs. The result in 1998 was the largest civil litigation settlement in American history. More than 40 cigarette companies and trade associations eventually agreed to pay states billions of dollars annually for as long as the companies continued selling cigarettes.

Today, the fossil-energy industry has employed a similar tactic of denial and distraction with regard to global climate change. The difference is that all people of all ages and countries are harmed, not just those who consume its products.

Several states and cities are suing major oil producers for damages. In this case, however, the president and the Republican-controlled Congress are siding with the polluters and against the health and welfare of the people who elected them.

Zeldin says, “We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.” But their dagger is actually aimed at the heart of the American people. Nearly 316 million Americans — 95.5 percent of us – live in counties that have suffered major weather disasters since 2011. Disasters displaced 2.5 million Americans from their homes in 2023. Three of four Americans say they have experienced extreme weather in the last 12 months.

The broader issue is what the American people deserve and expect from their government. Although the best corporations serve society as well as shareholders, profits are the principal goal of business. The government’s job is to protect the health and welfare of the people. Regulations are a critical tool.

President Trump is trying to release corporations from any social responsibility. He is using the powers of his office to punish companies and other organizations that adopt diversity, equity, and inclusion goals, or environmental, social, and governance goals. He has ordered the attorney general to investigate states with climate policies.

Because governments in the U.S. and worldwide are doing too little about climate change, people are turning to the courts again. As of last fall, 122 of the world’s largest oil companies faced 86 active lawsuits attempting to hold them accountable for damages resulting from climate-altering pollution. Fifty-eight percent of the cases are in U.S. courts. They’ve had mixed results so far.

However, the world’s highest court, the International Court of Justice, ruled on July 23 that nations are obligated under international law to take action against climate change, and countries can be held liable for failing to do so. Their obligations include “necessary regulatory and legislative measures” to prevent greenhouse gas pollution.

As consumers, Americans have some leverage over corporate behavior, but it is limited. So long as corporations try to profit from environmental degradation and human misery, we must insist that governments protect us. And any elected official who serves corporations at the expense of people should be shown the revolving door.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/AP25204769320186.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-04 12:17:29.036928

Visit our company portals Rolls-Royce","Rolls-Royce posts strong profits and cash flow in H1 2025, driven by SMRs, battery storage and sustainable aviation engine upgrades

Rolls Royce (RR) has posted a huge performance in the first half of 2025, reinforcing the commercial and environmental momentum behind its multi-year transformation strategy.

With operating profits surging 50% and free cash flow reaching £1.6bn (US$2.13bn), the business is outperforming even in the face of supply chain constraints, inflationary pressure and tariffs.

At the heart of this resurgence is a sharpened focus on efficiency, low-carbon technologies and long-term resilience, all of which are accelerating the company’s shift towards more sustainable operations and value creation.

Accelerating low-carbon energy solutions

One of the most significant sustainability milestones is the selection of RR SMR (Small Modular Reactor) as the sole provider in the UK’s Great British Energy – Nuclear (GBEN) programme.

The project, which will deliver three SMR units with the first connected to the grid by the mid-2030s, is expected to generate positive cash flow starting in late 2025 and become fully profitable by 2030.

The strategic investment by ČEZ Group, a Czech utility operator, not only brings additional capital but also strengthens the project’s nuclear expertise and potential for future deployments in Europe.

Further international interest, such as being shortlisted by Vattenfall in Sweden, highlights the growing global appetite for clean, modular nuclear power to support decarbonisation and grid stability.

The SMR programme, if scaled, could be pivotal in reducing reliance on fossil fuels and accelerating national net zero targets.

“Our multi-year transformation continues to deliver,” says Tufan Erginbilgic, CEO of Rolls Royce.

“Our actions led to strong first half year results, despite the challenges of the supply chain and tariffs. We are continuing to expand the earnings and cash potential of Rolls-Royce.

“We also delivered continued strong operational and strategic progress in the first half of 2025.

“A strong start to the year gives us confidence to raise our guidance for 2025.

“We see these targets as a milestone, not a destination, with substantial growth prospects beyond the mid-term.”

Growth in battery storage and green technologies

RR is also advancing battery energy storage systems (BESS), with major orders including from Lithuania’s Ignitis Group.

This business is now supporting revenue growth across the Power Systems division and is on course to reach breakeven in the near term.

The company anticipates 20% annual revenue growth in its power generation segment, underpinned by booming demand for data centre backup power – a key area of focus for digital infrastructure and energy resilience.

Beyond hardware, RR is embedding sustainability into product development.

The next-generation engines under development are expected to offer lower emissions and improved fuel efficiency, with entry into service by 2028.

In parallel, military engine upgrades with higher power density also reflect a focus on energy performance and environmental impact.

Rolls Royce Target Progress

RR has set multiple initiatives to meet in order to become as sustainable as possible.

To date, RR has achieved its aim to reduce energy use in operations and facilities by 50%, normalised by revenue and its ambition to achieve a GrandMean in Gallup’s top quartile (75th percentile) for large manufacturing companies by the end of 2023.

So far, the company is making key progress on:

Delivering a 46% reduction of GHG emissions from operations, facilities and product testing by 2030 vs 2019 baseline, so far its 46%

Achieving a Total Reportable Injury (TRI) rate of 0.33 per 100 employees by 2025, so far its 0.32

Inspiring 25 million of young innovators by 2030, 45% to date

Reducing total solid and liquid waste in operations and facilities by 25%, normalised by revenue, so far 65% has been achieved

Increasing the recycling and recovery rate to 68% by 2025 whilst maintaining zero non-hazardous waste to landfill, so far 60% has been reached.

RR’s initiatives were introduced in 2015, based on its 2014 performance, to help the company manage risk and reduce emission and cost across the company.

Sustainable aviation

In Civil Aerospace, RR has made significant progress improving the fuel efficiency and durability of its engines, a critical factor in decarbonising aviation.

RR announced in late 2023 that it had successfully completed its compatibility testing of 100% SAF on all of its in-production civil aero engine types.

The discovery fulfils the company’s commitment made in 2021, to prove that there are no engine-technology barriers to the use of 100% SAF.

Other major highlights in the company’s progress include:

Trent XWB-84EP: Now in service, this upgraded variant improves fuel consumption by over 1% and extends engine lifespan.

Trent 1000 TEN: The new high-pressure turbine blade will more than double its time on wing, reducing waste and emissions associated with engine maintenance.

Trent 7000 and 1000: Set to deliver a further 30% time-on-wing benefit by year-end 2025.

These enhancements are driven by data analytics and digital engineering.

“This is an important milestone, not just for Rolls-Royce, but also for the wider civil aerospace industry,” says Simon Burr, Group Director of Engineering, Technology and Safety at Rolls-Royce plc.

“We hope the success of these tests provides a level of technical validation that supports those who seek to invest in the production of 100% SAF going forward.”

Cloud-based Engine Health Monitoring (EHM) and adoption of AI-driven performance diagnostics are optimising fleet uptime while lowering environmental impact — all contributing to more efficient and sustainable operations.

Operational resilience and climate commitment

RR’s transformation has been underpinned by a strong emphasis on efficiency and simplification.

Since 2022, the company has delivered more than £850m (US$1.13bn) in third-party cost savings, with a target of exceeding £1bn (US$1.33bn) by the end of 2025.

The TCC/GM ratio (total cash costs to gross margin) has improved to 0.35x, described as ""best-in-class"" and essential for long-term climate and financial resilience.

These cost efficiencies have enabled sustained investment in R&D, site decarbonisation, and advanced product development — including clean propulsion and digital systems.

The company is also adopting zero-based budgeting to better align resources with sustainability priorities.

Partnering with Louisiana contractors like GIS isn’t just local pride—it’s a strategic move to build smarter, faster, and stronger with people who know this region best”

— Jonathan Bass, Chairman & CEO

METAIRIE, LA, UNITED STATES, August 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In an energy industry often criticized for lofty promises and transient commitments, Argent LNG is taking a stand—and taking action. By initiating early development with Galliano-based Grand Isle Shipyard (GIS), Argent isn’t just talking about local investment—it’s leading with it.

This first move signals a broader philosophy: Argent LNG’s “Louisiana First” procurement approach is more than policy—it’s the foundation of how the company plans to build a 25 MTPA world-scale LNG export terminal in Port Fourchon, deliver on time and budget, and help restore confidence in large energy project execution.

Rethinking Risk, Starting with Local Wisdom

In contrast to other mega-projects that often rely on out-of-state or international contractors unfamiliar with Louisiana’s unique industrial and environmental landscape, Argent LNG is investing in companies who live and work in the region. The difference is more than symbolic—it’s strategic.

“Everyone talks about supporting local communities—but Argent LNG is doing it in a way that matters,” said Jonathan Bass, Chairman & CEO of Argent LNG. “Our choice to begin development with GIS, one of the Gulf Coast’s most capable and trusted engineering and construction firms, proves that we’re not just checking boxes. These are partners who’ve weathered hurricanes, built through supply chain crunches, and know the regulators and terrain. That experience reduces risk—and raises our confidence.”

Why “Louisiana First” Is the Right Strategy

Louisiana has one of the most sophisticated industrial labor forces and energy supply chains in the world. Yet far too often, companies parachute in with outside contractors unfamiliar with the coastal terrain, environmental nuances, and regulatory complexity. That inexperience often results in:

Change orders and permitting delays

Misunderstandings with local officials

Workforce friction and low community trust

Schedule and cost overruns

Argent LNG is taking a different path—prioritizing Louisiana contractors who:

Possess decades of proven performance in the region

Employ local talent and grow in-state capabilities

Understand the unique demands of building in hurricane-prone, environmentally sensitive areas

Bring deep relationships with state agencies and regulators

Economic Multiplier for Louisiana

By anchoring its project to Louisiana’s energy ecosystem, Argent LNG is setting up a powerful ripple effect for the state’s economy. The project is expected to:

Create thousands of high-paying jobs across fabrication, logistics, construction, and professional services

Support small and medium-sized businesses through subcontracting and supplier agreements

Facilitate local workforce training and vocational education programs

Generate long-term economic resilience in coastal parishes long tied to the energy sector

“This is about more than just a plant—it’s about building opportunity for generations of Louisiana families,” added Bass. “Working with partners like GIS is how we create real value for the community and de-risk one of the most ambitious LNG projects in the hemisphere.”

Built to Deliver and Ready for the Future

Argent LNG’s 25 MTPA export facility is scheduled to break ground in 2027, with first LNG deliveries targeted for 2030. Designed around modular liquefaction technology and best-in-class environmental performance, the project is also exploring integration with carbon capture, storage, and hydrogen modules to stay competitive in a low-carbon global energy future.

And while global headlines are dominated by supply shocks and geopolitics, Argent is focused on resilience: building a reliable, secure U.S. LNG supply chain anchored in local talent and trust.

About Argent LNG

Argent LNG is a next-generation U.S. liquefied natural gas developer based in Louisiana. Focused on building secure, scalable infrastructure to meet global demand, Argent LNG is committed to operational excellence, community investment, and supporting America’s allies with low-carbon, cost-competitive energy.

Why this matters:

EPA science underpins standards for the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the chemicals that course through consumer products. When core research is steered by political appointees — or simply defunded — regulators lose the data needed to judge whether refinery emissions drive asthma spikes, whether “forever chemicals” slip from tap water into bloodstreams, or how rising heat magnifies the harms of smog. Without that evidence, rules can stall or skew, leaving clinicians guessing at causes of illness and communities absorbing unseen costs. The stakes are especially high for children, older adults, and low-income neighborhoods already burdened by traffic exhaust and industrial waste.

Our latest Clean Energy Future-Energy Efficiency (CEF-EE) report highlights how our programs continue to deliver meaningful savings for customers while reducing overall energy usage and supporting the state's goals. Through March 2025, nearly 465,000 customers have actively participated in PSE&G's energy efficiency initiatives, collectively saving over $720 million annually[i] on their utility bills.

These results reflect a range of efforts aimed at helping customers reduce both their energy use and costs—from home energy assessments to rebates on energy-efficient appliances, HVAC systems, and products available through the PSE&G Marketplace. Since the start of the program, customers have received approximately $740 million in rebates, delivered as either instant discounts at the point of purchase or post-purchase rebates, helping to offset the cost of energy-saving upgrades.

Additionally, participation to date includes:

More than 95,000 home energy assessments completed

Over 140,000 rebates claimed for upgrades to energy-efficient appliances

More than 24,000 appliances recycled, and;

Approximately 340,000 smart thermostats and 100,000 power strips purchased through the PSE&G Marketplace

""Affordability and energy efficiency go hand-in-hand, and our programs are designed to make it easier for customers to reduce their energy use and manage their monthly bills,"" said Lauren Thomas, vice president Clean Energy Solutions-Customer Solutions at PSE&G. ""As customers continue to take advantage of our energy efficiency programs, they're seeing the benefits—lower energy costs, greater comfort, and more affordable ways to save energy at home.""

Our energy efficiency programs for businesses are also delivering strong results, helping commercial customers lower energy use and operating costs through a range of practical business solutions. To date, these programs have helped more than 18,500 businesses implement approximately 28,000 projects that improve operational efficiency, enhance comfort, and manage expenses.

Participation in the Small Business Direct Install program remains strong, with more than 1,500 small businesses projected to save approximately $19 million annually[ii] on energy costs. This program helps make energy-saving improvements more affordable for smaller businesses by reducing upfront costs and delivering long-term savings.

""With support from PSE&G's Business Energy Efficiency Programs, we've been able to make meaningful upgrades that help us keep our building cool, comfortable, and running efficiently—especially, during the summer months,"" said Radwa Ali, library director, Montclair Public Library. ""The program's incentives, combined with flexible, interest-free on-bill-repayment, allowed us to move forward with these improvements in a way that make sense financially for the library and the community we serve. These upgrades ensure we can continue to serve Montclair reliably, seven days a week.""

Together, our residential and business customers are on track to save approximately 2.8 million megawatt-hours of electricity annually—enough energy to power over 406,000 homes[iii] each year. Natural gas savings are expected to exceed 75 million therms per year. Combined, these efforts are projected to help avoid approximately 2.1 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually.

We also remain focused on expanding access to clean energy careers through the Clean Energy Jobs Program, where more than 4,100[iv] individuals have been placed in clean energy roles, helping to build the state's skilled workforce of the future. Additionally, our energy efficiency programs have also been recognized with 75 industry awards for excellence in program delivery, workforce development, and marketing.

We understand managing energy costs can be challenging, which is why affordability remains a top priority for PSE&G. In addition to helping customers save through energy efficiency, we recognize that broader supply and demand challenges also impact energy costs across the state.

As affordability remains an ongoing concern, New Jersey should seek to address one of the main drivers of this year's electric supply increase – a lack of forecasted electric supply. The demand for electricity is forecasted to continue to grow, and supply is not keeping up with this demand. PSE&G stands ready to work with the state to expand reliable energy sources and maintain the reliability of the system through near and long-term solutions such as continued energy efficiency, additional power generation capabilities and transmission to lower energy costs.

As a trusted energy advisors, we're remain focused on providing resources to help customers better manage their energy bills and make more informed decisions. Learn more at pseg.com/SaveEnergyandMoney.

While the solar project will require investments worth $28 million, another $7.6 million is expected to be incurred for the construction of a 126 MVA substation in the Mohammad Agha Industrial Park.

The office of the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs (DPMEA) shared that the solar PV project is targeted to be completed within 18 months. It will provide clean electricity to 40,000 households in the region and resolve the electricity shortage in the industrial park.

Taliban government’s Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Baradar Akhund added that the 40 MW solar project will boost industrial activities in Logar and create numerous economic opportunities. He cites the lack of electricity supply in Afghanistan as one of the key reasons for the country’s underdevelopment, as it remains dependent on expensive imported electricity despite having vast energy generation resources.

Now, the country aims for energy self-sufficiency through efficient utilization of solar and wind energy, as well as ensuring proper water resource management. Afghanistan also aims to become an exporter of surplus electricity to the neighboring nations.

The construction of this project follows another 40 MW solar project in Balkh province that entered construction in May 2025 (see Afghanistan Starts Construction Of Balkh Solar Power Plant).

According to the country’s Renewable Energy Policy of 2015, available on the DABS website, Afghanistan’s total renewable energy potential stands at around 318 GW, with solar alone accounting for 222 GW, followed by wind with 67 GW, 23 GW of hydro, up to 3.5 GW of geothermal, and 4 GW of biomass capacity.

707(a)(2)(B) instead of the corporate AMT deferred gain rules in Prop.","Interim guidance issued Tuesday by the IRS on the Sec. 55 corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) contains several changes for which the AICPA advocated.

One such change in Notice 2025-28 is the inclusion of a top-down elective safe harbor that will allow corporate AMT entity partners to use a simplified method for allocating their distributive share of a partnership’s adjusted financial statement income (AFSI).

Overall, the notice informs taxpayers of the intention of Treasury and the IRS to partially withdraw proposed regulations (REG-112129-23) and issue revised proposed regulations regarding the application of the corporate AMT to applicable corporations with financial statement income attributable to investments in partnerships.

The notice also provides interim guidance primarily on simplified methods to determine an applicable corporation’s AFSI with respect to an investment in a partnership, reporting by partnerships of information needed to compute ASFI, and rules for partnership contributions and distributions.

The IRS stated in the notice that the interim guidance is being provided to reduce the compliance burdens and costs associated with applying the corporate AMT.

The corporate AMT, which was included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, P.L. 117-169, originally imposed a 15% minimum tax based on book income rather than taxable income on corporations with AFSI of over $1 billion beginning after Dec. 31, 2022. Treasury estimated that about 100 of the largest U.S. corporations would pay the corporate AMT annually.

AICPA recommendations

In addition to the top-down elective safe harbor, the notice includes several other AICPA recommendations, said Reema Patel, the AICPA’s senior manager–Tax Policy & Advocacy, such as:

Allowing for simplified methods and reducing reporting for immaterial partnership interests when the top-down or taxable-income election is made, which the AICPA said would reduce unnecessary complexity.

Allowing for any reasonable method for allocating modified FSI, provided that it uses the same method for all corporate AMT partners in the partnership.

Introduction of a “modified–20 Method,” which essentially allows partnerships to apply the regular tax rules under Sec. 752 and Sec. 707(a)(2)(B) instead of the corporate AMT deferred gain rules in Prop. Regs. Sec. 1.56A-20. This helps prevent corporate AMT gain recognition on transactions under Sec. 721 and Sec. 731.

AICPA advocacy

The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, based in Richland, Washington and Portland, Oregon, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, would see their funding in the year ahead nearly halved under the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 budget for the U.S. Department of Energy. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate are negotiating spending bills for the next fiscal year that begins in October and will decide on the energy agency’s budget after Sept. 2, when they return from their August recess.

The national labs are meant to lead research and scientific experimentation in climate and clean energy strategies, including measuring extreme weather risks by collecting and analyzing atmospheric data from around the world and improving battery and grid technologies to get more wind and solar energy flowing to homes and businesses. They also study energy efficiency across U.S. infrastructure and commerce, all of which is meant to save Americans and businesses money and to curb climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Andrea McMakin, a former communications specialist and 34-year veteran of the Northwest Laboratory in Richland, said the U.S. risks losing its best scientists if the proposed funding cuts go through.

McMakin is part of the group Friends of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which has been raising concerns about the cuts. McMakin said the group learned in June that the lab’s former director told staff in a meeting that up to 1,000 people could be cut if the current budget passes, a number that’s been echoed by state leaders.

“Those people leave. They have to find jobs someplace. And we’re seeing that a lot of other countries are stepping up their recruiting to get U.S. scientists and engineers,” McMakin said. “We don’t want to see that. We want to keep our energy competitiveness and we want to keep our brain power here in the U.S.”

A recent report from Politico cites two sources familiar with U.S. Department of Energy facilities who said up to 1,000 people could be cut from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado.

Heather Lammers, a spokesperson for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said in an email that the lab is talking with the federal energy department to fully understand the impacts of its proposed spending cuts.

The Northwest Laboratory’s public affairs officer, Dawn Zimmerman, did not confirm figures for potential staff cuts and said the U.S. Department of Energy requires all queries involving the federal budget to be directed to its public affairs office. An unnamed energy department spokesperson said in an email that personnel decisions are dictated by the labs directly, not the federal government.

“The Department of Energy is committed to making the American people’s government more efficient while also growing the output of top-quality science at our national labs,” the spokesperson wrote.

Proposed cuts

Trump proposed in May cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. energy department by about $3.5 billion. Of that, $2.5 billion would be cut from the agency’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy — a 74% reduction from its current budget.

The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office, established following the 1973 oil crisis, in recent years has focused on researching, developing and deploying technologies meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the country’s electricity sector. That technology includes batteries that can hold large amounts of wind and solar power, and white LED light bulbs that require far less energy than incandescent and fluorescent lights.

The budget also cuts 14%, or $1.15 billion, from the department’s Biological and Environmental Research program, meant to collect and analyze climate change data.

Both the Colorado lab and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory get most of their funding from those two programs. But under Trump’s proposed 2026 budget, the Renewable Energy Lab would lose $387 million in funding – more than half of its current budget.

Lammers, the spokesperson for the National Renewable Energy Lab, said it also receives funding from state and tribal governments and some private industry partners.

“We remain committed to our mission of delivering integrated solutions for an affordable, secure and reliable energy future through research, innovation and strategic collaboration,” she said.

The Northwest National Lab would lose about $280 million, a third of its current budget.

The lab, which employs more than 5,000 people, is the largest employer in Washington’s Tri-Cities area, which includes Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, according to the area’s development council.

State lawmakers weigh in

Washington’s U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, said the Republican budget for the energy department would be a “devastating blow” to the Northwest National Lab.

“Make no mistake: if Trump’s budget request were to become law, it would result in the loss of over 1,000 jobs at PNNL. On top of that, this administration is defying the law right now by redirecting millions of dollars away from wind and solar research and development happening at our national labs — this move alone could force major layoffs at PNNL,” she said in a statement.

Murray, the lead Democrat and vice chair on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she would fight the proposed cuts.

“President Trump’s budget is dead on arrival in the Senate as far as I’m concerned,” she said. “I’m working to write a bipartisan funding bill that will protect investments in our national labs and save the jobs President Trump is thoughtlessly seeking to eliminate.”

Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, also a Democrat, said in an email the Republican budget is “anti-science” and will harm clean energy industries gaining traction and growing in parts of the state.

“I just had five town halls in eastern Oregon where wind turbines and solar panels are taking full advantage of renewable energy options that lower prices for consumers and fight the climate crisis,” Wyden said. “That’s but one clear example of how this latest Republican scheme to slash research investments in clean energy would be both nonsense and anti-science.”

Wyden said he voted against confirming oil executive Audrey Robertson as Trump’s appointee for assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy at the federal energy agency, in large part because Trump said he wanted to cut renewable energy investments.

Trump threatened nearly identical cuts for the energy department during his first presidency in 2017, but Congress ultimately ignored the president’s suggested budget for the agency. McMakin said she remembers staff of the Northwest National Lab starting to change the way they talked about their work so they wouldn’t draw Trump’s attention.

“I remember at that time it was like, we have to change. We can’t say ‘atmospheric climate science’ anymore, we have to say ‘earth sciences,’ because it was just one of those language things that if you said climate science or anything about climate you are in danger of getting your funding cut,” she said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_1092-1024x8571754305371.jpg?h=2c1ed066&itok=BeRvEup6,N,,2025-08-04 08:03:37.716681

Deal Orchards is a third-generation orchard based in the Brushy Mountains in the northwestern region of the state. A quarter of the orchard is EcoCertified, meaning measures have been taken to protect pollinators, to use natural pest management, and to improve soil health.

Continuing in its sustainability efforts, Deal Orchards has installed a 77-kilowatt solar panel array, meeting about 75% of its energy demands.

""We loved working with the folks at Deal Orchards,"" Pisgah Energy President Evan Becka said, per Solar Power World. ""It's inspiring to see how they've expanded their idea of stewardship to include the production of renewable energy. They're an incredible example for other orchards in the region.""

Solar power is the cheapest option out there and can reduce monthly utility bills to $0. Many utilities allow homeowners to feed power back to the grid, earning them credit that can be used during cloudier weather.

Best of all, solar energy displaces reliance on coal and gas power. These polluting sources produce health risks and exacerbate the destructive weather patterns, such as floods and droughts, that are threatening agricultural operations.

To be a part of the solution and enjoy the great benefits of solar at home, use EnergySage to connect you to vetted local installers. By leveraging available rebates and credits, these pros can knock off up to $10,000 from the installation cost. Federal incentives will dry up this year, so it's best to hop on the opportunity sooner than later.

Solar panels can also help to lower electricity costs associated with appliances such as heat pumps. If you are thinking of upgrading your HVAC system, Mitsubishi offers a great line of heat pumps.

Deal Orchards has been pleased with the switch to solar.

""We decided to install solar for two very practical reasons: to reduce our carbon footprint and our energy bills,"" President Alan Deal said.

The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office, established following the 1973 oil crisis, in recent years has focused on researching, developing and deploying technologies meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the country’s electricity sector. That technology includes batteries that can hold large amounts of wind and solar power, and white LED light bulbs that require far less energy than incandescent and fluorescent lights.

The budget also cuts 14%, or $1.15 billion, from the department’s Biological and Environmental Research program, meant to collect and analyze climate change data.

Both the Colorado lab and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory get most of their funding from those two programs. But under Trump’s proposed 2026 budget, the Renewable Energy Lab would lose $387 million in funding – more than half of its current budget.

Lammers, the spokesperson for the National Renewable Energy Lab, said it also receives funding from state and tribal governments and some private industry partners.

“We remain committed to our mission of delivering integrated solutions for an affordable, secure and reliable energy future through research, innovation and strategic collaboration,” she said.

The Northwest National Lab would lose about $280 million, a third of its current budget.

The lab, which employs more than 5,000 people, is the largest employer in Washington’s Tri-Cities area, which includes Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, according to the area’s development council.

State lawmakers weigh in

Washington’s U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, said the Republican budget for the energy department would be a “devastating blow” to the Northwest National Lab.

“Make no mistake: if Trump’s budget request were to become law, it would result in the loss of over 1,000 jobs at PNNL. On top of that, this administration is defying the law right now by redirecting millions of dollars away from wind and solar research and development happening at our national labs — this move alone could force major layoffs at PNNL,” she said in a statement.

Murray, the lead Democrat and vice chair on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she would fight the proposed cuts.

“President Trump’s budget is dead on arrival in the Senate as far as I’m concerned,” she said. “I’m working to write a bipartisan funding bill that will protect investments in our national labs and save the jobs President Trump is thoughtlessly seeking to eliminate.”

Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, also a Democrat, said in an email the Republican budget is “anti-science” and will harm clean energy industries gaining traction and growing in parts of the state.

“I just had five town halls in eastern Oregon where wind turbines and solar panels are taking full advantage of renewable energy options that lower prices for consumers and fight the climate crisis,” Wyden said. “That’s but one clear example of how this latest Republican scheme to slash research investments in clean energy would be both nonsense and anti-science.”

Wyden said he voted against confirming oil executive Audrey Robertson as Trump’s appointee for assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy at the federal energy agency, in large part because Trump said he wanted to cut renewable energy investments.

Trump threatened nearly identical cuts for the energy department during his first presidency in 2017, but Congress ultimately ignored the president’s suggested budget for the agency. McMakin said she remembers staff of the Northwest National Lab starting to change the way they talked about their work so they wouldn’t draw Trump’s attention.

“I remember at that time it was like, we have to change. We can’t say ‘atmospheric climate science’ anymore, we have to say ‘earth sciences,’ because it was just one of those language things that if you said climate science or anything about climate you are in danger of getting your funding cut,” she said.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1092-2048x1715.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 08:02:36.172964

“The last four years have seen significant inflation in all areas, but especially energy prices,” said Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovation.
“Low-income families already hadn’t recovered from the pandemic and now all the major utilities are coming back for a rate increase,” said McGowan.
Not only did SEACAP offer direct assistance on her utility bills, cutting them in half, but it also connected Ross with incentives to improve the house’s efficiency.
“We know that families struggling to pay their utility bills will result in more evictions, more hospitalizations and more heat-related deaths.”","The residents of Lake Havasu City, near Arizona’s western border, knew their electricity bills would go up.

Their utility — UniSource — had gotten approval from state regulators for its first rate increase in seven years to take effect in 2024. The projected $14 monthly bump was designed to cover the much-needed cost of upgrading infrastructure and building a cleaner grid to deliver more power to more people in increasingly hot summers.

But when residents started seeing triple-digit increases on their summertime bills, Mayor Cal Sheehy thought there must be a problem. A movie theater’s $12,500 bill for just one month of power made the front page of the local newspaper.

“We have some of our citizens who are making choices between paying utility bills and buying groceries and medications,” said Sheehy, who has served in the nonpartisan office since 2018.

Those hefty bills — which UniSource has said reflects seasonality and how individuals use electricity, not improper rates — have captured the attention of state officials, including the attorney general. But they’re just one example of an issue that’s become a political flashpoint in Arizona. Across the state, residents complain of high electricity prices, and the state has seen dozens of reports of people who have died in their homes because they either turned off air conditioning or set it to a dangerously high temperature to avoid expensive bills.

It’s not likely to abate any time soon. The GOP megalaw signed by President Donald Trump last month is forecast to raise electricity prices by slashing development of new, low-cost wind and solar power and instead keeping aging coal and gas plants open.

The true effects won’t be known for years and will vary across the country, but an analysis by Princeton University estimates that annual energy costs could increase an average of $165 per household by 2030 and $280 by 2035. Separate estimates by Energy Innovation forecast a 25 percent increase in wholesale electricity prices by 2030 compared to current policies, resulting in household electricity rates that are between 9 and 18 percent higher by 2035.

“The last four years have seen significant inflation in all areas, but especially energy prices,” said Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovation. “In a world without this bill, we’d see more new technology come onto the grid and make it more efficient to reel back in some of that inflation. But instead, we’ve got a bill where you strangle and restrict the technologies of the future.”

“One way to look at this bill is that it’s inflationary in that it increases the cost of producing power for utilities and the utilities pass that on to you and me and the industries that want to invest,” he added.

In Arizona, cutting clean energy taxes could result in a 12.7 percent increase in electricity bills to households and 4.7 percent to businesses between 2026 and 2032, according to a report from NERA Economic Consulting released by the Clean Energy Buyers Association. That report, which was done before the final OBBBA language was released, found that the result would be a $340 annual loss in household income for Arizonans.

The state represents much of what ails the nation’s electric grid. A surge of data centers and manufacturing plants is driving up industrial demand. Homeowners are cranking up air conditioning to deal with increasingly hot summers where temperatures regularly sit in the triple digits. And the region’s aging coal plants — like the Navajo Generating Station and the massive Cholla Power Plant — are closing as they become too costly to retrofit, requiring new generation to be built.

Already the state’s largest electric utilities set peak demand records this summer. Arizona Public Service, the largest utility, says it could see peak demand jump 60 percent by 2038.

“The question is who pays for all that growth and whether it’s possible to build that much generation in such a short period of time,” said Amanda Ormond, a former director of the Arizona Energy Office and energy consultant. “And now this bill kneecaps the clean energy industry. And what’s stunning to me is what an ideologically blind move this is.”

Political potency

As Democrats and environmental groups try to exploit the politics of the tax and spending law, electricity prices have emerged as a potent line of attack. Ad campaigns from groups like Clean Energy for America, Protect Our Jobs and Climate Power have all highlighted the issue. A new ad from the League of Conservation Voters and House Majority Forward, a progressive PAC, is running in the Arizona district of Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani, accusing him of “creating a massive rate hike on electricity.”

During his presidential campaign, Trump used rising energy prices to make his case against the Biden administration and even vowed to halve bills within his first year. But prices have continued to rise. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said this spring that retail electricity prices are set to rise faster than inflation through 2026, following a 13 percent increase between 2022 and 2025. That projection came before the megalaw vote.

So far in 2025, utilities nationally have requested roughly $29 billion in total rate increases, already more than was requested in all of 2024, according to a report from nonprofit PowerLines.

The reasons behind rate increases differ from region to region. Some may be for infrastructure repair, others for wildfire protection and others to handle spikes in fuel prices. Arizona utilities have attributed much of their costs to massive load growth.

Between 2012 and 2023, the average price of electricity in the state has risen 24 percent, according to data from the EIA and, as of 2023, is higher than in 31 other states.

Customers of two of the state’s largest electric utilities are set to see steeper hikes even without the influence of the OBBBA. Arizona Public Service is asking state regulators to approve a 14 percent rate increase — about $20 per customer — to pay for rising demand. Tucson Electric Power is also seeking a 14 percent increase, which it says would add about $16 per month.

The state’s utility regulatory board has also approved a so-called formula rate calculation for regulated utilities that could allow them to request annual rate increases rather than waiting every few years for a new rate case.

APS spokesperson Michael Philipsen said in an email that it was too early to say how the OBBA would affect future rates. No planned projects, he said, have yet been canceled and that the company will continue to “select the lowest cost, best-fit resources to meet the growing energy needs of our customers.” At this time, he said, there was no indication of whether customer prices would be affected by the tax law changes.

Joe Barrios, a spokesperson for UniSource, said similarly that there was no indication yet of how the bill would affect future rates. The company, he said, has no immediate plans to increase rates.

Barrios also said that residents of Lake Havasu City have used less energy this summer, resulting in lower bills. The average bill in the city in June was $251.78, down from $277.66 the year prior.

Ormond said that affordability and reliability can only come through building more renewables, since they are essentially free to run and can come online faster than a new gas plant. Studies have shown that wind and solar paired with battery storage is increasingly cost competitive with a new gas plant.

“When you put a wind solar and battery plant together on the grid, you know exactly what the price is going to be for the life of that project,” Ormond said. “If you put a power plant with a fuel source on the system, that’s not stable and that can show up in people’s rates.”

The White House has placed the blame for electricity prices on Democrats’ pro-renewables policies and said that the president’s policies promoting oil and gas production would help bring down costs.

“Since Day One, President Trump has taken decisive steps to unleash American energy, which has driven oil production and reduced the cost of energy,” said spokesperson Taylor Rogers. “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill will turbocharge energy production by streamlining operations for maximum efficiency and expanding domestic production capacity, which will deliver further relief to American families and businesses.”

According to the Arizona Commerce Authority, a public-private business development group, IRA tax credits contributed to 134 project leads in the state for a total of $58 billion in existing and potential clean energy investments. The state is in the midst of a renewable energy boom, with Arizona installing the sixth most new solar last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. In 2024, renewable energy provided about 20 percent of the state’s electricity.

Whether the megalaw will affect that development remains to be seen. But Kelly McGowan, who leads a state nonprofit that distributes federal utility assistance funds, said that the potential drop in clean energy comes at a fraught time, with utility bills rising and looming cuts to the social safety net.

“Low-income families already hadn’t recovered from the pandemic and now all the major utilities are coming back for a rate increase,” said McGowan.

Making ends meet

Shirley Ross and her husband moved to Pearce, Arizona — an unincorporated community in the southeastern part of the state — in 2010 to find a lower cost of living than their longtime California lifestyle. They had enough to buy the house “in the middle of nowhere,” Ross said, but with just one Social Security check coming in a month, even that was a struggle.

So when she saw a flyer attached to her utility bill for the Southeastern Arizona Community Action Program (SEACAP) advertising ways to spend less on electricity and heating, she jumped at the chance. Not only did SEACAP offer direct assistance on her utility bills, cutting them in half, but it also connected Ross with incentives to improve the house’s efficiency.

Gone was the avocado-green refrigerator that dated to the ’70s. Contractors put insulation in the attic and closed up leaky windows. The heater and air conditioner were upgraded, a necessity in an area where the lows can be in the teens and the highs can top 110 degrees.

Ross’ monthly utilities have risen from about $100 when they first moved to around $200, in part because her husband is now running an oxygen machine full time. Without the upgrades, Ross says she knows she’d be paying much more.

“We would have made it work. I’m too stubborn not to do it,” Ross said. “But I know we wouldn’t be eating as well as we do.”

But now federal programs that helped people make similar improvements are also on the chopping block after passage of the OBBBA. Tax credits designed to cover up to 30 percent of upgrades for energy efficiency improvements and credits to help offset the cost of clean energy systems, battery storage or heat pumps are set to expire at the end of 2025.

McGowan’s group, Wildfire, is also keeping a close eye on the status of LIHEAP, the federal assistance program for low-income households. The program has been hit by staffing cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget proposal would eliminate its funding entirely.

That means Wildfire and similar groups are in wait-and-see mode, hoping they can continue their work in what McGowan says is becoming a life and death situation.

“We’re putting families in a position where they’re choosing between paying for electricity, food or housing with no backstop,” she said. “We know that families struggling to pay their utility bills will result in more evictions, more hospitalizations and more heat-related deaths.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/5b/37/111388764efda9ee025f61455ea4/hot-weather-climate-blame-22452.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 08:02:41.896284

That’s because the law increased tax incentives for using captured carbon dioxide to squeeze more crude out of sputtering oil wells or to create low-carbon products like sustainable aviation fuel. When it comes to capturing carbon and using it to extract more oil, Occidental is the industry leader, according to energy analysts and drilling data.

“Since they are the pacesetter, they are the ones best positioned to take advantage of an enhanced tax credit,” Skip York, an energy fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute think tank, said of the company.

The megalaw’s increased subsidies for Occidental and other drillers come amid a broader push by Trump and congressional Republicans to rebalance U.S. energy markets to favor fossil fuels over renewable sources of power. That has included easing environmental permitting bottlenecks for drillers while adding red tape for wind and solar projects. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act also includes a $1 billion fund to subsidize oil, gas and coal developments — a generous provision that surprised even some of the GOP lawmakers who voted for it.

The expanded carbon capture subsidy was one of the only provisions intended to limit climate change that survived in the Trump-led rewrite of the tax code. But the megalaw has shifted the focus of the subsidy from reducing carbon emissions toward encouraging additional production of oil, raising questions about whether the changes could fuel further warming. The tax tweaks could also promote the development of environmentally friendly CO2-based goods, such as green concrete.

Either way, Occidental stands to benefit due to its sprawling network of carbon dioxide processing facilities, pipelines and injection wells. The company already uses that system to squeeze additional crude from wells that have seen declining oil production.

It operated over 3,200 CO2 injection wells in 2022 — the most in the U.S. — according to a report published last year by the industry consulting firm Advanced Resources International. That represented 37 percent of all injection wells, or four times as many as its closest competitor, Kinder Morgan. Injection wells are used to pump carbon dioxide into underground oil fields, in order to force the crude to the surface through nearby production wells.

Occidental has also made several investments in carbon reuse startups and is the first oil company to begin building a direct air capture facility to pull CO2 from the sky. Those investments give the Houston-based driller other ways to cash in on the tax code revisions.

Prior to the megalaw’s passage, companies could collect subsidies of $60, $85, $130 or $180 per metric ton of CO2, depending on whether the carbon was captured from an industrial facility or the atmosphere, and whether the gas was used or stored. The lowest payments went for climate pollution scrubbed from smokestacks and converted into carbon-based products or stored via enhanced oil recovery injection wells. The highest were for tons that were removed from the sky by direct air capture plants, which use absorbent materials to suck CO2 from the air, and permanently store the gas in saline aquifers or other geologic formations.

Trump’s tax law increased and simplified the climate subsidy for new projects. Now all carbon trapped by industrial emitters is worth $85 per ton and all CO2 extracted by direct air capture plants is worth $180 — regardless of whether it’s injected into depleted oil fields, stored in rock or used to make carbon-based products.

How the megabill benefits Occidental

The changes mean that any enhanced oil recovery projects that have started up since Trump enacted the megalaw will generate at least $25 more for each ton of captured carbon than they would have before the bill was signed.

That’s good news for Occidental and other companies that specialize in enhanced oil recovery operations. Whether the climate will also benefit from the change is less clear, experts say.

“Valuing the [enhanced oil recovery] equally with storage could divert more investment into those companies doing EOR and less from the companies doing pure storage,” said Anna Littlefield, a former Occidental geologist who is now the carbon capture program manager at the Colorado School of Mines. “In the end, that could equate to less CO2 stored.”

Occidental didn’t respond to questions about how the tax tweak will affect the climate, the company’s investment strategy, and the extent of its lobbying on the provision, known as 45Q because of its place in the tax code.

“We are pleased that President Trump and Congress preserved and expanded 45Q to encourage the development of direct air capture technology that will secure US energy independence and grow American industry,” Occidental spokesperson William Fitzgerald said in an email. “Just as the shale revolution transformed US production, using CO2 from DAC for EOR is the best proven technology available to protect America’s energy security and lead to US energy dominance.”

The 45Q tax credit is a historically bipartisan carbon capture subsidy that was established in 2008 by then-President George W. Bush. This is the third time it’s been expanded. The other instances occurred during Trump’s first term and during the Biden administration.

The latest changes could lead Occidental to pursue more enhanced oil recovery developments, according to Baker Institute’s York, who is also the chief energy strategist at the consulting firm Turner, Mason & Co.

“The places that were economic at $60 a ton, they can get bigger,” he said, referring to oil fields that already have CO2 pipelines and other infrastructure that can be easily expanded.

The tax tweak also “opens up those places where the economics weren’t attractive at 60 [dollars per ton] but are attractive at 85,” York said. The main question is “how much bigger is that opportunity set for them now than it was?”

The subsidy boost for alternate uses of captured carbon would also give Occidental new ways to profit from Stratos, according to the Carbon Capture Coalition, an advocacy group that includes the oil company. The facility is set to become the world’s largest direct air capture plant when it begins operations in West Texas later this year.

When Occidental began building Stratos in 2023, the company expected that the only way it could collect $180 for each ton of CO2 the plant captured was if it stored the gas in a saline aquifer. But because the massive project didn’t come online before the megalaw’s passage, it will be able to generate the same level of subsidies if the company decides to instead divert the CO2 into its Permian Basin oil fields.

“It gives them additional optionality at the outset,” said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, referring to the 500,000 tons of CO2 per year that Stratos is designed to collect. What Occidental does with all that climate pollution “is just going to come down to project economics,” she said.

Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub told financial analysts in May that the company views direct air capture plants primarily as components of its petroleum production efforts.

“We’re building our DAC business toward a business that will use CO2 for enhanced oil recovery to get more oil out of the existing reservoirs that we have here in the United States to help extend our energy independence,” Hollub said during an earnings call. Carbon removal “credits will continue, I believe, to help us build the bridge between now and making the EOR realizations happen over time.”

Oil lobbying preceded tax changes

The tax tweak came after Occidental and other drillers unleashed a wave of political spending to help Republican candidates in the 2024 elections.

It also followed a lobbying push by small oil producers in the home state of Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), according to the Carbon Capture Coalition, which was previously known as the National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative. The coalition said it urged lawmakers to preserve the climate subsidy on behalf of its members, which include environmental groups as well as oil companies.

During the 2024 presidential race, Hollub was one of roughly two dozen oil CEOs who last April attended a dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, where he promised to slash environmental rules in exchange for $1 billion in contributions from the industry. The following month, Hollub co-hosted a fundraiser for Trump where she planned to press him to maintain tax credits for carbon capture, Reuters reported at the time. It is unclear whether she made the request.

After Trump won, Occidental gave $1 million to his inaugural committee, Federal Election Commission data shows. Chevron was the only oil company that gave more to the committee than Occidental.

The company also gave over $7 million to groups supporting Republican congressional candidates in the 2024 cycle, according to donation records analyzed by the transparency group OpenSecrets. Occidental didn’t directly donate to Democratic groups in 2023 or last year, although its political action committee gave $32,500 to Democratic candidates over the same period — about 14 percent of the PAC’s total giving during that time.

After returning to office, Trump followed through on his deregulatory vow — even though the oil industry only managed to raise about a quarter of a billion dollars for his campaign. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Although the president and Congress rewrote the tax code in a way that favors the oil industry, the changes could still have positive environmental effects, according to some analysts.

“Whether you like the place that we’re in politically or not, I can see upsides to the U.S. doing a really good job at figuring out carbon capture technology and learning how to drive the cost of that down over time,” said Sheila Olmstead, former economic adviser to then-President Barack Obama who is now an environmental policy professor at Cornell University. “Think of it as a small silver lining, rather than the best outcome.”

“I think the prior board of adjustment (and) board of supervisors definitely did not help us.","TOLEDO — Last Monday morning’s Tama County Board of Supervisors meeting saw a pivotal turn in the epic wind turbine saga. After years of fighting, litigation, and back-and-forth, the supervisors agreed to enter into a settlement agreement with Salt Creek Wind LLC that will allow their project to move forward without further litigation. Although the white flag was agreed to be waved, it was done reluctantly, and not without thought and contemplation.

During public comment, several members of the public spoke both in favor of settlement and of holding off. Former Zoning Commission member Craig Sash said the settlement should be passed, and that this issue “needs to be put to bed.” Zoning Administrator Laura Wilson asked for the settlement to be tabled as she was concerned about its wording and how it would affect the county and her duties.

When the supervisors spoke of their opinions on the settlement, Heather Knebel spoke first, stating that she agreed that the settlement should be tabled so that the wording could be tweaked.

“The prior board of supervisors are the reason we are in this situation. I do think we had a good case. I think the Supreme Court would be a different answer, obviously the prior board left us out of money in our general basic fund, we literally need money to be able to go forward as a county. So that’s definitely disappointing,” she said. “I think the prior board of adjustment (and) board of supervisors definitely did not help us. They did not look at the ordinances; they did not do their due diligence. That’s why we’re in this situation.”

Supervisor Curt Hilmer also let his opinions be known.

“I just want to let my district know that, with this being worded right, I’ll be voting yes. Not because I agree with anything from the top to the bottom, way back to Al Gore, this was a scam,” There is no such thing as clean energy, especially in industrial. Um, I just have to, I cringe every time I hear ‘good faith’ because these companies are big enough where they don’t care about anything else but the money,” he said. “It’s hard to have good faith with somebody that knows they’re gonna get a 50/50 chance at losing at (the) Supreme Court to them pile four or five lawsuits on you, knowing you don’t have the money to pay. I mean how corrupt is that? And how corrupt is the world because (of) this clean energy all the way from the Biden administration down to here?”

Supervisor Chairman Mark Doland spoke about some of the issues brought up by the public. “The questions that Laura had put out there, none of those have been; all of them had been addressed. There’s nothing she’s raised that hasn’t already been thought of and been sent through our attorneys,” he said.

Doland went on to clarify that this settlement only applies to phase one. Both Supervisor Curt Kupka and Hilmer made a point during their comment time to convey their thanks to Doland and Supervisor David Turner for negotiating the settlement.

The settlement agreement lists concessions from both parties, with the biggest point being $1.2 million that Salt Creek Wind LLC will pay Tama County in two $600,000 installments — one within five days of SCW delivering the certificate of completion to the county for the first turbine and the second upon the beginning of commercial operations or on Dec. 31, 2026, whichever is earlier. It also stipulates that “any future commercial wind energy conversion project in Tama County, which includes any commercial wind project other than Phase 1 of the Project, will be subject to all ordinances then in place at the time of any such future application for conditional use permits or zoning certificates.”

The settlement went to a vote, and all five supervisors voted yes. They also approved directing counsel to execute the withdrawal of the revocation petition and the joint dismissal.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.timesrepublican.com/images/2025/08/03213016/Copy-of-1-690x840.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 08:02:46.350577

— Jonathan Bass, Chairman & CEO

METAIRIE, LA, UNITED STATES, August 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In an energy industry often criticized for lofty promises and transient commitments, Argent LNG is taking a stand—and taking action. By initiating early development with Galliano-based Grand Isle Shipyard (GIS), Argent isn’t just talking about local investment—it’s leading with it.

This first move signals a broader philosophy: Argent LNG’s “Louisiana First” procurement approach is more than policy—it’s the foundation of how the company plans to build a 25 MTPA world-scale LNG export terminal in Port Fourchon, deliver on time and budget, and help restore confidence in large energy project execution.

Rethinking Risk, Starting with Local Wisdom

In contrast to other mega-projects that often rely on out-of-state or international contractors unfamiliar with Louisiana’s unique industrial and environmental landscape, Argent LNG is investing in companies who live and work in the region. The difference is more than symbolic—it’s strategic.

“Everyone talks about supporting local communities—but Argent LNG is doing it in a way that matters,” said Jonathan Bass, Chairman & CEO of Argent LNG. “Our choice to begin development with GIS, one of the Gulf Coast’s most capable and trusted engineering and construction firms, proves that we’re not just checking boxes. These are partners who’ve weathered hurricanes, built through supply chain crunches, and know the regulators and terrain. That experience reduces risk—and raises our confidence.”

Why “Louisiana First” Is the Right Strategy

Louisiana has one of the most sophisticated industrial labor forces and energy supply chains in the world. Yet far too often, companies parachute in with outside contractors unfamiliar with the coastal terrain, environmental nuances, and regulatory complexity. That inexperience often results in:

Change orders and permitting delays

Misunderstandings with local officials

Workforce friction and low community trust

Schedule and cost overruns

Argent LNG is taking a different path—prioritizing Louisiana contractors who:

Possess decades of proven performance in the region

Employ local talent and grow in-state capabilities

Understand the unique demands of building in hurricane-prone, environmentally sensitive areas

Bring deep relationships with state agencies and regulators

Economic Multiplier for Louisiana

By anchoring its project to Louisiana’s energy ecosystem, Argent LNG is setting up a powerful ripple effect for the state’s economy. The project is expected to:

Create thousands of high-paying jobs across fabrication, logistics, construction, and professional services

Support small and medium-sized businesses through subcontracting and supplier agreements

Facilitate local workforce training and vocational education programs

Generate long-term economic resilience in coastal parishes long tied to the energy sector

“This is about more than just a plant—it’s about building opportunity for generations of Louisiana families,” added Bass. “Working with partners like GIS is how we create real value for the community and de-risk one of the most ambitious LNG projects in the hemisphere.”

Built to Deliver and Ready for the Future

Argent LNG’s 25 MTPA export facility is scheduled to break ground in 2027, with first LNG deliveries targeted for 2030. Designed around modular liquefaction technology and best-in-class environmental performance, the project is also exploring integration with carbon capture, storage, and hydrogen modules to stay competitive in a low-carbon global energy future.

And while global headlines are dominated by supply shocks and geopolitics, Argent is focused on resilience: building a reliable, secure U.S. LNG supply chain anchored in local talent and trust.

We call it road-tripping. But in 2025, that frontier looks a little different, quieter, smoother.

And while the future may not smell like 93 octane and scorched brake pads, it’s got its own rhythm, especially for the brave who venture beyond city limits for the first time. Like Joshua Huber, who swapped his lifted 2010 GMC Sierra 4x4 for a 2025 Chevy Equinox EV LT and set off on a 748-mile maiden electric voyage.

""First-ever EV road trip for beginner EVer.

2025 Equinox EV LT FWD vs. 2010 GMC Sierra 4x4 on 33s.

748 miles total, 79 mph avg or so, using Tesla and Electrify America high-speed chargers mostly. The EV was $0.136 per mile. Having previously taken this trip in my truck, I know it would cost something like $0.31 per mile in gas, so already be less than half the fuel cost.

Not to mention, the EQ EV is much more fun to drive, rides and handles so nicely, and is so much quieter.

The trip home did take me an extra 1.5 hours or so of charging (really bad headwind), but I needed some naps and breaks and dinner anyway.

I was impressed with the Tesla chargers, though. From 20–40%, they ran 155 kW, and from 40–80%, about 100 kW, blew the doors off the Electrify America ""350 kW"" chargers. At 2 out of 3 stops at EA, I had to use the credit card reader because the app wouldn’t work. I would be upset if I were a paying member. The Tesla app worked every time, no hassle, and charged way faster than EA.

I also stopped at some EV Connect stations, but every single one was out of order.

I also mooched some free charging at a Chevrolet dealership; they have several chargers free for anyone to use.

I was impressed by how accurate the Google Maps estimates were. It was within 5% every time and even gave me warnings if I tried to go too far without charging. Also, the automatic battery preconditioning before approaching the charge location, so cool.

The only problem with it was that it wouldn't send me to Tesla chargers, even though I have a NACS adapter… so I had to look those up manually.

Oh, btw, at the Tesla chargers, many Tesla fanboys were checking out my car and were impressed, not that that really matters.""

You can almost hear the enthusiasm bleeding through his keyboard, a mix of relief, triumph, and genuine awe. Huber’s post wasn’t just about cost-per-mile or charging speeds. It was about crossing a psychological Rubicon. This was his first EV road trip, and unlike the V8-fueled confidence of his old Sierra, there was no roaring engine to reassure him. Instead, he was armed with a Chevy-branded Google Maps integration, a NACS adapter, and a willingness to roll the dice on America’s still-maturing EV charging patchwork.

2025 Chevy Equinox EV Range, Specifications, and Fun Facts

Range is 319 miles on front-wheel-drive models and 307 miles on available all-wheel-drive variants, giving you confidence for both daily commutes and longer road trips

A single-motor FWD setup delivers 220 hp and 242 lb-ft of torque, while the dual-motor AWD system bumps output to 300 hp and 348 lb-ft for brisk acceleration

The FWD model achieves 117 MPGe city, 99 MPGe highway, and 108 MPGe combined, helping to minimize “fuel” costs and maximize your range per charge

It sports a class-leading 17.7-inch diagonal touchscreen, up to 57.2 cu ft of cargo space, and qualifies for the full $7,500 federal tax credit (through 9/30), making it one of the best value propositions in the EV market

From a numbers standpoint, he came out well ahead.

According to his logs, the Equinox EV averaged $0.136 per mile on electricity, compared to $0.31 per mile when doing the same trip in his gas-guzzling Sierra. Charging sessions revealed Tesla’s consistent performance: 27.7 kWh added in just 13 minutes, another 32.3 kWh in 21 minutes, and peak rates up to 155kW from 20–40% state-of-charge.

Meanwhile, Electrify America, ostensibly offering 350kW capability, averaged slower speeds and more frustration. As Huber noted, two out of three EA stops required him to use the credit card reader because the app wouldn’t connect. The app failures didn’t affect his bottom line much; one EA session cost $23.23 for 48.4 kWh, but they did cost him time and trust.

This contrast between Tesla and everyone else is no longer anecdotal. It’s becoming industry folklore. A commenter on ChevyBolt.org put it plainly:

“I now only use Tesla SC’s, they usually run about 50% less cost-wise, they work, and there are plenty of them.”

Huber’s journey adds another brick to that wall. It’s not just about speed, it’s about certainty.

What Makes The 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV Special

You plug in, it works, you move on. That kind of reliability is the difference between a road trip and a roadside headache. Tesla has spent over a decade refining the experience; the rest of the industry is still playing catch-up, especially when even dealership employees admit,

“This is the first EQ EV I’ve ridden in.”

And then there’s the tech stack. One of the subtler, smarter moments in Huber’s trip was the Equinox’s automatic battery preconditioning.

The vehicle readied itself for high-speed charging as it approached a known station, an efficiency trick that enthusiasts love and casual drivers won’t even realize is happening. It’s exactly the kind of thoughtful integration that’ll keep GM in the EV race.

But the moment you throw a NACS adapter into the mix and Google Maps refuses to show Tesla Superchargers, the user experience breaks down. Joshua had to manually search for chargers he was fully compatible with. That’s not user error, that’s system-level friction.

Dealership charging turned out to be a quiet ace in the hole. He found a Chevrolet store with free Level 2s and topped off his Chevrolet Equinox EV for nothing. GM’s dealer EV certification program has placed chargers across the country, but access policies vary wildly. Some stations are open 24/7; others are locked behind service hours and glass doors. Until there’s standardization, it remains a helpful but unreliable resource.

2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV Charge Time

The standard 11.5 kW onboard charger replenishes about 34 miles of range per hour, allowing a full 0–100% charge in roughly 8 hours, perfect for overnight top-ups

Higher trims offer a 19.2 kW Level 2 charger that can add up to 51 miles of range per hour when paired with a compatible home or public Level 2 station

With up to 150 kW capability, you can recover approximately 70–77 miles of range in just 10 minutes, making quick stops on long journeys highly practical

Tests show an average DC fast-charge rate of 94 kW, taking about 51 minutes to go from 10% to 90% state-of-charge, striking a balance between speed and battery longevity

Despite the charging hiccups and headwinds (literal and metaphorical), Huber didn’t sound defeated. He sounded energized.

“I needed some naps and breaks and dinner anyway,”

A road trip isn’t just about getting there. It’s about everything in between. And this time, it happened with fewer emissions, lower fuel costs, and a vehicle that didn’t rattle his fillings or drink like a frat boy on spring break.

His Chevy Equinox EV wasn’t perfect. Neither was the charging infrastructure. But taken together, and with a bit of grit, it worked. And that’s the biggest takeaway. EV road-tripping isn’t just possible. It’s already here. It’s just waiting for more of us to take the wheel.

The project, backed by Brazil’s leading energy company Petrobras, will deliver clients a credible, locally aligned pathway to accelerate climate action and support industry decarbonisation goals.

This strategic addition to ATPI Halo, the company’s proprietary carbon measurement and offset platform, is made possible through a partnership with Respira International, a leading provider of high-quality, certified CO2 offset projects. The Envira REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) initiative is independently rated BBB by BeZero Carbon, one of the highest available scores in the voluntary carbon market, and holds Triple Gold certification from the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards (CCB).

Petrobras’ investment included the remaining volume from Envira carbon’s carbon credit issuances for 2020, along with a commitment of up to $120 million to strengthen Brazil’s carbon market. This project highlights the growing momentum within the industry for sustainable investment strategies that generate both environmental and community impact. The project has also received backing from both Netflix and Lavazza.

Located in Brazil’s Acre state along the Envira River, the initiative protects over 39,000 hectares of tropical rainforest – a region under pressure from cattle ranching, infrastructure expansion, and slash-and-burn agriculture. It not only preserves one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet but also delivers long-term benefits to local communities through sustainable development and local governance, making it a high-impact, science-based solution for organisations seeking to offset hard-to-abate emissions.

With an indicative 2025 carbon credit price of US$12 per tonne, it provides an affordable, transparent offsetting option for energy companies and supply chain partners aiming to advance net-zero targets.

As the newest addition to ATPI Halo’s global carbon compensation portfolio, this initiative joins a suite of forestry and rehabilitation-based projects across Africa, Asia, Central America, and Europe. To date, ATPI Halo has sold 50,000+ carbon credits equivalent to offsetting 50k/tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to the emissions from driving a gasoline car 250 million miles, or the energy required to power 9,870 homes for a year.

Commenting on the new initiative, director of ATPI Halo, Pippa Ganderton, said: “This is exactly the kind of project our clients have been asking for – credible, high-integrity solutions that deliver tangible environmental and social value. The addition of the Envira REDD+ initiative is especially meaningful for our client base with operations in South America, offering a powerful way to give back to those local communities. It not only supports biodiversity in the Amazon but also drives sustainable livelihoods and aligns with the growing emphasis on ESG performance across the industry.”

The addition of the Envira REDD+ project marks another significant step in ATPI’s ongoing mission to provide energy sector clients and beyond with practical, effective sustainability tools, empowering organisations to manage travel-related emissions while contributing to long-term, environmental and social progress.",https://www.c-mw.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ATPI-expands-portfolio-with-Brazil-based-REDD-offset-project.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 07:04:26.589133

Driving the news: Exus recently completed over $158 million in financing to upgrade the Twin Ridges wind farm in Somerset County with more modern wind-power equipment and to invest in the Patton wind farm in Cambria County.

By the numbers: With an upgrade, Twin Ridges could produce 170 megawatts of electricity, about a 30% increase over its current capacity, said Exus North America president and CEO Jim Spencer.

That would generate 150 local construction jobs, per Spencer.

What they're saying: Exus' funding for upgrades on this wind project and other renewable energy projects across the country was driven by data centers, said Spencer.

""We work in Pennsylvania, and we work across North America. The appetite and demand we are seeing from data centers is not abating,"" he said.

Friction point: Trump said at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at CMU last month that AI ""won't be powered by wind, because it doesn't work,"" saying the power source is intermittent and ""causes a lot of problems.""

Trump's administration has been more bullish on natural gas, nuclear and even coal as a fuel source for increased energy consumption.

Zoom out: The U.S. added 2.1 gigawatts of new wind capacity in the first quarter of 2025, a significant increase from Q1 2024, per Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association, reports Axios' Ben German.

Zoom in: Exus is also looking at adding new wind farms in Elk, Northumberland and Columbia counties in Central Pennsylvania as energy demand jumps, said Spencer.

Between the lines: A proposal to build a natural gas plant in Indiana County to power data centers could generate 4.5 gigawatts of electricity, which would make it the largest gas-fired plant in the nation.

Some of the fastest-growing solar sectors in the US are located in the east and Midwest, where the heat dome remained for several days.
“Traditional day-ahead generation forecast data based on basic solar irradiance and meteorological data are no longer sufficient on their own,” argued Giridaran Srinivasan, Solargis CEO for the Americas.
The forecast does not take into account the impacts of extreme weather events, such as the July heat dome.
Solargis pointed to states with more robust storage sectors, such as Texas, as ones well-suited to endure these kinds of climactic disruptions to solar power generation.","Figures from the Northeast Regional Climate Center demonstrate the extremity of this anomaly in the north-east, noting that July 2025 was among the hottest months ever recorded for 28 of the 35 “major climate sites” in the region, with Hartford, Connecticut, and Albany, New York, reporting their hottest months since records began.

These extreme weather events can significantly affect the operation of a solar project. While much of the discussion in the US has focused on hailstorms – figures from kWh Analytics show that hail is responsible for over 70% of US solar projects’ financial losses – extremely high temperatures can also pose a threat, as they can lead to module temperature derating, reducing energy output.

Some of the fastest-growing solar sectors in the US are located in the east and Midwest, where the heat dome remained for several days. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Florida, Illinois, Ohio, New York state and Indiana were all ranked in the top ten for new capacity additions in 2024, and by the end of 2024, both Florida and North Carolina were among the top five states for total cumulative operating capacity.

As a result, the extreme heat had a significant impact on power generation in these areas, affecting power prices and price forecasting for asset managers in these states. Solargis reports that, on 24 June, real-time power prices in the NYISO and MISO grids surged above US$2,000/MWh, more than quadruple the day-ahead prices.

“Traditional day-ahead generation forecast data based on basic solar irradiance and meteorological data are no longer sufficient on their own,” argued Giridaran Srinivasan, Solargis CEO for the Americas. His comments echo words from global Solargis CEO Marcel Suri, who has written for PV Tech in the past about the need to move away from day-ahead power price forecasting in order to improve the accuracy of power price assessments, as climate change increases the frequency of extreme weather events.

“What’s needed is a more integrated view that accounts for not just solar resource variability, but also ambient temperature fluctuations, aging asset performance and the historical patterns of market price volatility,” added Srinivasan.

Texas’ robust storage sector provides resilience

Solargis suggested that variations in power generation and price had a more significant impact on areas that are not “storage-rich regions”, where battery energy storage systems (BESS) can provide grid-balancing services and help mitigate the impacts of extreme weather.

For instance, Midwest state Illinois added the fourth-most solar capacity in 2024, but a report published by the Clean Grid Alliance last year found that the state could require 8.5-15GW of new BESS capacity to effectively manage an energy mix that is increasingly reliant on renewable power. The forecast does not take into account the impacts of extreme weather events, such as the July heat dome.

Solargis pointed to states with more robust storage sectors, such as Texas, as ones well-suited to endure these kinds of climactic disruptions to solar power generation. The company notes that Texas now has nearly 7.5GW of storage capacity in operation, and according to the 2025 Federal Summer Reliability Assessment, the ERCOT grid, which manages 90% of Texas’ electricity, had a risk of declaring an ‘energy emergency event’ of just 3%.

This figure is significantly down from the 15% risk seen in summer 2024, and suggests that more installed storage capacity can provide the flexibility necessary to mitigate the impact of disruptions to the power grid, such as overgeneration of electricity that can cause curtailment, or less generation than expected due to weather impeding the efficacy of solar modules.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sb-energy.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 08:04:04.465780

“[This administration] has withheld funds that we have appropriated, they have canceled programs that we have established, they have closed offices that we have created, and they have pursued policies that we have never approved,” said Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said during a markup last week of Interior and Energy department nominees.

“Until this administration respects the will of Congress, I am unable to support these nominees,” said Heinrich, who did vote Friday to confirm Fish and Wildlife Service pick Brian Nesvik.

The Democratic rebellion could spill into the upcoming confirmations of NRC nominee Ho Nieh and FERC picks Laura Swett and David LaCerte.

Republicans can still muscle the nominees through like they have done numerous times since January. But the animosity could diminish the chances for the candidates to move quickly and with broad support.

Nieh, a utility executive who has worked at NRC, is widely seen as qualified. But qualifications didn’t get Democrats to support David Wright’s successful bid last week to rejoin the commission.

Senate Environment and Public Works Sheldon Whitehouse ranking member (D-R.I.) changed his mind against Wright because of administration involvement at NRC. He said the same could happen with Nieh.

“I am not ruling out my support for him, but that depends on whether the independence of the NRC is respected or if it continues to be infiltrated by DOGE boys,” Whitehouse said, referring to the Department of Government Efficiency.

Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) said he voted against Audrey Robertson in committee to lead DOE’s renewable energy office because of frustration with the administration.

“Robertson is eminently qualified, but we had so much push from constituents in Colorado on recent Trump administration nominees and actions,” Hickenlooper said.

Hickenlooper did not rule out that Democrats would similarly vote against FERC chair nominee Swett and LaCerte, saying that decision “still needs to be made.”

Swett is a well-known energy attorney. LaCerte may prove more contentious because of his lack of a deep background in energy policy.

Heinrich’s has also expressed concern about the independence of FERC, telling POLITICO recently that “we should be very careful about not turning a regulatory body into a political body.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/45/83/9a65518e485b9c873e33d3d9e937/20191227-ferc-shinkle-773.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 07:03:06.795589

“We don’t need to wait on the federal government to make progress on the clean energy future that our state leaders have committed to.”","Gov. Jared Polis wants Colorado to fast-track deployment of new clean energy projects before Republicans’ rollback of billions of dollars in incentives takes effect.

In an executive order signed Friday, Polis directed state agencies to take a variety of steps to “eliminate administrative barriers and bottlenecks for renewable projects,” citing a “time-limited window for procurement of tax-advantaged wind and solar” before Biden-era credits and rebates are phased out by the congressional GOP’s recent domestic policy bill.

“Today we are taking action to ensure that Coloradans can easily access clean energy savings, especially ones that expire soon,” Polis said. “We continue to do all we can to make people aware of how you can reduce costs on energy bills and keep money in your pocket.”

The state’s goal, Polis’ order says, is to “integrate maximal clean energy by securing as much cost-effective electric generation under construction or placed in service as soon as possible.” That could include expedited reviews of new projects by the Public Utilities Commission and invoking the agency’s authority to override local permit denials, as well as “priority air permitting” for electricity generation projects by the state’s Air Pollution Control Division.

Most of the clean energy incentives enacted by Democrats in 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act are set to be quickly phased out under the megabill passed by Republicans and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month. Tax credits for utility-scale wind and solar projects will expire for any project not placed into service by the end of 2027. Many consumer-facing incentives will expire much sooner than that, with electric vehicle rebates expiring next month and a credit for home energy upgrades due to end Dec. 31 of this year.

The state has launched an online “energy savings navigator” tool that allows Coloradans to learn what incentives they may be eligible for based on their ZIP code, income level and other factors.

$500 extra a year per household

Officials from the Colorado Energy Office told lawmakers last week that the Republican bill, also known as H.R. 1, will slow the state’s efforts to deploy electric vehicles, heat pumps and other clean-energy technologies. Colorado was already in jeopardy of falling short of its statutory goal of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, projections showed.

“The state can certainly work to ensure that Coloradans are aware of these credits and are able to take advantage of them as much as they can,” CEO deputy director Dominique Gómez told lawmakers. “But there are obviously some limitations given how quickly these credits are expiring.”

The state now projects fewer than 600,000 electric vehicles will be on Colorado’s roads by 2030, far short of the goal of nearly 1 million it first set in 2019, according to a slide shown to lawmakers.

Colorado’s plans to clean up the electricity sector, however, may be relatively unaffected by the Republican bill — aside from higher costs for utilities and ratepayers.

“While this does likely increase the cost for new wind and solar, it is likely that compared to other new generation sources, this is still the quickest to market, and in many cases, still the most cost-effective new generation source,” Gómez said. “It is difficult for us to say at this point whether or not it will really change the overall trajectory, but we do know that it will make it more expensive.”

Polis’ office claimed Friday that the energy policies enacted by Republicans are projected to cost the average Colorado household $500 a year by 2035.

“Colorado’s swift response to the devastating impacts of H.R. 1 shows true leadership at a critical moment for our economy and clean energy goals,” Emilie Olson, Colorado lead at clean energy trade group Advanced Energy United, said in a press release. “We don’t need to wait on the federal government to make progress on the clean energy future that our state leaders have committed to.”",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DSC_0427-2048x1365.jpeg,N,,2025-08-04 07:05:01.666227

In a dramatic act of protest on Sunday, Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives began to flee the state. It is a last-ditch attempt to stop President Trump and Texas Republicans from adopting an aggressively redrawn congressional map that would eliminate Democratic seats — and could help lock in a Republican majority in next year’s elections.

Port Fourchon is a multi-use coastal port that functions primarily as a land base for multiple offshore energy support service companies.

Beginning with GIS, Argent proves it’s actions—not lip service—that define its commitment to community and execution.

Partnering with Louisiana contractors like GIS isn’t just local pride—it’s a strategic move to build smarter, faster, and stronger with people who know this region best”

— Jonathan Bass, Chairman & CEO

METAIRIE, LA, UNITED STATES, August 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In an energy industry often criticized for lofty promises and transient commitments, Argent LNG is taking a stand—and taking action. By initiating early development with Galliano-based Grand Isle Shipyard (GIS), Argent isn’t just talking about local investment—it’s leading with it.

This first move signals a broader philosophy: Argent LNG’s “Louisiana First” procurement approach is more than policy—it’s the foundation of how the company plans to build a 25 MTPA world-scale LNG export terminal in Port Fourchon, deliver on time and budget, and help restore confidence in large energy project execution.

Rethinking Risk, Starting with Local Wisdom

In contrast to other mega-projects that often rely on out-of-state or international contractors unfamiliar with Louisiana’s unique industrial and environmental landscape, Argent LNG is investing in companies who live and work in the region. The difference is more than symbolic—it’s strategic.

“Everyone talks about supporting local communities—but Argent LNG is doing it in a way that matters,” said Jonathan Bass, Chairman & CEO of Argent LNG. “Our choice to begin development with GIS, one of the Gulf Coast’s most capable and trusted engineering and construction firms, proves that we’re not just checking boxes. These are partners who’ve weathered hurricanes, built through supply chain crunches, and know the regulators and terrain. That experience reduces risk—and raises our confidence.”

Why “Louisiana First” Is the Right Strategy

Louisiana has one of the most sophisticated industrial labor forces and energy supply chains in the world. Yet far too often, companies parachute in with outside contractors unfamiliar with the coastal terrain, environmental nuances, and regulatory complexity. That inexperience often results in:

Change orders and permitting delays

Misunderstandings with local officials

Workforce friction and low community trust

Schedule and cost overruns

Argent LNG is taking a different path—prioritizing Louisiana contractors who:

Possess decades of proven performance in the region

Employ local talent and grow in-state capabilities

Understand the unique demands of building in hurricane-prone, environmentally sensitive areas

Bring deep relationships with state agencies and regulators

Economic Multiplier for Louisiana

By anchoring its project to Louisiana’s energy ecosystem, Argent LNG is setting up a powerful ripple effect for the state’s economy. The project is expected to:

Create thousands of high-paying jobs across fabrication, logistics, construction, and professional services

Support small and medium-sized businesses through subcontracting and supplier agreements

Facilitate local workforce training and vocational education programs

Generate long-term economic resilience in coastal parishes long tied to the energy sector

“This is about more than just a plant—it’s about building opportunity for generations of Louisiana families,” added Bass. “Working with partners like GIS is how we create real value for the community and de-risk one of the most ambitious LNG projects in the hemisphere.”

Built to Deliver and Ready for the Future

Argent LNG’s 25 MTPA export facility is scheduled to break ground in 2027, with first LNG deliveries targeted for 2030. Designed around modular liquefaction technology and best-in-class environmental performance, the project is also exploring integration with carbon capture, storage, and hydrogen modules to stay competitive in a low-carbon global energy future.

And while global headlines are dominated by supply shocks and geopolitics, Argent is focused on resilience: building a reliable, secure U.S. LNG supply chain anchored in local talent and trust.

About Argent LNG

Argent LNG is a next-generation U.S. liquefied natural gas developer based in Louisiana. Focused on building secure, scalable infrastructure to meet global demand, Argent LNG is committed to operational excellence, community investment, and supporting America’s allies with low-carbon, cost-competitive energy.

Energy Global's Summer 2025 issue Dive into the latest renewable energy insights in the Summer issue of Energy Global, out now!","Mailo is now fully operational and actively trading renewable electricity through the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP), a first for the Group and a first for the SAPP platform.

Completion of the Mailo project and entry into the SAPP trading ecosystem heralds a watershed moment for BB Energy that will underpin the company’s move into renewable energy trading and power trading. Delivering this project and securing access to new finance, means BB Energy will now embark on an ambitious plan to roll out over 500 MWp worth of power projects across southern Africa.

This milestone represents three major firsts for BB Energy:

The first-ever solar infrastructure project designed, built, completed, and operated by the Group.

The first time BB Energy is trading electricity, applying decades of energy trading expertise to renewable power.

The first debt financing secured for the Group’s growing energy transition portfolio, with a US$40 million loan from Standard Bank, supporting the construction of Mailo Phase 2, now underway.

This is a pivotal development in BB Energy’s long-term energy transition, which balances continued growth in physical trading with credible, scaled investments in low-carbon projects. Mailo demonstrates that the Group is not only committed to transition, but has the capability to originate, build, operate, and trade renewable energy at speed and at scale.

Mailo represents a new dimension to BB Energy’s core strengths. As one of the world’s most experienced physical energy traders, BB Energy is now leveraging its expertise in producing, transporting, storing, and distributing conventional energy to operate and trade renewable electricity – an increasingly vital commodity in a region still dominated by ageing coal-fired generation assets, on a continent where nearly 600 million people still live without access to electricity.

The Mailo project is also the first dedicated merchant solar power plant to trade power directly into the SAPP – the competitive regional electricity market that connects utilities and large customers across Southern Africa. This model enables BB Energy to sell clean power into day-ahead, hourly, and intra-day markets, as well as via bilateral contracts.

The plant, located on 204 hectares in the Mailo Chiefdom, has now begun delivering over 60 GWh of clean power annually, enough to supply 25 000 homes and displace over 2 million t of CO2 over its lifetime. The project phases are as follows:

Mailo Phase 1 (25 MWp): Completed and trading through SAPP (now operational).

Mailo Phase 2 (35 MWp): Now under construction, with site capacity to reach 60 MWp within a few months.

Mailo Final Phase: Full expansion to 118 MWp by 2027.

Alongside Mailo, construction is also progressing on Gerus solar PV in Namibia. Together, these two plants mark the start of Solarcentury Africa’s planned 500 MWp merchant solar portfolio, focused on building flexible, financeable renewable generation assets across the SADC region.

BB Energy has secured a US$40 million loan from Standard Bank to finance Mailo Phase 2 – the first dedicated energy transition loan facility for the Group. This financing is also part of a broader framework to support the rollout of Solarcentury Africa’s merchant portfolio.

In a further vote of confidence, Standard Bank has joined BB Energy’s Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) for the first time in 2025, signalling growing institutional confidence and alignment with the Group’s strategic direction.

Mohamed Bassatne, Group CEO, BB Energy, commented: “Mailo is a landmark for our Group. It’s the first time we are delivering renewable power generation, trading electricity in a regional market, and financing clean energy assets. This is not just an investment in solar – it is a strategic evolution of BB Energy, and a tangible step forward in our transition journey.”

Jacques Erni, Group CFO, BB Energy, added: “This announcement marks a step-change for BB Energy’s transformational energy transition journey. We are grateful to Standard Bank for its trust and partnership. Their support is an important endorsement of both the Mailo facility and our wider renewable energy plans. We are building a serious, scalable merchant power business, and this financing is a cornerstone of that effort.”

Eng. Stephen Dihwa, Executive Director, SAPP, concluded: “We are thrilled to witness this historic milestone for SAPP, as Solarcentury Africa commissions the first dedicated merchant solar power plant to trade power on the platform. This achievement marks a significant step towards accelerating renewable energy generation and advancing sustainable power trading across the region.”

Fact file about the Mailo solar plant:

Capacity: 25 MWp of clean, reliable solar power rising to 118 MWp in Phase 3.

Development timeline: Developed, funded, and built in less than a year.

Clean energy output: Over 60 GWh annually – enough to power 25 000 homes based on average household consumption in Zambia.

Emissions offset: Some 60 000 tpy of CO2, over 2 million t over the lifetime of the project the equivalent of taking nearly 20 000 cars off the road in Zambia.

Job creation: Over 400 local jobs created during construction and operations.

Community support: Agreement in place with the local community to ensure it benefits financially from the Mailo plant, transforming the lives of people in the area.

Climate resilience: Supports sustainable energy and Zambia’s diversification away from reliance on hydro power output.

Offtake: Part of Solarcentury Africa’s merchant power portfolio.

Construction was undertaken by Alensy Energy Solutions of Namibia.

A similar problem arises with nuclear energy communities.
As a result, the law appears to designate roughly 20 percent of the US land mass as a nuclear energy community.
But because the law specifies that nuclear energy communities must be in an MSA, that 20 percent of the nation’s geography includes 75 percent of the US population.
First, policymakers are interested in supporting energy communities.","In the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), Congress created the legal concept of “energy communities,” part of an effort to steer investment toward places where the coal, oil, and gas sectors play an outsized role in the local economy. If developers located certain clean energy projects in these communities, they would be eligible for an additional 10 percent tax credit. The rationale here was pretty clear: steer investment in clean energy development toward places that historically have been reliant on coal, oil, and gas.

But as I and others have written, the way that Congress defined “energy communities” was extremely broad and poorly targeted. Although roughly 50 percent of US land mass qualified as an energy community in 2024 (including Cape Cod, Chicago, Las Vegas, San Diego, San Francisco, Connecticut’s New York City suburbs, and even Disneyland), the definition excludes all of the Permian Basin in West Texas (the epicenter of US oil production), along with oil- and gas-dependent regions in Oklahoma, Colorado, and North Dakota. (To understand how the “energy community” definition came to be, see this article.)

So, while looking to amend the IRA in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Congress had an opportunity to redefine “energy communities” to more precisely target the places that face the most acute economic risks from declining fossil fuel production. As it happens, Congress did seize the moment, but not by narrowing the geographic targeting. Instead, the OBBBA broadens the definition to include “nuclear energy communities.” Specifically, the designation includes any metropolitan statistical area (an MSA, which is an important detail I’ll get into later) that:

But giving a boost to nuclear communities is not what the new law will do. Instead, Congress—just like it did for the original “energy communities” definition—has included a surprisingly broad set of places while also excluding some of the places that would make the most intuitive sense. Instead of focusing on places where reactors have closed (or may close in the future), the OBBBA makes the bonus credit available for places where new nuclear reactors are built. In all likelihood, this broad availability of the credit will provide a top-up to the existing tax credits (i.e., 45Y and 48E) that already are available for new nuclear plants (and other technologies such as advanced geothermal), which were put in place under the IRA and mostly retained in the OBBBA.

But the expansive definition goes much further than that. The OBBBA includes most other parts of the nuclear energy industry and allows places to qualify if they hosted these sectors as long as 15 years ago. For example, places can qualify if they have had, in any year going back to 2010, at least 0.17 percent of their employment tied to uranium mining or enrichment (which mostly occurs in Wyoming, Utah, and New Mexico); hosted research and development for new reactor technologies (which mostly happens at federal labs, private labs, universities, and corporate headquarters far from the reactors themselves); stored spent fuel (which happens at existing nuclear sites and a couple off-site repositories); or hosted parts of the advanced nuclear supply chain.

Clearly, the intention is not primarily to support communities that face economic hardship from nuclear plants that have closed or are at risk of closure. Instead, the revision appears to boost the tax credits that are available to advanced nuclear projects (and other energy projects), while also steering investment toward places that have been, or will become, homes to the nuclear energy value chain. This approach is consistent with the Trump administration’s stated goals of boosting the broader nuclear industry within the United States and making the nation less reliant on imported fuel and technologies (particularly from Russia and China). But, as always, the devil is in the details.

How Will the IRS Determine Eligible Communities?

To qualify for the credit, an MSA needs to have 0.17 percent or more of its employment (the same threshold used in the IRA) in the broad range of sectors described above (e.g., advanced nuclear power generation, its supply chains, research and development). But here’s the rub: we don’t have detailed data on how many people work in each of these industries.

This ambiguity has popped up before. Under the IRA, places can qualify as energy communities if 25 percent or more of their tax revenues come from fossil fuels. The only problem: Comprehensive data isn’t available for local tax revenues from fossil fuels, and the IRS has never been able to enforce this provision of the law. (I’ve done research with colleagues that starts to put some of this data together, but our efforts are far from comprehensive.)

A similar problem arises with nuclear energy communities. Although federal data sets include employment for a variety of subcomponents of the nuclear industry, the data doesn’t cover all of the activities enumerated in the OBBBA. For example, employment data from the US Census includes statistics for employment at nuclear power plants (North American Industrial Classification, or NAICS, code 221113), construction of nuclear plants (NAICS 237130), waste reprocessing (NAICS 325180), and more. Similarly, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics includes employment statistics for nuclear engineers (Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, or OEWS, code 17-2161), nuclear power reactor operators (OEWS 51-8011), and nuclear technicians (OEWS 19-4051). But no data is available to measure employment in all the sectors identified in the OBBBA, such as advanced nuclear research and development or uranium mining and enrichment. Instead, data on these industries is aggregated into a broader “grab bag” of small but related industries, such as “other metal ore mining” (NAICS 212290), which includes uranium mining among a host of others.

In short, the IRS is going to have to implement this part of the law without the data it needs.

Which Places Will Be Covered?

How much of the United States might qualify under these provisions? Because of the data problems described above, and because we don’t know where new nuclear reactors will be developed in the future, it’s very hard to say for sure. But here’s a preliminary effort.

If we use employment data from the US Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns and include NAICS codes that are pretty clearly within scope of the law, it looks like about 0.56 percent of the US workforce was employed in the relevant sectors in 2023—well above the 0.17 percent threshold enshrined in the law (Table 1).

Even if we exclude some questionable sectors such as “electric power generation, nuclear,” which mostly covers existing, non-“advanced” reactor designs, the headline result is the same. In short, Congress has—as it did in 2022—defined “energy communities” to include places where energy-sector employment is well below the national average.

As a result, the law appears to designate roughly 20 percent of the US land mass as a nuclear energy community. But because the law specifies that nuclear energy communities must be in an MSA, that 20 percent of the nation’s geography includes 75 percent of the US population. So, despite the fact that very few of them host nuclear reactors, every major US city appears to qualify as a “nuclear energy community” under the OBBBA. Specifically, each one of the 50 most populous US counties would qualify (using the data and industry codes shown in Table 1).

Looking forward, there’s a lot of uncertainty, but a few things are clear. First, policymakers are interested in supporting energy communities. As I’ve written with colleagues, this is an important policy objective for reasons of both fairness and the political viability of any energy transition. Second, it’s not easy to do this well. Designing policies to target the right places often requires time and access to technical expertise that congressional staff may not have.

Perhaps Congress will revisit the “energy communities” provision in the months and years ahead to better target resources to the places that need them most. If and when these tax provisions are reconsidered, closer attention to detail will allow Congress to develop the right metrics and the right terminology so that taxpayer dollars (or, in this case, forgone tax revenue) are used to achieve the goals that lawmakers intend.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2520903275_16x9.width-600.png,N,,2025-08-04 07:01:15.277810

For BMW, a new EV model line to be announced this fall will answer that question with a Yes. For some companies, the initial carbon footprint of battery-and-EV manufacturing can be high, making it an uphill climb to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. However, BMW’s “Neue Klasse” (or “New Class”) models will offer not just sporty performance and competitiveness with China, but also a key milestone toward the automaker’s goal of net-zero corporate emissions by 2050.

BMW will officially unveil its first Neue Klasse model in early September—the compact iX3 SUV. It’s the first of multiple BMW models that will share a newly efficient, ultra-fast-charging electric architecture. In Munich, where IEEE Spectrum attended a Neue Klasse media preview, the automaker rolled out its bold plans for sustainable EV production.

BMW Re-envisions the EV Battery

Let’s start with the pricey heart of any EV, its battery. BMW will ditch today’s prismatic cells for new “Gen6” cylindrical batteries. Developed entirely in house, and built in a partnership with China’s CATL, the nickel-rich cells feature a 46-mm diameter and come in two heights, either 95- or 120-mm, for greater flexibility across different models. BMW’s cells boost energy density by 20 percent compared to its fifth-generation batteries. The new cells charge 30 percent faster, too. That means fewer battery cells and electricity are required to cover the same distance.

Those cells are integrated directly into a pack with no surrounding modules, saving weight and space. That high-voltage battery then connects directly to the chassis as a structural component, bringing more mass reduction: The top of the battery case actually forms the floor of a Neue Klasse vehicle.

BMW claims that 50 percent of these batteries’ lithium, nickel and cobalt will come from recycled materials, as automakers seek a more-circular battery economy and reduced reliance on freshly mined minerals. In production, BMW says its batteries’ overall carbon footprint drops by 42 percent. And the iX3 will reduce the car’s total carbon footprint by 34 percent versus its predecessor over a 200,000 kilometer (124,260 miles) life cycle, under a full “well-to-wheels” emissions analysis.

How is that possible? For one, iX3 production kicks off late this year in a factory in Debrecen, Hungary designed to operate on 100-percent renewable energy, including solar power generated on site. The automaker plans to build some Neue Klasse models in China as well, and eventually at its Spartanburg, S.C. factory, which is also BMW’s largest.

BMW’s Hungary Plant Re-envisions the Sustainable Factory

The new Hungary factory gives rise to the most slam-dunk benefit of all. Despite initially higher carbon dioxide inputs from manufacturing, BMW says its Neue Klasse SUV will reach its break-even point on carbon emissions with a comparable ICE model after less than a year for the typical owner—once their odometer crosses 21,500 km.

That represents a 34 percent CO2 reduction from its current-gen EVs. Meanwhile, if the car is charged on renewable electricity only, BMW says the break-even point drops to 17,500 kilometers, i.e. just under 11,000 miles.

Beyond its battery, roughly one-third of every Neue Klasse SUV will be made from recycled materials. Pampered BMW buyers will still be able to choose leather upholstery, but the iX3 will come standard with a vegan interior. A seat fabric called Econeer is made from 100-percent recycled PET bottles. Yarn for floor mats is sourced entirely from recycled materials, as are fabrics for the headliner that covers the cabin’s ceiling. Thermoplastics used in the storage “frunk” below the hood are made from 30-percent recycled fishing nets and other marine plastics, sourced from ports worldwide to reduce ocean pollution. A growing portion of metals are recycled as well. The BMW’s aluminum swivel bearings and hub carriers are 80-percent secondary raw materials. Wheel rims are cast from aluminum with 70-percent recycled content.",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61374280&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C371%2C0%2C116,N,,2025-08-04 07:04:33.351489

The attempt to rescind the endangerment finding combines pandering to the fossil-fuel industry with another of the Administration’s favorite activities: flouting science.
At this point, repealing the endangerment finding on scientific grounds should be impossible: contra the claims of the D.O.E.","Nineteen years ago, toward the end of the George W. Bush Administration, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a case prompted by government inaction on climate change. The plaintiffs in the case, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, argued that the Clean Air Act compelled the E.P.A. to determine whether greenhouse-gas emissions constituted a threat to the public, and, if so, to regulate them. The Court, in a 5–4 ruling, essentially agreed. Richard J. Lazarus, a Harvard Law School professor who wrote a book about the decision, has called it “the most important environmental law case ever decided by the Court.” The ruling gave rise, in 2009, to what’s known as the “endangerment finding,” which has formed the basis of federal limits on carbon pollution ever since.

Now the Trump Administration wants to overturn the Court’s decision, or perhaps just violate it. Last week, it announced a plan to revoke the endangerment finding. In concert with congressional Republicans, the White House has already laid waste to dozens of programs aimed at limiting climate change. These include fees on methane leaks, tax credits for clean-energy development, and grants to states to install electric-vehicle charging stations. (Recently, a federal district judge in Seattle ordered the disbursement of the charging-station grants awarded to several states, though it’s unclear whether the money has been released.) Still, in taking on the endangerment finding, the Administration has managed to outdo itself.

Speaking last week at a truck dealership in Indianapolis, Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said that “the proposal would, if finalized, amount to the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States,” and it’s possible that he’s right. The repeal—if it is finalized and also, given the inevitable lawsuits, upheld by the courts—would invalidate several sets of Biden-era regulations aimed at reducing emissions from vehicles and power plants. (The Administration is going after these regulations with separate actions, too.) More significantly, it could make it pretty much impossible for future Administrations to try to curb emissions without new legislation from Congress.

“I think the goal is to have this destruction of climate regulation go beyond Trump,” Michael Gerrard, the faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia, told me. If the Administration’s arguments prevail, he added, “it’s going to be very hard for E.P.A. going forward to use the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases. So they’re trying to take that away permanently—not just for the next three and a half years.”

The obvious beneficiary of the E.P.A.’s latest move is the fossil-fuel industry, which, under Donald Trump, seems to get pretty much anything it asks for, and then some. According to the White House, its recent trade deal with the European Union includes an E.U. pledge to purchase hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of oil and liquefied natural gas from the U.S. A few weeks earlier, in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act approved by Congress, oil and gas companies received new or expanded tax incentives adding up to an estimated eighteen billion dollars. “The final bill was positive for us across all of our top priorities,” Aaron Padilla, the vice-president of corporate policy at the American Petroleum Institute, an oil-industry lobbying group, told the Times. “We are becoming a petrostate” is how Gerrard put it.

The attempt to rescind the endangerment finding combines pandering to the fossil-fuel industry with another of the Administration’s favorite activities: flouting science. The E.P.A., in its proposal to repeal the finding, which was released last Tuesday, relied heavily on a report, made public the same day, that the Department of Energy had commissioned from a handful of scientists clearly chosen for their contrarian views. The hundred-and-forty-one-page assessment downplays the dangers from climate change, sometimes in ways that seem contradicted by the document’s own figures. And several climate scientists whose work is cited in the D.O.E. report have said that their conclusions are misrepresented. One, Zeke Hausfather, told Wired that the assessment seemed to him less like an official document than “a blog post—a somewhat scattershot collection of oft-debunked skeptic claims, studies taken out of context, or cherry-picked examples that are not representative of broader climate science research findings.” In a comment on the website realclimate.org, Christopher O’Dell, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University’s Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, noted that a paper attributed to him by the report was actually written by an entirely different set of authors, a mistake that suggests the document was composed with the aid of A.I.

At this point, repealing the endangerment finding on scientific grounds should be impossible: contra the claims of the D.O.E. report, the evidence since 2009 that climate change represents a threat to public welfare has become only that much more overwhelming. (It’s worth noting that on the day that both the report and the E.P.A.’s proposal were released, more than eleven million Americans were under a rare extreme-heat warning from the National Weather Service.)

“Revisiting the science is a frivolous argument,” Lazarus, the Harvard Law professor, said. But, he observed, the Administration’s legal arguments, which center on how, exactly, to interpret the relevant sections of the Clean Air Act, could appeal to the current Supreme Court. None of the five Justices who were in the majority in Massachusetts v. E.P.A. are still on the Court, but three of the dissenters—John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas—remain. Meanwhile, three of the Court’s newer Justices—Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett—are Trump appointees.

“There are a couple arguments they make where a hostile Court might bite,” Lazarus said. “My guess is that their aim here is not to have the Court say there’s no endangerment but for the Court to say there’s reason to revisit the endangerment finding,” he added. “There won’t be a revisitation, but that by itself will be enough to collapse everything.”

Just about the only positive spin on the repeal that anyone outside the MAGA world could come up with was that it could have unintended consequences for the fossil-fuel industry. On the website The Conversation, Patrick Parenteau, a professor emeritus at Vermont Law and Graduate School, noted that many cities and states have filed climate-related suits against the major oil companies. The “industry’s strongest argument” against these lawsuits, according to Parenteau, is that they are “preempted by federal law,” which is to say the Clean Air Act. But, if the Administration argues that the Clean Air Act doesn’t allow the E.P.A. to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions, the preëmption argument loses its teeth. Rescinding the endangerment finding could “backfire on the fossil fuel industry,” Parenteau observed.

Other legal scholars, however, are skeptical. They noted that the states’ and cities’ lawsuits would also eventually reach a hostile Supreme Court. “In theory, it’s a good argument,” Lazarus said. “But one cannot help but worry.” ♦

We’re witnessing a remarkable convergence of technological ambition and energy reality. The artificial intelligence revolution is driving energy demands that could reach 400 terawatt-hours by 2030, up from fewer than 100 terawatt-hours in 2020. What makes this moment particularly consequential isn’t just the scale of these energy demands, but how they’re reshaping the landscape of corporate climate commitments for companies outside the tech elite.

The new energy pecking order

The Magnificent Seven — Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia — account for roughly one-third of the S&P 500’s total market capitalization. These companies possess something that most other corporations don’t: the financial resources and strategic leverage to secure dedicated clean energy sources for their operations, no matter the amount or cost.

Microsoft, for example, has signed a 20-year agreement to restart Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor and Amazon announced $334 million in investments for small modular nuclear reactors. This isn’t corporate virtue signaling; this is securing competitive advantage through energy infrastructure control.

When the world’s most valuable companies can purchase their way to carbon-free electricity through long-term nuclear contracts, they create a two-tiered system where some of a company’s sustainability becomes increasingly correlated with market capitalization.

The grid under siege

Energy demand for data centers could increase by as much as 165 percent by 2030, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. Most electricity consumed by data centers currently relies on fossil fuels. While the MAG-7 secures clean energy through private agreements, the broader electrical grid is being strained to accommodate the growing demands of everyone else.

This creates a cascading effect that undermines the sustainability efforts of virtually every other industry. In Northern Virginia, for example, the region’s concentration of data centers has forced utilities to keep fossil fuel plants online to meet demand. When utilities must fire up additional gas plants to meet AI-driven electricity demand, the carbon intensity of the entire grid increases, making it more difficult for all grid-connected companies to achieve their emissions reduction targets.

Consider the math: Companies are still committing to Net Zero but only reducing emissions by 30 percent on average by 2030, falling short of the 43 percent reduction required to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. These already insufficient results become even more challenging when the electrical grid itself becomes more carbon-intensive due to AI’s energy demands.

Proponents of AI expansion will tell you the technology’s potential to drive efficiency gains could offset energy consumption. But that argument represents optimistic forecasting and ignores the immediate realities of deployment: training AI models consume thousands of hours of electricity and generate hundreds of tons of carbon dioxide. It’s like the Jevons Paradox but applied to AI: improvements in efficiency lead to increased consumption — not conservation.

Non-MAG-7 companies find themselves in a difficult position. They face rising electricity costs as utilities struggle to meet AI-driven demand, limited access to clean energy sources that are increasingly locked up in long-term contracts with tech giants, and stakeholder pressure to maintain ambitious climate commitments. The result is a growing gap between stated intentions and achievable outcomes.

This is particularly acute for manufacturing companies, which typically operate on thinner margins than tech firms and cannot easily absorb increases in energy costs. When the price of electricity rises due to grid strain, and when clean energy sources become less available due to tech sector capture, these companies face a choice between seeking to achieve their climate commitments and maintaining their competitiveness.

Facing reality

The uncomfortable truth is that we’re witnessing the emergence of a bifurcated approach to corporate sustainability. Companies with sufficient capital and strategic importance can secure clean energy sources and maintain credible climate commitments. Everyone else must compete for increasingly scarce and expensive clean electricity while operating in a grid environment that is becoming more carbon-intensive due to AI-driven demand.

Recent innovations such as in-memory computing, optical data transmission and more efficient AI models such as China’s DeepSeek, which reportedly consumes 10 to 40 times less energy than comparable models, demonstrate that AI’s energy consumption is not immutable. Yet the dominant approach remains focused on scaling up energy supply rather than optimizing demand.

For non-MAG-7 companies, the path forward requires several strategic adjustments:

Sustainability commitments must be recalibrated to reflect grid realities. Companies will have trouble achieving agreed to science-based targets on a grid that’s becoming more carbon-intensive due to factors beyond their control. This doesn’t mean abandoning climate goals but rather setting targets that account for systemic constraints.

Companies must invest more heavily in direct energy efficiency measures and on-site renewable generation. When clean grid electricity becomes less available, the next best option is to reduce dependency on the grid altogether.

Corporate climate advocacy must shift toward systemic solutions rather than individual commitments. The Science Based Targets initiative aims to commit 20 percent of the global economy to fully validated science-based targets by 2025, but these targets become meaningless if the underlying energy infrastructure cannot support them.

Broader implications

What we’re observing in the AI energy boom is a microcosm of broader challenges in addressing climate change through market mechanisms. When critical resources — in this case, clean electricity — become scarce, they flow to the highest bidders rather than the most socially beneficial uses. The MAG-7 companies aren’t villains in this story; they’re rational actors responding to market incentives. But their rational behavior creates externalities that undermine the climate commitments of virtually every other company.

AI development shouldn’t be curtailed, but energy implications must be addressed at a systemic level rather than left to individual corporate procurement strategies. This requires policy interventions that ensure clean energy deployment keeps pace with AI-driven demand and that access to clean electricity isn’t determined solely by purchasing power.

We stand at a critical juncture where our technological ambitions and our climate goals are pulling in different directions. The companies driving AI development have the resources to reconcile these tensions for themselves through private energy agreements. For everyone else, the path forward requires acknowledging that sustainability in the age of AI will be more challenging, more expensive and more dependent on systemic solutions than we’ve been willing to admit.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2204212041-e1753914500572.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 07:01:18.856235

Trump longs to return to an America he remembers growing up before the federal government started regulating the auto industry.","I’m old enough to remember the days before the federal government regulated auto tailpipe emissions, a time when the air was stinky and Los Angeles was enveloped in perpetual smog.

My first car was one of those pollution machines, a used 1968 Buick Gran Sport that gulped a gallon of poisonous, leaded gasoline every 14 miles or so.

It was a different time, one that the Trump administration seemingly is trying to bring back.

In what could be one of the most far-reaching deregulatory moves in U.S. history, the Environmental Protection Agency wants to stop regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks long considered by most scientists to be significant contributors to climate change.

“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said at a Kenworth heavy truck dealership in Indianapolis on July 29.

Zeldin said the administration plans to overturn a landmark 2009 finding by the Obama administration that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are pollutants the agency can regulate under the Clean Air Act.

That determination is known as the “endangerment finding” and was the basis for strict tailpipe emission rules enacted by the Biden administration that would have required about half of new vehicles sold in the U.S. being electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030.

Automakers also must meet certain fuel economy standards, which were stiffened by Biden. But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in June the Trump administration is planning to roll back the Biden standards, calling them “illegal.”

And under the One Big Beautiful Bill, the tax and spending bill approved by Congress on July 3, automakers won’t have to pay fines for not meeting fuel economy standards for the past three years.

It’s a big gift to automakers that pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the federal government for not meeting the fuel economy standards. But it will likely sting electric carmaker Tesla, which has made billions of dollars over the years selling regulatory credits to other carmakers.

Environmental groups expressed outrage over the EPA’s intent to deep-six climate rules.

“As Americans reel from deadly floods and heat waves, the Trump administration is trying to argue that the emissions turbocharging these disasters are not a threat,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It boggles the mind and endangers the nation’s safety and welfare.”

Environmental groups have vowed to sue the EPA over the proposed climate rules rollback, possibly delaying any implementation for years.

Even Detroit’s automakers were muffled in their response to the EPA’s move to ditch carbon dioxide rules.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an association representing dozens of automakers and suppliers including General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis N.A., did not issue a statement about the EPA’s groundbreaking announcement on its website.

That might be because some top auto executives have acknowledged climate change is real and their products are contributing to it.

GM CEO Mary Barra has said electric cars are a key element in the automaker’s long-range plan to have “zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. It’s the North Star that guides everything we do.”

Ford Motor Executive Chairman Bill Ford has supported the Paris Climate Accord, which seeks to reduce carbon dioxide levels associated with climate change. Ford Motor also has pledged to be carbon neutral across its vehicles, facilities and suppliers by 2050.

Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are doing their best to torpedo those efforts by conducting an all-out war against electric vehicles.

They’re ending the $7,500 tax credit to purchase EVs on September 30. And they’re eliminating tax credits for home EV charging stations, a move slated to take effect next June.

Trump’s chaotic implementation of tariffs also is being used as a weapon in his war against EVs. The Commerce Department last month slapped a 93.5% tariff on Chinese graphite, a critical ingredient in manufacturing EV batteries.

China supplies nearly all the high-grade graphite Tesla and other automakers need to make batteries. But the Commerce Department says China is “dumping” graphite into the U.S. at prices lower than in its home market.

Some experts say the tariff could add $1,000 or more to the price of an EV battery, another huge disincentive for consumers to buy EVs.

Trump’s widespread tariffs on cars, trucks and parts are hammering Detroit automakers’ bottom lines, potentially hurting their ability to adequately invest in new technologies to compete with Chinese automakers that are rapidly gobbling up the global EV market.

Ford and Stellantis cited the impacts of tariffs in the companies’ net losses for the second quarter of the year. Combined, the Detroit Three have paid more than $2 billion in tariffs so far this year.

Trump longs to return to an America he remembers growing up before the federal government started regulating the auto industry.

I’m nostalgic, as well, for my ’68 Gran Sport. But that muscle car is an anachronism best suited for events like the Woodward Dream Cruise.

“It boggles the mind and endangers the nation’s safety and welfare.” Environmental groups have vowed to sue the EPA over the proposed climate rules rollback, possibly delaying any implementation for years.
Even Detroit’s automakers were muffled in their response to the EPA’s move to ditch carbon dioxide rules.
That might be because some top auto executives have acknowledged climate change is real and their products are contributing to it.","I’m old enough to remember the days before the federal government regulated auto tailpipe emissions, a time when the air was stinky and Los Angeles was enveloped in perpetual smog.

My first car was one of those pollution machines, a used 1968 Buick Gran Sport that gulped a gallon of poisonous, leaded gasoline every 14 miles or so.

It was a different time, one that the Trump administration seemingly is trying to bring back.

In what could be one of the most far-reaching deregulatory moves in U.S. history, the Environmental Protection Agency wants to stop regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks long considered by most scientists to be significant contributors to climate change.

“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said at a Kenworth heavy truck dealership in Indianapolis on July 29.

Zeldin said the administration plans to overturn a landmark 2009 finding by the Obama administration that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are pollutants the agency can regulate under the Clean Air Act.

That determination is known as the “endangerment finding” and was the basis for strict tailpipe emission rules enacted by the Biden administration that would have required about half of new vehicles sold in the U.S. being electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030.

Automakers also must meet certain fuel economy standards, which were stiffened by Biden. But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in June the Trump administration is planning to roll back the Biden standards, calling them “illegal.”

And under the One Big Beautiful Bill, the tax and spending bill approved by Congress on July 3, automakers won’t have to pay fines for not meeting fuel economy standards for the past three years.

It’s a big gift to automakers that pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the federal government for not meeting the fuel economy standards. But it will likely sting electric carmaker Tesla, which has made billions of dollars over the years selling regulatory credits to other carmakers.

Environmental groups expressed outrage over the EPA’s intent to deep-six climate rules.

“As Americans reel from deadly floods and heat waves, the Trump administration is trying to argue that the emissions turbocharging these disasters are not a threat,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It boggles the mind and endangers the nation’s safety and welfare.”

Environmental groups have vowed to sue the EPA over the proposed climate rules rollback, possibly delaying any implementation for years.

Even Detroit’s automakers were muffled in their response to the EPA’s move to ditch carbon dioxide rules.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an association representing dozens of automakers and suppliers including General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis N.A., did not issue a statement about the EPA’s groundbreaking announcement on its website.

That might be because some top auto executives have acknowledged climate change is real and their products are contributing to it.

GM CEO Mary Barra has said electric cars are a key element in the automaker’s long-range plan to have “zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. It’s the North Star that guides everything we do.”

Ford Motor Executive Chairman Bill Ford has supported the Paris Climate Accord, which seeks to reduce carbon dioxide levels associated with climate change. Ford Motor also has pledged to be carbon neutral across its vehicles, facilities and suppliers by 2050.

Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are doing their best to torpedo those efforts by conducting an all-out war against electric vehicles.

They’re ending the $7,500 tax credit to purchase EVs on September 30. And they’re eliminating tax credits for home EV charging stations, a move slated to take effect next June.

Trump’s chaotic implementation of tariffs also is being used as a weapon in his war against EVs. The Commerce Department last month slapped a 93.5% tariff on Chinese graphite, a critical ingredient in manufacturing EV batteries.

China supplies nearly all the high-grade graphite Tesla and other automakers need to make batteries. But the Commerce Department says China is “dumping” graphite into the U.S. at prices lower than in its home market.

Some experts say the tariff could add $1,000 or more to the price of an EV battery, another huge disincentive for consumers to buy EVs.

Trump’s widespread tariffs on cars, trucks and parts are hammering Detroit automakers’ bottom lines, potentially hurting their ability to adequately invest in new technologies to compete with Chinese automakers that are rapidly gobbling up the global EV market.

Ford and Stellantis cited the impacts of tariffs in the companies’ net losses for the second quarter of the year. Combined, the Detroit Three have paid more than $2 billion in tariffs so far this year.

Trump longs to return to an America he remembers growing up before the federal government started regulating the auto industry.

I’m nostalgic, as well, for my ’68 Gran Sport. But that muscle car is an anachronism best suited for events like the Woodward Dream Cruise.

This groundbreaking development promises to enhance the efficiency of lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, and water filtration systems. Moleaer Inc., a leader in nanobubble technology based in Hawthorne, California, has introduced a patent-pending method that integrates nanobubbles into the thin-film fabrication process, resulting in significant performance improvements. However, this transformative technology also faces challenges related to manufacturability and scalability, raising questions about its widespread adoption and impact on the clean energy sector.

Nanobubbles Change the Game

Nanobubbles are poised to revolutionize the production of thin films, which are crucial components in various energy and water systems. From ultrafiltration membranes to catalyst layers in hydrogen electrolyzers and electric vehicle batteries, these films are foundational to modern technology. The new nanobubble method introduces billions of these microscopic bubbles into liquid coatings during production, optimizing pore size distribution and stabilizing inks. This process results in films with consistent porosity and uniform particle sizes, enhancing the performance of the systems they are used in.

The impact of this innovation is significant across different sectors. For instance, ultrafiltration membranes experienced a 66% increase in water permeability due to improved porosity, potentially reducing the energy consumption of municipal and industrial water treatment systems. Similarly, PEM fuel cells saw a 20% boost in power output from the same active area, paving the way for more compact and cost-effective solutions for vehicles and portable applications. Furthermore, hydrogen generation through PEM water electrolyzers achieved a 17% improvement in current density at operational voltages, marking a crucial step toward the economic viability of green hydrogen.

Cleaner Tech, Stronger Output

Lithium-ion batteries also stand to benefit significantly from the enhanced thin films. The introduction of nanobubbles facilitates faster charging, improved capacity retention, and better performance at high C rates. These advantages contribute to a longer battery lifespan and superior performance under demanding conditions. Moleaer’s CEO, Nick Dyner, emphasized the foundational role of thin films in clean energy and water technologies. He noted that traditional manufacturing methods have limited the potential of these films, but the nanobubble-enabled process overcomes these limitations without altering existing formulas or processes.

Importantly, the nanobubble technology has undergone independent validation and peer review, confirming its precision and efficacy. By integrating seamlessly into existing production lines, manufacturers can adopt this approach without major overhauls, making it an attractive option for companies looking to enhance their products’ performance and sustainability.

Scalability and Commercialization Prospects

As the global demand for clean energy and water technologies continues to rise, the scalability and cost-effectiveness of nanobubble integration become crucial considerations. Moleaer plans to commercialize this technology through partnerships with leading membrane and energy companies, aiming to bring these benefits to a broader market. Dr. Mohamed Abdelrahman, Senior R&D Application Engineer at Moleaer, likened nanobubbles to “invisible scaffolding” that enhance material organization during fabrication, resulting in higher-performing films with less waste and fewer defects.

However, the path to widespread commercialization is not without hurdles. Challenges related to manufacturability and scale-up need to be addressed to ensure that the technology can be adopted on a larger scale without compromising its benefits. These considerations will be essential as the industry seeks to capitalize on the potential of nanobubbles to transform clean technology.

However, AC-coupling may experience greater energy losses when charging BESS from variable renewable energy (relative to DC-coupling).
Yet, the current design for hybrid systems, particularly for DC-coupled projects, can make grid modelling and approvals more demanding.
Early integration of advanced bidding software is now critical to ensure hybrid systems perform as intended while maximising revenue and maintaining compliance.
For the energy industry, the message is clear: hybrid BESS hold significant promise to unlock renewable potential and improve project economics.","The opportunity for hybrid BESS lies in tackling a growing problem: the curtailment of energy from renewable assets. As more renewable generation comes online, parts of the grid are experiencing congestion, and negative prices are becoming increasingly common.

These factors force renewable asset owners to curtail output when wind or solar is most abundant. Hybrid BESS can help mitigate these losses by using batteries to store excess generation at key times or to bid strategically into the market, improving overall asset utilisation and economic returns.

However, building a hybrid system is complex. We see five critical considerations for project developers:

Coupling configurations matter

Choosing between AC and DC coupling affects capital expenditure, energy losses, and retrofit potential. DC-coupling can be effective for developing a greenfield site (although considering DC-DC converters is still important). It may reduce energy conversion losses and better capture renewable oversupply. However, DC-coupling is harder to retrofit and may increase engineering and operational complexity.

AC-coupling could be a more effective option when considering retrofitting a BESS to fit an existing plant and when leveraging specialist expertise by developing assets independently. However, AC-coupling may experience greater energy losses when charging BESS from variable renewable energy (relative to DC-coupling).

The choices between AC versus DC coupling, and one or two dispatchable unit identifiers (DUIDs), present multiple possible configurations. We have set out two combinations we expect to be commonly considered by developers.

While historically, the choices in hardware and operations have been distinct, the greater flexibility offered by hybrid BESS means that both the physical plant configuration and its future revenue streams should be considered simultaneously.

Flexibility vs simplicity trade-offs

For particular hybrid configurations, developers face a choice between registering as a single DUID, which simplifies operations but limits the ability to optimise assets separately, or as multiple DUIDs, which offers more market flexibility but compliance complexity.

Grid connection challenges

A key benefit of hybrid BESS is that it places multiple assets behind the same connection point and can utilise a single Generator Performance Standard (GPS) process, rather than separate studies for each asset. However, a drawback to keep in mind is that unless the GPS process is done simultaneously for both assets (under NER 5.3.4A), then an additional GPS approval will need to take place when adding a BESS later (under NER 5.3.9).

Yet, the current design for hybrid systems, particularly for DC-coupled projects, can make grid modelling and approvals more demanding.

Integrated forecasting and bidding systems

Hybrid systems must handle new layers of complexity: forecasting renewable availability, adjusting to headroom changes, and responding to new market signals like Aggregate Dispatch Conformance status, which can change every five minutes.

Early integration of advanced bidding software is now critical to ensure hybrid systems perform as intended while maximising revenue and maintaining compliance.

Integrated hardware and software can reduce risks

While there is significant upside to a hybrid BESS, there is additional risk and complexity to manage. A hybrid BESS with multiple assets behind the same connection point requires more sophisticated tools to manage active and reactive power, and the overall stability and efficiency of the system. For something like a solar BESS hybrid, it’s critical to have:

a power plant controller (or energy management system) that is capable of managing multiple assets at the same time

a bidding platform that is sophisticated enough to use highly variable solar forecasts and spot market price forecasts to deliver the most profitable mix of generation and charging to suit developers’ business cases.

For the energy industry, the message is clear: hybrid BESS hold significant promise to unlock renewable potential and improve project economics. These decisions go beyond technology alone. Commercial models, operational flexibility, and how quickly hybrid projects can move from concept to operation all need to be considered.

Importantly, hybrid systems also highlight the need for thoughtful partner selection and early engagement among developers, technology providers, system operators, and market bodies to align design, regulation, and revenue strategies.

As the energy transition accelerates, it is essential to leverage proven technology and software to navigate Australia’s unique regulatory and market environment. Hybrid BESS are set to play a central role in balancing the grid and delivering reliable, affordable, and clean power to Australian homes and businesses.

The BuildingsNEXT Student Design Competition — formerly the Solar Decathlon — encourages college students to design high-performance buildings that improve quality of life through great affordability, resiliency and energy efficiency.

Students were encouraged to choose a project that could bring positive change to their communities. In the past, Penn College teams have completed design projects for local groups like Greater Lycoming Habitat for Humanity and Family Promise of Lycoming County.

“This year, we reached out to Mayor Derek Slaughter and asked: ‘Is there something that the city would like some input on – something the students could help you visualize?'” explained Dorothy J. Gerring, associate professor of architecture and the team’s adviser. Gerring is also the architecture department head.

The students’ collaboration with the city resulted in a design for a Boys & Girls Clubs of America facility meant to serve as an after-school, weekend and summer camp for school-age children. Their design includes a gymnasium, walking track, locker rooms, kitchen/cafeteria, education space, quiet learning area, gamers lounge and recording studio, as well as a pollinator garden.

The students’ design was based on Boys & Girls Clubs of America standards and information in the city’s Park Avenue Plan.

The students began working on the facility design in October — when the competition was still formatted as the “Solar Decathlon” — and met with Slaughter throughout the process.

“This project is a testament to the students’ dedication, creativity and vision,” the mayor said. “Their design aligns with our city’s commitment to creating sustainable, safe and inspiring spaces where young people can grow, thrive and lead.”

In May, the students joined 18 other collegiate teams in the Open Commercial Division to present their plans to a panel of industry experts. While originally a 10-part competition with semifinals and finals, the event transitioned in early 2025 to a “showcase” for any team that chose to present.

“This project would be Williamsport’s first net-zero building,” said Kayla A. Weinzierl, a Bachelor of Architecture student from Summerhill. “It is designed with the health, safety and the community at its core.”

In a net-zero energy building, 100% of energy demand is met by on-site renewable energy.

To achieve net zero, the students’ plans call for solar panels on the roof. A tight building envelope helps minimize energy demand from its heating, ventilation and air conditioning system.

The students chose a vertical geothermal heating system. Their design takes advantage of daylighting from the sun. On the building’s east and west sides, vertical louvres on the windows help to minimize glare and solar heat gain, while a green wall system — an exterior wall covered in plants — provides extra insulation and is a natural air filter. Horizontal window shading on the south side minimizes solar heat gain in summer and maximizes it in winter.

Their design also incorporates kinetic energy technology in fitness equipment and under the gymnasium floor. The technology uses movement to generate electricity.

The students selected building materials and furnishings that are Pennsylvania sourced and low in volatile organic compounds. The building’s structural system uses mass timber — a renewable resource that can be sourced locally and is a low-carbon alternative to concrete or steel. Pervious concrete also helps to reduce the facility’s impact.

The seven-member team was made up of architecture students Jordan K. Ace, of Franklin; Jazira Baez Mercedes, of Pittsburgh; Ciara E. Fey, of Hegins; Sandra M. Gallick, of Linden; and Kayla A. Weinzierl, of Summerhill. All but Gallick were second-year students. Gallick completed a Bachelor of Science in architecture & sustainable design in May. Baez Mercedes graduated in May with an associate degree in architecture. Ace, Fey and Weinzierl are pursuing Bachelor of Architecture degrees.

Team member Lindsay N. Repman, of Williamsport, is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in business administration; and John P. McAnally Jr., of Coopersburg, is seeking a Bachelor of Science in heating, ventilation & air conditioning engineering technology. Both are third-year students.

“They had a great experience working in an interdisciplinary team,” Gerring said. “They were challenged to really step up because a lot of the things were very new to them.”

The project allowed them to broaden their experience by working with electrical and structural engineers, as well as the city and Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and by diving deeper into topics like costing and marketing.

“The students were tenacious,” Gerring said.

The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.
In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector.
This compares to the U.K. where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.
By the 2030s, he said: ""I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks.""","On Ireland's blustery western seaboard, researchers are gleefully flying giant kites — not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a ""revolution"" in wind energy.

""We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power,"" said Padraic Doherty of Kitepower, the Dutch firm behind the venture.

At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris, the team transports the vast 60-square-meter kite from a hangar across the lunar-like bogland to a generator.

The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a ""yo-yo or fishing reel,"" Doherty said.

""It gets cast out and flies up, the tether pulls it back in, over and over again, creating energy,"" he said, testing the kite's ropes and pulleys before a flight.

The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the world's first designated airborne renewable energy test site.

And although the idea is still small in scale, it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas.

""We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy,"" said Andrei Luca, operations head at Kitepower, a zero-emissions energy solutions spin-off from the Delft University of Technology.

""It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30 kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale, and decades to offshore wind farms we see today,"" he added.

The system flies autonomously, driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands, but Doherty acts as the kite's ""pilot"" on the ground, monitoring its flight path for efficiency.

The kite flies up around 400 meters and reels in to about 190 meters, generating around 30 kilowatts per hour for storage.

The force spins ""like a dynamo on a bike,"" Doherty said, adding that ""it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn.""

The electricity is stored in batteries, similar to solar photovoltaic systems, with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336 kilowatt per hour battery.

""That's a meaningful amount of energy, sufficient for powering a remote outpost, a small island, polar station, or even a construction site,"" Luca said.

""Add additional kites, and we can power a bigger island.""

According to Doherty, a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift start-up capability.

""We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere, it's super mobile, and doesn't need expensive, time- and energy-consuming turbine foundations to be built,"" he said.

A kite system is ""way less invasive on the landscape (than wind turbines), produces clean energy and doesn't need a supply chain of fuel to keep running,"" Luca added.

During January's Storm Eowyn, which caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in Ireland, the system showed its value in Bangor Erris, according to Luca.

""Paired with a battery, it provided uninterrupted electricity before, during and after the storm,"" he said.

Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.

But progress on large-scale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.

The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.

In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector.

This compares to the U.K. where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.

The ability of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems to harness high-altitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements ""makes them particularly suitable for remote, offshore or mobile applications,"" said Mahdi Salari, an AWE researcher at University College Cork.

But he said Kitepower would face challenges on ""regulation, safety, and system reliability.""

Such technology, however, could plug gaps in places where ""land availability, costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines,"" Salari said.

By the 2030s, he said: ""I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks.""",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/08/04/485352.jpg?v=3.1,N,,2025-08-04 08:03:08.285183

Walk away from net zero and you walk away from that deal – and from the billions that already flow to the bush.","The Coalition, led by some Nationals members, is again at war with itself over net zero.

This fight may serve short-term political ambitions of the National’s fractured leadership, but it’s a dead-end for the country and a disaster for the bush.

Every year we delay the transition to a clean energy grid costs Australia thousands of jobs and billions in real dollars.

It also comes with a rising human and natural toll as fires, floods and storms hurt people and nature across the country.

Scrapping net zero means turning our backs on income for farmers, upgraded roads and hospitals and cheaper energy bills for families doing it tough.

These opportunities aren’t far off in the future. They are knocking on the door.

Australia’s 20 remaining coal fired power stations are falling apart. Some off them keep exploding (looking at you, Callide).

The clock is ticking to replace them with cheap, clean, reliable renewables.

The gains from net zero are real – and overwhelmingly rural.

Yet the Nationals are leading the charge to tear it all down.

Instead of backing farmers, workers and communities hungry for opportunity, they’re reviving tired old culture wars that put politics ahead of people.

It’s a dead end for the bush.

The clean energy transition is the biggest regional development opportunity in a generation.

A 2024 report from Farmers for Climate Action found farmers would gain over $1 billion in direct payments from wind and solar projects by 2030. That’s badly needed stable income that can help drought-proof farms and keep family businesses alive.

Big picture, the numbers are staggering. Deloitte Access Economics estimates clean energy industries could generate more than $125 billion in economic activity in regional Australia by 2050, creating tens of thousands of new jobs in construction, operations, maintenance, and supply chains.

Beyond the farm gate, renewable energy projects deliver billions in flow-on benefits with dozens of community funds popping up.

These funds are locally governed, ensuring millions of dollars flow each year to local priorities like fixing the footy oval, building medical centres, expanding childcare or investing in training.

There’s also something deeper here. Climate action is good for farmers, but it’s essential for nature and Australian farmers are some of the proudest nature lovers out there.

As the climate heats up, our forests, rivers and reefs are all under threat. Done right, clean energy can help restore degraded areas, protect habitat and support the recovery of native species.

So, it’s perplexing to see the Nationals, ‘the party of the bush,’ straining yet again for a fight on climate action.

By doing so, they’re turning their backs on the mayors, farmers, business owners and parents around regional Australia who want jobs, investment and a safer climate.

Abandoning net zero would rip billions out of the bush and kneecap the economic future of hundreds of country towns.

Poll after poll shows the majority of people in regional Australia support renewable energy. They see the benefits firsthand. In many places, renewable energy projects are already the biggest employers, the biggest ratepayers and the best hope for keeping young people in town.

Of course, this support isn’t unconditional. It depends on making sure the benefits are shared, projects are well planned and nature is protected.

Communities want a fair go. They want consultation, not imposition. They want clean energy that adds to their quality of life, not undermines it.

That’s the deal. Walk away from net zero and you walk away from that deal – and from the billions that already flow to the bush.

Fortunately for the nuclear industry, it has always been a darling of U.S. policymakers, and that remains true.
The administration even hopes to lure nuclear manufacturing to Virginia – but it would be in Lynchburg, not Southwest Virginia.
Many local residents are skeptical of the administration’s plans, trusting neither the governor nor the nuclear industry.
Unemployment rates for Southwest Virginia counties have risen only slightly from their Biden-era lows, but poverty rates in some counties remain stubbornly high.","Gov. Glenn Youngkin wants to bring a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) to Southwest Virginia in the course of the next decade. The administration has put together a small amount of funding to search for a larger amount of funding to pay for a study. One of the study questions is what they would use the reactor for – research, possibly, and to provide electricity for the University of Virginia at Wise, or perhaps a data center that the region has yet to attract.

Virginia takes steps to bring advanced nuclear reactor to Wise County

If this all sounds a little sketchy, that’s because SMRs remain a little sketchy. Nuclear companies haven’t yet demonstrated they can attain the holy grail of safe, 24/7 carbon-free power at a competitive cost.

It’s not for lack of trying. At last count, the Nuclear Energy Agency was tracking some 98 different design technologies around the world for SMRs ranging in size from 1 MW microreactors to utility-scale reactors of more than 300 MW. Only a handful of these have reached the construction phase, and none are operational in the U.S.

This meager track record hardly reflects the enthusiasm surrounding the industry. It’s not just politicians and profit-seekers; many climate advocates believe the industry must succeed if the world is to have any hope of transitioning our energy supply away from fossil fuels. And polling shows that 56% of the public supports building more nuclear plants. That’s way less than the levels of support for wind and solar but more than support for fracking and coal mining. Still, concerns remain about safety and the proliferation of nuclear waste, a problem neither the industry nor the government yet has a strategy to deal with.

And then there’s the cost. SMRs haven’t shown an ability to compete in the energy marketplace, even against other carbon-free alternatives. As renewable energy and storage technologies continue to drop in price, the economic case for new nuclear remains an open question.

Nonetheless, both of Virginia’s publicly-owned utilities are exploring SMRs, having secured legislation last year that will allow them to charge customers for millions of dollars in early development costs. Appalachian Power is targeting a site near Lynchburg (not Southwest Virginia), while Dominion Energy says it is evaluating the feasibility of an SMR next to its existing conventional reactors at North Anna.

Dominion’s 2024 integrated resource plan shows an SMR could be part of its power mix as early as 2035; APCo has no timeline. For either utility, actually building an SMR will require making the economic case to the State Corporation Commission.

The slow timeline and cloudy cost picture have not dampened enthusiasm for nuclear among Virginia’s elected leaders. The data center boom is exacerbating a shortage of energy and causing utility bills to skyrocket. Keeping the party going means making messy tradeoffs between polluting fuels with volatile prices and low-cost but land-hungry solar. No wonder Youngkin and other leaders hope nuclear will magically allow them to sidestep the hard decisions and party on.

Energy demands, regulations and federal funding challenge Virginia Clean Economy Act

But wishful thinking doesn’t put megawatts on the grid. A recent article surveying the state of the nuclear industry makes it clear that these are early times in the nuclear renaissance, if such it is. The industry won’t be able to scale unless and until production-line manufacturing becomes a reality, and that will be years from now.

Fortunately for the nuclear industry, it has always been a darling of U.S. policymakers, and that remains true. Nuclear subsidies survived the axe in this year’s Republican budget law, while tax credits for wind and solar were revoked.

Indeed, President Donald J. Trump is doing his best to further the industry’s prospects, albeit in a ham-handed fashion that almost seems calculated to erode public trust.

Last month a representative of his Department of Government Efficiency reportedly told the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, charged with ensuring the safety of the industry, that it was expected to provide “rubber stamp” approval to nuclear plant applications after they were tested by the Department of Energy or Defense. A few days later, Trump dismissed all but one of the members of the U.S. Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, which provides oversight of spent fuel storage.

These alarming moves may not do much to dampen the enthusiasm of the Youngkin administration and other boosters. The administration even hopes to lure nuclear manufacturing to Virginia – but it would be in Lynchburg, not Southwest Virginia.

That calls into question Youngkin’s claims of economic benefits for an SMR in Wise County. If the SMR would be just a one-off for “research” purposes and needs a rich company or state-supported customer to buy the electricity, is it really an investment in the region, or a solution in search of a problem?

Many local residents are skeptical of the administration’s plans, trusting neither the governor nor the nuclear industry. Sharon Fisher, one of the leaders of the Southwest Virginia Nuclear Watch grassroots movement, told me in an email that her group “has extensively researched the nuclear industry with its enormous costs and contaminations.”

She pointed me to a 2023 study of health trends in a Tennessee county where a company called Nuclear Fuel Services generates highly enriched uranium fuels for naval reactors. Over the years, unintended releases of enriched uranium, plutonium and other substances have caused an accumulation of radioactivity in the local air, water, and food. The study documented rising cancer and mortality rates in the county, including a rate of premature deaths that is 61% above the U.S. average.

Rees Shearer, an activist with the Appalachian Peace Education Center, told me in a phone call that SMRs are “the next wave of exploitation” of Southwest Virginia’s resources.

“First they came for the timber, then they came for the coal, now they are coming with radioactivity,” Shearer said.

He explained, “Coal left a terrible legacy of abandoned mines, polluted creeks, and leaking methane. But this pales compared to the potential legacy of high-level nuclear waste stored on site. With SMRs, the amount of this waste can be 100 times more per megawatt than conventional nuclear. This is waste that will last millions of years. This isn’t a fair trade.”

An SMR would also come with the risk of terrorism, either from hacking or a drone attack. “It makes a place that was never a target into a target,” he noted.

Both Fisher and Shearer challenged the notion that SMRs would provide jobs for Wise County residents, even in the construction phase. Modular facilities would be manufactured offsite and assembled by an expert crew from out of the area. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has even approved remote operation of nuclear reactors from an offsite facility, they pointed out.

Well-paying jobs are certainly a priority for the area. Unemployment rates for Southwest Virginia counties have risen only slightly from their Biden-era lows, but poverty rates in some counties remain stubbornly high.

But Fisher says the key to a healthy economy lies in diversification.

“Wise County was once a major producer of apples. We have vineyards and breweries, and fields for growing grains. Tourism is growing. (We should be) investing in local entrepreneurs and farmers. (And) getting equitable tax revenues from the thousands of large absentee landholdings, which should be used for housing and development.”

Energy jobs needn’t be off the table, but, said Shearer, “We think the better approach is to put solar on the abandoned mines. We have a ready workforce already trained to do this.” He pointed to an effort already underway that’s being spearheaded by the environmental group Appalachian Voices.

What the region shouldn’t do, concluded Fisher, is “rely on one industry again that puts our lives and land at tremendous risk.”",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 07:01:30.894305

These energy companies should generate strong returns for investors as a result.

TotalEnergies (TTE -0.66%), NextEra Energy (NEE -0.84%), and Brookfield Renewable (BEPC -7.40%) (BEP -6.21%) stand out to a few Fool.com contributing analysts as great buys in the energy sector. Here's why they're such attractive investments this August.

TotalEnergies is prepared for the clean energy transition

Reuben Gregg Brewer (TotalEnergies): The integrated energy model that's being used by TotalEnergies stands out from its closest peers in a very important way. Most energy giants focus on owning assets that span from the upstream (production) through the midstream (pipelines) and on to the downstream (chemicals and refining). That's great, and it provides a way for investors to get energy exposure while softening the impact of volatile commodity prices.

TotalEnergies adds electricity to the mix, with a collection of renewable power and electric generation assets. Although BP and Shell both professed to have similar ambitions in 2020, they have since walked back their plans on the electricity front. TotalEnergies, by contrast, has increased its focus on the space. And, notably, BP and Shell cut their dividends when they announced their clean energy shifts while TotalEnergies didn't cut, specifically stating that it recognized how important the dividend is to investors.

So, in the end, BP and Shell investors were really just left with a dividend cut. TotalEnergies investors got dividend increases and the diversification benefit of the energy company's shift into electricity and clean energy. The really big benefit here, however, is long-term in nature. As peers focus on oil while the world slowly shifts toward renewable power, TotalEnergies is preparing today for the future. Add in a lofty 6.4% dividend yield (U.S. investors have to pay French taxes and fees on the income they collect), and Total Energies is a great long-term option in the energy patch.

Powerful growth drivers

Matt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy is growing quickly, especially for a utility. Adjusted earnings per share rose 9.4% in the second quarter, powered by growth in its Florida electric utility and energy resources segment. The latter business continues to benefit from strong demand for renewable energy. NextEra's energy resource segment ended the first quarter with nearly 30 gigawatts of renewable projects in backlog, compared with 38 GW of operating assets.

Building on this momentum, the company expects to keep growing in the coming years. NextEra projects its adjusted earnings per share will rise 6% to 8% annually through 2027. CEO John Ketchum said he would ""be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each year through 2027, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings."" NextEra also expects about 10% annual dividend growth through at least next year.

NextEra Energy should keep growing at a healthy rate well beyond that. Analysts expect U.S. power demand to surge in the coming decades, driven by the growth of AI data centers, electrification, and the onshoring of manufacturing. This will require far more renewable energy capacity. As a renewable-energy leader, NextEra Energy should benefit from this sector's surging demand.

Given these strong growth prospects and its attractive dividend yield of more than 3%, NextEra stands out as a compelling long-term investment. With its share price having dropped nearly 10% since the company reported second-quarter earnings last month, it's a great buy this August.

A top-notch energy dividend stock

Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Renewable): The Trump administration's shift away from renewables won't stop the global energy transition. Global renewable electricity generation is projected to grow by nearly 90% between 2023 and 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. The BloombergNEF's new energy outlook 2025, meanwhile, projects renewable generation to grow by 84% between 2025 and 2030, and then double by 2050.

Buying a top-notch renewable energy stock like Brookfield Renewable could therefore be one of your smartest investing moves now. That's because Brookfield Renewable not only generates over 40% cash flows from markets outside North America but is also one of the most diversified renewable energy plays, with operations across hydropower, wind, solar, and distributed energy and storage.

Brookfield Renewable just signed a first-of-its-kind hydro power agreement with tech giant Google to deliver up to 3,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power in the U.S. This deal comes on the back of yet another solid quarter, with Brookfield Renewable generating record funds from operations (FFO) in its second quarter, up 10% year over year.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/827635/a-person-holding-energy-industry-icons-in-their-hands.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 07:01:35.416893

The 2009 Endangerment Finding from the Environmental Protection Agency came after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered EPA to determine if greenhouse gases could harm public health or welfare.

The scientific review found the gases do present a danger. The finding has been the basis of regulations enacted to reduce climate pollution from cars, power plants, and oil and gas operations.

Now the Trump administration wants to overturn the finding and related regulations, saying they’ve hurt the auto industry.

A gas industry trade group praised the move. Marcellus Shale Coalition president Jim Welty said the original finding was “flawed and based on overreaching political agendas.”

Allegheny County officials are still evaluating the possible impacts.

“From a public health perspective, we are never in favor of any policy decisions that would roll back the advancements that have been made toward pollution reduction thus far,” said Dr. Iulia Vann, director of the Allegheny County Health Department.

Advocates said the proposal is scary and disappointing.

Patrick Campbell, executive director of the Group Against Smog and Pollution, said Pittsburgh’s air quality is already challenged by heavy industry and a landscape that traps pollution close to the ground.

“ This is one more thing that will burden the already most vulnerable of our neighbors,” he said.

The proposal is subject to a public comment period. Campbell is encouraging people to sign up.

“And let the EPA know what an absolute terrible idea this would be and how damaging it will be for the kinds of progress we need to continue to make to protect our own country, our own region, the planet from warming to catastrophic levels,” he said.

Virtual hearings are scheduled for Aug. 19 and 20. Written comments can be submitted until Sept. 15. Details can be found on the EPA’s website.

Marley McFarland, a Chatham University student and college leader with the Phipps Conservatory Youth Climate Advocacy Committee, said it’s discouraging to see elected leaders deny that climate change is real. She said it can impact mental health.

“ It's hard being someone who's growing up in this kind of state of the world, knowing that the people in power aren't doing enough to help it,” McFarland said.

But, she said the youth committee will keep working to make sure they’re heard on climate issues.

“ All hope isn't lost because we can still make an impact in our community” McFarland said. “There's still plenty of influential figures in our committee, in our community, and in our committee that will listen to us, and that will make that change at least locally.”

Natalie Ford, environmental justice organizer with 412 Justice, said now is the time for elected officials at all levels to step up and protect people.

Ford said the Pittsburgh region’s air quality has improved over the decades, but it's still some of the worst in the country. The American Lung Association gave Allegheny County a D grade for ozone and an F for particulate pollution in its most recent “State of the Air” report.

“I’m mainly concerned that any progress that we have made in improving air quality is just going to be lost,” Ford said.

Ford is thinking in particular about Mon Valley communities near the Clairton Coke Works, a top source of pollution.

Studies have found Allegheny County children living near industrial sites have asthma at nearly triple the national rate.

If the finding is overturned, the move is likely to be challenged in court.

Robert Routh, Pennsylvania Policy Director for Climate and Energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said overturning the 2009 determination would be unlawful and contrary to science.

”The science in 2009 — 16 years ago now — was clear about the risks of climate change, and in 2025 it has become even more clear,” Routh said. “There's been unprecedented heat waves, severe rainstorms and supercharged hurricanes — all of which are affected by and accelerated by climate change.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2f1b24/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+11/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwesa%2Ffiles%2F202101%2Fclairton_coke_works.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 07:04:04.629890

Head of the Human Resources Development Agency (BPSDM) of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), Prahoro Yulijanto Nurtjahyo, asserted that the energy transition must be realised through concrete actions that create economic value, especially in the form of employment.

“If there are no projects, then there are no jobs. It’s as simple as that,” said Prahoro when speaking at the Energy Mineral Festival 2025 discussion session, which was broadcast online on Thursday, 31 July. According to him, building an energy transition narrative without execution will only be an illusion.

He gave an example of a solar power plant (PLTS) development project by New Wheel that was constrained due to the lack of skilled labour. “Finding competent solar panel installation technicians is still difficult. This shows that our human resources are not fully prepared to enter this sector,” said Prahoro.

The labour issue is crucial because the energy transition is not only about replacing fossil energy sources, but also about social and economic transformation. MEMR’s BPSDM noted that there are 3,764 types of jobs emerging in the energy sector, including the green energy subsector. However, only 487 jobs are entirely new; the rest are old jobs that require increased competence according to new challenges.

Of Indonesia’s total labour force of 140 million, only around 34 million people have vocational education, and around 15 million have a bachelor’s degree or higher.

“We are now in the demographic window that will peak in 2030 – just five years away. If not utilised, this opportunity will be lost,” Prahoro warned.

He emphasised the importance of cross-sector collaboration between the government, industry, educational institutions and the media to accelerate the preparation of human resources for the energy transition. Education curricula and training programmes, according to him, must be aligned with the competency needs of the future energy industry, especially in the new and renewable energy (NRE) sector.

“We have prepared a map of work needs and competencies. It is just a matter of how universities and training institutions can utilise and adjust quickly. It’s a race against time,” he emphasised.

Appropriate certification and training schemes are also key. Without a well-prepared workforce, NRE projects could be delayed or even fail to be realised, resulting in lost potential for job creation and investment.

Prahoro concludes that the success of the national energy transition is primarily determined by the extent to which the country can build a strong human resources foundation.

“Narratives are good, but if they do not give birth to real projects and work, then we are just repeating the old mistakes: a lot of talk, minimal results,” he concluded. (Hartatik)

These wind energy areas could hypothetically be re-designated by a future administration or the policy reversed, according to the Interior Department employee.","The move comes just a day after Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered his staff to stop ​“preferential treatment for wind projects” and falsely called wind energy ​“unreliable.” Analysts say that offshore wind power can be a reliable form of carbon-free energy, especially in New England, where the region’s grid operator has called it critical to grid stability. It also follows the Trump administration’s monthslong assault on the industry, which has included multiple attacks on in-progress projects.

Amid federal setbacks, Maine ‘closely tracking’ development of Canadian offshore wind

Figuring out the best spot to place offshore wind is an involved undertaking. The proposed areas start off enormous and, according to the Interior staffer, undergo a careful, multiyear winnowing process to settle on the official ​“wind energy area.” Smaller lease areas are later carved out of these broader expanses.

Take the process for designating the wind energy area known as ​“Central Atlantic 2,” which started back in 2023 and is now dead in the water.

The draft area — or ​“call area” — started out as a thick belt roughly 40 miles wide and reached from the southernmost tip of New Jersey to the northern border of South Carolina, according to maps on BOEM’s website. Multiple agencies, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and NASA, then provided input on where that initial area might have been problematic. NASA, for example, maintains a launch site on Virginia’s Wallops Island and in 2024 found that nearby wind turbines could interfere with the agency’s instrumentation and radio frequencies.

The winnowing didn’t stop there. By 2024, according to BOEM’s website, its staff was hosting in-person public meetings from Atlantic City, New Jersey, to Morehead City, North Carolina, to gather input from fishermen, tourism outfitters, and other stakeholders. Under a wind-friendly administration, a final designation and lease sale notice would have likely been released this year or by 2026, based on a timeline posted to BOEM’s website.

But the Trump administration is no friend to offshore wind.

Trump officials have repeatedly targeted wind projects by pulling permits and even halting one wind farm during construction. Last month, Trump’s ​“big, beautiful bill” sent federal tax credits to an early grave, requiring wind developers who want to use the incentives to either start construction by July 2026 or place turbines in service by the end of 2027. The move is particularly devastating for offshore projects not already underway. Currently, five major offshore wind farms are under construction in the U.S., and when they come online, they will help states from Virginia to Massachusetts meet their rising energy demand with carbon-free power.

Wednesday’s order halts all work on Central Atlantic 2 and similar areas, like one near Guam, and also revokes completely finalized wind energy areas with strong state support.

Stalin, on Monday (August 4, 2025), inaugurated Vietnamese electric vehicle (EV) maker VinFast’s first manufacturing plant in India at Thoothukudi.

Spread across 408 acres at the SIPCOT industrial complex in Sillanatham in Thoothukudi district, the plant is expected to generate over 3,500 jobs in the next five years. It is part of a ₹16,000-crore investment pact inked between VinFast and the Tamil Nadu government during the Global Investors Meet last year.

The plant will initially have a production capacity of 50,000 vehicles per year, with the potential to reach 1,50,000 to meet future demand.

Speaking after inaugurating the plant, Mr. Stalin said the facility was built in record time – within 17 months of the groundbreaking ceremony.

Highlighting Tamil Nadu’s reputation as a manufacturing powerhouse, he said, “Chennai is India’s Detroit.” He added that Thoothukudi was also fast emerging as an automotive hub.

Pointing out that VinFast had provided jobs to hundreds of local youth under the ‘Naan Mudhalvan’ initiative, he said its investments would drive growth and development not only in Thoothukudi but also in other southern districts of the State.

Noting that VinFast’s parent company Vingroup also had other business interests including education, real estate, and hospitality, he invited the Vietnamese conglomerate to bring more investments into Tamil Nadu, adding that the State government would provide all necessary support.

‘Sign’ifying the launch

The Chief Minister put his signature on the bonnet of a VF7 model to launch the rollout of cars from the shop floor.

Industries Minister T.R.B. Rajaa said that around 18 months ago, many people were sceptical about the possibility of setting up a car manufacturing plant in Thoothukudi. But now, the facility was up and running, he added.

Pham Sanh Chau, CEO of VinFast Asia, said, “We aim to develop it [Thoothukudi plant] into VinFast’s largest export hub for South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In fact, we have already secured orders from several countries across these regions. In close collaboration with the Tamil Nadu Government, VinFast is working to transform the area into the EV capital of South Asia.”

It also follows the Trump administration’s monthslong assault on the industry, which has included multiple attacks on in-progress projects.

Amid federal setbacks, Maine ‘closely tracking’ development of Canadian offshore wind

Figuring out the best spot to place offshore wind is an involved undertaking. The proposed areas start off enormous and, according to the Interior staffer, undergo a careful, multiyear winnowing process to settle on the official ​“wind energy area.” Smaller lease areas are later carved out of these broader expanses.

Take the process for designating the wind energy area known as ​“Central Atlantic 2,” which started back in 2023 and is now dead in the water.

The draft area — or ​“call area” — started out as a thick belt roughly 40 miles wide and reached from the southernmost tip of New Jersey to the northern border of South Carolina, according to maps on BOEM’s website. Multiple agencies, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and NASA, then provided input on where that initial area might have been problematic. NASA, for example, maintains a launch site on Virginia’s Wallops Island and in 2024 found that nearby wind turbines could interfere with the agency’s instrumentation and radio frequencies.

The winnowing didn’t stop there. By 2024, according to BOEM’s website, its staff was hosting in-person public meetings from Atlantic City, New Jersey, to Morehead City, North Carolina, to gather input from fishermen, tourism outfitters, and other stakeholders. Under a wind-friendly administration, a final designation and lease sale notice would have likely been released this year or by 2026, based on a timeline posted to BOEM’s website.

But the Trump administration is no friend to offshore wind.

Trump officials have repeatedly targeted wind projects by pulling permits and even halting one wind farm during construction. Last month, Trump’s ​“big, beautiful bill” sent federal tax credits to an early grave, requiring wind developers who want to use the incentives to either start construction by July 2026 or place turbines in service by the end of 2027. The move is particularly devastating for offshore projects not already underway. Currently, five major offshore wind farms are under construction in the U.S., and when they come online, they will help states from Virginia to Massachusetts meet their rising energy demand with carbon-free power.

Wednesday’s order halts all work on Central Atlantic 2 and similar areas, like one near Guam, and also revokes completely finalized wind energy areas with strong state support. One example is in the Gulf of Maine, where Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has been a fierce advocate for the emerging renewable sector.

These wind energy areas could hypothetically be re-designated by a future administration or the policy reversed, according to the Interior Department employee. Still, in the best case, that means developers will have to wait several more years for new lease areas to become available, further slowing down an industry whose projects already take many years to go through permitting and construction.

On today’s episode of CBT Now, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of insights at Cox Automotive, joins us to break down the report’s findings and what they mean for the remainder of 2025.

According to the report, U.S. EV sales declined 6.3% year over year in Q2, closely matching Cox Automotive’s projections. Still, the market showed signs of resilience with nearly 5% growth quarter over quarter, driven in part by consumers rushing to take advantage of the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit before its expiration. Tesla, which still leads the EV market, saw a 12% drop in sales, weighing down the overall numbers. Excluding Tesla, EV sales were largely flat, with some automakers, like Chevrolet, posting growth thanks to new offerings like the Equinox EV.

Valdez Streaty emphasized that the EV market continues to face several headwinds. Price remains a top concern, with EVs carrying an average premium of around $10,000 over gas-powered vehicles. Meanwhile, infrastructure limitations and regulatory uncertainty continue to challenge broader adoption. Despite these barriers, leasing is emerging as a key driver of growth, now accounting for approximately 60% of EVs on the road. Leasing not only lowers monthly payments, but also addresses consumer concerns over battery longevity and depreciation.

Additionally, Valdez Streaty underscores the importance of educating consumers about EV battery warranties, which typically last 8 to 10 years or up to 100,000 miles. She notes that this knowledge gap can fuel hesitation among buyers unfamiliar with EV ownership.

Another key issue she touched on was dealer readiness. During the conversation, host Jim Fitzpatrick highlights how fewer than 15% of new car salespeople currently drive EVs themselves. Valdaz Streaty notes that the lack of firsthand experience can hinder their ability to effectively guide customers through the transition, making education and local engagement efforts increasingly critical for retailers.

“The EV market is very dynamic and complex. It’s not just about incentives; it’s about infrastructure, pricing, and consumer education.”

Meanwhile, competition in the EV space is intensifying. General Motors and Honda have gained ground in the first half of 2025 with broader lineups and competitive incentives, while Tesla has seen its market share slip due to product delays and ongoing brand challenges. The expiration of federal tax credits in September is expected to drive a short-term sales spike in Q3, followed by a likely dip in Q4. Ongoing state-level incentives and OEM strategies will remain key to shaping adoption moving forward.

Moreover, the used EV market is accelerating rapidly, with a record 100,000 units sold in Q2. Used EV prices are nearing parity with used internal combustion engine models, offering more affordable entry points for buyers. Valdez Streaty also highlighted the potential future impact of low-cost, high-quality EV imports from China, although timelines remain unclear.

Nevertheless, Valdez Streaty said that while EVs are a vital part of the industry’s future, the transition remains complicated. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid models continue to serve as crucial options for many consumers as the market adapts to shifting regulations and evolving consumer preferences.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08.04.25-Stephanie-Valdez-Streaty.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 06:02:22.161975

""To build what customers really want is going to be a tailwind for us,"" said Ford CEO Jim Farley, citing what he called a ""multi-billion dollar opportunity"" over the next couple of years.
Trump ditched his predecessor's ambitious CO2 emissions targets and canceled California's EV mandates (although 11 states are suing to block that effort).
His administration is also erasing consumer tax credits for EV purchases and repealing existing fuel economy targets and CO2 emissions standards.
By removing penalties for non-compliance, the government is also eliminating any incentive for carmakers to buy regulatory credits from overachieving rivals.","For all their complaints about how unfair President Trump's tariffs are for U.S. automakers, the industry seems quite pleased with his environmental policies, which lift a massive regulatory cost burden.

Why it matters: Trump's agenda could wind up as a net win for the auto industry, allowing them to sell more high-margin, U.S.-built trucks and SUVs for the foreseeable future, while avoiding penalties for not building enough electric vehicles.

Stunning stat: Together, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis are projecting nearly $10 billion in gross tariff costs this year.

For the most part, they're eating those taxes rather than passing them on to consumers.

Yes, but: Trump's deregulation policies could help them offset most or all of that burden, depending on the outcome of continuing trade talks.

Driving the news: In quarterly earnings calls with analysts, the CEOs of the Detroit 3 said Trump's reversal of Biden-era EV policies will boost their finances.

""To build what customers really want is going to be a tailwind for us,"" said Ford CEO Jim Farley, citing what he called a ""multi-billion dollar opportunity"" over the next couple of years.

GM CEO Mary Barra had a similar message, calling Trump's regulatory policies a ""huge opportunity"" that allow the automaker to keep selling profitable trucks and SUVs while EV demand slowly builds.

Stellantis, meanwhile, is bringing back muscle cars and Hemi engines now that it's no longer obliged to produce EVs and fuel-sipping engines. ""And this will mean to us a lot of additional profit,"" said CEO Antonio Filosa, trying to steer a turnaround.

The big picture: The Trump administration has been moving quickly to unwind Biden's EV-favorable policies.

Trump ditched his predecessor's ambitious CO2 emissions targets and canceled California's EV mandates (although 11 states are suing to block that effort).

His administration is also erasing consumer tax credits for EV purchases and repealing existing fuel economy targets and CO2 emissions standards.

By removing penalties for non-compliance, the government is also eliminating any incentive for carmakers to buy regulatory credits from overachieving rivals.

Zoom in: Ford, for example, said last year it had contracts to purchase about $3.8 billion of non-compliance credits from other carmakers — presumably Tesla, which said in October that it had long-term contracts to sell $4.7 billion of credits.

As of this week, however, Farley told analysts that Ford has already reduced that commitment by nearly $1.5 billion — money that can instead be invested in other parts of the business or to improve profits.

On the flip side, Telsa is staring down a ""few rough quarters"" as support for EVs goes away and it pivots toward autonomy and robots starting next year.

Aside from vanishing tax breaks that will likely dampen EV demand, Tesla is also losing that easy money — $15 billion since 2012 — it made from selling regulatory credits.

What to watch: While the Detroit 3 welcome the relief from regulatory pressures, they're still anxious to see how Trump will revamp the existing trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada on which they depend.",https://images.axios.com/XC3j1vy2BdYILYmrc5ZTdYaDVBM=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2020/03/20/1584669009565.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 06:01:31.645431

Great British Energy will also be headquartered in Aberdeen, to drive clean power generation across the UK, boosting homegrown energy.

The Chancellor’s visit comes as defence spending rises to 2.6% of GDP and figures from 23/24 reveal that MOD spend maintains 26,100 skilled jobs across Scotland. The Spending Review also committed £250 million to secure the future of HMNB Clyde – the first stage of a multi-decade, multi-billion renewal project and all three Clyde shipyards are currently fulfilling contracts for the Royal Navy.

The funding will also see the addition of three new E-7 Wedgetail aircraft be added to the RAF’s fleet, which will see more jobs created at the Boeing base in Moray.

”But sometimes what’s less visible is the economic impact on small businesses in our community over time.“ Whether it’s hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, or ice storms, small businesses are more vulnerable to climate shocks than larger businesses, said Shehryar Nabi, a senior research associate at the Aspen Institute Financial Security Program.
He co-wrote a recent report outlining the hurdles small businesses face from severe weather.
These waves of impacts are coupled with limited support options for small businesses in both the long and short term.
“When we think about fortifying small businesses,” she said, “it’s about going beyond a physical structure.”","The United States is home to millions of small businesses that form the backbone of countless communities. Even during the best of times keeping shops solvent can be a struggle, but when climate-driven disasters strike the impact on mom and pops can be particularly devastating — and prolonged.

“The news coverage has definitely focused on the physical destruction,” said Kyle McCurry. He is the director of public relations for Explore Asheville, an organization that promotes the North Carolina city, which Hurricane Helene pummeled with torrential rain and flooding last fall. ”But sometimes what’s less visible is the economic impact on small businesses in our community over time.“

Whether it’s hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, or ice storms, small businesses are more vulnerable to climate shocks than larger businesses, said Shehryar Nabi, a senior research associate at the Aspen Institute Financial Security Program. He co-wrote a recent report outlining the hurdles small businesses face from severe weather. They can be hobbled by a range of challenges, from limited preparation resources to a lack of post-disaster financing.

“One reason we focused on small businesses here is because of their importance to the U.S. economy,” said Nabi. That was certainly the case in Asheville, a city known for its artists, breweries and boutiques. Helene not only destroyed homes and upended lives, it sent the region’s economy into a tailspin.

In 2023, McCurry said, visitors to the area spent $2.9 billion. Last year, Helene hit Appalachia right before the busy fall foliage season, when tourists flock to places like Asheville to see the leaves turn. McMurry says the storm, which knocked out some municipal services for weeks, led to a 20 to 40 percent drop in annual business revenue.

Ten months later, a slew of businesses haven’t reopened: Vivian’s restaurant, Pleb Urban Winery and TRVE Brewery, to name a few. Another was New Origin Brewery, which started pouring in 2021 and soon had fans lauding it as their favorite brewery in Asheville. Although the floodwaters inundated the business, the bulk of the destruction occurred when railroad cars floated off nearby tracks and crashed into the building.

“There’s not a way to get money for damages in that scenario,” said Dan Juhnke, one of New Origin’s founders. Even after maxing out the brewery’s flood insurance claim, it wasn’t enough to cover the damage. The only other option was to take on more debt from the federal Small Business Administration, or SBA, which didn’t seem prudent. Ultimately,Juhnke and his business partner decided to apply for a Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, funded buyout program that purchases flood-damaged property and limits rebuilding as a way to mitigate the damage from future storms.

“We signed up for it and have been waiting almost a year now,” said Juhnke.

McCurry estimates that, overall, around 85 percent of Asheville businesses have reopened in some form, which is relatively good news. According to 2014 national data from FEMA and the U.S. Department of Labor, 40 percent of small businesses do not reopen after a natural disaster and another 25 percent shutter within a year.

These waves of impacts are coupled with limited support options for small businesses in both the long and short term. While FEMA has individual and public assistance programs, there is little if any funding for businesses. The SBA often offers low-interest loans, but the paperwork can be burdensome and the money might not start arriving for months. Only 14 percent of businesses were able to rely on support from the federal government, according to an analysis of the 2021 Small Business Credit Survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

“Support makes a meaningful difference,” said Nabi. “For a lot of businesses it is the difference between closing down and surviving, But it doesn’t reach all the businesses that could benefit.”

State and local governments, private lenders and community fundraising are other potential sources of money. New Origin, for example, raised more than $100,000 via a GoFundMe campaign but fell short of its $300,000 goal. The fund that Explore Asheville established has brought in $2.1 million, which has been awarded to more than 500 businesses.

Still, Nabi says, these avenues don’t usually address one of the toughest challenges facing businesses after a storm: liquidity. Even a month or two of disrupted cash flow can devastate some operations, which is why experts point to pre-disaster planning as one of the most effective steps a business can take to help protect itself.

“Often businesses see contingency planning as a distraction from the core thing they want to do,” said Benjamin Collier, an associate professor in the Department of Risk and Insurance at the Wisconsin School of Business. But things like better understanding your insurance coverage, or where to move inventory in the event of a threat, should be routine steps for business owners and generally aren’t expensive.

“The natural tendency for many small business owners to be reluctant to really engage with the risks that they’re exposed to,” he said. “This is a call to have more buffers and be more cautious.”

Nabi also underlines the importance of planning, but says structural change could help as well. Greater use of parametric insurance, which automatically pays out when a specific event like a disaster happens, would allow quicker access to funds. Shifting more money to pre-disaster preparation could help businesses avoid the worst impacts of a storm, too.

“The financing for preparation is limited compared to what’s available post disaster,” said Nabi.

Earlier this year, the counties he oversees saw historically devastating wildfires and one thing that he’s noticed was that, unlike with residential properties, insurance companies hadn’t offered small businesses discounts for any improvements they might have made to make their buildings more fire-resilient.

“As it stands, there is no incentive that exists for this work,” said Nye. “A lot of stuff just focuses on home owners.”

Governments often don’t do enough to include small businesses in their recovery plans either, contends Kristen Fanarakis, associate director, small business policy and innovation at the nonprofit Milken Institute. She pointed to a landscaper in the Asheville area who spent weeks helping clear debris after Helene without pay and ended up facing eviction. Those are the kind of businesses, she said, that municipalities should be hiring and including in rebuilding efforts.

More broadly, a report Fanarakis wrote called for a cross-agency “Small Business Resilience czar,” standardized disaster assistance forms and quicker grant dispersal, among other recommendations. She called the current system “very reactionary” and argues for increased attention to not just the immediate impacts of disasters but the long-term economic fallout as well.

“When we think about fortifying small businesses,” she said, “it’s about going beyond a physical structure.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/asheville-business-hurricane.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-08-04 06:02:46.026115

In the latest filing, Vingroup stated that it will invest approximately $14.3 billion (373.84 trillion dong) in the construction of a large seaport and logistics center in the northern port city of Haiphong, Bloomberg reported.

Construction work will take place in three phases from 2026 to 2040. The company expects to fund 15% of the project using its own capital and raise the remaining 85% from external sources.

The move adds to Vingroup’s broader expansion plans.

In April, Vingroup broke ground on a coastal tourism and urban development complex near Ho Chi Minh City, with an investment capital of approximately 282.8 trillion dong. It aims to achieve 25.5 gigawatt-hours of renewable and liquefied (LNG) power capacity by 2030.

VinFast, Vingroup’s electric vehicle unit, is also making a big bet on India as a sourcing hub and potential future export destination.

At the inauguration of its new plant in Thoothukudi, VinFast Asia CEO Pham Sanh Chau told Reuters the company is actively speaking with existing component suppliers, some of whom are exploring a partial shift of their operations to India.

He also mentioned that a Vietnamese plastic manufacturer has expressed interest in relocating its production to support VinFast’s operations in India.

VinFast is expected to begin delivering its vehicles to Indian showrooms later this month, though pricing and launch details haven’t been announced.

The company previously signed a deal with the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu (NSE: ) — home to “India’s Detroit” automobile hub of Chennai — targeting a $2 billion investment, including a $500 million commitment over the first five years, to set up operations in the state. The plant will eventually be capable of producing up to 150,000 EVs annually.

The India facility is already attracting attention beyond local borders, according to Chau’s statements to the media.

Chau said VinFast has received initial orders from Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Mauritius, signaling that the factory could soon become an export hub, even as it focuses first on serving domestic demand.

Globally, VinFast aims to deliver 200,000 vehicles by 2025, which represents more than a doubling from last year. In the first half of this year, it sold around 72,100 units, mainly in Vietnam.

Emergency Department Visits Reach Five-Year High

The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) has documented more than 3,300 emergency department visits for heat-related illness from May 1 to July 12, 2025 — nearly double the average of 1,675 visits recorded during the same period from 2020 to 2024. This marks the highest number of heat-related emergency visits in the past five years.

“We are seeing more people coming to emergency departments across the state with heat-related illnesses this summer,” said Dr. Zack Moore, NCDHHS State Epidemiologist.

Vulnerable Populations at Greatest Risk

While heat-related illnesses can affect anyone regardless of age or physical condition, certain groups face elevated risks, according to health officials. These high-risk populations include:

Outdoor workers

Infants and children

Older adults

Pregnant individuals

Athletes

Low-income individuals

People with underlying health conditions

Warning Signs and Symptoms

Health officials emphasize that recognizing heat illness symptoms is crucial for preventing serious complications, including death. Key warning signs include:

Heavy sweating

Paleness

Muscle cramps

Racing or weak pulse

Dizziness

Headache

Fainting

Nausea or vomiting

State Response and Alert System

To combat the growing threat, NCDHHS has activated its Heat Health Alert System, which issues warnings when forecasted temperatures reach dangerous levels. From May 1 to July 18, 2025, the system distributed more than 900 county-level alerts in both English and Spanish across North Carolina.

Residents can sign up for heat alerts by visiting the NCDHHS Climate and Health webpage.

Safety Recommendations

State health officials recommend the following precautions during hot weather:

Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day without waiting until thirsty. Limit alcohol and caffeine consumption.

Limit Outdoor Exposure: Avoid outdoor activities during peak heat hours when possible. Wear light, loose-fitting clothing and take frequent breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas.

Seek Air Conditioning: When temperatures exceed 95 degrees and air conditioning is unavailable at home, seek refuge in cooler public buildings.

Stay Informed: Monitor heat alerts and local weather forecasts to plan outdoor activities safely.

Comprehensive Prevention Efforts

The NCDHHS Division of Public Health has implemented multiple initiatives to combat extreme heat impacts beyond surveillance and alert systems:

Distributed 1,300 high-velocity cooling fans to farmworkers statewide and partners in the Sandhills region

Developed specialized training programs for healthcare providers treating heat-related illnesses in farmworkers, in collaboration with the NCDHHS Office of Rural Health

Provided educational materials and protective equipment — including water bottles, cooling towels, and hats with heat prevention guidance — to at-risk populations

Partnered with the NC Department of Environmental Quality to lead the Extreme Heat Cohort Program, helping local governments and organizations develop comprehensive heat action plans

As summer temperatures continue to climb, state officials urge all North Carolina residents to take heat-related health risks seriously and implement recommended safety measures to protect themselves and their communities.",https://cdn.socast.io/3922/sites/29/2025/06/09093834/NCDHHS-logo.jpeg,N,,2025-08-04 06:02:49.886121

,Clean Energy ,2025-08-04 08:44:24+00:00,Canary Media,California halts building code updates in a blow to electrification - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/ca-ab-130-code-housing,"The law permits the state commission and local governments to update building codes in emergencies to protect health and safety.
​“Building codes have never been what drives high costs in California — certainly not the energy code,” Borgeson said.
​“The building codes overall are required [by law] to be cost-effective.” Any up-front costs must be outweighed by savings.
Research also shows that building all-electric homes is typically faster and cheaper than building those with gas.
But Vander Klay argues that lawmakers should view strong building codes as a way to help create abundance.","At the end of June, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed into law AB 130, a sweeping bill that aims to make it easier to build housing, reforms that many lawmakers and experts agree are long overdue given the state’s severe housing crisis.

But one provision could needlessly slow the state’s progress on its climate and clean energy goals, according to advocates. The law pauses updates to state and local building codes — the mandatory construction standards meant to ensure that new buildings are safe and energy efficient — for the next six years.

Buildings account for a quarter of California’s carbon pollution. And the state’s building standards, which are normally revised once every three years, have been a powerful decarbonization tool. The latest statewide energy code, already finalized, takes effect Jan. 1, 2026, and encourages developers to build all-electric homes with both heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters — super-efficient, zero-emissions appliances that are safer than gas-fired options. In addition to updating codes, California has eliminated subsidies for new gas lines.

These regulations are working; ​“California is an electrification-forward state,” said Sean Armstrong, managing principal of Redwood Energy, a design firm specializing in net-zero, all-electric affordable housing development. In 2023, 80% of line extension requests by builders to utilities Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric were electric-only, according to the California Energy Commission, the agency responsible for developing the building energy codes. The commission expects that the majority of new houses built under the latest code will be all-electric.

Now, though, the state will skip a scheduled 2028 residential code update, blocking it from pushing builders to go further to cut emissions. Starting Oct. 1 this year, the new law will also prevent local jurisdictions from updating their own, more ambitious building standards, known as reach codes.

These could include measures not yet enacted in the state rules, such as encouraging heat pumps for multifamily buildings, mandating all-electric renovations, and requiring that broken central air conditioners be replaced with heat pumps that can both warm and cool spaces. That last idea is an inexpensive way to decarbonize heating, according to Matt Vespa, senior attorney at nonprofit Earthjustice.

Seventy-four local governments in California have passed reach codes that encourage or require all-electric new construction. With the pause on updates looming, San Francisco is now racing to get an all-electric requirement for major renovations on the books before the Oct. 1 deadline.

Exception redemption? A path forward

AB 130 does allow for some exceptions that could let local governments implement stricter building requirements even after the cutoff date.

The law permits the state commission and local governments to update building codes in emergencies to protect health and safety. Perhaps the climate emergency will qualify, said Kelly Lyndon, cochair of the advocacy alliance San Diego Building Electrification Coalition.

Cities and counties can also adopt updates that are necessary to carry out greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategies spelled out in their state-mandated general plans. These road maps must have been adopted by June 10, 2025, and code updates can’t ban gas.

“At least one of these exceptions is going to work for folks who want to make further progress on climate,” said Merrian Borgeson, director of California policy with the Natural Resources Defense Council’s Climate & Energy Program. ​“Unfortunately … [AB 130] makes it more complicated and creates more red tape.”

Vespa pointed out that many jurisdictions may be able to take advantage of the exception for preexisting aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among the 482 city plans, 409 mention ​“greenhouse gas” — an indicator that local leaders are pursuing emissions cuts. The phrase also shows up in 52 of 58 county general plans.

Sacramento’s general plan, for example, stresses ​“a continued focus on improving the performance of both new and existing buildings.” A local code update to swap old air conditioners with heat pumps could fit within AB 130’s exemption, Vespa said.

But it’s too soon to say who might try the strategy first. ​“Some jurisdictions are really looking towards their legal experts to interpret [the exception language],” said Madison Vander Klay, senior manager of government affairs at the nonprofit Building Decarbonization Coalition.

But even with its exclusions, the moratorium ​“is a big problem for emissions, affordability, and cost savings,” Vander Klay said.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D) and Assemblyperson Nick Schultz (D), who authored the initial standalone bill to pause building codes, AB 306, championed the idea as a way to help solve California’s housing affordability crisis and spur rapid recovery after the wildfires that torched areas of Los Angeles County in January. That bill eventually got folded into AB 130.

“California home prices are double the national average, and the rent is too damn high. So many folks cannot afford to live in California,” Schultz said on the Assembly floor in April. ​“This pause … will provide stability and certainty in the housing construction market by temporarily freezing the standards by which people need to meet to construct their home.”

It’s unclear whether the bill will actually make homes more affordable, though. ​“Building codes have never been what drives high costs in California — certainly not the energy code,” Borgeson said.

A 2015 study conducted by the University of California LA for Pacific Gas & Electric backs that up; the authors noted that they couldn’t find a statistically significant relationship between California’s energy-efficiency code and home construction costs.

“There isn’t a lot of evidence that waiving codes helps affordability,” Vander Klay said. ​“The building codes overall are required [by law] to be cost-effective.” Any up-front costs must be outweighed by savings.

The standards have delivered, sparing Californians more than $100 billion in avoided energy costs over the last five decades, according to the Energy Commission. The code that takes effect next year is expected to net more than $4.8 billion in savings over 30 years.

Research also shows that building all-electric homes is typically faster and cheaper than building those with gas. A 2019 analysis by energy consultancy E3, for example, estimated that building a new all-electric home in most parts of California costs about $3,000 to $10,000 less than building a home that’s also equipped with gas. Similarly, a 2022 study by the New Buildings Institute found that constructing an all-electric single-family home in New York costs about $8,000 less than a home with gas. A UC Berkeley team used these and other findings to conclude in an April report that the most cost-effective way to rebuild after the LA fires is likely all-electric.

With the moratorium, the commission will have to skip the 2028 residential code cycle. That omission could result in tens of millions of dollars in lost utility bill savings for households, according to the Building Decarbonization Coalition. Notably, the commission will be able to work on the following code update, so it can take effect as planned in 2032.

In the wake of AB 130, the Building Decarbonization Coalition’s Vander Klay is urging the Legislature to reauthorize California’s successful cap-and-trade program to support home electrification by making heat pumps and other decarbonizing tech more affordable. ​“There is still an opportunity … this year for the state to look at carving out funding to provide incentives,” she said.

In passing AB 130, state lawmakers took aim at rules that they contend stifle development. Underpinning this strategy is a notion popularized by a recent book, ​“Abundance.” Authors Ezra Klein of The New York Times and Derek Thompson, contributing writer at The Atlantic, make the case that well-intentioned but overly protective regulations can foster scarcity — in this case, of housing — and thus interfere with leaders’ ability to deliver on the promises of a better life.

But Vander Klay argues that lawmakers should view strong building codes as a way to help create abundance. ​“Abundance is this idea that we should all have access to housing, we should all be able to afford our energy bills … we should all be able to have access to clean air and clean water and healthy homes,” Vander Klay said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Housing-Construction-Richmond-CA.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a872c448ec1fe582036e8008267d9c88,N,,2025-08-04 07:01:49.495086

HASI's money comes in through a few different doors: interest and securitization income from lending, special accounting gains from tax-advantaged projects (using what’s known as the hypothetical liquidation at book value, or HLBV, method), profits from selling assets, and fees for co-investing and structuring deals. Climate finance itself is booming, thanks to global pushes for decarbonization and electrification. The OECD says the world needs to invest $6.9 trillion every year into climate-friendly infrastructure to meet global climate goals by 2030. HASI likes to set itself apart with its climate-first focus and investment-grade ratings—two things even big banks and utility yield companies can't always match. Notably, HASI's strategic partnerships, including a $2 billion co-investment with KKR (CCH1), and its knack for structuring deals, give it a leading edge among companies tied to the energy transition.

Recent Performance

On August 4, 2025, HASI's stock closed at $25.69, down from $32.38 a year prior. That works out to a total return of –20.7%. The S&P 500, by comparison, delivered a +13.6% return over a similar period (as of June 30, 2025)—meaning HASI has underperformed the market by a hefty 34 percentage points. What's behind that drop? For starters, higher interest rates raised HASI’s funding expenses (interest costs ticked up from $62 million to $65 million year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025), which squeezed profits from new investments. A rocky run for power prices hurt the company’s earnings from equity method investments. On top of that, a change from REIT status to a standard C-corp in mid-2024 means HASI now pays full corporate tax, slicing into its net income.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

HASI’s managed assets nudged up from $12.9 billion in March 2024 to $13.1 billion by March 2025, though the portfolio itself dipped slightly from $6.4 billion to $6.3 billion as some assets were rotated out. In the first quarter of 2025, total revenue came in at $97 million—down 8% from the same period last year, mainly because giant asset sales in Q1 2024 made for a tough comparison. Management expects adjusted earnings per share to grow at an 8–10% annual clip from 2024 to 2026, starting from a $2.23 baseline. That outlook is staked on a diverse $5.5 billion project pipeline and high yields from new investments (more than 10.5%). Long-term growth should get a boost from higher U.S. electricity demand as transport and industry go electric, continued support from federal policy (including tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act), and ongoing grid upgrades.

Quality & Moat

HASI boasts a strong balance sheet featuring an investment-grade credit rating, which helps secure cheaper, longer-term financing. But there’s a catch: net debt to EBITDA is a sky-high 180×—compared to the market’s 1.3×—as a result of heavy reliance on securitization. The company’s return on invested capital is 8.5%, well below its own five-year average of 48% and the market’s 12%. This reflects both the effects of complicated tax-equity structures and large depreciation in equity-accounted projects. Free cash flow yield is deeply negative at –19.3%, while the market stands at +2.1%, mostly due to rising borrowing costs and equity method cash adjustments outpacing operating cash inflows. HASI stands out for its proprietary CarbonCount® project scoring, deal-making know-how, and strong relationships with both developers and institutional investors.

Valuation

HASI trades at a forward P/E of 25.7×, right in line with the S&P 500’s 25.0× and its REIT peers. But look at its enterprise value to sales: 63×, compared to a 4.4× market average. That’s a huge premium, reflecting the company’s durable revenue streams, its ESG focus, and a promising project pipeline. Still, with sky-high leverage and negative free cash flow, better margins or lower debt might be needed to justify the price tag.

Market Sentiment

Wall Street’s feeling bullish: nine analysts rate HASI a “Strong Buy,” and the average 12-month price target is $38.33, suggesting potential upside of 49% from current levels. Short interest remains pretty tame at under 5% of shares, and institutions with an ESG focus make up a substantial chunk of shareholders. Insiders have been mostly quiet since HASI switched to C-corp status, though management did chip in on a $200 million revolver extension. Social media chatter is all over the map, with macro worries and rising rate fears keeping the mood cautious.

Key Risks

Interest‐Rate Sensitivity: HASI’s debt costs are mostly floating or hedged, but rate hikes can still pinch net investment margins.

Leverage: With net debt to EBITDA at 180×—miles above market norms—HASI faces real refinancing and covenant risks if asset returns slip.

Project Performance: Credit and construction risks in renewables could knock equity earnings and force HASI to set aside higher provisions.

Tax Equity & Policy: If U.S. renewable tax credits change or key incentives expire, the returns on new projects could take a hit.

Bull Case

Attractive Pipeline: A project pipeline topping $5.5 billion, plus the KKR CCH1 partnership, positions HASI for more than $2 billion in annual closings.

High Yield on New Investments: New investment yields are coming in above 10.5%—comfortably outpacing HASI’s funding costs of less than 6.5%.

ESG Mandate Tailwinds: Global commitments to decarbonization, along with U.S. policy support like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, are strong long-term growth drivers.

Investment-Grade Profile: Achieving a second investment-grade rating lowers funding costs and gives HASI broader access to institutional money.

Bear Case

High Leverage: That 180× net debt to EBITDA ratio makes HASI especially risky in a world of rising rates—and it could clip the company’s wings for future growth.

Negative Free Cash Flow: A free cash flow yield of –19% means HASI can’t fund new projects from existing cash, and may need to issue more shares to raise cash.

Margin Compression: Operating margins are weak at 6%, trailing peers at around 18%—thanks to tax drag and lower-return asset rotations. It could take time to improve.

Valuation Premium: The EV/sales ratio of 63× says investors already expect near-flawless performance—so any misstep could spark a market pullback.

On Our Radar

Q2 2025 Earnings: Coming up August 7, 2025, after the market closes, with a conference call at 5pm ET.

IRA Tax Credit Phase-Down: Critical clean energy tax credits start phasing down in 2025–2026, which could impact how attractive new projects are for HASI.

CCH1 Milestone: By year-end 2025, hitting the $2 billion KKR co-investment target would be a key win for HASI’s growth ambitions.

North Carolina House Bill 569 — which remains under consideration — would require polluters to reimburse public water systems for the cost of cleaning up PFAS contamination.","By Will Atwater

This week, state lawmakers made it more difficult to establish regulations that potentially protect the environment and public health with the passage of House Bill 402. Critics say the measure creates significant roadblocks to addressing air and water pollution.

The new law, known as the “Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Scrutiny (REINS) Act,” requires rules with a projected financial impact of $1 million over five years to be approved by a two-thirds majority of the rulemaking body making the rule. For rules with impacts over $10 million, unanimous approval is required. And if a proposed regulation is expected to cost $20 million or more, it must be ratified — formally approved — by the General Assembly before it can take effect.

Environmental advocates warn that the law, combined with the Trump administration’s push to weaken federal environmental protections, could stall urgently needed responses to emerging and growing environmental and public health threats.

“Lawmakers who passed this bill did not have the best interests of North Carolinians at heart,” said Mary Maclean Asbill, in a release. Asbill is the director of the Southern Environmental Law Center’s North Carolina offices. “This new law marks an awful turning point for families and communities across North Carolina when elected officials in the state legislature ignore serious illnesses and deaths in favor of polluters’ profits.”

Asbill also pointed to potential economic consequences, arguing that the new law will likely increase the costs to consumers of Duke Energy power, which she argues is a monopoly in North Carolina

Asbill also estimated that the aspect of the law could cost the state, “$23 billion in additional electricity bill payments over the next few decades and all but guaranteeing a more polluted and riskier future.”

House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) dismissed criticism of the legislation, saying it’s intended to ensure transparency and accountability — not to hinder progress.

“What we had in the REINS Act was a situation where if you have a regulation that is extremely expensive, our position is that it’s something that [the legislature] needs to take a look at, because ultimately, constitutionally, this body appropriates funds in this state,” Hall said.

“It doesn’t mean that we’re always going to turn down a proposed regulation just because it comes over,” he noted. “But I think that often what they’re doing in the agencies and regulatory bodies doesn’t always come to the attention of this body until it’s already implemented and already too late and somebody’s suffering from it.”

Environmental advocates argue that delays in enacting environmental regulations can cause the public to suffer in other ways — including higher costs and increased health risks.

Costs passed on to consumers

Environmental advocates warn that the added red tape may delay or block rules needed to control harmful industrial chemicals — such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and 1,4-dioxane — both linked to adverse health outcomes, including cancer. They say it could also drive up utility costs in the process.

For example, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority spent nearly $50 million in 2022 to install a system that filters PFAS from drinking water. It’s now exploring additional upgrades to better address 1,4-dioxane — a chemical the EPA classifies as a likely human carcinogen. Because no enforceable federal limit exists for 1,4-dioxane, the responsibility for removing it falls to utilities — and ultimately to customers.

That burden comes at a cost. As reported by Port City Daily, the technology needed to better control upstream 1,4-dioxane pollution is expected to cost millions — expenses likely to be passed on to ratepayers.

“If you’re allowing 1,4-dioxane in people’s water, if you’re allowing thousands of different PFAS in drinking water, and you’re not allowing the necessary rulemaking that would remove them, then you’re not protecting the people of North Carolina. You’re not,” said Erin Carey, conservation policy director for the North Carolina Chapter of the Sierra Club.”You’re protecting the polluters.”

Critics argue that protecting the public requires weighing both the costs and benefits of regulations — especially those designed to safeguard health and the environment. But under House Bill 402, only financial costs can be considered, not any benefits flowing from the imposition of a new regulation.

“It is expensive to have clean drinking water, to keep things out of our drinking water that would be harmful for us to ingest,” said Brooks Rainey, SELC lobbyist to the North Carolina General Assembly. “That costs money, but the reason we’re all willing to do it is because the benefit so greatly outweighs the cost. For example, keeping fecal matter out of our drinking water means we don’t have cholera outbreaks.”

Rainey noted, “If we’re only allowed to think about the cost of a rule, every rule is going to look like a burden on industry, and it is a scary road to walk down when the only thing we even think is worth considering is the cost to industry and the health of the people isn’t even taken into consideration.”

“Everything about that bill is kind of rigged to make it harder to enact or keep on the books important environmental protections,” said state Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford), a fierce opponent of the bill.

Where does House Bill 402 leave North Carolinians?

As the cost of living rises, environmental advocates warn that laws like House Bill 402 — which make it harder to implement pollution controls — are forcing public utilities to shoulder the burden of removing hazardous contaminants from drinking water. Without strong “polluter pays” provisions, those costs often end up being passed on to ratepayers.

At the same time, residents are also facing higher insurance premiums and reduced coverage as extreme weather events — including Hurricane Helene, California’s wildfires, and Tropical Storm Chantal — strain the insurance industry’s capacity.

“North Carolina decision-makers have more than enough information to move forward on strong legislative and regulatory actions around PFAS and 1,4-dioxane, whether that is a “polluter pays” bill like H.B. 569 or surface water quality standards,” said Grady O’Brien, water policy manager for the North Carolina Conservation Network.

North Carolina House Bill 569 — which remains under consideration — would require polluters to reimburse public water systems for the cost of cleaning up PFAS contamination. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a wide margin, but has not had any legislative action since the House sent the bill to the Senate in early May. Advocates say HB 569 stands in direct contrast to HB 402, which they argue creates unnecessary red tape and stalls meaningful reform.

Another proposal environmentalists are watching closely is Senate Bill 666, the Water Safety Act, introduced by Senate Majority Leader Michael Lee (R–New Hanover) who represents a district that has been heavily affected by PFAS contamination in the Cape Fear River basin. If passed, it would direct the Environmental Management Commission to establish regulatory limits on PFAS. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Operations in March and has yet to advance.

“It is an essential function of government: we need to be able to regulate, to make rules — otherwise it becomes the wild, wild West out there,” Carey said. “People will start building wherever they want, filling in wetlands wherever they want, discharging chemicals where and when it suits them.

“If there are no regulations, no rules in place, then there is no protection for the environment — and no protection for the people.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/house_chamber-768x427-2.jpg?fit=768%2C427&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-04 06:02:54.304790

According to Bloomberg, Adani is personally heading discussions with BYD executives, which took place as recently as last week. Amid delicate diplomatic relations between New Delhi and Beijing, any prospective partnership between the Adani Group and China’s BYD is expected to be signed through BYD’s subsidiaries in third countries rather than its Shenzhen headquarters, according to sources familiar with the matter who requested anonymity.

The discussions are driven by Adani’s ambition to begin large-scale production of lithium-ion cells for electric vehicles and, more crucially, for stationary energy storage systems—critical to supporting its expansive renewable energy operations. As India’s largest solar power producer, the Adani Group sees battery technology as a cornerstone of its clean energy strategy.

Why BYD Fits the Bill?

Chinese manufacturers currently lead the world in advanced and cost-effective battery technology, and Adani considers a technology-sharing agreement vital to achieving its clean energy goals. While talks are still in the early stages and may not materialize, BYD is seen as a natural partner. The Chinese giant is not only the world’s leading EV maker but also a global leader in rechargeable battery innovation.

However, such a partnership would test the political climate in both countries. India and China remain locked in a long-standing border dispute and are increasingly at odds over global supply chains and manufacturing. China has been limiting the export of technologies and critical components—such as rare earth magnets—to India and Southeast Asia since April. On the other hand, India has withheld visas for BYD’s executives, compelling meetings to be held in neighboring countries.

Adani’s Broader Outreach and Low-Key China Visit

The Adani Group is not limiting its options to BYD. It has also initiated conversations with other Chinese renewable energy firms, including Beijing Welion New Energy Technology Co., the sources said. Adani is reportedly aware of the political hurdles in securing approval for any Chinese partnership.

Although alternative suppliers in Europe and South Korea are available, none can currently compete with the cost-efficiency of Chinese firms. During a discreet trip to China in June, Adani met with companies such as Broad Group and Jinko Solar Co., as confirmed by social media activity and company announcements. However, some firms reportedly declined to meet the delegation, highlighting the sensitive political environment. There has been no response from Beijing Welion as of now.

Expanding Green Ambitions

Adani Green Energy Ltd., the group’s renewable arm, is already India’s largest green power producer with 15.8 GW of operational capacity—over 70% of which comes from solar. It aims to scale up to 50 GW by 2030. The group also operates India’s only ingot and wafer manufacturing facility, alongside 4 GW of solar cell and module capacity.

Looking ahead, the Adani Group plans to deepen its investments across the green energy value chain, including renewable power, green hydrogen, and energy storage. These initiatives are critical to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a carbon-neutral India by 2070. Notably, Adani has also pledged to decarbonize its own operations—including coal power, ports, and airports—under this broader transition.",https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Adani-BYD.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 04:59:30.871910

The New York policy has gained support from climate-conscious communities.
""Ending subsidies for new gas hookups seems like the absolute minimum to me for climate-smart policy.""","New York legislators voted for a bill that will end subsidies for new natural gas line hookups, News10 ABC reported.

The old policy, passed in 1981, fully subsidized homeowners who built within 100 feet of a gas line. All gas customers across the state shared the cost. These subsidized home hookups cost $2,500 to almost $100,000 per customer from 2017 to 2021.

Senate sponsor Liz Krueger said that if Gov. Kathy Hochul signs this bill into law, the change would make energy more affordable for millions of New Yorkers. By ending these subsidies, the state is encouraging homeowners to consider cleaner appliances when building and renovating.

Assembly sponsor Jo Anne Simon said the bill also stops utility providers from getting unlimited subsidies to lengthen ""polluting gas pipelines."" Laura Shindell, New York State director at Food and Water Watch, noted that for decades, the ""fossil fuel expansion that pollutes our communities and drives up energy costs"" had been residents' responsibility.

For homeowners seeking cleaner cooking methods, induction stoves are a great option. Induction stoves cook food faster and are less expensive to run over time than regular stoves, and they don't lead to the health issues commonly associated with gas stoves.

If you rent your home or can't afford a kitchen update, a plug-in induction burner is a great alternative. These handy units start at just $50 and offer the same cooking benefits without needing installation.

Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, you can save up to $840 on a new induction range. Though many tax credits will be cut by late 2025 — meaning taking advantage of them now rather than later could save you thousands of dollars — some clean appliance rebates will continue indefinitely, including those for induction stoves.

The New York policy has gained support from climate-conscious communities. ""The point is that if we are ever going to have a carbon-neutral energy grid … we need to be turning off gas meters, not hooking up new ones,"" a Redditor in r/Futurology wrote. ""Ending subsidies for new gas hookups seems like the absolute minimum to me for climate-smart policy.""

Jessica Azulay, executive director of the Alliance for a Green Economy, agrees, saying the bill is ""the first step toward relieving New Yorkers of the burden of paying for unnecessary pipelines.""

With these changes, New Yorkers have both financial and planet-friendly reasons to check out cleaner energy options such as induction cooktops.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iStock-1462287016.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 07:05:41.962211

They’re highly complex, with intricate assemblies and precise chemistry. Often left out of the more high-profile discussions on battery composition are the adhesives and sealants that hold everything together – however, they’re vital for battery safety and performance.

The Dürr Group specializes in industrial manufacturing solutions including adhesives and application technology for battery systems. Sebastian Gries, senior sales manager Automotive Gluing Systems, answers a few questions about these critical materials.

Q. What role do adhesives and sealants play in the manufacture of electric vehicle batteries?

A. The process of bonding and sealing the cell modules and battery packs plays a crucial role, as the precise application of adhesives and sealants significantly contributes to battery safety and longevity. Vulnerable battery cells are at risk of damage from stone impacts, vibrations, and heat buildup, as well as from moisture and dirt. Sealants are utilized to seal the gaskets of the battery pack, aiming to prevent moisture incursion. Furthermore, they are required to survive collisions without sustaining damage and to withstand a fire until the vehicle occupants have moved to a safe distance. The primary function of thermal adhesives is to ensure effective thermal management of the battery, thereby extending its lifespan and preventing thermal runaway.

Q. What types of materials are used to bond and seal the various battery components?

A. In the field of battery dispensing processes, Dürr has successfully developed solutions for highly abrasive adhesives, two-component materials, and hot melts with different viscosities. Thermally conductive adhesives play a critical role in the bonding of cells and modules to cooling devices. This ensures effective heat transmission, safeguarding the battery's integrity, and maximizing its longevity. Structural adhesives are utilized to secure the battery pack's structural integrity, while sealants are employed to ensure the closure of the battery pack, its cover, and screwheads.

Q. How are these materials applied?

A. Depending on the shape of the components, the application pattern, and the adhesive, a variety of different application processes are used to bond and seal the individual components of a battery cell. The structural adhesive that bonds the assemblies together to stabilize the battery packs is applied using an extrusion process. Dürr uses its EcoShot Meter dosing systems for even, uninterrupted adhesive application.

By contrast, the fire-retardant pastes designed to prevent flame penetration in the event of a fire are sprayed onto the aluminum cover using a two-component spraying process. The same application process is used for the sealant that seals the heads of the bolts fastening the cover in place. The nozzle system specially developed by Dürr for this purpose ensures a consistent spray pattern. An injection process is also used to fill cavities, for example, between the cell modules and the cooling system. This is known as gap filling.

Dürr offers a wide-ranging portfolio to fulfill all battery production requirements, including various types of nozzles for different application patterns and modular shot meters for 1K, 2K, and hot melt. Dürr’s gluing products are particularly robust and of high quality, capable of conveying dense, abrasive materials without damaging pumps and dispensers, thanks to the stainless-steel material used and special coatings. Furthermore, the system is flexible, accommodating different viscosities, materials, and processes (1K to 2K) with products designed for each specific material.

Q. How can EV battery manufacturers keep up with rapidly changing requirements?

A. Manufacturers must establish flexible production systems that enable them to adapt their products to new developments in a relatively short period of time. The following products from Dürr serve as exemplars of this flexibility.

It’s possible to carry out applications using a single-piston dispenser; however, this method has the disadvantage of necessitating the refilling of adhesive or sealant after each process, which results in increased processing time. To address this, Dürr utilizes continuous dosing in its modular system. This objective can be achieved through two distinct methods.

In the case of two-component applications, two EcoShot Meters are integrated into a tandem configuration. This eliminates the need for refilling, allowing cycle times to be maintained and reducing investment costs by consolidating tasks into a single work stage.

The EcoMeter SP provides the same advantages for single-component applications. The robot's payload capacity for single-component continuous dosing remains constant, equivalent to that of a single EcoShot Meter, ensuring consistent performance and operational reliability. Dürr's modular design facilitates the direct retrofitting of each solution described into the existing system.

Sebastian Gries, senior sales manager Automotive Gluing Systems at Dürr System AG, is a graduate mechanical engineer and has been working in the field of gluing technology for more than ten years. He has been with Dürr for seven years and has held several positions here, including project manager and product manager for gluing applications. Furthermore, Gries is a member of the battery production working group of the German Machinery and Equipment Manufacturers Association (VDMA).",https://www.evdesignandmanufacturing.com/fileuploads/image/2025/08/01/credit-saschafeuster_r61_2731.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 08:02:31.757667

VinFast must also contend with established local players Tata Motors and Mahindra, plus Tesla, which opened its first India showroom last month.","VinFastiVinFastVinFast is a Vietnamese EV maker with global ambitions, which listed on the Nasdaq Composite stock market index in the U.S. in 2023.READ MORE is building factories faster than it can sell cars.

The Vietnamese electric-vehicle maker opened its first Indian factory on August 4, betting on expansion even as its existing plant at home sits mostly idle. The new 160-hectare (400 acres) facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu can produce 150,000 cars annually, according to VinFast. That’s more than its entire global output last year, when it delivered fewer than 100,000 vehicles — 90% of them in Vietnam.

The India plant, originally slated to start operations on June 30, debuted after multiple delays. VinFast broke ground in February 2024 and showcased its VF6 and VF7 premium SUVs at New Delhi’s auto show in January. It started taking prebookings in July.

The India push comes as VinFast has accumulated $11.5 billion in losses and pivoted away from the U.S. market after poor reviews and disappointing sales. The company now targets Asia and the Gulf, where consumer expectations differ from Western markets and U.S. reviews may not impact demand.

The plant will initially assemble 50,000 combined units of VF6 and VF7 SUVs a year. The facility will create as many as 3,500 direct jobs, Tamil Nadu Industries Minister T.R.B. Raja said, while inaugurating the facility.

“This plant marks a strategic milestone in our long-term commitment to the Indian market,” VinFast Asia CEO Pham Sanh Chau said at the press briefing. “It enables us to offer high-quality, competitively priced electric vehicles to Indian consumers.”

In the U.S., VinFast sold 332 EVs in December 2024, compared to more than 65,000 by market leader Tesla. The VF8 suffered from software glitches, poor build quality, and safety concerns. VinFast delayed its North Carolina factory to 2028 and resorted to heavy discounts, offering what industry observers called the cheapest lease in America.

While VinFast has yet to disclose its strategy for India, its playbook in Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines includes setting up a network of VinFast-exclusive chargers and deploying its vehicles as part of a taxi service owned by a group company.

“With local manufacturing in India, VinFast hopes to avoid high import duties and tap into government incentives,” Abhik Mukherjee, automotive analyst at Counterpoint Research, told Rest of World. “This strategy could lead to unused factory capacity if sales don’t pick up.”

India has slashed duties to 15% from 110% for EVs priced above $35,000, but only for carmakers who invest at least $500 million in local production. VinFast doesn’t yet qualify, although its new factory could eventually unlock these benefits.

India’s regulatory hurdles for Chinese automakers could benefit VinFast. BYD’s billion-dollar plant was blocked last year because of national security concerns, while Great Wall Motor couldn’t secure government approval for its factory in 2022.

MG Motor — a China-India venture — already operates successfully and is among the market leaders. VinFast must also contend with established local players Tata Motors and Mahindra, plus Tesla, which opened its first India showroom last month.

VinFast’s Vietnamese factory can produce 250,000 EVs annually, but operated at just 12% capacity in mid-2023. Despite the underutilization, the company recently opened a second Vietnamese plant with a 200,000-unit capacity.

Almost all VinFast’s deliveries have been made in Vietnam, with Green and Smart Mobility, majority owned by VinFast founder and CEO Pham Nhat Vuong, receiving 46,500 EVs between March 2023 and December 2024. VinFast, which introduced Green and Smart Mobility in Indonesia and the Philippines, relies heavily on its taxi subsidiary for sales volume rather than individual consumers.

The company may find it difficult to copy-paste this strategy in India because the ride-hailing sector has long been dominated by the Uber-Ola duopoly, and these services favor lower-trim, cost-effective models, Counterpoint’s Mukherjee said.

A 2024 report by Mathias Corvinus Collegium, a Hungarian think tank, noted that VinFast has addressed production capacity through massive investment but failed to realize the economies of scale through actual sales.

Last year, when VinFast postponed building its $4 billion North Carolina plant to 2028, chairperson Le Thi Thu Thuy said the company was reallocating capital to markets with “policies and the culture a lot closer to us [in Vietnam].”

""The house has a radiant heat system that is absolutely TERRIBLE in cold weather,"" they posted on r/Maine. ""... So we decided to abandon ship and go the heat pump route.""

An appliance that doesn't perform well in cold weather is a bit of a problem in the Pine Tree State. According to World Population Review, Maine is the fifth-coldest state in the Union. Heating and cooling tend to be the largest expenses on home utility bills, accounting for almost half, so opting for a more energy-efficient system is a smart move.

In simple terms, a heat pump works by gathering heat from the air or the ground outside the home and concentrating it for indoor use. Unlike a standard HVAC system, a heat pump can be used for heating and cooling a home. That efficiency can translate into big savings for homeowners.

While making the right choice can seem daunting, Mitsubishi has online tools to help you find the right system and trusted installers to install the unit that's right for you.

The thread garnered thoughtful comments, with a few posters noting that the homeowner could save even more money by taking advantage of tax credits. ""Have you looked into the inflation reduction act tax credit?"" one said. ""You might be able to drop that price even lower. It's a tax credit, so you won't see it for a while, but keep it in mind when filing taxes next year.""

Another user noted the poster could save 30% if they take advantage of the rebate and congratulated the Redditor on thinking ahead, writing, ""Smart move that will pay dividends when propane costs inevitably go up.""

It's worth noting that these incentives won't last after recent legislation eliminated them. Some clean appliance rebates, however, are still available.

This change dramatically shortens the planning horizon for families considering solar. If you're thinking about going solar, the time to act is now — not next year.”

— Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia

BANGOR, ME, UNITED STATES, August 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Suncovia, a leading advocate for equitable clean energy solutions, has expressed deep concern over the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, 2025. With its passing, the federal 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D) is officially ending on December 31, 2025. The legislation abruptly stops the long-standing tax credit without a phase-out period — creating a narrow and urgent window for homeowners to take advantage of this historic incentive.

Suncovia, a leading force in solar project development and clean energy financing, is calling on homeowners, contractors, and developers to move quickly. This tax credit sunset is one of the most consequential energy policy shifts in over a decade.

“This change dramatically shortens the planning horizon for families considering solar,” said Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia. “If you're thinking about going solar, the time to act is now — not next year.”

WHAT HOMEOWNERS NEED TO KNOW:

DECEMBER 31, 2025 IS A HARD DEADLINE

To qualify for the 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit, solar systems must be fully installed and operational by the end of 2025 — no extensions, no carryovers.

THERE IS NO PHASE-DOWN — NO GRACE PERIOD

Contrary to the Inflation Reduction Act’s original plan for a gradual wind-down through 2034, this legislation cuts the credit off entirely after 2025.

COMMERCIAL SOLAR CREDIT REMAINS, BUT WITH NEW DATES

The 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for commercial and utility-scale projects still stands but now includes new rules: projects must start by July 4, 2026, and be operational by December 31, 2027, to remain eligible.

IMPACTS FOR HOMEOWNERS AND THE INDUSTRY:

The end of the federal residential solar tax credit could significantly impact both consumers and the broader solar market. For homeowners, the loss of the 30% credit may result in noticeably higher upfront costs for solar installations. Without the federal incentive, many may experience longer return-on-investment timelines beginning in 2026, which could dampen enthusiasm and delay decision-making.

Additionally, the compressed deadline is expected to create logistical challenges. As the end-of-year deadline approaches, installers may become overbooked, and material availability could tighten. These bottlenecks could prevent some homeowners from completing their installations in time to qualify for the credit.

From an industry perspective, the sudden removal of the residential incentive is likely to cause market disruption. The reduced demand could lead to job losses, particularly among smaller solar contractors and residential-focused providers. This shift may also slow the overall pace of solar adoption, just as the U.S. seeks to solidify its leadership in the global clean energy transition.

Suncovia remains committed to making clean energy accessible. In response to these changes, the company is expanding its support for residential installations through Q4 2025. The company is also closely monitoring legislative activity and working with industry partners and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) to advocate for long-term policies that support clean energy adoption and economic resilience.

Suncovia strongly encourages homeowners to act now, before it’s too late. Homeowners should schedule their solar evaluations, secure permits, and finalize installations well before year-end to ensure eligibility for the 30% tax credit.

“This is the last full year for homeowners to take advantage of the most generous solar incentive in U.S. history,” added Craig Mattson. “We don’t want anyone to miss out due to delays or misinformation.”

Lee Zeldin argues that its scientific basis is flawed and economically damaging.
""EPA’s reconsideration of the endangerment finding will eliminate burdensome regulations and save small businesses at least US$170bn.
However, eliminating the Endangerment Finding would strip federal agencies of their authority to set GHG standards for new light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.
Transport remains one of the largest contributors to US GHG emissions.","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Administrator Lee Zeldin has proposed to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding, a key legal instrument that has enabled the federal regulation of GHG emissions from vehicles and engines.

Announced at an Indiana car dealership alongside Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Governor Mike Braun, the proposal represents a sharp reversal in the country's climate and energy regulatory framework.

It marks a move away from emissions controls and toward expanded fossil fuel use in transport and industrial sectors.

Understanding the Endangerment Finding’s role in energy and transport

The Endangerment Finding, issued in 2009 during the Obama administration, concluded that six pollutants, including CO₂, posed a danger to public health and welfare.

This determination gave the EPA authority, under the Clean Air Act, to regulate GHG emissions.

That ruling has underpinned more than US$1tn in climate regulations, including those targeting fuel efficiency, vehicle standards and the push for EV adoption. The Biden administration's EV mandate also stems from this legal framework.

Lee Zeldin argues that its scientific basis is flawed and economically damaging. ""With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” says Lee.

“The Obama and Biden EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent and warped science to achieve their preferred ends.”

According to the EPA’s new analysis, repealing the finding would reverse what Zeldin describes as “US$1tn or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families.”

The agency contends that this will lower goods prices, restore consumer choice in vehicles and reduce supply chain friction, particularly for logistics and trucking.

""EPA’s reconsideration of the endangerment finding will eliminate burdensome regulations and save small businesses at least US$170bn.

""I’m excited to work alongside Administrator Zeldin to cut red tape and unleash President Trump‘s new golden age for Main Street.”

Energy policy, emissions and legal consequences

While the EPA claims that the repeal is supported by updated science and economic modelling, including estimates of US$54bn in annual savings, environmental advocates warn of long-term risks.

The Department of Energy’s 2025 Climate Work Group study has been cited as part of the revised rationale.

However, eliminating the Endangerment Finding would strip federal agencies of their authority to set GHG standards for new light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.

Measures such as fuel-saving start-stop systems, controversial but effective, could also be dropped.

Transport remains one of the largest contributors to US GHG emissions.

Removing national limits on vehicle emissions risks slowing the country's decarbonisation effort and impacting international credibility.

Legally, the proposal draws strength from the Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. EPA, which determined that major regulatory actions must be backed by clear Congressional approval.

Lee believes the 2009 ruling bypassed that requirement: “The Obama Administration ignored Congress’ clear intent... using unprecedented logic to expand EPA’s power.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/01e79ecb02434b67070ed7d51d95afdf:d4db82b803729228dd59f2451bed7208/p20250207dt-0103-54325633746-o-055296.webp.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 03:59:14.463753

And their innovative diagnostic setup will have range-boosting potential, according to a news release from developer ZF.

The product, called TempAI, uses artificial intelligence to improve temperature control by 15%. It's an invention that boosts efficiency, reduces the need for rare and expensive materials, and shortens development times from months to days, per ZF.

""We are proud to bring this innovation into series production and thus making a significant contribution to more efficient e-mobility,"" Otmar Scharrer, ZF's head of development for electrified powertrain technology, said in the release.

Generally, electric motors use power from the battery to drive the wheels. Cooling systems, controllers, and other tech are typically part of the setups, per the U.S. Department of Energy.

ZF's AI software doesn't require more hardware add-ons. The temperature analysis requires low energy but provides fast, actionable metrics for existing control units. As a result, the motors can operate to their safest limit, giving 6% more peak power, while reducing energy consumption up to 18%. The performance was proved during testing, according to ZF.

""This technology enables us to further increase the efficiency and reliability of our drives. At the same time, TempAI demonstrates how data-driven development can be not only faster, but also more sustainable and more powerful,"" Dr. Stefan Sicklinger, head of AI, digital engineering, and validation in research and development, said in the release.

AI is being used by experts at the University of Liverpool to develop a better EV battery electrolyte. In China, advanced computing is helping scientists better understand nuclear fusion reactors.

At ZF, it is giving experts an inside look at e-motors through millions of data points.

""TempAI is a real technological breakthrough for the temperature management of electric drives."" Scharrer said in the release.

The improved performance could help increase already strong EV numbers. BloombergNEF reported that experts expect 22 million EVs to be sold globally this year. It would be a 25% jump from last year.

That's despite slowing numbers stateside — mainly due to fossil-friendly energy policy that leverages ""a mighty federal arsenal,"" according to Politico. EV tax credits worth up to $7,500 are being retired years early, on Sept. 30, CNBC reported. The clean energy cutbacks are part of President Donald Trump's spending bill.

Still, certain states provide their own incentives. That's in addition to the approximately $1,500 a year EV owners can save in gas and service costs. What's more, each EV that replaces a gas-guzzling ride prevents thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution annually, according to the DOE. Tailpipe exhaust and other fumes are released when fossil fuels are burned, polluting the air with toxic substances that contribute to 6.5 million deaths worldwide a year, per the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

Hastening the shift to cleaner transportation can help clear the air.

At ZF, the team thinks its AI-powered motor monitoring will be an important process during development that replaces costly measurements taken during operation and improves EV performance.

Such infrastructure plays a critical role in Hyundai’s long-term electrification strategy, aiming for 21 EV models globally by 2030.
Ultimately, Hyundai’s performance reflects a broader industry pivot toward sustainability, backed by data from sources like PR Newswire’s November 2024 sales report, which showed an 8% year-over-year increase.","Hyundai Motor Co.’s electrified vehicle sales in the U.S. hit a remarkable milestone in July, surging 50% year-over-year and propelling the company to its best-ever performance for the month. According to data from the automaker, total U.S. sales reached 79,543 units, a 15% increase from July 2024, with electrified models—including pure EVs and hybrids—driving much of the growth. This surge underscores Hyundai’s aggressive push into sustainable mobility, even as global automotive markets grapple with fluctuating demand and supply chain hurdles.

The standout performer was the IONIQ 5, Hyundai’s flagship electric SUV, which saw retail sales jump 71% compared to the previous year. Models like the Santa Fe hybrid and Elantra hybrid also set records, contributing to electrified vehicles making up a significant portion of the sales mix. Randy Parker, president and CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, highlighted in a company statement that this performance reflects strong consumer demand for efficient, tech-forward options amid rising fuel costs and environmental concerns.

Electrified Lineup Fuels Record-Breaking Momentum

While Hyundai’s global sales dipped slightly by 1.4% to 332,003 units in July, as reported on the company’s official worldwide newsroom, the U.S. market told a different story. Electrified sales not only boosted totals but also highlighted a shift in buyer preferences, with hybrids and EVs representing 32% of retail sales. This aligns with broader industry trends where consumers are increasingly opting for vehicles that offer both performance and lower emissions, helping Hyundai outpace competitors in key segments.

In contrast to the global dip, North American demand remained robust, driven by incentives like federal tax credits for EVs and competitive pricing. Publications such as Electrek, cited in a Slashdot summary, noted that Hyundai’s growth was “mainly driven by electrified vehicles,” emphasizing how models like the IONIQ 5 are resonating with tech-savvy buyers seeking fast-charging capabilities and modern designs.

Competitive Edge in a Crowded EV Market

Hyundai’s success comes at a time when rivals like Tesla and Ford are also vying for EV market share, but posts on X (formerly Twitter) from industry watchers like Sawyer Merritt indicate Hyundai and its affiliate Kia captured 10% of U.S. EV sales in the first seven months of 2024, trailing only Tesla’s dominant 49.7%. This positions Hyundai as a formidable challenger, especially with its expanding lineup that includes the upcoming IONIQ 9 three-row SUV, set to further bolster its portfolio.

Analysts point to Hyundai’s strategic investments, such as the $5.5 billion EV and battery plant in Savannah, Georgia, which began ramping up production in late 2024. As detailed in a Reuters report referenced on X by user John Raymond Hanger, this facility is expected to enhance supply and meet growing demand, with executives stating they could sell even more if capacity allowed. Such infrastructure plays a critical role in Hyundai’s long-term electrification strategy, aiming for 21 EV models globally by 2030.

Challenges Amid Global Headwinds

Despite the U.S. triumphs, Hyundai faces headwinds elsewhere. In India, for instance, July 2025 sales totaled 60,073 units, with domestic figures at 43,973 and exports at 16,100, as per a Business Upturn article. SUVs like the Creta led with 71.8% of domestic sales—the highest ever for Hyundai Motor India—yet overall growth was modest compared to U.S. figures, reflecting regional variations in EV adoption.

Globally, Hyundai sold 757,191 electrified vehicles in 2024, an 8.9% increase, with acceleration in the fourth quarter, according to an AInvest analysis. This resilience is notable against a backdrop of cautious consumer spending, as seen in BYD’s minimal 0.6% year-over-year growth in July, highlighted in X posts by energy analyst Dan Tsubouchi. Hyundai’s hybrid-heavy approach provides a buffer, appealing to buyers not yet ready for full EVs.

Strategic Shifts and Future Outlook

Looking ahead, Hyundai is doubling down on electrification, with CEO statements from May 2024, as reported by Sawyer Merritt on X, affirming commitment despite any perceived slowdowns. Innovations like bidirectional charging in the IONIQ 5 and software updates are enhancing appeal, positioning Hyundai to capture more market share as infrastructure improves.

For industry insiders, this July surge signals Hyundai’s adept navigation of a transitional era in automotive manufacturing. By blending hybrids with pure EVs, the company mitigates risks associated with battery supply chains and charging networks, potentially setting a blueprint for others. As Randy Parker noted in the Hyundai Newsroom release for July 2025 sales, “We achieved new records across multiple nameplates,” underscoring a momentum that could redefine competitive dynamics in the coming years.

Innovation and Market Adaptation Drive Sustained Growth

Hyundai’s record-breaking July also included highs for models like the Palisade SUV, up 59% in retail sales, blending traditional strengths with electrified options. This hybrid strategy is particularly effective in markets like the U.S., where EV adoption is accelerating but hybrids serve as a bridge for mainstream buyers.

Ultimately, Hyundai’s performance reflects a broader industry pivot toward sustainability, backed by data from sources like PR Newswire’s November 2024 sales report, which showed an 8% year-over-year increase. As the automaker continues to innovate, its July 2025 results may well mark the beginning of a new chapter in global mobility leadership.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-a9a604d8-e7a2-4292-b6a0-cf40c1ce592d.jpeg,N,,2025-08-04 03:59:03.409971

Bentley then discussed costs and rate history through the New York Power Authority and some potential rate increases going forward.
He also looked at ancillary services, risk mitigation strategies for that, National Grid rates and the Clean Energy Standard.
Risk mitigation is also in fuel adjustment charges to customers, Leathers said, adding right now those risks are specifically in hydropower and the Clean Energy Standard charges.","The most pressing risk to the Jamestown Board of Public Utilities’ operation, at this point, are decisions regarding clean energy at the state level.

The BPU board was presented with their annual Risk Management Program Update during the board’s July board meeting. That program is one way the utility works to make sure power is available and affordable as the energy market in New York state changes to meet the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Brad Bentley, BPU energy and gas resources manager, presented the annual required presentation to the board, beginning with comparing load history and customers versus loads from this year with last year.

Risk mitigation strategies for the BPU from this section include SC-6 and Key Account programs, the business development coordinator who does projects and events such as the Retool NY conference and facility studies, customer awareness and staying ahead of customer needs, advanced metering infrastructure, local involvement with community organizations, high reliability standards and address the impacts of state’s Climate LEadership and Community Protection Act passed in 2019 that includes encouragement of electrification of vehicles and buildings.

Bentley then discussed costs and rate history through the New York Power Authority and some potential rate increases going forward. Risk mitigation strategies in regards to NYPA include life extension and modernization of the BPU’s operation, long term agreement contract management, New York Association of Public Power involvement to track and manage NYPA Rate Stabilization Reserve Programs, monitoring of invoices, long term trend tracking and analysis, energy schedule planning and post evaluation, and having a regular and good relationship with NYPA.

“We do have our contract secured through 2040 for our supply,” Bentley said.

On the market side of things, Bentley said that the New York Independent System Operator controls the market for wholesale electricity. The ISO is an independent organization formed from the New York Power Pool in 1999 that is responsible for maintaining New York’s electric grid and competitive wholesale electric market place. Bentley briefly looked over the ISO ICAP Market, saying ICAP stands for the New York Installed Capacity market that serves to maintain reliability of the bulk power system by procuring sufficient resource capability to meet expected maximum energy needs plus an installed reserve margin. There is also a UCAP, or Unforced Capacity, which is calculated monthly for generators based on historic availability and maximum demand output.

After discussing the BPU’s UCAP financials, which drives how much per megawatt the BPU gets paid, Bentley discussed the risk mitigation strategies in regards to the ISO and the market. He also looked at ancillary services, risk mitigation strategies for that, National Grid rates and the Clean Energy Standard.

“The way the Clean Energy Standard works for New York state is, we have it based on what we can share, so those costs are allocated from New York State, based on your load,” Bentley said.

Bentley went over current approved CES programs and potential future programs, along with current and future cost exposure for BPU customers. Bentley also discussed Renewable Energy Credits, which are a way for the state to collect money that is used to subsidize new renewable generation such as wind and solar power generation, and the BPU’s risk mitigation strategies for those. Bentley wrapped up his presentation with a few more strategies and numbers and graphs.

After the presentation, General Manager David Leathers noted that this is a “very complicated process.”

“If you look back 20 years, the BPU used to have a financial consultant … out of Washington,” Leathers said. “There was a two month lag between what was presented to us and what ended up in people’s bills.”

Leathers said they took a leap to start this Risk Management Program in-house, and the work talking about risk mitigation is an every day, every week process. Risk mitigation is also in fuel adjustment charges to customers, Leathers said, adding right now those risks are specifically in hydropower and the Clean Energy Standard charges.

“A lot of stuff at the state level, this stuff is going to be raining down so we’ll see how the residents in the state and electric rate payers in the state respond to this,” Leathers said. “Renewable energy credits and zero emission energy credits have been in place for a while and there’s more coming and they’re very significant.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.post-journal.com/images/2016/10/31144144/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 07:02:33.876310

MK Stalin inaugurated the plant in the presence of the company’s CEO of VinFast Asia, Pham Sanh Chau, with the roll out of the premium VF7 car.

VinFast setting up its base in the State adds another feather in the cap for the thriving auto sector in Tamil Nadu, called the Detroit of Asia. For Thoothukudi, this is a major boost for industrial development as the town is yet to recover from the closure of the Sterlite Copper smelter plant in 2018 due to alleged environmental issues.

Tamil Nadu is home to car manufacturing by vendors like Hyundai, Renault-Nissan (now Renault), Stellantis and BMW. The Ford plant is defunct now and Tata’s JLR will start production in a few months.

The State produces one out of every five cars made in India and contributes to nearly 40 per cent of India’s automobile exports, according to the State Planning Commission.

In April 2024, Vietnam-based electric vehicle maker VinFast Auto Ltd commenced construction work for establishing a new integrated EV manufacturing unit at Thoothukudi with planned investment of ₹4,000 crore, spread over 5 years. In March 2024, the Vietnamese company signed an agreement with the Tamil Nadu government to invest ₹16,000 crore over some time.

The new factory has been set up in a 400-acre site at the industrial park of State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (SIPCOT) and it is expected to generate jobs for 3,000 to 3,500 people.

The plant is the company’s third operational plant - the first outside Vietnam - and the fifth project in its global manufacturing network.

Chief Minister MK Stalin said that the facility will boost bilateral relations between Vietnam and Tamil Nadu. “Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu saw the first car manufacturing (Hyundai in 1998) while the EV car manufacturing plant is being inaugurated at Thoothukudi. This is a big to the industrial development for the region,” he said.

The plant will be the country’s full EV car manufacturing unit, which will provide employment to a large number of local people, he said. The company has so far invested ₹1,300 crore in the plant, he added.

Vinfast CEO Chau said that the company did a survey of 15 sites in 6 states across India looking at infrastructure, government incentive and growth potential. Tamil Nadu stood out, and the company decided to set up the facility, he said. The first global customers were from countries like Sri Lanka and Maldives, he said.

Tamil Nadu Industries Minister TRB Rajaa said that 20 months ago, the possibility of a car manufacturing (in Thoothukudi) was not thought of. But, 18 months ago, the MoU was signed with VinFast and today, the dream has become a reality with a ₹16,000 crore investment through the new factory.

In the initial phase, VinFast Tamil Nadu will focus on assembling two premium electric SUV models - the VF7 and VF6. The plant’s annual capacity is 50,000, scalable up to 150,000 to meet rising market demand. With the launch of the plant, VinFast moves closer to its target sales target of 200,000 vehicles and its long-term production goal of 1 million vehicles per year by 2030, the company said in a statement.

On August 1st, VinFast opened its showroom (its biggest) in Chennai - the second after Surat on July 27. The company is scheduled to inaugurate its plant in the port town of Thoothukudi on Monday. VinFast Auto India, the Indian subsidiary VinFast, as part of its roadmap, aims to launch 35 dealerships by year-end, across 27+ cities.

VinFast officially opened pre-bookings for its premium electric SUVs, the VF6 and VF7 on July 15. Customers can now book their preferred VinFast premium electric SUV either at the exclusive showrooms or through the official website, VinFastAuto.in, with a fully refundable booking amount of ₹21,000.

It has also partnered with multiple dealer groups in key cities and teamed up with RoadGrid, myTVS and Global Assure to build a digital services and after-sales support network. VinFast has also joined forces with BatX Energies to enable battery recovery and reuse, advancing circular production and sustainable development in the world’s third largest automobile market, the release said.

According to an official of a major freight forwarder, the new factory will be a major boost to the shipping community. “We need more such facilities to help the shipping community to grow,” he added.

The inauguration of VinFast is likely to be followed by large industrial projects worth over ₹45,000 crore like ACME Green Hydrogen & Chemical (₹27,000 crore); Green Infra Renewable Energy Farms Pvt Ltd (₹8,460 crore); Amplus Ganges Solar (₹6,000 crore) and Renew E-fuels Pvt Ltd (₹400 crore).

China’s export restrictions on next-generation battery technologies allow Beijing to dictate the global market as these innovations are commercialized.
It was inevitable that the “age of economic warfare,” as coined by Edward Fishman in “Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare,” would eventually find its way into the energy transition.
The age of economic warfare is marked by the use of tools like sanctions, financial restrictions, export controls, and the weaponization of key chokepoints to exert economic power.
But it is highly unlikely the U.S. will follow the same playbook when it comes to LFP technologies.","China’s export restrictions on heavy rare earths and permanent magnets have garnered the majority of the public’s attention, but a new set of restrictions on battery supply chain technology signal a turning point. The April restrictions on rare earths were a continuation of China’s past approach, focusing on dual-use applications and minerals with small markets. But Beijing’s decision in July to implement export licensing requirements on lithium-ion cathode active materials and lithium extraction technologies marks the start of a new era. The age of economic warfare has now come for the energy transition.

In a move initially proposed in early January, China’s Ministry of Commerce, in coordination with the Ministry of Science and Technology, formally added a series of advanced critical minerals and battery supply chain technologies to the “Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and Restricted from Export from China.” The most impactful are export-licensing requirements on technologies necessary to produce next generation lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) and lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode active materials along with technologies for direct lithium extraction. Cathode active materials are a core component of a lithium-ion battery that determines its energy density, performance, and cost.

China dominates the global lithium-ion battery supply chain, with particularly overwhelming control over LFP technologies. Chinese companies produce nearly 99 percent of the world’s LFP cathode materials and lead in LFP cell manufacturing, driven by strong domestic demand for affordable electric vehicles. LFP, instead of nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC), is now the chemistry of choice in the world’s largest EV market. In the context of these restrictions, Chinese companies are also the only companies that have started to produce next-generation LFP cathode active material. Next-generation LFP material significantly increases the energy density of LFP batteries. The higher density allows vehicles to compete with NMC batteries, which have higher energy density, on driving range, without the added cost of additional raw materials like nickel and cobalt. The result is a “best of both worlds” solution: lower-cost EVs with superior performance.

China’s export restrictions on next-generation battery technologies allow Beijing to dictate the global market as these innovations are commercialized. By limiting access to the best LFP technology, Beijing can slow the development of foreign competitors while forcing them to rely on Chinese imports – effectively reinforcing its dominance in the battery supply chain. These controls not only protect and promote domestic manufacturing, but also advance China’s broader strategy of exporting battery technologies and EVs worldwide, as Chinese brands expand their global footprint.

China has also restricted technologies key to direct lithium extraction (DLE). Unlike traditional brine-based methods – which rely on large evaporation ponds and take 18-24 months to yield lithium – DLE technologies can extract lithium in a matter of hours or days. This makes it possible to produce lithium from brine sources that were previously uneconomical or geologically unsuitable. By enabling faster production timelines, reducing water usage, and expanding the geographic footprint of viable lithium projects, DLE could diversify global supply if it is fully commercialized.

The new restrictions target adsorption‑membrane related technologies that are necessary for the development of DLE. Chinese producers, like Sunresin, are the leading providers. As Reuters reported in February, several U.S. companies looking to expand into DLE currently rely on Sunresin’s technologies. U.S. companies could eventually produce their own material, but it would severely slow their extraction development and allow Chinese companies to become the global leaders in a still emerging industry. The United States can support companies like Lilac Solutions and Albemarle that are building non-Chinese technologies to respond to these restrictions.

Previously, China’s export restrictions focused predominantly on materials and technologies with dual-use applications: gallium, germanium, graphite, and most recently heavy rare earths elements and advanced permanent magnets. Graphite and rare earths are necessary for batteries, wind turbines, and electric vehicles but the restrictions were implemented because of their dual use applications. The new restrictions are focused solely on technologies vital to the energy transition. China created key chokepoints in clean energy supply chains, and now Beijing is taking advantage of them. China is exerting its control to slow the development of competitors, support domestic producers, and dictate the next generation of the clean energy economy.

It was inevitable that the “age of economic warfare,” as coined by Edward Fishman in “Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare,” would eventually find its way into the energy transition. It has already proliferated through all aspects of our economy. The age of economic warfare is marked by the use of tools like sanctions, financial restrictions, export controls, and the weaponization of key chokepoints to exert economic power. As Fishman describes in “Chokepoints,” the modern age of economic warfare has reshaped the global financial system, oil market, and semiconductor industry. It was only a matter of time before the energy transition became entangled.

The shift from export restrictions on raw or processed materials to advanced technologies mirrors Beijing’s broader strategy in the battery supply chain over the last two decades. China began its ascent in the supply chain in the upstream with overseas investments in lithium, cobalt, nickel, and other critical mineral mining projects. Then it moved downstream, leveraging those resources to focus on advanced technologies and build a comprehensive battery supply chain and electric vehicle sector. As global competition over clean energy supply chains intensifies, China is demonstrating that the battle is not just about resources – it’s about who controls the tools of the transition. And Beijing decided to follow the Washington playbook to make their mark.

In September 2022, weeks prior to announcing the United States’ strongest export restrictions to date on advanced semiconductors, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser for previous U.S President Joe Biden, stated “on export controls, we have to revisit the longstanding premise of maintaining ‘relative’ advantages over competitors in certain key technologies…we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.” The new export restrictions on LFP and DLE allow China to maintain “as large of a lead as possible” in the battery supply chain. Whereas the United States has used export controls to slow down China’s military-adjacent technology sectors, Beijing has adopted a similar playbook, but repurposed it to serve industrial, not security, priorities. China is looking to slow down foreign commercial competitors and support domestic manufacturing rather than denying adversaries military capabilities.

China is following the United States’ playbook, but it remains to be seen if the Trump administration will follow China’s playbook when it comes to responding to technology restrictions. Beijing poured funding into a domestic semiconductor supply chain when the U.S. implemented restrictions on advanced semiconductors. They decided they were going to have to build their own industry if they could not rely on access to leading Western technology.

The Trump administration did follow a similar playbook in response to restrictions on rare earth elements and permanent magnets through the Department of Defense’s investment into MP Materials. The creative funding mechanism aims to build a domestic mine to magnet supply chain. Like Beijing before it, Washington finally realized that it could not allow a competitor to control key chokepoints on technologies necessary for the defense sector. Additionally, rare earths could continue to be a major bargaining chip in any trade negotiations.

But it is highly unlikely the U.S. will follow the same playbook when it comes to LFP technologies. There has been a series of recent announcements of new domestic LFP production from LG, SK ON, and Samsung. However, these efforts are constrained by the absence of domestic cathode production, limited technical expertise in advanced LFP materials, and higher production costs. To compete with China, the United States would have had to double down on the energy transition to build domestic demand and strengthen the Inflation Reduction Act benefits.",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2025-08-01-194711.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 03:00:41.312450

The most recent permitting reform effort, led last year by former U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, failed after negotiations to include it in another continuing resolution failed.
The act would have shortened the timeline for judicial review of energy and mineral permitting projects while accelerating federal decision-making for leasing of energy projects on federal lands.
It’s solar, it’s wind, it’s broadband, it’s housing development, it’s transportation projects,” Capito said.
I feel like this is where we are with permitting,” Capito said.","CHARLESTON — Permitting reform is once again a major focus of U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, and she believes that lawmakers can get a package to the desk of President Donald Trump by the end of the year.

Speaking to West Virginia reporters on a conference call Thursday afternoon, Capito talked about her speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate Wednesday advocating for permitting reform to speed up energy, transportation, and infrastructure projects.

“I thought it was time to start talking more aggressively about the need for permitting reform,” said Capito, R-W.Va. “If we’re going to have data centers in need of more energy, we need to be able to have a permitting structure that really works.”

Capito, the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, is working with EPW ranking Democratic member Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., on a permitting reform package that can be considered by the full Senate and U.S. House of Representatives sometime in the next five months.

“We both, as chair and ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, wanted to put out a united front as a unit,” Capito said. “I think that is good, and that would be great for West Virginia. Hopefully, we can do something by the end of the year.”

The EPW Committee began work in February on permitting reform, taking testimony in committee and keeping the record open for 30 days to allow stakeholder to submit further testimony and comments. According to Capito, her committee received 107 submissions on behalf of 146 organizations, as well as 854 individual requests providing input on how to improve federal permitting processes.

Congress has been tackling the topic of permitting reform for a number of years, either through individual bills or by including permitting reform provisions in continuing resolutions to keep the federal government funded.

The most recent permitting reform effort, led last year by former U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, failed after negotiations to include it in another continuing resolution failed. Manchin, the former chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, worked with then-ranking Republican committee member John Barrasso of Wyoming on a package called the Energy Permitting Reform Act.

The act would have shortened the timeline for judicial review of energy and mineral permitting projects while accelerating federal decision-making for leasing of energy projects on federal lands. It would have allowed for at least one lease sale for offshore wind and offshore oil and gas projects per year from 2025 to 2029 subject to limitations.

Among other things, the proposal would have reformed current backstop authority for interstate electric transmission lines and required interregional planning. It would have limited how electric companies allocate expenses to customers for transmission line projects, as well as other items to speed up transmission projects.

“We’ve been talking about this for years,” Capito conceded. “The Manchin/Barrasso bill almost passed at the end of last year. They had a lot of permitting for transmission and some easing of some of the judicial reviews so you can’t keep going to court back-and-forth and back-and-forth.”

But Capito said she believes this is the year to push for a large, comprehensive permitting reform package that can appeal to different kinds of projects.

“It’s not just new pipelines or natural gas. It’s solar, it’s wind, it’s broadband, it’s housing development, it’s transportation projects,” Capito said. “I think what we’re seeing here is a convergence of clean energy folks and people like me who are all-of-the-above meeting together with an urgency, and I think that’s why I think we have a better shot at this year than we’ve had over the last few years.”

Over in the U.S. House of Representatives, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., and U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, introduced the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act. That bill would make reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to streamline permitting processes, shorten timelines for permit approvals, and limit judicial review.

“A lot of times here on Capitol Hill…things have to simmer and cook for a couple years before we really get to the meat of the matter. I feel like this is where we are with permitting,” Capito said. “The House just put out a bipartisan bill. That’s a good sign that there’s bipartisan support in the House and we have to have a bipartisan process.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintermountain.com/images/2025/08/03161759/Capito-07-31-24-568x500.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 07:02:44.594248

The endorsement provides up to $5,000 in additional coverage for FORTIFIED Roof upgrades when a roof is replaced due to damage from a covered claim.

“In May, we launched the Strengthen Your Roof program, which invested $20 million in grants to policyholders in the Outer Banks and Barrier Islands,” said Gina Hardy, CEO of the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association, the state-created program to help coastal homeowners find coverage. “Now, we are expanding that commitment with the Strengthen Your Coastal Roof program, adding another $20 million in funding to the remaining 18 coastal counties we serve.”

The program, unlike most other states’ wind-mitigation grant programs, is funded largely through the NCIUA’s surplus, which has grown in recent months due in large part to reduced reinsurance costs, Hardy said earlier this year.

The FORTIFIED process was developed by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety and is considered to be something of a gold standard for wind-resistant roofs. Roof claims are among the most common in coastal areas that are vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storm winds. The standard requires stronger roof deck attachment, sealed roof decks, and locked-down edges.

Crucially, each installation is verified by a third party to ensure the upgrades meet IBHS standards, state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey said at the announcement in July.

“Research from the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University shows that homes with a FORTIFIED Roof had about 35% fewer claims after Hurricanes Matthew, Florence, Dorian, and Isaias,” Causey said in a statement. “When claims were filed, the damage was about 23% less severe.”

Grants made through the expanded program will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Eligible policyholders in the following counties are encouraged to apply promptly to reserve funding: Brunswick, Carteret, New Hanover, Onslow, Beaufort, Camden, Chowan, Craven, Jones, Pender, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrell, Washington, Currituck, Dare, Hyde, and Pamlico.

NCIUA also offers the Stronger Roof Endorsement at no cost to all policyholders. The endorsement provides up to $5,000 in additional coverage for FORTIFIED Roof upgrades when a roof is replaced due to damage from a covered claim.

With the combined impact of the Strengthen Your Roof and Strengthen Your Coastal Roof programs, along with the Stronger Roof Endorsement, NCIUA said it has assisted more than 18,000 policyholders in obtaining an IBHS FORTIFIED roof since adopting the standard in 2016. These efforts represent more than $120 million invested in building stronger, safer homes across the coast.

The programs are another indication that wind-mitigation efforts, including FORTIFIED roofs, are catching on across much of the country as ways to reduce insurance claims and premiums. More states have introduced mitigation grant programs. And most property insurers are required to offer premium discounts or credits when mitigation work is completed.

And it’s not just hurricanes that are protected against: Research from the Institute for Advanced Analytics found a 63% reduction in claims from non-named storms among homes with FORTIFIED Roofs, Causey noted.",https://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2025/08/north-carolina-expands-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 06:02:59.046828

(CNN) — Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Sunday defended the Trump administration’s move to repeal the so-called endangerment finding that planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health.

“To reach the 2009 endangerment finding, they relied on the most pessimistic views of the science. The great news is that a lot of the pessimistic views of the science in 2009 that was being assumed ended up not panning out,” Zeldin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We can rely on 2025 facts as opposed to 2009 bad assumptions.”

The 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety, which has served as EPA’s basis for many of its significant regulations aiming to protect the environment and decrease climate pollution. If successful, the repeal could strip away the federal government’s most powerful way to control the country’s planet-warming pollution and fight climate change.

The text of the administration’s proposal to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding said that while greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise in the atmosphere, that rise has been “driven primarily by increased emissions from foreign sources,” and has happened “without producing the degree of adverse impacts to public health and welfare in the United States that the EPA anticipated in the 2009 Endangerment Finding.”

The US is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and historically has emitted more planet-warming pollution than any other country. Many rigorous scientific findings since 2009 have showed both climate pollution and its warming effects are not just harming public health but killing people outright.

In the nearly 16 years since the EPA first issued the Supreme Court-ordered endangerment finding, the world has warmed an additional 0.45 degrees Celsius (or 0.81 degrees Fahrenheit) to 1.4 degrees Celsius, according to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather.

“Both the scientific certainty around climate change and evidence of the dangers it is causing have grown stronger since 2009,” Hausfather said in an email. “There is no evidence that has emerged or been published in the scientific literature in the past 16 years that would in any way challenge the scientific basis of the 2009 endangerment finding.”

Pressed on whether he’s skeptical of the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are the overwhelming driver of man-made climate change, Zeldin said, “That might be your way to try to twist my words.”

The EPA is in a public comment period on its proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles, since they stem from the 2009 finding.

“We’re going through a public comment period. We want to make the right decision afterwards. But for people who want to sum up the 2009 endangerment finding as if they study carbon dioxide as an endangerment on human health, they did not do that,” Zeldin told CNN.

Asked whether the EPA should have a role in trying to combat climate change, Zeldin said that the Supreme Court “made it very clear that I have to follow the law.”

“I have to follow the plain language of the law, and I can’t get creative. So when you read through the 2009 endangerment finding, they say that where there’s silence in the law, there’s gaps that I should just be interpreting that as my own discretion. The Supreme Court has made it very clear that that is not what is a power that I have,” he said, adding that drawing up such a regulation should be left to Congress.

In short, the US does not have an energy security problem.
It has clawed back billions of US dollars in tax credits and grants that were supercharging American energy innovation.
Beijing has doubled down on wind, solar and next‑generation batteries, installing more wind and solar power in 2024 than the rest of the world combined.
Roughly one-in-five lithium‑ion batteries, a key component in clean energy products, are made in China.","During the cold war, the United States and Soviet Union were locked in a desperate race to develop cutting‑edge technologies like long-range missiles and satellites. Fast forward to today and the frontiers of global technology have pivoted to AI and next‑generation energy.

In one domain, AI, the US has far outpaced any other nation — though China looks to be closing the gap. In the other, energy, it has just tied its shoelaces together. The reason isn’t technology, economics or, despite the government’s official line, even national security. Rather, it is politics.

Since returning to the White House in January, Donald Trump has handed out huge wins to the coal and oil and gas industries. This is no great surprise. Trump has long been supportive of the US fossil fuel industry and, since his reelection, has appointed several former industry lobbyists to top political positions.

According to the Trump administration, national security requires gutting support for renewable energy while performing political CPR on the dying coal industry.

The reality is that, since 2019, the US has produced more oil, gas and coal annually than Americans want to use, with the rest exported and sold overseas. It is currently one of the most prolific exporters of fossil fuels in the world.

In short, the US does not have an energy security problem. It does, however, have an energy cost problem combined with a growing climate change crisis. These issues will only be made worse by Trump’s enthusiasm for fossil fuels.

Over the past six months, the Trump administration has upended half a decade of green industrial policy. It has clawed back billions of US dollars in tax credits and grants that were supercharging American energy innovation.

Meanwhile, China has roared forward. Beijing has doubled down on wind, solar and next‑generation batteries, installing more wind and solar power in 2024 than the rest of the world combined. To China’s delight, the US has simply stopped competing to be the world’s clean energy powerhouse.

Roughly one-in-five lithium‑ion batteries, a key component in clean energy products, are made in China. Many of the newest high‑tech batteries are also being developed and patented there. While Trump repeats the tired mantra of “drill, baby, drill”, China is building factories, cornering the market for critical minerals such as lithium and nickel and locking in export partners.

At the same time, household energy spending in the US is expected to increase by $170 (£126) each year between now and 2035 as a result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The bill, which includes sweeping changes to taxes, social security and more, will raise energy costs mainly because it strips away support for cheap and abundant renewables like wind and solar.

Household energy costs could go up even more as Trump threatens to make large‑scale clean energy development much more onerous by putting up bureaucratic hurdles. The administration recently issued a directive requiring the secretary of the interior to approve even routine activities for wind and solar projects connected to federal lands.

Meanwhile, climate change is hitting American communities harder with each passing year. As recent flooding in Texas and urban fires in California and Hawaii have shown, fewer Americans still have the luxury of ignoring climate change.

As the cost of these disasters mount — $183 billion in 2024 — the grifting of the oil and gas industry will become an increasingly bitter pill for the nation to swallow.

China, with its authoritarian government, is less susceptible to the petroleum-obsessed dogma fueling the Republican party. It does not have prominent leaders like US politician Marjorie Taylor Greene, who previously warned that Democrats are trying to “emasculate the way we drive” by advocating for electric vehicles. Rather, China’s leaders are seeing green — not in the environmental sense, but in a monetary one.

It is generally cheaper nowadays to build and operate renewable energy facilities than gas or coal power stations. According to a June 2025 report by Lazard, an asset management company, electricity from new large-scale solar farms costs up to $78 per megawatt hour — and often much less. The same electricity from a newly built natural gas plants, by comparison, can cost as much as $107 per megawatt hour.

Across the world, utilities are embracing clean energy, choosing lower costs for their customers while reducing pollution. China saw the writing on the wall decades ago and its early investments are bearing a rich harvest. It now produces more than half of the world’s electric vehicles and the vast majority of its solar panels.

The US can still compete at the leading edge of the energy sector. American companies are developing innovative new approaches to geothermal, battery recycling and many other energy technologies.

But in the battle to become the world’s 21st-century energy manufacturing powerhouse, the US seems to have walked off the playing field.

In Trump’s telling, the US may have simply exited one race and reentered another. But the fossil fuel industry — financially, environmentally and ethically — is obviously a dead end.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-08-04%2Ficeii36s%2Fwind-farm.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-08-04 02:00:02.930274

“That could be a weapon that can help us beat China.” Solid-state batteries are more powerful, durable, faster to charge and safer than the lithium-ion cells currently dominating the EV sector.","SK Innovation Co.’s battery unit plans to accelerate development of cutting-edge technologies in partnership with US and European carmakers, its R&D chief said, aiming to win back market share from peers in China and South Korea.

SK On is focused on honing its edge in thermal management technology, such as immersion cooling designed to boost the efficiency of batteries for AI data centers, energy storage systems and electric vehicles, Park Kisoo, head of the company’s research and development arm, said in an interview. The battery specialist already is in talks with Ford Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. to collaborate on the cutting-edge tech, he said.

A representative for Ford declined to comment. Hyundai didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The push comes amid a broad reorganization of the SK group, a leading South Korean conglomerate, which plans to merge money-losing SK On with more profitable sister company SK Enmove in a bid to stabilize its balance sheet. The move follows another in-group transaction by SK On’s parent company a year ago with a similar goal of shoring up finances as the battery unit pursues aggressive expansion overseas.

The Korean company operates two standalone battery plants in Georgia which supply Ford and Volkswagen AG, and is planning another facility in the state with Hyundai. SK On and Ford received a $9.63 billion loan from the US government late last year to build two battery factories in Kentucky and another in neighboring Tennessee. They have paused plans for a battery plant in Canada. SK On also has battery production facilities in China, Europe and at home in South Korea.

Park said his R&D center will spur internal efforts to diversify suppliers and strengthen supply chains to bolster the company’s US production and ramp up its energy storage business there.

EV demand is set to decline further with the looming end of US tax credits in September, but the R&D chief sees global sales rebounding as early as late 2027 — if automakers can close the price gap between EVs and gas-powered vehicles.

“For many EV drivers, there’s no going back, and the penetration rate is only set to grow in China and elsewhere,” Park said.

SK On also is targeting development of solid-state batteries by the end of 2027 and mass production of them from 2029, he said. Semi solid-state batteries, a hybrid version of current and next-generation tech, could be commercialized even sooner.

“When the world of solid-state batteries arrives, it will definitely be first applied in pouch-type cells in which we already have a technological edge,” Park said. “That could be a weapon that can help us beat China.”

Solid-state batteries are more powerful, durable, faster to charge and safer than the lithium-ion cells currently dominating the EV sector. That’s set off a global race to bring those batteries to market among top suppliers, including China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. and BYD Co. as well as South Korea’s LG Energy Solution Ltd. and Samsung SDI Co.

Jiang argues that blockchain can coordinate unused resources, including labor and infrastructure, in a decentralized manner to build a more resilient energy system [1]. By incentivizing individuals to install solar panels or home batteries through token-based rewards, blockchain can help create a grid that operates without heavy reliance on centralized systems [1].

This approach aligns with the Trump administration’s emphasis on upgrading the U.S. energy grid to support energy-intensive sectors such as artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency mining. A recent White House report highlighted the importance of modernizing the grid, which is described as “one of the largest and most complex machines on Earth,” to meet the demands of future technologies [1]. The administration has also proposed exploring nuclear energy and protecting the grid from electromagnetic disruptions to enhance its reliability and security [1].

According to the White House report, building redundant systems to ensure maximum grid uptime and resiliency is a key policy objective. This strategy reflects a broader recognition that the U.S. must optimize its energy resources to sustain high-performance computing applications and maintain its competitive edge in the global AI race [1]. The administration has repeatedly stressed the importance of maximizing energy output to meet the growing needs of data centers and other high-energy consumption industries [1].

Meanwhile, blockchain’s potential to support decentralized energy systems is being explored in various academic and industry contexts. Research into Ethereum-based smart contracts has revealed their potential to enhance transparency and security in digital infrastructures, suggesting similar applications in energy management [2]. Additionally, companies such as LumiShare are experimenting with tokenizing real-world assets, including renewable energy projects, to improve access to clean energy and create new investment opportunities [3].

The integration of blockchain into energy systems, however, is not without challenges. It requires the development of robust regulatory frameworks, stakeholder cooperation, and significant investment in supporting infrastructure. Despite these hurdles, venture capitalists and industry experts remain optimistic about the long-term benefits of decentralized energy models, including reduced costs, greater consumer control, and improved grid resilience [1].

As blockchain-based solutions continue to gain traction in the energy sector, the U.S. could see a shift toward a more distributed and efficient energy model. While the pace of transformation remains uncertain, the technology is already drawing interest from investors, researchers, and policymakers, signaling a potential turning point in how energy is generated, distributed, and consumed.

Cosmo Jiang, a general partner at Pantera, emphasized that blockchain can revolutionize how energy is produced and distributed by aligning incentives in a way that was previously unachievable. He noted that the core of human civilization has always been the coordination of incentives, and blockchain introduces a new decentralized method to achieve this [1].

Jiang explained that gig economy platforms have already demonstrated how individuals can monetize their spare resources outside of regular work hours. Blockchain can extend this concept by leveraging unused infrastructure and human labor to create a decentralized energy grid. For instance, protocols using token incentives can encourage everyday people to install solar panels or home batteries, creating a decentralized power network without the need for large capital investments [1].

This shift toward decentralization aligns with the broader goals of the Trump administration, which has positioned energy grid modernization as a key priority for advancing artificial intelligence and high-performance computing [1]. A recent White House report highlighted the need to upgrade the U.S. energy grid to support energy-intensive sectors such as AI data centers and cryptocurrency mining. The report also called for exploring alternative energy sources like nuclear power and implementing measures to protect the grid from electromagnetic interference [1].

President Donald Trump has repeatedly underscored the importance of maximizing energy resources to meet the demands of these high-tech industries. His administration’s energy infrastructure plan includes building redundant systems to ensure maximum grid uptime and resiliency. These actions aim to streamline regulatory processes that have traditionally slowed infrastructure development [1].

Beyond the U.S., blockchain-based energy solutions are gaining traction globally. In Singapore, for example, smart home devices are being developed to leverage blockchain for secure and transparent energy transactions [4]. These initiatives highlight the adaptability of blockchain in creating scalable and modular systems across different regulatory environments [4].

The potential of blockchain in energy systems also extends to other sectors, such as artificial intelligence. The immutable and permissionless nature of blockchain is being explored as a framework for decentralized AI systems [3]. In the energy context, this could support AI-driven grid management that autonomously optimizes energy distribution based on real-time data [3].

The growing interest from venture capital in blockchain for energy reflects a broader recognition of the technology’s role in addressing infrastructure challenges. By decentralizing energy control and enabling localized markets, blockchain can create a more robust, resilient, and responsive energy ecosystem [1]. It also facilitates the integration of renewable energy by making it easier to connect distributed generation sources into the grid [1].

As the U.S. energy landscape continues to evolve, blockchain is emerging as a key tool for building a modern, decentralized infrastructure. Its ability to offer transparency, security, and efficiency positions it as a compelling solution for the challenges of the 21st century [1].

Agencies have responded by issuing a flurry of IFRs over the last few weeks, rescinding most of their NEPA regulations.","Key Takeaways

What happened: Over the last few weeks, individual federal agencies have issued interim final rules (IFRs) to largely rescind their existing NEPA regulations. Agencies have replaced those regulations with a mixture of slimmed-down regulations and non-binding guidance/manuals/handbooks.

Major Streamlining: Following CEQ's lead, agencies are making major changes to NEPA processes to speed up and simplify reviews. There are some variations in agency approaches, but they all follow the theme of expediting NEPA compliance and final decision-making.

Who this affects: Companies, States, and other sponsors undertaking projects that require federal permits, involve federal funding, occur on federal lands, or otherwise may trigger NEPA review.

What you should do: Stay informed about changes to relevant agency NEPA provisions and submit public comments where applicable. Many agencies are accepting comments on their IFRs until August 4, 2025. Agencies have indicated that even more NEPA changes are forthcoming.

Background

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) took effect in 1970. The Council on Environmental Quality originally issued non-binding guidance to assist agencies in developing implementation procedures. In 1977, to standardize NEPA procedures across the federal government, President Carter issued an executive order requiring CEQ to promulgate regulations that would be binding on federal agencies.

CEQ promulgated binding regulations in 1978 that largely went untouched for over 40 years. Agencies issued their own supplemental regulations that incorporated CEQ's regulations by reference. But recently, NEPA has not been immune to policy pendulum swings across administrations. The first Trump administration promulgated new CEQ regulations in 2020 that provided the first overhaul of the 1978 regulations. Congress then passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA), which codified a number of the CEQ 2020 rule provisions into law while streamlining other permitting requirements. The Biden administration then issued another overhaul of CEQ NEPA regulations in 2024, trumpeting concepts like climate change, environmental justice, and indigenous knowledge.

Over the last year, courts have driven major NEPA changes, upon which the latest agency actions seek to capitalize. First, multiple courts held that CEQ lacks the authority to issue binding NEPA regulations. In light of those rulings, the administration has used the good cause exception of the Administrative Procedure Act to rescind CEQ's binding regulations through an interim final rule (IFR) without typical prior notice-and-comment. The administration has since directed other agencies to also rescind their own NEPA regulations and issue non-binding guidance in place of rulemakings where possible. Most recently, the Supreme Court's Seven County decision afforded agencies greater discretion in determining the scope of their NEPA reviews and focusing on the effects of ""the project at hand.""

Agencies have responded by issuing a flurry of IFRs over the last few weeks, rescinding most of their NEPA regulations. Agencies have retained binding regulations to address NEPA topics most beneficial to project proponents, including categorical exclusions, emergencies, and third-party preparation of NEPA documents. Agencies have shifted the majority of their NEPA provisions to separate guidance documents, issued concurrently with the IFRs.

Although the agencies' IFRs are immediately effective, agencies are still accepting public comments on many IFRs and agency guidance. For example, the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)—encompassing their respective subagencies—as well as other agencies, are accepting public comment until August 4, 2025.

Agencies Adhere to CEQ Guidance Template

Although CEQ rescinded its binding regulations, it issued a guidance template that agencies can use while updating their own NEPA procedures. The guidance will assist agencies in adopting replacement procedures to expedite NEPA reviews, without a gap after rescinding their binding regulations. Agencies have quickly adopted many of the provisions suggested in the guidance template, with some differences.

For example, DOI, DOT, USACE, and DOE have all issued guidance or updated their regulations adopting almost word-for-word the CEQ guidance template's provisions on page limits of environmental impact statements (EISs) and environmental assessments (EAs). All have also adopted nearly identical definitions of ""impacts,"" ""major federal actions,"" and ""non-federal actions."" They have also adopted similar language around project sponsors and analytical methodologies.

Agencies have discretion in using the template, however, and some have already chosen to deviate from CEQ's guidance template in other areas.

For example, the FRA statute requires agencies to include an analysis of the negative environmental impacts of a no-action alternative in an EIS. While CEQ's guidance template largely mirrors the FRA, the agencies have adopted slightly different interpretations. DOT's guidance is to include an analysis of both beneficial and negative environmental impacts of a no action alternative, while USACE's and DOE's guidance suggests they only needs to consider negative environmental impacts of not selecting the proposed action.

Agencies' NEPA Procedures Stripped Down to Statutory Requirements in Some Instances, While Going Beyond in Others

Public Comments: Some agencies are forgoing longstanding public comment policies, particularly on a draft EIS, to include only the public input required by statute. The CEQ 1978 rule required agencies to seek comments from ""interested parties"" during both the scoping and the public comment period for the draft EIS. The CEQ 2020 rule went one step further and required agencies to publish an EIS notice of intent for public comment while maintaining the requirement to seek comment on the draft EIS. The FRA codified the requirement for agencies to publish an EIS notice of intent for public comment.

Yet, new CEQ and agency guidance suggests agencies do not need to seek comment on a draft EIS from the public, the applicant, or certain agencies without authority to develop and enforce environmental standards for the project. USACE's new procedures largely follow CEQ's guidance template, while DOI, DOT, and DOE take slightly different approaches; DOI provides for comments from a broader set of agencies and from the applicant (but not the public), while DOE and DOT make all public comment discretionary (subject to statutory requirements identified by DOT unique to surface transportation projects).

Categorical Exclusion (CE) Borrowing: CEQ and agency guidance, on the other hand, go beyond what is expressly authorized by statute in borrowing of other agencies' CEs. Under new guidance, even without adopting another agency's CE, agencies can nevertheless ""rely on the agency's determination"" that a CE applies to the action at issue, provided that it is substantially the same as the action for which the other agency applied a CE.""

Time limit extensions: The FRA codified a one-year deadline for completing an EA and a two-year deadline for completing an EIS, unless an extension is ""necessary"" to complete the analysis. The recently enacted reconciliation legislation allows project sponsors to cut those times in half by paying the government 125% of anticipated NEPA document preparation or oversight costs. The CEQ guidance template goes a step further and instructs agencies to abide by those deadlines, even if the NEPA document is incomplete, unless the analysis is ""fundamentally in breach of the spirit of NEPA's requirements."" Agencies have adopted similar, but slightly different, language in their newly issued non-binding guidance and updated regulations. For example, DOI, DOT, and USACE have all instructed their agencies to abide by the deadlines unless the analysis is ""inadequate."" DOE guidance abides by the deadlines unless the analysis is ""not sufficiently developed.""

Next Steps

Although streamlining NEPA processes will be a welcome change for many project proponents, some of these new approaches are novel and have not yet faced litigation. Agency staff will need time to adjust to these new requirements, a task complicated by the current shrinking of the federal workforce. The removal of binding regulations may also lead to inconsistencies across agencies and within different offices of a single agency. Project proponents should be aware that agency approaches to NEPA are in flux and of the ways that these new procedures could affect NEPA reviews and any associated litigation.

The Small Parties group — a collection of small and large manufacturers — defended the EPA’s settlement and its endorsement by the district court.
“The surrounding communities have waited far too long for action, and objectors to the settlement should not be allowed to delay the river cleanup any further.
What OxyChem wants OxyChem reported it has already spent $260 million on designing and preparing for the cleanup of the lower river and expects to spend another $257 million on designing the cleanup of the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic.
“I could imagine EPA securing a cleanup for the river even if this settlement is voided.”","After decades of court battles and hundreds of thousands of pages of documentation, the companies that have contributed to severe pollution in an eight-mile stretch of the Lower Passaic River are still fighting over who pays — and how much — for the cleanup.

The latest shot was fired by Occidental Chemical (OxyChem), which says it has already designed an approved cleanup plan but it wants dozens of other companies to share the estimated $1.84 billion cost of removing or capping the cocktail of toxic chemicals on the bottom of the river.

On July 28, OxyChem appealed a federal district court ruling that upheld a consent decree by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency saying the company is responsible for nearly all the cleanup costs. In 1986, the company bought Diamond Alkali, which made dioxin and other deadly chemicals in its manufacture of herbicides and pesticides in Newark from the 1940s to the 1960s.

OxyChem’s argument

The chemical giant maintains Diamond Alkali was not responsible for many of the chemicals in the river, including those resulting from prior industrial production by about 80 other companies starting in the 19th century.

“This extraordinary consent decree — which leaves OxyChem holding the bag for practically all the estimated $1.84 billion cost of cleaning up the Lower Passaic, while purporting to eliminate its right to seek contribution toward that cost from any settling party — cannot be sustained,” the company said in its appeal to the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Philadelphia.

OxyChem said the river contains ‘staggering amounts’ of contaminants.

OxyChem accused the District Court of New Jersey of ignoring the requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, and of effectively nullifying Congress’s intent to subject settlements related to the law to meaningful judicial review.

“Instead of letting OxyChem spend its own money to clean up the river and try to recover some of its costs via private-party litigation, EPA decided to let virtually everyone but OxyChem off the hook for a pittance,” the appeal reads.

“Companies that indisputably spewed vast quantities of contaminants into the Passaic for decades — many before OxyChem’s predecessor even came on the scene — thus have been relieved of all risk of liability for pennies on the dollar (if that),” the appeal said.

What the EPA decided

The EPA consent decree said the other companies, known collectively as the Small Parties Group, would pay a total of $150 million toward the cleanup, a sum that OxyChem says is nowhere near their liability. The EPA designated the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River as the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site in 1984; it is one of the nation’s most costly Superfund sites.

The Small Parties group — a collection of small and large manufacturers — defended the EPA’s settlement and its endorsement by the district court.

‘All OxyChem has asked in return is to be allowed to pursue its statutory contribution rights to recover some of the costs of that massive undertaking from the dozens of other polluters of the Passaic River.’ — OxyChem appeal

“The settlement is fair, reasonable, and will help facilitate EPA’s selected remedy for the Lower Passaic River, which has yet to begin,” the group said in a statement. “The surrounding communities have waited far too long for action, and objectors to the settlement should not be allowed to delay the river cleanup any further. We will strongly defend the settlement in court and encourage EPA to force these parties to begin to dredge and cap the lower eight miles of the river as called for in the remedial design that EPA approved over a year ago.”

OxyChem said the river contains “staggering amounts” of contaminants, including more than 3 million kilograms of lead, 2 million kilograms of copper, 400,000 kilograms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (“PAHs”), 42,000 kilograms of mercury, and 26,000 kilograms of polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”). The pollutants also include 38 kilograms of dioxins — by-products of Agent Orange, a notorious defoliant used by the U.S. military in the Vietnam War and made by Diamond Alkali at Lister Avenue in Newark’s Ironbound section.

Even before that, the contamination was so great that the federal government declared aquatic life destroyed in that section of the river in 1926. That was more than a decade before Diamond Alkali opened on the site, OxyChem said in the appeal.

The appeal recognized that Diamond Alkali contributed “significantly” to the dioxin contamination and OxyChem, as its corporate successor, has “long acknowledged” its responsibility to contribute to the cleanup.

What OxyChem wants

OxyChem reported it has already spent $260 million on designing and preparing for the cleanup of the lower river and expects to spend another $257 million on designing the cleanup of the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic. It has offered to implement the cleanup work.

“All OxyChem has asked in return is to be allowed to pursue its statutory contribution rights to recover some of the costs of that massive undertaking from the dozens of other polluters of the Passaic River,” the company said in its appeal.

The district court ruling, issued by Judge Madeline Cox Arleo last December, said the EPA’s consent decree advances the goals of the Superfund law by requiring the other companies to pay a total of $150 million toward the cleanup.

“It is reasonable because it extracts $150 million from Settling Parties — a sum significantly more than their estimated liability for the decided upon remedial action — that will be immediately available for cleanup efforts,” Cox Arleo wrote for the district court in a 47-page opinion.

Legal considerations

Steven Miano, an environmental lawyer at Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller in Philadelphia, predicted that the appeals court will hear the case, because it addresses what he called the important matter of EPA’s authority to reach a settlement in such cases.

But Miano said the appeals court is unlikely to overturn the district court ruling, because EPA has a record of acting within its authority in allocating financial responsibility.

“I would be surprised if the lower court will be found to have been wrong in approving the consent decree,” said Miano, who is not connected with the case. “EPA is typically fairly careful in taking positions on allocations in CDs [consent decrees]. It has a good track record on having such CDs approved. However, it remains to be seen how the Third Circuit analyzes this case and whether it will delve into the underlying facts.”

‘Superfund consent decrees historically have been treated extremely deferentially by the courts.’ –– Steve Gold, professor in environmental law, Rutgers Law School

If OxyChem loses the case, it could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but it’s unlikely that court would take it because the case doesn’t have enough wide legal implications, Miano said. It’s more likely that the Third Circuit will send the case back to the district court with an instruction to take another look at whether the cost allocation in EPA’s consent decree is fair, he said.

“It’s possible the Third Circuit might say, ‘There’s not adequate evidence. We’re returning it to the District Court to do a better job of parsing out all of the elements here.’ That would be new and different, and create a lot of issues for those of us who routinely enter into these types of consent decrees,” Miano said.

Cleanup timeline?

Steve Gold, a professor in environmental law at Rutgers Law School, also said the odds are against the appeals court overturning the lower court’s approval of the EPA settlement. He said there is a long record of the courts upholding Superfund consent decrees.

“Superfund consent decrees historically have been treated extremely deferentially by the courts,” Gold said. “The trial court is deferential in the choices the government makes in how to settle its enforcement claims, and then the appellate court is typically extremely deferential to the district court’s judgment about what the government did.”

Gold said OxyChem appears to be expecting to lose at the Third Circuit and would then appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. But he predicted that the high court wouldn’t take the case because it has no constitutional significance, and there’s no “really dire” statutory question.

But whatever the legal machinations, they don’t necessarily signal more delays in the river’s cleanup because the EPA could simply order the work to proceed.

“I don’t know that the fate of this settlement has to delay the cleanup,” Gold said. “I could imagine EPA securing a cleanup for the river even if this settlement is voided.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2024/04/oxychem7.png,N,,2025-08-04 03:59:29.810311

The factory in Thoothukudi will initially make 50,000 electric vehicles annually, with room to triple output to 150,000 cars. Given its proximity to a major port in one of India’s most industrialized states, Vinfast hopes it will be a hub for future exports to the region. It says the factory will create more than 3,000 local jobs.

The Vietnamese company says it scouted 15 locations across six Indian states before choosing Tamil Nadu. It’s the center of India’s auto industry, with strong manufacturing, skilled workers, good infrastructure, and a reliable supply chain, according to Tamil Nadu’s Industries Minister T.R.B. Raaja.

“This investment will lead to an entirely new industrial cluster in south Tamil Nadu, and more clusters is what India needs to emerge as a global manufacturing hub,” he said.

A strategic pivot to Asia

Vinfast’s foray into India reflects a broader shift in strategy.

The company increasingly is focusing on Asian markets after struggling to gain traction in the U.S. and Europe. It broke ground last year on a $200 million EV assembly plant in Indonesia, where it plans to make 50,000 cars annually. It’s also expanding in Thailand and the Philippines.

Vinfast sold nearly 97,000 vehicles in 2024. That’s triple what it sold the year before, but only about 10% of those sales were outside Vietnam. As it eyes markets in Asia, it hopes the factory in India will be a base for exports to South Asian countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka and also to countries in the Middle East and Africa.

India is the world’s third-largest car market by number of vehicles sold. It presents an enticing mix: A fast growing economy, rising adoption of EVs, supportive government policies and a rare market where players have yet to completely dominate EV sales.

“It is a market that no automaker in the world can ignore,” said Ishan Raghav, managing editor of the Indian car magazine autoX. .

A growing EV market in India

EV growth in India has been led by two and three-wheelers that accounted for 86% of the over six million EVs sold last year.

Sales of four wheel passenger EVs made up only 2.5% of all car sales in India last year, but they have been surging, jumping to more than 110,000 in 2024 from just 1,841 in 2019. The government aims to have EVs account for a third of all passenger vehicle sales by 2030.

“The electric car story has started (in India) only three or four years ago,” said Charith Konda, an energy specialist who looks at India’s transport and clean energy sectors for the think-tank Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis or IEEFA. New cars that “look great on the road,” with better batteries, quick charging and longer driving ranges are driving the sector’s rapid growth, he said.

The shift to EVs is mostly powered by Indian automakers, but Vinfast plans to break into the market later this year with its VF6 and VF7 SUV models, which are designed for India..

Can Vinfast Succeed Where Chinese EVs Faltered?

Chinese EV brands that dominate in countries like Thailand and Brazil have found India more challenging.

After border clashes with China in 2020, India blocked companies like BYD from building their own factories. Some then turned to partnerships. China’s SAIC, owner of MG Motor, has joined with India’s JSW Group. Their MG Windsor, a five-seater, sold 30,000 units in just nine months, nibbling Tata Motors’ 70% EV market share down to about 50%.

Tata was the first local automaker to court mass-market consumers with EVs. Its 2020 launch of the electric Nexon, a small SUV, became India’s first major EV car success.

Vinfast lacks the geopolitical baggage of its larger Chinese rivals and will also benefit from incentives like lower land prices and tax breaks for building locally in India. That’s part of India’s policy of discouraging imports with high import duties to help encourage local manufacturing and create more jobs.

The push for onshore manufacturing is a concern also for Tesla, which launched its Model Y in India last month at a price of nearly $80,000, compared to about $44,990 in the U.S without a federal tax credit.

“India’s stand is very clear. We do not want to import manufactured cars, even Teslas. Whether it’s Tesla or Chinese cars, they are taxed heavily,” added Konda.

An uphill battle in a tough market

The road ahead remains daunting. India’s EV market is crowded with well-entrenched players like Tata Motors and Mahindra, which dominate the more affordable segment, while Hyundai, MG Motors and luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and Audi compete at high price points.

Indians tend to purchase EVs as second cars used for driving within the city, since the infrastructure for charging elsewhere can be undependable. Vinfast will need to win over India’s cost-sensitive and conservative drivers with a reputation for quality batteries and services while keeping prices low, said Vivek Gulia, co-founder of JMK Research.

“Initially, people will be apprehensive,” he said.

Vinfast says it plans to set up showrooms and service centers across India, working with local companies for charging and repairs, and cutting costs by recycling batteries and making key parts like powertrains and battery packs in the country.

Scale will be key. VinFast has signed agreements to establish 32 dealerships across 27 Indian cities. Hyundai has 1,300 places for Indians to buy their cars. Building a brand in India takes time — Hyundai, for instance, pulled it off over decades, helped by an early endorsement from Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan.

VinFast can succeed if it can get its pricing right and earn the trust of customers, Gulia said, “Then they can actually do really good.”

Pierce, Sri Medicherla, The Regulatory Review",,,,,https://www.theregreview.org/2025/08/04/winston-recent-legislation-reveals-president-trumps-regulatory-approach/,"Several presidents before President Trump supported increasing market competition through legislation that deregulated U.S. industries and expanded free trade.
The law reveals that President Trump generally does not withdraw a government intervention because he envisions a superior market solution.
BYD Auto, a Chinese producer, has frequently surpassed Tesla in global electric vehicle sales—including both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.
High tariffs and stringent regulations combine, however, to create significant barriers for Chinese producers aiming to sell electric vehicles in the United States.
The entry of Chinese automobile firms could have a similar positive effect on the U.S. automobile market while helping to address an important social problem.","President Trump’s latest legislative victory reveals an inefficient approach to deregulating markets.

Efficient government policymaking recognizes when it is, and when it is not, socially desirable to intervene in markets. Thus, efficient policymakers would choose not to regulate non-government entities if market forces can produce a more efficient outcome than a prior government intervention. For example, when deregulating the airline industry in 1978, policymakers benefited air travelers by giving airlines the freedom to set fares and to enter routes they wanted to serve. The increase in competition led to lower fares and improved service.

Efficient policymakers reform, but do not withdraw, their policies to encourage certain behaviors by non-governmental entities when a government policy intervention would improve on market performance. For example, the Federal Trade Commission benefited the public by creating a National Do Not Call Registry and giving households the choice of whether to receive calls from telemarketers.

President Donald J. Trump’s recently enacted megalaw—or law—could have improved government efficiency both by withdrawing economic regulations from industries where market forces could produce more efficient outcomes than regulatory interventions and by reforming certain policies to improve their efficiency. However, the law does not attempt to accomplish either objective. This choice indicates that President Trump’s anti-government, but not pro-market, approach to policymaking is nihilistic and does not bode well for the nation’s material quality of life.

Several presidents before President Trump supported increasing market competition through legislation that deregulated U.S. industries and expanded free trade. President Gerald R. Ford supported initiatives leading to transportation deregulation. President Jimmy Carter signed legislation advancing deregulation of the airline, trucking, railroad, natural gas, and banking industries. President Ronald Reagan signed legislation deregulating interstate bus transportation, the savings and loan industry, and cable television. President Bill Clinton persuaded the U.S. Congress to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement and furthered deregulation of telecommunications, branch banking, and intrastate trucking. President Barack Obama spearheaded the Trans-Pacific Partnership with Asian countries, excluding China, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union.

President Trump did not build on those deregulatory successes in his first term, and the law does not include economic deregulation initiatives. President Trump could have led the effort to deregulate, for instance, current prices, entry, and exit in the global airline industry by persuading countries to grant cabotage rights, which would allow any airline to serve any country’s domestic routes and to charge any fares they wanted. For example, United Airlines would be free to serve New York to Pisa, Italy, by offering non-stop flights from New York to Rome and its own connecting flights from Rome to Pisa, reducing travelers’ transfer-wait time in Rome. Foreign airlines would be free to serve any U.S. domestic and international route, which would increase competition, reduce fares, and improve service frequency in the United States and throughout the world.

But, despite the potential benefits to U.S. travelers from global airline deregulation, the law does not include it. It also does not include ocean shipping deregulation, which President Trump explored in his first term by considering whether to eliminate the Jones Act. President Trump subsequently decided against eliminating it for unknown reasons.

The law reveals that President Trump generally does not withdraw a government intervention because he envisions a superior market solution. Instead, he withdraws the intervention because he has little faith in government, especially his Democratic predecessors, which is consistent with his disinterest in government regulatory reform.

For example, the tax credits instituted under the Biden Administration for the purchase of new or used electric vehicles will be eliminated by the law on September 30, 2025. This elimination is a step in the right direction of regulatory reform because the tax credits are an inefficient approach to reducing pollution, relying on taxpayer-funded subsidies that benefit vehicle manufacturers and households with above-average incomes instead of relying on user charges paid by motorists who are polluting the environment. Replacing tax credits with efficient emissions taxes would be appropriate regulatory reform because it would incentivize all motorists to drive cleaner-burning gasoline vehicles and would spur some motorists to purchase electric vehicles. And, although tax credits add to the federal deficit, emissions tax revenues could be used to help reduce the federal deficit.

However, the law “deregulates” policies to reduce automobile emissions and eschews efficient regulatory reform. In other words, although motor vehicle emissions are widely recognized by conservative and liberal economists as a textbook example of a negative externality that causes adverse health effects, including neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, reproductive, and immune system damage, they are ignored by the law.

President Trump also forecloses a possible market approach to reducing automobile emissions. Currently, Chinese electric vehicle producers collectively possess the largest market share of electric vehicles in the world. BYD Auto, a Chinese producer, has frequently surpassed Tesla in global electric vehicle sales—including both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. High tariffs and stringent regulations combine, however, to create significant barriers for Chinese producers aiming to sell electric vehicles in the United States.

The United States could greatly spur domestic sales of electric vehicles to help improve the environment by allowing Chinese producers to sell their vehicles in the United States, provided they manufacture their electric vehicles in America to address concerns about job losses, not receive subsidies from the Chinese government to address concerns about competitive disadvantages, and address the U.S. government’s security concerns.

Japanese automobile firms transformed the U.S. automobile market by building manufacturing plants in the United States in the 1980s and selling high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles. Consumers benefited from the improvement in vehicle price-quality offerings, and U.S. automobile firms were incentivized to improve the quality of their vehicles. The entry of Chinese automobile firms could have a similar positive effect on the U.S. automobile market while helping to address an important social problem.

Yet, because President Trump is not drawn to market solutions—nor does he believe it is the government’s responsibility to address a negative externality efficiently—he ignores the approach, as does the law.

There has also been no information on how these small nuclear reactors dotted all over the place can be protected from attacks especially by armed drones.

The uranium fuel would have to be imported which is an added problem and is also unethical as it is mainly mined on indigenous peoples lands from Canada, Namibia, the Republic of the Congo, the southern states of the USA, Kazakhstan and Australia where for years the miners and their families have suffered from the resulting severe illnesses.

To address delays in energy infrastructure development, the report proposes the creation of an independent Clean Energy Coordinator-General.","According to the report, Australia should enhance incentives in the electricity, heavy industry, and transport sectors to facilitate an efficient transition to net zero emissions. Together, these sectors represent 79% of Australia’s total gross emissions.

The Productivity Commission is an Australian government research and advisory body focused on economic, social, and environmental issues.

Specifically, the report suggests implementing market-based incentives in the electricity sector to replace the Renewable Energy Target (RET) and the hugely successful Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS), with the PC stating that neither will support new investments in renewables after 2030.

The CIS aims to promote new investments in reliable clean energy generation, enhance system reliability, and mitigate the risk of price fluctuations in Australia’s evolving energy market. Its successes thus far recently saw the federal government upsize its 2030 target from 32GW to 40GW.

Successful projects in the CIS are offered long-term Commonwealth underwriting agreements with an agreed-upon revenue “floor” and “ceiling.”

Commissioner Barry Sterland said reaching net zero at the lowest possible cost is central to the PC’s productivity challenge.

“With the right policy settings, we can limit the costs of decarbonising and speed up our approvals to unlock the opportunities of lower-cost, more abundant clean energy. We can also boost our resilience to the effects of climate change and minimise their human and economic costs,” Sterland said.

Policy frameworks driving renewable energy expansion

Australia’s renewable energy sector has benefited from various supportive policies, and the report underscores the importance of maintaining and expanding these frameworks.

The Commission highlights the need for robust policy mechanisms to incentivise investment in clean technologies, particularly in regions with high renewable energy potential.

Renewable energy zones (REZs) have been identified as a critical tool for facilitating large-scale solar PV development, providing the infrastructure needed to connect new generation capacity to the grid.

The expansion of REZ across the National Electricity Market (NEM) is expected to reduce curtailment risks and improve energy distribution efficiency, making it a key enabler for solar PV growth. Developers and investors are advised to closely monitor the rollout of these zones, as they will dictate the geographic focus of future installations.

Additionally, the report calls for streamlined regulatory processes to accelerate project approvals and reduce barriers to entry for new market participants. Planning delays were referenced as one of the biggest obstacles to clean energy investment in the NEM in a report released by advocacy and engagement platform Clean Energy Investor Group (CEIG) last month.

To address delays in energy infrastructure development, the report proposes the creation of an independent Clean Energy Coordinator-General. This role would oversee priority renewable energy projects, ensuring they are assessed and approved more efficiently.

The Coordinator-General would be supported by a specialist “strike team” tasked with breaking through regulatory and logistical roadblocks. This initiative could significantly reduce project timelines, benefiting developers and investors in the renewable energy sector.

Market trends and investment opportunities

Australia’s solar PV market is poised for continued growth, with the report projecting a steady increase in installed capacity through 2030.

This expansion is driven by strong demand from residential, commercial, and utility-scale segments and supportive policies such as feed-in tariffs and renewable energy certificates.

However, the report cautions that grid constraints and regulatory bottlenecks could slow progress if not addressed promptly, echoing the CEIG’s thoughts.

The report highlights the importance of aligning capital allocation with emerging market trends for investors. The growing integration of solar PV with energy storage systems presents a lucrative opportunity, particularly as hybrid renewables-plus-storage solutions become the norm for new installations.

Additionally, the report points to the rising demand for distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop solar and community-scale storage, as a key growth area for the sector. The Australian Energy Market Commissioner (AEMC) has recently explored the role virtual power plants (VPPs) and DERs could play in the NEM, potentially enabling them to compete with large-scale generators.

A recurring theme in the report is the emphasis on technology-neutral policies. By avoiding favouritism toward specific technologies or regions, the Commission believes this will create a level playing field that encourages the adoption of the most efficient and cost-effective solutions.

Non-profit organisation Climate Council has welcomed the PC’s report on Australia’s net zero transition, emphasising the critical role of renewable energy in driving productivity growth and economic resilience.

“The report highlights that accelerating the roll out of renewable power, through faster approvals, will support productivity growth – lowering developers’ costs, attracting investment and making energy cheaper. To do this, Australia’s national environmental laws must be reformed,” Climate Council CEO, Amanda McKenzie, said.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/solar-PV-plant-Lumea-Australia-Image-Lumea-768x431-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 00:59:19.571232

A few days ago, Chevrolet put out a press release about the new version of the Chevy Bolt. As press releases go, it was remarkably short. Here it is in its entirety:

The Chevrolet Bolt is back. Almost.

From its market introduction in 2017, the Chevrolet Bolt changed the game as the first long-range, mass-produced EV available to customers at a truly affordable price. Production ended in December 2023. But by popular demand, GM is bringing it back for the 2027 model year.

And it is better than ever.

More details will be revealed in a few months. For now, we can give you a quick preview of what’s to come. There will be updates to the front fascia and rear tail lamps, a NACS charging adapter port, and some other cool stuff that…we’ll show you later.

Hopscotching the automotive world for headlines, we came with a few details, but not many. InsideEVs reports that the new car will be much like the old car in appearance except for new headlight and taillight treatments. GM has previously said the Bolt 2.0 will be upgraded to use its latest suite of battery tech and software, similar to what it now deploys on cars like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and Cadillac Lyriq.

We do know that the next generation car will have an LFP battery pack, which should be a big factor in keeping the starting price down while making the car profitable. “While it won’t be a completely clean-sheet design, it will be a thoroughly modern EV with newer safety equipment,” InsideEVs says.

Chevrolet has not announced prices for the Bolt 2.0, but it will have to be noticeably less money than the Equinox EV that lists for around $35,000. No doubt Chevrolet has a plan to deal with the discontinuance of the federal EV tax credit. While that is a setback for EV enthusiasts, such rebates have a way of keeping prices high, so once it disappears on September 30, 2025, we will see whether there will be any significant downward pressure on the price of new EVs.

“It’s going to be at a similar price point than the old one going out, which is very low,” GM President Mark Reuss told InsideEVs at the Detroit launch of the Silverado EV and Equinox EV last year. “We’re going to deliver it at a profitable point.”

GM Authority commented after seeing side by side photos of the old car and the new car that the latest version has a noticeable amount of extra bodywork — by about 6 inches — ahead of the front wheels. “While it may seem like a small design tweak, it could hint at broader changes under the skin,” it said.

“The 2027 Chevy Bolt EV is expected to ride on the GM BEV2 platform, which previously underpinned the now-discontinued Bolt EUV. In fact, spy shots suggest the overall proportions and silhouette remain quite similar between the different generations. And yet, the longer overhang suggests GM may be rethinking some elements of the front-end architecture.

“The new front overhang likely isn’t related to the battery pack or primary powertrain components, as those are typically integrated into the floor structure of BEV2 based vehicles. However, the extra forward length could serve several practical purposes. One possibility is more space for improved cooling systems, which may be necessary depending on the type of electric motor or thermal management system at work.

“Another possible consideration is crash safety. Extending the front overhang could allow for improved crumple zones, absorbing more energy in the event of a frontal impact. This would help the Bolt meet more stringent crash-test standards and possibly improve insurance safety ratings.

“There’s also the possibility that the added space up front will accommodate the latest driver-assistance hardware. Modern systems like Enhanced Automatic Emergency Braking, Front Pedestrian Braking, and Cyclist Detection often rely on large sensor arrays, including radar modules and forward facing cameras that require physical space and specific mounting geometry.”

According to Ward’s Auto, the original Bolt was equipped with a 200 hp electric motor that had 266 lb.-ft. of torque (361 Nm). The 2027 Bolt is likely to use the same motor used in front-wheel drive versions of the Equinox EV. That motor is rated at 213 hp and 236 lb.-ft of torque (320 Nm). While base models are likely to be FWD only, the Bolt 2.0 is expected to have a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version available.

While Chevrolet has not released any technical specs for the new car — which is still about 8 months away from appearing in dealer showrooms — the motoring press is projecting a range of around 300 miles, which would be about 20 percent more than the original. In addition, the new car will come with a NACS charging port, which is raising hopes that charging speeds will be improved to between 125 and 150 kW — almost triple what the original was capable of. That will be a huge advantage for Bolt owners who want more than just a commuting car.

The Original Continues To Shine

My wife and I drive a 2017 Chevy Bolt with the upgraded battery in the summer. This is our third year with the car and it has been all over New England reliably and in complete comfort. We have put about 8,000 miles on the car and it just keeps getting better and better. Recently we saw 307 miles on the guess-o-meter after a full charge and the car consistently gets about 4.5 miles per kWh, which is stellar performance by anyone’s standards.

90 percent of our charging takes place using a standard wall outlet, but we have noticed there are more and more charging opportunities in New England today than there were when we first bought the car. We have purchased an adapter to allow us to use Tesla Supercharger locations but have not tried one yet, as many of the Superchargers in our area are V1 equipment that is not compatible with our Bolt. We do have a 10-day road trip coming up later this month, so maybe we will get a chance to Supercharge then.

All in all, it is a great little car — fast and comfortable. Although, it does tend to eat electrons at higher highway speeds, so we keep it between 65 and 70 mph and smile at the cement mixers and semis that pass us. EV drivers are less inclined to be the fastest cars on the road and we are comfortable taking our time, even if it adds 10 minutes to our trip.

If the Bolt 2.0 is a noticeable improvement over the original at an affordable price, it will be just what America needs to keep the EV revolution moving forward.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bolt-headlight.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 00:59:42.368889

Several Republican Senators are sending signals of unhappiness to the Trump administration. These politicians have basked in the glow of Inflation Reduction Act largess from the Biden administration, and now the Senators are nervous they won’t be able to salvage funding for renewables that are already earmarked for their states. Politico reports that the Republican advocacy “comes on the heels of the Interior Department’s new secretarial order calling for the identification of any ‘preferential treatment’ toward wind and solar facilities in current regulations, guidance, policies, and agency practices.”

Increased national productivity is a key ingredient of sustained growth. Nonetheless, while promising an all-of-the-above energy mix, Trump and his merry pranksters have done everything in their power to halt the exponential rise of solar and wind energy projects.

Fear among Republicans is that power demand failures will spark consumer scrutiny, which could have negative consequences for 2026 elections. “It will become very clear very quickly that our energy needs will outstrip our ability to produce energy unless we also include wind energy in the mix,” explains Senator Mike Rounds, who represents the large wind-producing state of South Dakota.

There is also the stark realization that more than half of clean energy projects since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act were located in red states. Oops. The loss of investment and jobs will hurt communities that voted for less government — or so they thought.

One barrier to Trump’s proclamation to “drill, baby, drill” is coming from an usual source: the oil and gas sector itself. Even with opportunities to drill on additional public lands at reduced royalty rates and limits on incentives for wind and solar, there’s been a relatively lackluster push for more fossil power.

“The industry is going to do what the industry is going to do,” Jenny Rowland-Shea, director for public lands at the Center for American Progress, told Wired.

The price of oil is the driving factor for its commercial production. Global demand and supply dynamics figure heavily into that equation — much more so than as a reaction to a White House prod. It might seem that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s vision to reduce new wind and solar would be making headway with energy speculation.

However, the appeal of solar and wind is getting harder and harder to deny. “Paradigm shifts like this don’t come along often,” climate activist Bill McKibben reminds us.

Last year, 96% of the global demand for new electricity was met by renewables.

In the US, during that time, 93% of new generating capacity came from solar, wind, and an ever-increasing variety of batteries to store that power.

In March 2025, for the first time, fossil fuels generated less than half the electricity in the US.

Texas is now installing renewable energy and batteries faster than California. The state has also set records for solar and wind production as well as for battery discharge.

A 2025 United Nations analysis concludes that “solar and wind are now almost always the least expensive — and the fastest — option for new electricity generation.” With costs falling far faster than originally predicted, solar and wind have become “the fastest growing sources of electricity in history, and growth in renewable energy is now outpacing that in fossil fuels in the power sector.”

Global Voices for a Wide-Ranging Energy Mix

Politicians who recognize the need for funding for renewables are speaking up around the world. Chancellor Rachel Reeves of Scotland rebuked Trump’s remarks that the North Sea is a “treasure chest,” saying that renewable and non-renewable energy sources are not an “either-or” equation.

Reeves acknowledged that oil and gas continue to be “incredibly important for the UK and our energy security.” The plan for energy production doesn’t stop there for Scotland, however. “At the same time, we’re investing in clean homegrown energy, including at Berwick Bank in Scotland, which will create thousands of new jobs and power millions of homes. And that’s what we need to do to make sure that our economy has this energy security that we need, that we bring down bills and bring more good jobs to Scotland.”

As example, a proposed wind farm, off the coast of East Lothian has the potential to add more than 4.1 gigawatts of capacity, which could power more than six million homes annually. Continually focusing on superficial perceptions of wind turbines, Trump reacted to Reeves’ remarks by saying, “When we go to Aberdeen, you’ll see some of the ugliest windmills you’ve ever seen, the height of a 50-story building.”

No Funding for Renewables for Security?

The US military consumes 80% of all of the energy that the federal government uses annually. The Biden administration had embarked on an ambitious campaign to drastically cut the US military’s carbon emissions as part of its broader climate strategy. Trump 2.o doesn’t have time for decarbonization — the Administration is busy with Coca Cola and renaming bodies of water.

Yet two projects designated for military applications demonstrate how funding for renewables and companies that support them makes sense.

One example is US firm NanoGraf, which announced last July that it held production-scale orders for its new silicon battery, with the US military in mind. Today’s electronic military gear requires batteries, and plenty of them, to power the increasing load of portable electronic gear carried by soldiers.

Another is Solar Ready Vets, which is a collection of initiatives designed to strengthen solar career pathways for veterans and support the industry’s efforts to invest in military talent. Funded by the US Department of Energy, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is working alongside the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), solar businesses, and other partners to develop resources that help the solar and storage industry recruit and retain veterans and the broader military-connected community.

After years of seemingly unstoppable momentum, we’re now seeing what some are calling “the great EV pullback”. Even the mighty Tesla has revealed a significant drop in revenue, prompting a raft of deals to shift metal. Add in shifting political winds like the rollback of EV tax credits, and you have a recipe for uncertainty. But it seems Ford is looking to cut through the noise with a move of historical proportions.

In what he’s calling a “Model T moment,” Ford CEO Jim Farley has announced that the company is preparing to unveil a “breakthrough” electric vehicle and an entirely new platform on August 11th. It’s a bold claim, deliberately evoking the revolutionary car that put the world on wheels. But is it just clever marketing, or is Ford truly on the verge of redefining the affordable EV? The project is the brainchild of Ford’s “skunkworks” team, a clandestine group led by none other than former Tesla engineer Alan Clarke. For some time, this team has been working in the background, tasked with a single, crucial mission: to develop a genuinely affordable electric car without the compromises. According to Farley, this isn’t just about making a cheaper Mustang Mach-E. He envisions “a new family of vehicles to the world that offer incredible technology, efficiency, space, and features”.

This new, low-cost platform is the key. While Ford’s current EV business has taken a substantial $1.3 billion financial hit, this new architecture represents a ground-up rethink. The first vehicle built on this platform is slated to be a pickup truck, set for a 2027 release, with a range of other models to follow. This strategy mirrors the original Model T’s success, which became a versatile base for countless applications, not just a single car.Farley has been refreshingly direct about the primary target: low-cost EVs from Chinese automotive giants like BYD and Geely. He acknowledges that to be competitive on a global scale, Ford can’t just tweak its existing methods. “We believe the only way to really compete effectively with the Chinese… is to go and really push ourselves to radically reengineer and transform our engineering supply chain and manufacturing process,” Farley stated.

While competitors are navigating slumping sales and political pressures like tariffs that Ford expects will cost it $2 billion annually, the Blue Oval is doubling down.

It has not changed its policy yet, but Reuters reported that Indian oil refineries had paused purchases of Russian oil while matters are worked out.
India’s imports of Russian oil averaged 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of this year.","Energy was one of the most freely traded goods in the post-Second World War era, even behind the Iron Curtain. A flood of sanctions has eroded that in recent years. But are the latest EU-US trade deal and Donald Trump’s tariff threats an even greater danger?

Under Thursday’s trade pact, the EU has agreed to buy an extra $250 billion of US energy each year until 2027, and invest $600 billion in the US by 2028.

Separately, Mr Trump has proposed “secondary tariffs” on countries buying Russian oil, notably India. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told China that it would face 100 per cent tariffs if it continued to purchase Russian oil, for which it is the biggest customer.

The reality of the European deal can be dismissed in detail.

Impossible numbers

The bloc imported $76 billion of American coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and oil last year. The US exported $318 billion of energy to all its customers, and EU customers imported nearly $407 billion of energy from all suppliers. So, the US would have to divert all its energy exports to Europe, and Europe would in turn have to buy almost exclusively from America.

Yes, US LNG exports are set to rise substantially. Here are some easy gains in energy trade for the EU. The last remnants of the old Russian gas empire will be swept away, as Brussels plans to end imports from its hostile neighbour by 2027.

But prices are likely to fall as new supply comes online over the next five years, from Qatar, the UAE, Canada and elsewhere as well as the US. Japan and South Korea have also agreed to buy more American energy products. Meanwhile, the EU’s bulk energy buys will probably keep falling, as renewables and electric vehicles meet more of its needs.

“Europe” does not buy energy – its companies and consumers do. There is no way for Brussels to redirect energy trade on the massive scale required to meet these commitments. Big chunks of the imports are from Norway, Algeria and Azerbaijan, tied into the EU by gas pipelines. These are not going to be diverted elsewhere, whatever the White House tries to dictate.

Similarly, US companies decide whom to sell to on commercial, not political grounds. Here, admittedly, some combination of arm-twisting and subsidies might divert trade. But that is more likely to relate to large, visible, single inward investments such as Japan’s reported interest in the $44 billion Alaska LNG project.

One-trick trade pony

European companies would invest in renewable, hydrogen and electric vehicle projects in the US – but these are undercut by the current administration’s hostility. The withdrawal of tax incentives, increased barriers to receiving permits, and onerous rules on foreign content, make them unappealing. As Nippon Steel found out in its purchase of US Steel, sizeable foreign acquisitions of American companies are also likely to face unreasonable opposition and an opaque process of lobbying to win approval.

The reliance on energy sales shows the US to be a one-trick trade pony – or at best, three tricks, including agricultural goods and weapons. Its other goods are not very competitive – gas-guzzling cars and planes that fall out of the sky – and will become even less so as tariffs drive up input costs for key materials such as aluminium, steel and copper.

Ultimately, such trade commitments by Europe are not going to raise US oil and gas output. So, even if fulfilled, they just shuffle energy trade around.

Sanctions could be a different matter. Mr Trump could execute his threat of 100 per cent tariffs against India and China if they persist in buying Russian oil. This is a bizarre approach to defeating Moscow’s war against Ukraine, instead of imposing stronger sanctions on specific customers and shippers, which is the same approach used against Iran.

Beijing will not back down; it cannot allow its economic model, its foreign policy, its alignment with Moscow, to be dictated by Washington. It buys about two million barrels per day of Russian oil.

New Delhi might concede, though. It has not changed its policy yet, but Reuters reported that Indian oil refineries had paused purchases of Russian oil while matters are worked out. India’s imports of Russian oil averaged 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of this year. The third major customer, Turkey, takes about 250,000 barrels daily.

If India and Turkey drop out, China would no doubt step up its purchases of Russian oil, but it would not take all the remainder. This is partly for logistical reasons, but also political. It would gain further leverage over its junior ally, and could extract generous discounts, as it does from Iran, where it is essentially the only customer.

So, there would probably be an overall reduction in Russian oil exports. The gap would be filled by Opec+, depending on its policy decisions, and potentially by higher US output. But US oil production will only increase if prices rise substantially. Mr Trump has shown himself acutely sensitive to inflation and to the concerns of American drivers, preferring lower rather than higher prices, to the discomfort of his supporters in Texas.

So how does this all tie together? Less Russian oil and gas means more room for Gulf suppliers. If they end up sending less to Europe to fill a gap in India, or if prices rise enough to boost American production, the US may then supply more to Europe, cosmetically satisfying part of the trade deal.

The inconsistency and volatile, contradictory messages emanating from the White House make all this very hard to evaluate. There’s a good chance that the impending “secondary tariffs” never materialise. Yet what is clear that a free and liquid energy market is being replaced by a constrained and politicised one.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/DUK36FR2PYRDAPX4N6MKLBS3HA.jpg?smart=true&auth=7d18195fef75f6b0130bb85a5a525383ba56988ec2ed1bc588fcc6da236c1bad&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-08-04 00:00:33.211210

A powerful means to curb carbon dioxide emissions is pure electric vehicles, which do not emit carbon dioxide during operation.

However, a report points out that if the production of EVs increases excessively, it may actually exacerbate environmental pollution. The report predicts that by 2030, compared with the scenario where the production of EVs does not increase, sulfur dioxide emissions in various countries will increase by 79% in China and 19% in India...

After the 18th century, humanity achieved industrialization at the cost of causing many environmental hazards. People failed to anticipate the environmental pollution risks posed by technological innovations such as steam engines and the chemical industry, which brought harm to local residents. In the second half of the 20th century, environmental protection measures made progress. However, some scientific studies point out that if new technologies such as pure electric vehicles (EVs) and artificial intelligence (AI) become more widespread in the future, they may trigger new environmental problems, mainly in emerging market countries. Can we prevent potential problems by paying attention to the negative aspects of technological innovation?

Carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels leads to global warming. A powerful means to curb carbon dioxide emissions is pure electric vehicles, which do not emit carbon dioxide during operation. The latest models of pure electric vehicles are also very popular at auto shows around the world.

Pure electric vehicles are highly anticipated as a means to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (Beijing, 2024)

According to data released by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 2023, if the world is to achieve net - zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, in the automotive sector, the annual sales of pure electric vehicles need to increase to seven times that of 2022, reaching 70 million units by 2030.

Many people regard pure electric vehicles as a symbol of environmental protection. However, a paper published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and Princeton University in 2024 pointed out that ""if the production of pure electric vehicles increases excessively, it may actually exacerbate environmental pollution."" What's going on?

The paper predicts the amount of air pollutants generated by the production of pure electric vehicles. It analyzes two scenarios: (1) continuing the current policies in the production of pure electric vehicles; (2) the popularization of pure electric vehicles and an increase in production in China and India. The results show that if the production of pure electric vehicles increases, the emissions of sulfur dioxide generated during the extraction of battery materials may also increase.

During the analysis, it is assumed that all pure electric vehicles are equipped with batteries using nickel, etc., and are produced in China and India. It is predicted that by 2030, compared with the scenario where the production of pure electric vehicles does not increase, sulfur dioxide emissions in various countries will increase by 79% in China and 19% in India. Pure electric vehicles do not emit sulfur oxides such as sulfur dioxide, which are mainly contained in the exhaust of diesel vehicles, during operation. However, more sulfur dioxide may be generated during battery manufacturing.

The World Health Organization (WHO) states that long - term exposure to high - concentration sulfur dioxide can easily exacerbate asthma or cause cardiovascular diseases. The research team from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and others pointed out that ""it is crucial to re - evaluate the environmental burden of the entire supply chain (such as batteries).""

Looking back at history, innovative technologies in each era have promoted the development of civilization while also causing environmental hazards. Based on the reflection on the fact that environmental hazards have damaged the health of many people, countries have taken countermeasures. Currently, mainly in developed countries, people's focus has shifted from past environmental hazards to measures to address global warming.

However, modern new technologies may once again lead to environmental pollution that was previously overcome. Alongside pure electric vehicles, AI, which is rapidly spreading in work and life scenarios, is a prime example.

High - performance AI running on servers in data centers requires a large amount of electricity. If it relies on thermal power generation, in addition to carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides will also be emitted. During the manufacturing of semiconductor chips used in AI computing, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with a size of less than 2.5 microns is also generated in processes such as grinding.

A paper published in 2024 by the University of California, Riverside, and others estimated the amount of air pollutants generated throughout the process from chip manufacturing to high - performance AI development and data center operation.

The study shows that during the development of the large language model (LLM) ""Llama 3.1"" by Meta in the United States, up to 1.5 tons of PM2.5 and 13.5 tons of nitrogen oxides were generated. This is equivalent to the amount of exhaust emissions from a car traveling back and forth more than 10,000 times between Los Angeles and New York, which are about 4,000 kilometers apart in a straight line. The reason lies in the large amount of electricity and semiconductor chips used.

Some scientific studies show that technological innovation may lead to new environmental problems. Humanity has repeatedly experienced the benefits and environmental hazards brought by new technologies. Can we prevent potential problems this time? We need to use the wisdom of modern people who learn from historical lessons.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20250804/v2_48c9f304424b4ba68941514a12857785@5888275@ai_oswg755048oswg1053oswg495_img_png~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 01:59:51.898159

This change dramatically shortens the planning horizon for families considering solar. If you're thinking about going solar, the time to act is now — not next year.”

— Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia

BANGOR, ME, UNITED STATES, August 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Suncovia, a leading advocate for equitable clean energy solutions, has expressed deep concern over the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, 2025. With its passing, the federal 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D) is officially ending on December 31, 2025. The legislation abruptly stops the long-standing tax credit without a phase-out period — creating a narrow and urgent window for homeowners to take advantage of this historic incentive.

Suncovia, a leading force in solar project development and clean energy financing, is calling on homeowners, contractors, and developers to move quickly. This tax credit sunset is one of the most consequential energy policy shifts in over a decade.

“This change dramatically shortens the planning horizon for families considering solar,” said Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia. “If you're thinking about going solar, the time to act is now — not next year.”

WHAT HOMEOWNERS NEED TO KNOW:

DECEMBER 31, 2025 IS A HARD DEADLINE

To qualify for the 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit, solar systems must be fully installed and operational by the end of 2025 — no extensions, no carryovers.

THERE IS NO PHASE-DOWN — NO GRACE PERIOD

Contrary to the Inflation Reduction Act’s original plan for a gradual wind-down through 2034, this legislation cuts the credit off entirely after 2025.

COMMERCIAL SOLAR CREDIT REMAINS, BUT WITH NEW DATES

The 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for commercial and utility-scale projects still stands but now includes new rules: projects must start by July 4, 2026, and be operational by December 31, 2027, to remain eligible.

IMPACTS FOR HOMEOWNERS AND THE INDUSTRY:

The end of the federal residential solar tax credit could significantly impact both consumers and the broader solar market. For homeowners, the loss of the 30% credit may result in noticeably higher upfront costs for solar installations. Without the federal incentive, many may experience longer return-on-investment timelines beginning in 2026, which could dampen enthusiasm and delay decision-making.

Additionally, the compressed deadline is expected to create logistical challenges. As the end-of-year deadline approaches, installers may become overbooked, and material availability could tighten. These bottlenecks could prevent some homeowners from completing their installations in time to qualify for the credit.

From an industry perspective, the sudden removal of the residential incentive is likely to cause market disruption. The reduced demand could lead to job losses, particularly among smaller solar contractors and residential-focused providers. This shift may also slow the overall pace of solar adoption, just as the U.S. seeks to solidify its leadership in the global clean energy transition.

Suncovia remains committed to making clean energy accessible. In response to these changes, the company is expanding its support for residential installations through Q4 2025. The company is also closely monitoring legislative activity and working with industry partners and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) to advocate for long-term policies that support clean energy adoption and economic resilience.

Suncovia strongly encourages homeowners to act now, before it’s too late. Homeowners should schedule their solar evaluations, secure permits, and finalize installations well before year-end to ensure eligibility for the 30% tax credit.

“This is the last full year for homeowners to take advantage of the most generous solar incentive in U.S. history,” added Craig Mattson. “We don’t want anyone to miss out due to delays or misinformation.”

ABOUT SUNCOVIA

The Productivity Commission has recommended that the Fuel Tax Credit Scheme should be overhauled to substantially reduce the size of the tax credits flowing through to big business.

Australian Unions are calling for capping the Fuel Tax Credit Scheme so that no company can claim more than $20 million a year in fuel tax credits. This would stop unnecessary billions in taxpayer dollars from flowing to big miners, while keeping the benefits in place for smaller operators.

This measure would generate at least $14 billion in revenue over the next three years, a part of which could be used to help heavy vehicle users decarbonise their fleet, through buying electric and low-carbon vehicles.

Australian Unions also support the Productivity Commission’s recommendation for a streamlined, accelerated development approvals system to speed up the approval of more renewable energy projects.

Unions will go into this month’s Economic Reform Roundtable advocating for a new national approvals system for renewable energy and transmission projects to progress them faster to a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’ determination, including by ensuring workers and communities get their fair share of the benefits.

The process would reduce the long periods of uncertainty regional communities face while waiting for new jobs in renewable energy, particularly those on the front line of the energy transition.

This reform is essential for meeting Australia’s climate goals under the Paris Agreement, and for powering burgeoning clean industries like green metals, critical minerals, and renewable manufacturing that have the potential to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.

Unions also support new production tax incentives for green iron and green alumina projects, more R&D support for Future Made in Australia industries, a network of regional industrial innovation precincts, and requiring the Government’s specialist investment vehicles to better support regional communities in transition.

Quotes attributable to ACTU President, Michele O’Neil:

“Australian Unions want to see living standards rise for everyone, and increasing productivity is one way to achieve this, if the gains are shared fairly.

“Good productivity measures will see everyone’s living standards rise through investing in people, research, innovation, skills and technology.

“A faster, fairer path towards a net zero economy, including an improved development approvals process, which guarantees shared benefits with workers and communities, can take us a long way down the road.

The decision, aimed at spurring demand across buses, cars, and trucks, is expected to be formally clarified soon, sources told TNN.

The proposal was among key action points discussed in a high-level meeting chaired by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba and attended by senior officials from Niti Aayog, the road transport ministry, and the power ministry. The meeting was convened amid concerns over the country’s slow EV penetration — just 7.6 per cent in 2024 against a 2030 target of 30 per cent.

Advt

While EV adoption is relatively strong in the two- and three-wheeler segments and urban buses, progress in four-wheelers and electric trucks remains sluggish. A source said that Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam supported a proposal by road transport secretary V Umashankar that removing the EoL limit for EVs, particularly privately owned older buses, could stimulate fresh demand in the segment.

In parallel, the power ministry is expected to expedite the extension of Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) norms to cover urban freight vehicles, buses, and trucks — a move intended to tighten emissions control across commercial transportation.

Strategies for EV adoption

There was also consensus at the meeting to pivot away from incentives alone, and instead focus on mandates and disincentives to push EV adoption. One strategy under consideration is to saturate five major cities with electric buses, urban freight vehicles, and para-transit EVs, supported by rapid deployment of charging infrastructure and fast chargers.

Officials stressed the need to localise battery manufacturing, encourage new battery technologies, and address the high upfront cost of EVs — particularly for e-trucks and buses — by improving access to finance.

In a follow-up meeting chaired by financial services secretary M Nagaraju, public sector banks raised concerns about financing challenges. They sought standardisation of EV batteries, cost reductions, and incentives to offset the expense of battery replacements — typically required every 6-7 years and comprising 40-50 per cent of an EV’s cost.

Advt

With the EV ecosystem still maturing in many regions, the government’s shift in approach could prove pivotal in meeting its ambitious 2030 electrification targets.

There are two principal credits enacted in the IRA that benefit wind and solar projects – the clean electricity production credit and the clean electricity investment credit.
The first principal credit is the clean electricity production credit in Internal Revenue Code (""IRC"") Section 45Y.
Two IRS Notices, 2013-29 and 2018-59, had previously provided rules for determining the beginning of construction for applicable tax credits.
Notwithstanding that language in the Statute, project developers may now need to wait for the new guidance before beginning construction if the project economics are dependent on the availability of tax credits.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the ""OBBBA"") signed by President Trump on July 4, 2025, reflected the administration's policy decision to end incentives for clean and renewable energy enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act (the ""IRA"") during the previous administration. Tax credits for wind and solar projects in particular will face early termination.

There are two principal credits enacted in the IRA that benefit wind and solar projects – the clean electricity production credit and the clean electricity investment credit. Taxpayers cannot claim both credits for the same facility. Both these credits are transferable, thus allowing developers to monetize the credits to provide funding for projects. As an alternative to transferability, developers may form complex tax equity partnerships to obtain equity investment in return for allocations of credits.

The first principal credit is the clean electricity production credit in Internal Revenue Code (""IRC"") Section 45Y. This new credit enacted under the IRA applies for facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024. This is available for electricity produced by the taxpayer at a qualified facility and sold to an unrelated person during the taxable year. The credit is also available where such electricity is consumed or stored by the taxpayer during the taxable year and there is no third-party sale, if the qualified facility is equipped with a metering device owned and operated by an unrelated person. The credit is available for electricity produced during the 10-year period beginning when the qualified facility is originally placed in service. The base credit rate is 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. This amount is increased to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour for facilities with a maximum output of less than one megawatt of electricity (as measured in alternating current) and for facilities that meet certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. The credit is increased by 10% for facilities located in energy communities (certain brownfield cites, communities that had significant employment in coal or gas extraction experiencing above average unemployment, or census tracts having closed coal mines or coal fired generating plants and adjoining census tracts to them). Additionally, the credit is increased by 10% if certain domestic content requirements are met. This credit is further adjusted for inflation after 2024. Under the IRA, this credit begins to phase out for projects the construction of which begins after the ""applicable year,"" which is defined as the later of 2032 or the calendar year in which Treasury determines that the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the United States are equal to or less than 25% of the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the United States for calendar year 2022.

The other principal credit enacted by the IRA benefiting wind and solar projects is the clean electricity investment credit in IRC Section 48E. This credit enacted under the IRA applies to facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024. This credit applies to qualified investments for any taxable year with respect to qualified facilities and energy storage technology. The base rate is 6%. This base rate is increased to 30% (the ""alternative rate"") for facilities with a maximum output of less than one megawatt of electricity (as measured in alternating current) and for facilities that meet certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements (or for which construction began more than 60 days before Treasury publishes guidance with respect to such prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements). If energy property is placed in service in an ""energy community,"" the provision increases the base rate by two percentage points and the alternative rate by 10 percentage points. An additional credit amount is available for property that meets certain domestic content requirements. This credit was to phase out for projects the construction of which begins after the later of the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after 2032 or the calendar year in which Treasury determines that the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the United States are equal to or less than 25% of the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the United States for calendar year 2022.

The OBBBA will terminate the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities for which construction has not begun by July 5, 2026 and that are placed in service after December 31, 2027. The credits are terminated earlier for facilities for which construction includes ""material assistance"" from a ""prohibited foreign entity"" (both defined terms in the Statute). Those projects do not qualify for credits if construction begins after December 31, 2025. No credit is allowed for taxable years after enactment if the taxpayer claiming the credit is a prohibited foreign entity. The OBBBA also removes the ""later of"" rule and instead begins the phase-out for projects the construction of which begins after the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after 2032 for qualified facilities other than wind or solar that generate electricity, such as hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal.

Developers of wind and solar projects may feel urgency to begin construction of contemplated projects before the July 5, 2026 (or December 31, 2025) deadline and to place such projects in service by December 31, 2027, in order to be eligible for the production or investment tax credits under the OBBBA.

However, on Monday, July 7, 2025, President Trump added uncertainty to such plans by issuing an Executive Order directing Treasury within 45 days following enactment of the OBBBA, to take all actions as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under IRC Sections 45Y and 48E for wind and solar facilities, including issuing new and revised guidance to ensure that policies concerning the ""beginning of construction"" are not circumvented. Two IRS Notices, 2013-29 and 2018-59, had previously provided rules for determining the beginning of construction for applicable tax credits. The OBBBA includes a provision requiring that rules similar to those in the Notices be used to determine when construction begins for purposes of the prohibited foreign entity restrictions. Notwithstanding that language in the Statute, project developers may now need to wait for the new guidance before beginning construction if the project economics are dependent on the availability of tax credits. Investors in transferable credits or tax equity that may be used to provide funding for projects may be unwilling to commit funding until there is more clarity.

As climate concerns mount and regulations tighten, companies producing everything from bowling green machinery to sophisticated turf management systems are reimagining their manufacturing processes.

Green Manufacturing Revolution

Sustainable manufacturing in grounds care extends far beyond simply creating eco-friendly products. It encompasses the entire production cycle, from sourcing raw materials to packaging and distribution. Leading manufacturers are investing heavily in renewable energy systems, with solar panels and wind turbines becoming common sights at production facilities. These initiatives not only reduce carbon footprints but often result in substantial long-term cost savings.

The industry’s commitment to sustainability can be seen at events like the GroundsFest landscaping show, where manufacturers discuss innovative sustainability measures alongside their latest equipment. Many exhibitors highlight their transition to water-based paint systems, elimination of harmful solvents, and implementation of closed-loop manufacturing processes that minimise waste.

Material Innovation and Circular Economy

Progressive manufacturers are revolutionising their approach to materials, prioritising recycled content and developing products designed for longevity. Cricket ground maintenance equipment now frequently incorporates recycled steel and aluminium components, whilst maintaining the durability standards that are essential for professional sports venues.

This shift towards circular economy principles means products are designed from the outset with end-of-life considerations in mind.

Some key sustainable material practices include:

Biodegradable lubricants and hydraulic fluids that reduce environmental impact during operation and maintenance

Recycled plastic components for non-structural elements, diverting waste from landfills whilst maintaining product integrity

Renewable material sourcing for components like handles and covers, often using sustainably harvested timber or bio-based plastics

Energy Efficiency and Clean Production

Modern manufacturing facilities are incorporating smart technologies to optimise energy consumption and reduce waste. Advanced monitoring systems track resource usage in real-time, enabling manufacturers to identify inefficiencies and implement corrective measures quickly. This approach is a central theme at lawn and landscape technology conferences, where industry leaders share best practices for sustainable production.

Innovation Through Collaboration

The industry’s sustainability journey benefits enormously from collaborative efforts between manufacturers, suppliers, and end-users. These partnerships promote innovation in areas such as:

Supply chain transparency ensuring responsible sourcing of materials and components

Shared research and development initiatives that pool resources to tackle common environmental challenges

Customer feedback integration helping manufacturers understand real-world sustainability needs and preferences

Future Outlook

The transition towards sustainable manufacturing practices represents more than an environmental imperative – it’s becoming a competitive advantage. Companies that embrace these changes early often find themselves better positioned to meet evolving customer expectations and regulatory requirements.

As the grounds care industry continues to professionalise, with venues demanding higher standards for both performance and environmental responsibility, sustainable manufacturing will likely become the norm rather than the exception.

This transformation requires ongoing investment and commitment, but the benefits extend well beyond regulatory compliance. Manufacturers adopting sustainable practices often experience improved efficiency, reduced operating costs, and enhanced brand reputation, creating a compelling business case for environmental responsibility in the grounds care sector.

It lost 31 percentage points of market share in U.S. power generation between 2005 and 2024, and natural gas picked up four-fifths of that.
The cheapest existing coal plants remain competitive, according to Lazard Inc.’s latest analysis of levelized costs.
But this won’t catalyze new ones, even when you consider the suddenly rising cost of new gas plants.
The whiplash of U.S. energy policy over the past decade demonstrates why a developer must think in terms of not the next three years but the next 30.","The same day President Donald Trump launched his AI Action Plan, his Energy Secretary Chris Wright pulled federal support for a power project with ties to renewable energy that could help that plan. Not coincidentally, Trump instructed Wright at his AI summit that he must say “clean, beautiful” before any mention of the word “coal” and that the U.S. must compete with China’s construction of new coal-fired plants.

Possibly the only thing more bizarre than Trump’s enforced catch-phrasing is his vision of 21st century robots running on a power technology that hasn’t been cutting-edge since the days of Thomas Edison. Coal has long been a political prop for Trump, but this has taken on greater significance in his second term, with a naked assault on both the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and zero-carbon technologies (nuclear power excepted). When coal isn’t being touted as beautiful or clean, it is pitched as reliable and cheap, and due for a comeback if freed from overbearing rules.

This is a fantasy, and a bleak one at that, not just for the climate but also that AI plan.

You don’t need a conspiracy theory to explain coal’s decline in the U.S. It lost 31 percentage points of market share in U.S. power generation between 2005 and 2024, and natural gas picked up four-fifths of that. Why? Gas got cheaper. Five times the cost of coal in 2005, on an energy-equivalent basis, that gap was all but erased by booming shale supply (which Trump also backs). Meanwhile, the cost of building new coal plants, already a multiple of that for gas, went up even as it went down for gas (and renewables). Coal’s decline was well established by 2015, when former President Barack Obama unveiled his Clean Power Plan — which was never implemented anyway.

The problem is straightforward: Coal-power is an old technology outmatched by newer ones. The average coal-plant running today began operating when Jimmy Carter was president. The youngest, Sandy Creek in Texas, came online in 2014. By 2020, its owners were reportedly in debt restructuring talks and the following year the plant tripped offline in Texas’ winter blackouts. Utilization, or the proportion of the year it actually runs, has slumped.

The cheapest existing coal plants remain competitive, according to Lazard Inc.’s latest analysis of levelized costs. Yet they are hardly a slam-dunk compared with gas or unsubsidized wind and solar. The latter are intermittent, of course, and securing firm power to back them up, such as contracting with a gas peaker-plant or battery, boosts their cost considerably. Even then, new coal is in a similar cost range — and that is only with the implicit subsidy of spewing unpriced carbon.

This shows why rising forecasts of power demand, stoking fears of dark datacenters or blackouts, offer a lifeline to some existing coal plants that would otherwise retire. But this won’t catalyze new ones, even when you consider the suddenly rising cost of new gas plants. Utility NextEra Energy Inc. recently cited a levelized cost for new gas-power of $90-$115 per megawatt-hour. That would put it closer to new coal, but there are reasons why there’s a backlog for turbines, not for boilers.

Gas plants are more efficient than coal, especially in ramping up and down to match shifting demand and output from renewables, and also emit about half as much carbon. The whiplash of U.S. energy policy over the past decade demonstrates why a developer must think in terms of not the next three years but the next 30. Similarly, AI hyperscalers are prioritizing sheer speed over net-zero now, but tethering their reputations to coal over the long term would be inadvisable.

This is why, for all of coal’s vaunted qualities, the Trump administration still tries to tilt the field so heavily toward it and away from renewable competitors. Wright has made extensive use of federal powers to keep coal plants running that might otherwise close or run minimally; roughly a fifth of all such emergency orders since 2000 have been issued this year.

Similarly, Wright’s decision to pull an agreed $4.9 billion federal loan-guarantee for the 800-mile Grain Belt Express transmission line reeks of politics, rather than the economic analysis his department claims. The project, bringing wind and solar power from the Great Plains to states further east, had secured approval from four states, partly due to expected cost savings, as well as court victories over opponents. However, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a big coal-power state across which part of the line would stretch, has made a crusade out of the project’s eminent domain disputes with several dozen landowners. Recasting this as stopping a “green scam” in a conversation with Trump and Wright seems to have tipped the balance; Wright pulled the guarantee less than two weeks later.

This sort of rug-pull makes a mockery of Trump’s “national energy emergency.” Developers like renewables because they are quick to build and, twinned with batteries or gas, offer a path to a cleaner, more resilient and diversified grid. Wright’s own department forecasts wind and solar to account for virtually all additions to generating capacity this year. Trump’s call to compete with China’s coal-plant construction is laughably anachronistic. Even there, coal’s share of output has fallen over the past 20 years while wind and solar have risen from virtually zero to 18%. Last year alone, China added more solar capacity than America’s entire installations to date. Beijing presumably isn’t doing that to destroy its own grid. Rather, its clean-tech effort is driven by the new ESG: Economics, security and geopolitics.

The Republican project to protect fossil fuels and choke off the fastest-growing source of new capacity amid rising demand, meanwhile, will ultimately constrain the U.S. grid, raising costs and curtailing our AI ambitions. And it still won’t reverse decades of economic trends burying coal. Yet Trump and his cohort appear beyond such reasoning, preferring the blunt instruments of bureaucracy. If you are invested in the belief that renewables’ success owes everything to a woke conspiracy, you may well convince yourself that coal can simply be willed back to life.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to increase the penetration of electric buses, cars and trucks, and to spur their sales, government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' (EoL) regulation isn't applicable to EVs. The power ministry will also expedite extending the CAFE norms (regulations designed to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions) to urban freight vehicles, trucks and buses. These were among the steps finalised at a recent high-level meeting chaired by Niti Aayog member Rajiv Gauba amid concerns over the slow progress of EV penetration in the country, which was barely 7.6% in 2024, as against the target of 30% by 2030. While EV penetration is higher for two- and three-wheelers and buses, it has been slow for four-wheelers, with e-trucks not having taken off so far. Sources said that responding to an observation from road transport secretary V Umashankar that most over 15-year-old buses are privately owned, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam suggested that if the 15-year EOL regulation is not applied to EVs, it may spur sales. Umashankar also held that a mandate for EV adoption works best at places where a certain level of penetration and ecosystem are in place. Sources said there was a consensus to move from incentives to mandates and disincentives for faster EV adoption and for strategies to have saturation in five cities for buses, para-transit and urban freight vehicles. A source said there was unanimous agreement on the need for fast expansion of charging infrastructure, deployment of fast chargers, development of new battery technologies to reduce import dependence and easier finance for e-buses and e-trucks. Days later, the finance ministry held talks with banks to address their reluctance to finance EVs and the issue of higher interest rates. At the meeting chaired by financial services secretary M Nagaraju, banks urged govt to standardise batteries, bring down vehicle costs and announce some incentive for purchase of new batteries, considering that batteries usually have to be replaced in 6-7 years and account for 40-50% of the cost of EVs.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin defended his decision to axe an Obama-era rule that allowed the agency to regulate vehicles, airplanes and coal plants in order to combat climate change, vowing he won’t regulate ""entire sectors of the economy"" out of existence.

The ""Endangerment Finding"" published by former President Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency found that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane and others threaten human life because they accelerate climate change. The EPA relied on the ""endangerment finding"" to install stringent regulations on a variety of industries, including auto, air travel and energy, that business leaders said threatened the viability of their companies.

Notably, the endangerment finding was part of the basis of the Biden administration’s so-called electric vehicle mandate which would have required over half of all cars sold to be EVs by 2032.

Zeldin announced that he was repealing the ""holy grail of the climate change religion"" during a speech at an Indianapolis auto dealership in July. He hailed the announcement as the ""largest deregulatory announcement in US history,"" and said he was ending over a decade of uncertainty for American automakers and consumers.

Zeldin told CNN Sunday that when the rule was passed, the administrators relied on optimistic and pessimistic predictions surrounding the future effects of climate change, and that the pessimistic predictions did not pan out. He said that his decision was relying on ""2025 facts rather than 2009 bad assumptions."" He also said the endangerment finding went beyond the EPA’s legal scope, by ""filling in gaps"" in the law and essentially legislating itself.

He said the agency couldn’t bend the law to meet its own goals, and that issues surrounding regulating ""mobile sources"" of pollution like cars would need to be handled by Congress. He accused the Obama-era bureaucrats of engaging in ""mental leaps"" in order to justify the endangerment finding.

This high-profile conclave aims for balanced regional growth by leveraging Thoothukudi’s key advantages, particularly its strategic port and vast green energy potential, to garner interest from global investors, industry leaders, policymakers, and sectoral experts.

In the electronics manufacturing sector, Tamil Nadu is signalling a major push to establish itself as a leading national and global hub. The state recently launched India’s first state-level electronics components manufacturing scheme, with a target of attracting ₹300 billion in investment and creating 60,000 new jobs over the next three years. With annual electronics exports already surpassing $14.65 billion and with the planned establishment of two large Electronics Manufacturing Clusters at Pillaipakkam and Manallur, the region is rapidly attracting major manufacturers and benefiting from a skilled local workforce. Recent investments, such as the new facility by Vietnamese EV maker VinFast and the expansion of local contract manufacturers, reinforce the state’s leadership in electronics hardware and advanced component production. This momentum is supported by robust government policies, including attractive incentives, strategic infrastructure development, and comprehensive skill training programs, all aimed at enhancing global supply chain integration.

Renewable energy is another pillar being highlighted at the summit. Thoothukudi and wider Tamil Nadu are poised to benefit from a surge of investments into green energy, with a focus on large-scale wind and solar power projects. The summit serves as a platform for new project launches and the signing of key agreements in the renewable sector, supporting both state and national sustainability goals. Tamil Nadu’s renewable energy production reached 33.17 billion units in 2023–24, and the state is actively pushing forward initiatives such as the National Green Hydrogen Mission and the creation of Green Energy Corridors to scale up renewables and introduce emerging clean technologies. The government has set ambitious targets, including a 24% reduction in emissions by 2030, a 50% reduction by 2050, and net-zero emissions by 2070, with the summit underscoring a clear roadmap toward climate resilience and sustainable industrialization.

Importantly, by hosting a significant event in Thoothukudi rather than the state capital, the government is driving economic development in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, thus promoting equitable job creation, MSME participation, and the emergence of regional industrial corridors. The summit also emphasizes the importance of collaboration with academia and industry to nurture and upskill local talent, ensuring that the local workforce is aligned with the future needs of high-tech manufacturing and renewable energy sectors.

In summary, the ‘TN Rising’ summit marks the beginning of a transformative phase for southern Tamil Nadu, steering the region towards inclusive, export-driven, and sustainable growth through leadership in electronics innovation and green energy.

Dan Meuser, R-Dallas, this week participated in a high-level roundtable discussion focused on energy, manufacturing and expanding opportunity in Pennsylvania’s rural communities.

The event was co-hosted by the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, Pennsylvania College of Technology and the Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce and brought together Members of Congress, federal officials, energy leaders and workforce experts to chart a path forward for regional growth.

Held at the Pennsylvania College of Technology’s Thompson Professional Development Center, the roundtable served as a platform to discuss how federal policy can better align with regional success models — especially in workforce development, energy infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing.

“This roundtable underscored the incredible opportunity we have to grow Pennsylvania’s energy economy, support small businesses, and invest in workforce development programs that deliver results,” Meuser said. “We heard directly from job creators, educators, and innovators who are driving progress in our region. Whether it’s strengthening technical education pipelines, modernizing permitting to meet 21st-century demands, or scaling homegrown energy solutions, today’s discussion was about action — focused, practical, and rooted in what’s working right here in Pennsylvania.”

Meuser said Pennsylvania has the resources, the talent and the entrepreneurial spirit to lead the next chapter of America’s energy and manufacturing renaissance.

“From the classroom to the job site to the boardroom, our Commonwealth is positioned to lead,” Meuser said.

The conversation focused on several priorities that will be essential to sustaining Pennsylvania’s competitive edge, including expanding federal support for career and technical education through corporate tax credit models inspired by Pennsylvania’s EITC program; modernizing infrastructure and permitting processes to attract data centers and meet surging energy demands driven by AI and manufacturing reshoring; unlocking critical mineral recovery from produced water through targeted tax incentives and streamlined federal regulation; and strengthening coordination between federal, state and local partners to scale successful workforce pipelines and rural economic development strategies.

Meuser banking roundtable at Yuengling Brewery

Meuser welcomed Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman to Pennsylvania’s 9th Congressional District for a roundtable discussion with community and regional banking leaders.

Held at the historic Yuengling Brewery in Pottsville, the roundtable focused on promoting a regulatory environment that supports responsible lending, protects consumers, and encourages financial innovation without imposing unnecessary burdens on banks that serve Main Street.

“Pennsylvania’s banking sector reflects the strength and diversity of our national financial system—from rural community banks to regional institutions,” Meuser said. “Vice Chair Bowman brings valuable experience as both a former community banker and state regulator, and her visit today reinforces our shared commitment to getting regulation right. We need supervision that encourages innovation, supports local economies, and protects consumers—without driving small banks out of the market. That starts with streamlining bank applications, encouraging smart capital rules, and tailoring risk based on bank size and business activities. Not a one-size-fits-all approach. As well, consumer fraud is a top issue facing banks and their customers across the country. Congress will continue to work in coordination with the Administration to find real solutions to consumer fraud.”

The event concluded with a tour of Yuengling’s facility — America’s oldest operating brewery — and lunch with attendees.

Deluzio pushes utilities for more transparency

U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pittsburgh, this week sent a letter to the Bureau of Audits — a division of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission — requesting information about an independent audit of the agency.

The letter is the latest in Deluzio’s ongoing response to April’s widespread power outages and is part of his work to get utility companies and state and local governments to do better by people in the future. It comes amid rising energy costs that continue to hammer Pennsylvanians’ wallets and frustration about low power reliability around severe storms.

“Pennsylvanians should not be forced to accept week-long blackouts as normal when storms roll through,” Deluzio said. “I see it as my role as a member of House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to always fight for the strongest, best infrastructure possible for the people of Pennsylvania’s 17th Congressional District. A fuller understanding of the PUC’s audits and work will help as I continue to push utilities and governments to improve storm readiness and response.”

Deluzio’s letter to the Bureau of Audits is his latest move in his follow-up to this spring’s extensive power outages. He sent the letter in response to a constituent’s survey response.

Bresnahan leads legislation to put local food on local tables

U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, Jr., R-Dallas Township, this week led a bipartisan group of his colleagues in introducing the Local Farmers Feeding our Communities Act to boost the purchasing and distribution of local food.

The bill will help build stronger connections between local producers, and community food programs, expanding markets and improving access to healthy food for those in need.

“Far too often the discussion around alleviating hunger leaves out those who grow, raise, and produce food — our local farmers,” Bresnahan said. “Reducing the barriers between our communities and the farmers who produce our food is a commonsense approach to ensure everyone in Northeast Pennsylvania has access to the food they need. This bill recognizes the hard work that is needed to supply fresh and nutritious food like fruit, veggies, milk, and cheese, while also creating a clear path to putting this food on the plates of people who need it. This investment in our local farmers is an investment in stronger local food security and healthier communities.”

The Local Farmers Feeding our Communities Act will allow states, through USDA, to establish cooperative agreements connecting local farmers and producers with local food distribution organizations.

Through these agreements, funds will be used to purchase local, fresh, and minimally processed foods like seafood, meat, milk, cheese, eggs, fruit and poultry. The bill also sets aside a portion of these funds to purchase food specifically from small, mid-size, beginning and veteran farmers.

Senior Expo for 117th District residents set

Rep. Jamie Walsh, R-Ross Township, invites residents of the 117th District to a free Senior Expo from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 12, at Misericordia University’s Insalaco Hall, 301 Lake St., Dallas.

The expo will feature more than 30 vendors offering information and services for seniors. Several breakout sessions will be held on topics like estate planning, Area Agency on Aging programs, Silver Sneakers chair yoga, low-income taxpayer assistance information, cyber security and fraud bingo.

The Pennsylvania Treasury Department will also be in attendance to help search for unclaimed property.

Piaggio Vehicles anticipates a 50% penetration of L5 electric three-wheelers in India by mid-2028, driven by a structural market shift despite reduced government incentives. The company emphasizes the need for clarity on incentive continuation as it launches new electric passenger models. Factors like improved infrastructure and lower costs are fueling EV adoption, particularly in the passenger segment.

Small commercial vehicle maker Piaggio Vehicles is expecting L5 electric three-wheeler segment penetration in the domestic market reaching 50 per cent at the most by mid-2028, owing to a structural shift and other factors, a top company official has said.

The company, which last month rolled out two new electric passenger three-wheelers -- the all-new Ape E-City Ultra and upgraded Ape FX Maxx- also said there is a need for the government to provide clarity on the issue of continuation of the incentives.

Piaggio Commercial Vehicles Pvt Ltd (PVPL) is the Indian subsidiary of Italian auto major Piaggio Group.

""There is a spike in the penetration of L5 category electric three wheelers in the country in the last one-and-a-half years. And this is when the government incentives under the FAME program have reduced to one-fourth in the same period,"" Diego Graffy, Chairman and Managing Director of PVPL, told PTI in an interaction.

He said that if the level of penetration continues at this pace, ""we expect this to reach 50 per cent by the end of 2027 or the beginning of mid-2028 even if the incentives are withdrawn, as there is a structural shift taking place in the market.""

Live Events

There are two categories-- L5 and L3-- in the electric three-wheeler segment. L5 Category refers to three-wheeler auto-rickshaws for carrying passengers or cargo while e-carts fall in L3 category.

Both the Central Government and state governments are promoting the faster adoption of EVs through various fiscal incentives to the EV buyers.

The second phase of the government's flagship scheme, Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME), launched in 2019 with an initial outlay of Rs 10,000 crore, later increased to Rs 11,500 crore, ended in March last year.

Subsequently, a new PM E-Drive Scheme with an outlay of Rs 10,900 crore for two years to boost EV sales, replacing FAME programme was announced in September 2024.

""The Government reducing the subsidy to one-fourth in the last one-and-a-half years could have definitely been a big disruption (in terms of demand) but instead of depressing the market, it has only kept on increasing. It means that the change or the shift that is happening now is structural and not anymore incidental. And this shift is happening for multiple reasons,"" Graffy said.

Apart from the structural shift, the factors for the higher penetration include improved charging infra, lower cost of acquisition and ease of financing and servicing.

""These challenges have largely been addressed in this period leading to increased penetration, particularly of the passenger segment,"" he said.

According to industry statistics, L5 passenger electric three-wheeler penetration accounted for 22.8 per cent in the total EV sales in FY 25 while the goods e-three-wheeler penetartion stood at 21.5 per cent in the same period.

Also, in the April-June quarter of this fiscal, as much as 32.4 per cent of the total ev penetration was recorded in the passenger e-three wheeler segment and 22.8 per cent in the cargo e-three-wheeler segment.

Graffy said that the adoption rate across Southern and Western parts of the country however, is still much lower, adding that, it is expected to increase in the next couple of years and when it happens, the overall penetration rate would go much higher than 50 per cent.""

He said that the e-commerce transition was leading to the demand for cargo e-three-wheelers, which is on the wane now while the passenger segment is picking up very rapidly due to the reason cited earlier.

Due to a structural transition that we see, now the passenger segment will have a much higher rate of adoption in the next few months, he stated.

He said that Piaggio Vehicles is ""maintaining"" more or less the pace at which the industry is growing, adding that the company keeps on renewing its product portfolio every two years since 2019 when it first introduced its e-three-wheeler in the country.

""We are not doing (renewing products) so frequently unlike many other players are doing in the space. We prefer to take our time. So, we are reviving our products every two years trying to introduce new features with innovation and technology,"" he said.

""We believe EVs are an opportunity to reshape urban transport and improve livelihoods. New ApA© E-City Ultra and ApA© E-City FX Maxx are being built with these realities in mind. They deliver what the Indian customer needs: best in class range, low battery degradation, strong performance, and minimal operating costs,"" Graffy said on the launch of the two models, which are priced at Rs 3.80-lakh and Rs 3.30 lakh, respectively.

""These vehicles are enablers of economic mobility, future-ready solutions that can scale across cities and small towns alike. Our focus is not only on innovation but also on contributing to a more inclusive and sustainable future,"" he said.

On the incentives, he said,"" uncertainty on (the continuation) of the incentives is definitely very disturbing and some clarity going forward is required."" ""Even if the government wants the incentives to discontinue from a particular date, declare it clearly so that every OEM can plan the strategy accordingly,"" Graffy said.

This is set to be a large manufacturing set up with potential to employ over 7,000 people, sources in the know said.

Interestingly, the facility, once operational, will cater to both domestic and export market and is also set to dabble in defence manufacturing. “The company is also exploring ways to leverage the facility as an advanced integrated artillery ammunition and missile manufacturing factory,” an electronics industry insider said.

With the likes of Tata Power and Vikram Solar present in South Tamil Nadu, the region is also attracting renewable energy projects. This has also attracted Delhi-based Mobius Energy to set up a new ₹1,000 crore solar cell and module manufacturing facility in the district of Theni, with an MoU likely to be signed for it on Monday.

Beyond Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli, South Tamil Nadu is also seeing the mushrooming of more investment clusters. Dindigul and Theni’s agriculture strengths offer potential for companies in the value-added food exports space, and the temple town of Madurai too is fast emerging as an IT hardware and software hub.

Following Thoothukudi, the state also plans to conduct editions of the Regional Investment Conclaves in western, central, and northern Tamil Nadu.

“That could be a weapon that can help us beat China.” Solid-state batteries are more powerful, durable, faster to charge and safer than the lithium-ion cells currently dominating the EV sector.","[SEOUL] SK Innovation’s battery unit plans to accelerate development of cutting-edge technologies in partnership with US and European carmakers, its R&D chief said, aiming to win back market share from peers in China and South Korea.

SK On is focused on honing its edge in thermal management technology, such as immersion cooling designed to boost the efficiency of batteries for AI data centres, energy storage systems and electric vehicles (EVs), Park Kisoo, head of the company’s research and development arm, said. The battery specialist already is in talks with Ford Motor and Hyundai Motor to collaborate on the cutting-edge tech, he said.

A representative for Ford declined to comment. Hyundai did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The push comes amid a broad reorganisation of the SK group, a leading South Korean conglomerate, which plans to merge money-losing SK On with more profitable sister company SK Enmove in a bid to stabilise its balance sheet. The move follows another in-group transaction by SK On’s parent company a year ago with a similar goal of shoring up finances as the battery unit pursues aggressive expansion overseas.

The South Korean company operates two standalone battery plants in Georgia, which supply Ford and Volkswagen, and is planning another facility in the state with Hyundai. SK On and Ford received a US$9.63 billion loan from the US government late last year to build two battery factories in Kentucky and another in neighbouring Tennessee. They have paused plans for a battery plant in Canada. SK On also has battery production facilities in China, Europe and at home in South Korea.

Park said that his R&D centre will spur internal efforts to diversify suppliers and strengthen supply chains to bolster the company’s US production and ramp up its energy storage business there.

EV demand is set to decline further with the looming end of US tax credits in September, but the R&D chief sees global sales rebounding as early as late 2027, if automakers can close the price gap between EVs and petrol-powered vehicles.

“For many EV drivers, there’s no going back, and the penetration rate is only set to grow in China and elsewhere,” Park said.

SK On is also targeting the development of solid-state batteries by the end of 2027 and mass production of them from 2029, he said. Semi solid-state batteries, a hybrid version of current and next-generation tech, could be commercialised even sooner.

Solid-state batteries are more powerful, durable, faster to charge and safer than the lithium-ion cells currently dominating the EV sector. That’s set off a global race to bring those batteries to market among top suppliers, including China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited and BYD, as well as South Korea’s LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI.

American tech giants are increasingly turning to nuclear power to meet the growing demand for electricity driven by the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). Companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft are building data centers near nuclear power plants, such as the Susquehanna plant in Pennsylvania, to power their AI operations. This strategic move underscores the critical need for reliable and sustainable energy sources to support the development and deployment of AI technologies.

The demand for AI has surged in recent years, with tech companies requiring immense amounts of power to run their data centers. Traditional power sources, including renewables and natural gas, are struggling to meet this growing demand. In response, tech firms are exploring nuclear power as a viable alternative. Nuclear energy offers several advantages, including the ability to provide round-the-clock electricity regardless of weather conditions and its low carbon footprint.

According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, the nation's dwindling fleet of nuclear plants is being seized upon by tech firms as a foundation for their AI-infused future. Tech companies are striking deals with nuclear plant operators to secure long-term power contracts. For instance, Microsoft has agreed to restart a reactor next to the one at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant that was shuttered in 1979, while Amazon has locked up power from a 42-year-old nuclear plant down the Susquehanna River [2].

The tech industry's interest in nuclear power is not without controversy. Critics argue that these deals could lead to electricity rate hikes or shortages for consumers, as the nation faces soaring demand for power. Moreover, the reliance on aging nuclear plants could extend the life of polluting coal and gas plants, potentially undermining climate goals.

Despite these concerns, nuclear industry officials maintain that the tech industry's interest in nuclear power is a springboard for the industry's resurgence. They argue that building more plants is the solution to meet the growing demand for power. However, even nuclear executives acknowledge that pulling zero-emission nuclear energy away from other customers will have an impact on the climate and can be out of sync with the ambitious commitments tech firms have made to reduce their carbon footprint.

In conclusion, the shift towards nuclear power by tech firms highlights the urgent need for sustainable and reliable energy sources to support the growth of AI. While this move presents both opportunities and challenges, it is clear that the energy landscape is evolving to meet the demands of the digital age.

It added, “The goal should be to scale local manufacturing without compromising access to affordable solar energy.
“There is an urgent need for single-window applications, clearer eligibility criteria, and renewable energy desks in key MDAs,” PwC stated.","A new report by global consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, has cautioned the Federal Government against implementing an immediate restriction on solar panel imports, warning that such a move could disrupt Nigeria’s fragile energy access gains and dampen investor confidence in the renewable energy sector.

The report, titled “Rethinking Nigeria’s Proposed Solar Panel Import Policy”, and obtained by our correspondent on Friday, noted that while the push for local manufacturing and industrialisation is commendable, a measured and phased approach is necessary to avoid unintended consequences.

These recommendations came in response to the government’s announcement of a ban on solar panel importation, citing the influx of substandard products. The Federal Government, through the Ministry of Science and Technology, had proposed a policy to restrict solar panel imports in a bid to localise production, conserve forex, and create jobs.

But PwC said the plan, if not properly sequenced, risks stalling Nigeria’s clean energy momentum. In Q4 2024, Nigeria imported solar panels valued at approximately N237.3bn, but by Q1 2025, imports had dropped by about 89 per cent to N125.29bn.

“In 2023 alone, Nigeria imported over four million solar panels, valued at more than $200m. This is not just a reflection of our energy crisis, but also of the absence of adequate local manufacturing capacity,” the report said.

Rather than an outright restriction, PwC advised the government to implement a three- to five-year phased reduction in imports, giving room for local manufacturers to ramp up production capacity, meet demand, and establish quality control systems.

“The proposed import restriction policy reflects Nigeria’s ambition for energy security and industrial growth. A measured and strategic approach is needed to avoid unintended disruptions.

“A tiered strategy that includes import quotas, progressive tariffs, or blended procurement models would ensure supply continuity while attracting long-term investments under a stable regulatory framework,” the report recommended.

It added, “The goal should be to scale local manufacturing without compromising access to affordable solar energy. Rather than an instant restriction, Nigeria should adopt a three to five-year phased reduction in solar panel imports.”

The firm acknowledged that the Nigerian government already offers incentives such as the Pioneer Status Incentive, import duty waivers, VAT exemptions, and green finance instruments. However, these remain grossly underutilised due to bureaucratic red tape, fragmented application processes, and limited awareness.

“There is an urgent need for single-window applications, clearer eligibility criteria, and renewable energy desks in key MDAs,” PwC stated. It also called for dedicated renewable energy industrial zones, equipped with shared infrastructure, streamlined permitting processes, and proximity to ports and transport corridors to reduce logistics costs.

The report stressed that solar manufacturing isn’t just about equipment, but also about people. It urged the government to partner with universities, polytechnics, and vocational centres to create a national renewable energy skills framework.

“Manufacturing solar panels requires trained technicians, engineers, and quality assurance professionals. Without human capital development, local industry will struggle to compete,” PwC warned.

It also advocated for stronger enforcement of product standards, urging agencies such as the Standards Organisation of Nigeria and Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency to adopt and enforce International Electrotechnical Commission-aligned standards.

On finance, PwC noted that access to capital remains a major constraint for both manufacturers and consumers. It is recommended that the Bank of Industry and Central Bank of Nigeria provide long-term green financing and support Pay-As-You-Go models to deepen solar access for off-grid households.

PwC urged the government to engage the private sector, development partners like the World Bank and AfDB, and civil society to co-develop a coherent renewable energy roadmap.

“Establishing stakeholder feedback loops and publishing annual progress reports can drive transparency, track jobs created, cost reductions, and support mid-course corrections,” it said.

While acknowledging the government’s intent to spur industrialisation, PwC concluded that “a hasty restriction could stall momentum in Nigeria’s clean energy transition, reduce affordability, and shake investor confidence.”

“Nigeria must recalibrate its solar panel import policy with strategic sequencing, stakeholder alignment, and realism about the current state of local capacity,” the report stated.

It added, “Getting it right can help Nigeria meet its climate goals, boost local industry, and drive long-term economic growth. Getting it wrong could leave millions in the dark.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/02004258/PwC-e1706830978530.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 20:57:59.781950

Mahindra & Mahindra is proactively managing potential rare earth magnet supply disruptions caused by China's export restrictions. The company is securing alternative sources for the next nine months and investing in engineering solutions for long-term supply chain resilience. While Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai India haven't faced production impacts, M&M is preparing for future growth amid industry-wide concerns.

Mahindra & Mahindra plans to manage rare earth magnet supplies through alternative sourcing channels for the next nine months and will pursue 'engineering efforts' to address the raw material shortage situation amid growing product portfolio, according to a senior company executive.

The imposition of export restrictions by China on key rare earth magnets has resulted in supply chain bottlenecks, impacting the user industries, including the auto and electronics sectors.

The magnets are essential components across sectors like automobiles, household appliances, and renewable energy.

""Basis, all the actions we have taken, FY26 is more or less managed. We have to now work on some medium and long term actions,"" Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) Group Chief Financial Officer Amarjyoti Barua told PTI in an interaction.

The company has taken steps to build inventory through alternative sources to take care of the problem, he stated.

""It has panned out well for us so far and we do not foresee any major risk for the next nine months,"" Barua said.

""But considering the growth plans we have, we have to think about a much bigger play than what the tactical plays we have done, and that is going to require a lot more engineering effort,"" he added.

The company's engineers are working on various solutions to work out a solution, Barua said.

Last week, Maruti Suzuki stated that its engineers are working to mitigate the rare earth magnet shortage issue, noting that there has been no impact on its production so far.

Hyundai Motor India has also stated that it is not facing any production issues due to the shortage of rare earth magnets.

In June, rating agency ICRA had stated that inventories of rare-earth magnets used in critical automotive components, particularly electric vehicle (EV) traction motors and power steering systems, could run dry by mid-July this year. Crisil, another rating agency, had also flagged it as a significant risk to automotive supply chains.

The magnets in question, neodymium-iron-boron, are known for their strength and efficiency, used for high-performance automotive applications such as traction motors in electric vehicles and power steering in both electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles.

The company proposed a BESS project to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees and manages the electrical grid to serve most of the southern US state, said Issara Niropas, chief executive of Banpu Power.

He did not reveal the development cost, saying only that the project may be partially funded by a subsidy programme aimed at supporting BESS businesses.

""The global market for BESS is experiencing rapid growth, driven by increasing adoption of renewables and the need for grid stability and energy security,"" said Mr Issara.

The market growth is attributed to declining battery costs, technological advancements and supportive government policies, he said.

BESS plays an important role in storing electricity generated by the sun and wind, which are intermittent sources of energy generation dependent on weather conditions and seasons.

BESS can be developed via a battery farm to ensure a stable supply of clean energy.

Electricity demand in the US is rising, driven by the development of data centres and greater use of artificial intelligence technology.

BESS represents a new area of business for Banpu in the US after it embarked on on-shore gas production and distribution, as well as power generation businesses in the country.

Banpu Next, the energy technology arm of Banpu, said earlier it plans to expand the BESS business into Asia-Pacific nations.

Through its subsidiary Banpu Japan, Banpu Next operates a 58-megawatt-hour BESS farm in the city of Tono. The facility is designed to supply electricity to 5,800 houses.

Banpu owns 40 power plants, either in operation or under construction, both in and outside the US.

These plants have a combined electricity generation capacity of 3.6 gigawatts, based on the company's shareholding in energy firms developing these facilities.

Withdrawing the finding would give the Trump administration license to eliminate those regulations.
Although Texas remains the nation’s top producer of crude oil, it’s also become the top producer of solar power—and a hub for solar-equipment manufacturing, too.
And that’s to say nothing of the human impacts that first prompted the endangerment finding.
Regulatory changes like the proposed rescinding of the endangerment finding might not survive legal challenges.","IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND how mindlessly destructive Donald Trump’s latest move on climate could be, just look at the response from the groups that you would expect to be cheering it most loudly.

The move came on Tuesday, when the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was preparing to smash the legal foundation for government limits on greenhouse gases. The plan is for EPA to revoke its “endangerment finding” that formally recognizes global warming as a threat to public health.

That finding—issued in 2009 under the Obama administration—gave EPA authority to regulate emissions from cars, power plants, factories, and other sources of pollution. Withdrawing the finding would give the Trump administration license to eliminate those regulations.

And while the process of revoking the endangerment finding will take at least a few months—like any other new rule, it first has to go through a period of public comment—the administration isn’t wasting any time. On the very same day it announced its intentions on the endangerment rule, the EPA also said it intends to get rid of the motor-vehicle emissions limits.

Speaking at an Indianapolis truck dealership, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin described the agency’s plans for the endangerment finding as “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.” That might not be an exaggeration. The New York Times, which broke the news of the announcement several days before, called it a “game-changing climate rollback.”

Get 30 day free trial

On first blush, it was also the ultimate wish fulfillment for an industry coalition that in 2009 had screamed about the finding and subsequently—and unsuccessfully—tried to stop it in court. Back then, trade organizations like the Edison Electric Institute (which represents power companies) and the National Association of Manufacturers were making many of the same arguments Trump officials made last week: that the EPA had overstepped its authority and relied on bad science, and that the resulting regulations would unleash all kinds of economic damage.

The finding could lead to “a top-down command-and-control regime that will choke off growth by adding new mandates to virtually every major construction and renovation project,” the then-head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned at the time.

But if you checked out the websites and social media feeds of those organizations last week, all you saw was the digital equivalent of crickets. Groups weren’t putting out public statements or dispatching officials to hail the move. They also weren’t answering reporter queries, at least based on those I sent to the Edison Institute and the Manufacturers, as well as the auto-industry lobby.

In fact, the only group that responded to me was the chamber, which provided a statement from Marty Durbin, who runs its Global Energy Institute. “We appreciate the Administration’s focus on economic growth and on providing the reliable, affordable energy needed to support our growth and competitiveness,” Durbin said. “While we did not call for this proposal, we are reviewing it and will consult with members so we can provide constructive feedback to the agency.”

That’s a conspicuously milquetoast reaction considering that the chamber knows as well as anybody in Washington how much Trump rewards public praise. But the chamber’s statement was actually pretty typical for how industry groups have greeted Trump’s climate agenda over the past few months.

That agenda has included everything from eliminating penalties for auto manufacturers whose cars don’t meet efficiency standards to gutting the rules on power-plant emissions. Sometimes the administration has simply acted on its own—by, for example, withdrawing permission for the development of offshore wind farms and canceling a $4.9 billion loan to build a critical cross-state transmission line. Other times it has worked with Congress, as it did most famously and consequentially on legislation shutting off hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies that were supporting the development of wind and solar power, and electric vehicles.

In each of these cases, the industry reaction has been just as ambivalent as it was to last week’s announcement on the endangerment finding, with a mix of muted praise and begrudging acceptance. There’s a reason for that. The organizations and people who work on these issues every day understand that the world has changed dramatically since 2009—in ways Trump and his hard-core supporters apparently cannot grasp, or maybe just don’t want to acknowledge.

THE 2009 ENDANGERMENT FINDING was a watershed moment in the campaign to slow global warming, which nearly the entire scientific community had long since concluded was the result of human activity. But slowing climate change meant reducing the production of greenhouse gases from cars, factories, and other sources. And, back then, there was no way to do that without highly expensive, politically toxic tradeoffs.

The most obvious and straightforward approach, putting some kind of financial penalty on carbon (a “carbon tax”), threatened to increase costs for consumers by raising electricity bills or jacking up the prices of cars. Penalizing carbon also threatened jobs in the fossil-fuel industry, which is a big reason why Obama’s proposal to create a scheme of tradeable emission permits (his “cap and trade” proposal) couldn’t get through the Senate.

It was in the wake of that legislative failure that Obama resorted to executive action, which was possible because the EPA already had well-established, widely supported authority to regulate harmful pollutants under the 1970 Clean Air Act. The law didn’t mention greenhouse gases specifically, but the EPA’s own scientists had spent years accumulating evidence of all the ways greenhouse gases were warming the planet, and then all the ways changing weather patterns and rising seas would cause human harm.

The George W. Bush administration had balked at letting the scientists issue that finding. That prompted a lawsuit and, eventually, a 2007 Supreme Court ruling (Massachusetts v. EPA) in which a 5–4 majority held that the EPA not only had the right to regulate greenhouse gases but an obligation to do so if it determined they threatened health. That set the stage for action by Obama’s EPA, which issued the finding and then its series of emissions regulations—which, in turn, the Biden administration made even more stringent.

But the Biden administration was able to do more than merely issue regulations. Working with a narrow Democratic majority in Congress, it was able to invest large sums of federal money in the development of cleaner energy. The primary vehicle for this was the Inflation Reduction Act, the 2022 law that subsidized everything from the construction of solar arrays to purchase of electric vehicles.

The result has been hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of carrots for businesses and consumers, to go with the sticks of regulation. And it has come at the same time that technological advances have made reducing carbon emissions a lot easier—and a lot cheaper too.

A prominent example: The price of electric vehicles has fallen, thanks to the development of more efficient batteries, which are their costliest component. And their ranges have increased—which, combined with advantages like whisper-quiet operation and lower lifetime maintenance costs, and the greater availability of charging stations in parts of the country, are increasingly making these vehicles more attractive to consumers.

The transformation of the energy sector has been even more dramatic. It used to be that renewables reliably cost more than fossil fuels. No more. Solar and wind today frequently cost less, depending on the circumstances. And at this particular moment they are also a lot easier to scale up, thanks to a worldwide shortage of the turbines it takes to generate electricity from petroleum.

“The fundamentals have shifted,” Sonia Aggarwal, CEO of Energy Innovation, a climate and energy think tank, told me. “Renewables are the cheapest, fastest way to get power online right now.”

That is especially important because of the surging demand for power from data centers, especially those dedicated to artificial intelligence. That is why the tech sector has been defending government support for renewables—as it did successfully at the state level earlier this year, when their objections helped defeat a proposal to slow the deployment of solar power in Texas.

The tech sector prevailed by winning over a significant chunk of Republican legislators, not because they’re tree huggers but because they like jobs. Although Texas remains the nation’s top producer of crude oil, it’s also become the top producer of solar power—and a hub for solar-equipment manufacturing, too.

THAT SAGA—WEAVING TOGETHER regulations and incentives so that the business community would buy in to the overall plan—was very much how the Biden administration and its supporters in Congress hoped the politics of their clean-energy push would play out at the national level. And in some ways, it has.

Clean-energy subsidies have disproportionately benefited Republican-leaning parts of the country—by underwriting wind farms across the blustery Great Plains and solar arrays across the sun-soaked Southwest, along with the “battery belt” of EV factories stretching from Kentucky to Georgia. When Trump and GOP leaders made clear they were serious about ending that federal support, a number of Republican lawmakers from those districts and states pushed back.

But Trump and his allies proceeded anyway, making only modest concessions. And now the rollbacks are beginning. The EV credits disappear in September. Support for wind and solar effectively ends next year. And that’s on top of the executive actions, which include not just the big, very public rescinding of regulations but also a much quieter set of cuts to funding for research into clean energy.

Investment in factory construction has already plummeted, as Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer documented last week, while clean-energy companies have started canceling projects and laying off workers.

For those who support the Trump agenda, this shift away from clean energy is proof that their original objections to Biden- and Obama-era policies were correct—that markets, always wiser than regulators, will steer America to a future with more coal and less solar, more gas-powered cars and fewer EVs.

And if that means less progress at reducing greenhouse gases, well, they can live with that too. Many simply don’t see climate change as a threat, if they acknowledge it all, and say efforts to slow it are part of a vast, freedom-crushing campaign by leftist elites. “Another great step in unwinding the Democrats’ radical climate agenda” is how Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) described last week’s EPA announcement.

But that’s not how the rest of the world (or, for that matter, many younger Republicans) see it. And it’s probably not where global markets are headed.

At this point, for instance, it’s hard to find an auto industry expert who thinks combustion engines are the future. “The industry is completely committed to electrification,” as Daniel Sperling, founding director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, told me in a phone interview. “It’s really just a question of pacing and timing.”

With the Biden-era policies in place, U.S. companies were just starting to catch up to Chinese manufacturers, which have a big head start thanks to longstanding support from their government. Now those U.S. companies are in danger of falling farther behind, setting up a scenario where they hold on to an isolated, shrinking U.S. market for gas-powered cars while ceding worldwide EV sales to foreign competitors.

“There’s a learning curve—to the extent that you start delaying and you lower the launch volumes in like year two and year three, you’re not getting the experience that is going to help inform your next generation of vehicles,” Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, former chief economist at the Ford Motor Company now at the think tank Third Way, told me.

Falling behind on EVs has national security implications, insofar as it could leave American vehicle fleets more dependent on foreign oil. It’s the same story with power generation, too.

Yanking the support for wind and solar—while, simultaneously, dealing out new subsidies for fossil fuels—could leave the civilian power grid more dependent on either the foreign countries that produce oil or the ones that manufacture renewable energy machinery.

And in case you’re wondering, Chinese firms are also on their way to dominating that manufacturing sector.

“We are sacrificing so much opportunity that we had, ready and there for the taking,” Julia McNamara, associate policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told me. “We are at risk of losing hundreds of thousands of jobs, hundreds of billions of dollars in manufacturing investments and in clean energy projects, and ceding innovation on a global scale.”

HOW THIS ALL PLAYS OUT politically is hard to say. While some effects of Trump’s agenda will take years or even decades to materialize, others will not. Among the more immediate impacts could be rising electricity costs, because the gap between surging demand and increasing supply is likely to grow so quickly.

And that’s to say nothing of the human impacts that first prompted the endangerment finding. That includes extreme weather events, which (sadly and often tragically) come with regularity nowadays. Linking any one calamity to a warming planet is difficult. Linking the broad increase in frequency and intensity of deadly storms and other weather shifts isn’t.

The somewhat relatively good news—as climate experts Jesse Jenkins and Jane Flegal discussed on a recent episode of Ezra Klein’s podcast—is that the clean-energy transition is far enough along that it won’t stop altogether, despite Trump’s best efforts. And that assumes the entirety of Trump’s agenda comes to fruition, which it may not.

Regulatory changes like the proposed rescinding of the endangerment finding might not survive legal challenges. The cuts to wind and solar and EVs could be reversed or delayed, if Congress were so inclined to demand it of the president—although the chances of this Congress making those demands seem close to nil given how opposition to climate change has become yet another badge of right-wing political identity.

The best hope for change probably lies in a change of leadership, in Congress and eventually the White House. Neither will happen without political pressure, which is why the industry groups silent about Trump’s agenda might want to go one step further and speak out forcefully against it.

They have plenty of incentive. After all, it’s their money at stake.

And come to think of it, it’s their planet too.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VTB8!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc74ed0ab-a35f-417c-8754-b7af248205ca_2100x1500.jpeg",N,,2025-08-03 20:00:51.514233

As California navigates the challenges of managing retired EV batteries, the rest of the nation observes closely.","The growing surplus of retired electric vehicle (EV) batteries is becoming an urgent issue for California. As the state increases its adoption of renewable energy, it faces a critical decision: how to manage the influx of spent EV batteries. A recent study by a trans-Atlantic research team highlights a potential solution. Reusing these batteries as grid-connected storage before recycling could significantly reduce carbon emissions. This approach, however, demands a robust infrastructure and strategic planning to maximize environmental benefits. The study’s findings not only hold implications for California but also serve as a cautionary tale for energy policies across the United States.

Reuse Delivers the Bigger Climate Dividend

California’s plan to manage retired EV batteries could result in substantial carbon savings. The study reveals that if every retired battery is recycled immediately, it could cover 61% of the state’s cumulative EV battery demand by 2050. This would prevent approximately 48 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. However, adopting a “second-use first” strategy could amplify these benefits.

By repurposing batteries for energy storage, California could avoid up to 56 million tons of carbon emissions. This approach leverages the existing functionality of aged batteries, avoiding the need to manufacture new lithium-ion units. Manufacturing from primary raw materials is carbon-intensive, making the reuse of existing packs a more sustainable option. Extending the life of these batteries defers the environmental impact of new manufacturing, maximizing carbon savings.

Oversupply Looms, Making Early Recycling Infrastructure Critical

Despite the environmental benefits of reuse, researchers warn of an impending oversupply of retired EV batteries. By mid-century, the quantity of spent batteries will exceed the state’s stationary storage needs. Even if all second-life packs are used, the demand will not match the supply. This scenario highlights the necessity of a well-developed recycling infrastructure.

Building large-scale recycling facilities is essential to handle the surplus efficiently. Delaying investment in these facilities could lead to bottlenecks, impeding the recovery of valuable materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt. These materials are crucial for the production of next-generation EVs. Establishing comprehensive collection networks and efficient recycling processes will ensure a steady supply of these resources, supporting the growth of the EV industry.

Three Scenarios Illuminate Trade-Offs

The research team explored three scenarios to evaluate the potential outcomes. The baseline scenario represents the current state, where only 2.5% of retired batteries are reused. The recycling scenario focuses on 100% material recovery, while the second-use scenario prioritizes reuse until storage needs are satisfied annually.

Each scenario emphasizes the importance of recycling to close the loop on raw materials. However, the second-use strategy offers the most significant carbon savings while still contributing to future recycling streams. This approach allows batteries to provide additional service years, maximizing their utility before recycling.

Implications for U.S. Energy Policy

Although the study centers on California, its implications resonate nationwide. As federal incentives drive EV adoption and renewable energy growth, states with ambitious clean-energy goals can benefit from these findings. Pairing solar and wind farms with repurposed EV batteries can enhance climate gains.

Holistic, regional planning is crucial to realizing the full potential of a circular battery economy. By coordinating production, reuse, and recycling efforts, jurisdictions can strengthen supply-chain resilience, reduce reliance on mined materials, and achieve deeper emissions reductions. Early action will be key to securing these benefits and leading the transition to sustainable energy practices.

As California navigates the challenges of managing retired EV batteries, the rest of the nation observes closely. The decisions made today will shape the future of energy policy and environmental sustainability. How will states balance the need for immediate recycling with the potential benefits of battery reuse?

The Korean automaker sold 79,543 vehicles in the U.S. last month, marking a 15% jump from the previous year and the company's strongest July performance since launching its first American vehicle in 1986. Leading this charge was the IONIQ 5, which saw sales rocket 71% with 5,818 units sold, proving that building quality EVs in America is the recipe for success.

The numbers tell a compelling story about shifting consumer preferences in the EV market. Electrified vehicles now account for nearly one-third of Hyundai's retail sales mix, representing a dramatic 50% increase compared to July 2024. This surge comes at a critical time as the federal $7,500 EV tax credit faces its September 30 deadline, creating urgency among buyers to secure these substantial savings before they disappear.

What Makes the IONIQ 5 a Tesla Model Y Killer

The IONIQ 5's success stems from addressing real-world consumer pain points that Tesla has struggled with. Built at Hyundai's Georgia manufacturing facility, the updated 2025 model delivers up to 318 miles of range while featuring an industry-leading 800-volt electrical architecture that enables ultra-fast charging. This technical advantage allows the IONIQ 5 to charge from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes at compatible 350kW stations, compared to Tesla's slower 400-volt system requiring around 40 minutes.

Recent independent testing has shown the IONIQ 5 matching or exceeding the Tesla Model Y in key areas like ride comfort, interior space, and user-friendly controls. The Korean crossover offers nearly four more inches of rear shoulder room and includes physical buttons for essential functions, addressing common Tesla owner complaints about everything being buried in touchscreen menus. Recent automotive reviews have positioned the IONIQ 5 as Tesla's most formidable competitor, with Edmunds calling the comparison a tie between the two vehicles.

The Perfect Storm for EV Adoption

Hyundai's aggressive pricing strategy has made electric vehicle ownership accessible to mainstream buyers. The IONIQ 5 is currently available for lease starting at just $179 per month, undercutting many gas-powered SUVs while including a complimentary home charging station.

Among the most impressive are results from a run at the United Kingdom's vaunted Shelsley Walsh hill climb. Porsche Formula E development driver Gabriela Jílková took the prototype battery-powered SUV up the 2,998-foot course — with a gradient of up to 16.7% in places — in under 32 seconds. The mark bested the SUV record by four ticks, according to InsideEVs.

The publication credits the model's special suspension for the showing, which could have it competing in the sports car category, as well. It looks the part of both, judging by a photo shared by Car and Driver. It has a clean, low-profile design with the attitude of a sports car on the front half. The report listed the starting price at between $80,000 and $120,000. It's intended to replace the gas-burning Cayennes, but Car and Driver's Frankie Cruz didn't know when the complete shift to the cleaner version would happen, per his article.

News about Porsche's EV commitment has been mixed. It was reported last year that the luxury brand was cutting back on battery-powered investments with demand for its Taycan slowing, though other stories describe the ride as a boon for the EV sports car segment.

The Porsche models are evidence of how advanced EV performance is becoming, as more brands are competing with Tesla's popular models. Last year, a Mercedes-Benz CLA traveled 2,309 miles in 24 hours, requiring just 40 charges. The Chinese-made Xiaomi SU7 Ultra prototype has set lap records that contend with dirty-fueled rides.

The high-performance marks are reflected in better charge, range, and planet-friendly performance for models that end up on Main Street, too. Each EV that replaces a gas guzzler prevents thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution annually, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The tailpipe exhaust includes known carcinogens and is associated with a variety of health risks, according to more government-cited studies.

A report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology drives home EVs' planet-friendlier attributes. Gas-burning vehicles emit more than 350 grams of carbon dioxide per mile during their lives. An EV's lifetime CO2 burden is 200 grams per mile. If the region where it charges has cleaner energy to power it, the pollution contribution is lower.

Charging the ride with a household solar panel setup can increase the benefits by providing free solar-based electricity. EnergySage is a vetted resource that can help you land applicable incentives and find the right installer, saving thousands on upfront panel costs. Action is important, as President Donald Trump's spending bill ends solar incentives early on Dec. 31.

As for EVs, owners typically save up to $1,500 a year in gas and service costs, as there are no fluids to change. But EV tax credits expire early on Sept. 30, thanks to the bill, per NPR. Fortunately, states still offer certain incentives for clean energy projects.

Back on the proving grounds, former Top Gear host Richard Hammond tested the prototype Cayenne's towing capacity. It ""effortlessly"" handled a nearly 4,000-pound load, and will likely be able to pull more than 7,700 pounds. It's expected to have 729 horsepower or more, setting it apart from other Cayennes on the market, per ArenaEV.

The report said the new version will likely be available stateside in 2027.

In a sweeping deregulatory move, the Trump administration has proposed scrapping the Endangerment Finding, a foundation of U.S. climate policy that enabled federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants, by setting emissions standards.

First established in 2009 by Barack Obama’s government, the Endangerment Finding declared that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare. The ruling, based on a 2007 Supreme Court decision, gave the EPA legal authority to regulate emissions from cars, power plants, and industrial sources under the Clean Air Act.

Now, under EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the agency is seeking to overturn the finding. Calling it “the largest deregulatory action in the history of America” on a recent conservative podcast, Zeldin characterised the move as a rejection of “the holy grail of the climate change religion.”

If finalised, the repeal would gut the federal government’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including the rollback of vehicle emissions standards and methane limits on oil and gas operations. It would also severely restrict future administrations from enacting similar protections. The finding was a key justification behind the Biden Administration’s electric vehicle (EV) mandate which has been a key issue of opposition for Trump.

The administration argues that the Clean Air Act was never intended to regulate global climate pollutants, suggesting instead that EPA authority should be limited to pollution with local or regional health impacts. This interpretation, however, has been widely dismissed by legal scholars and environmental experts.

Critics warn the proposal could have catastrophic environmental and legal consequences. Former EPA officials, including Republicans, have condemned the move as a betrayal of the agency’s mission. Climate scientists emphasise that eliminating the Endangerment Finding undermines decades of research linking emissions to rising global temperatures, extreme weather, and public health risks.

Whilst the proposal is expected to face significant legal challenges, experts caution that the mere attempt could delay climate action and weaken existing protections. A public comment period is now underway whereby the public can issue their thoughts on the proposal, before any final decision is made.",https://www.environewsnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lee-Zeldin.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 20:01:26.550827

Lucid Motors Stock (NASDAQ:LCID)

Lucid stock has risen more than 19% over the past month, driven mainly by the announcement of a recent deal, under which ride-sharing giant Uber Technologies (UBER) aims to deploy 20,000 or more Lucid vehicles equipped with the Nuro Driver technology over a six-year period. Moreover, Uber will invest $300 million in Lucid as part of the robotaxi deal.

Investors also cheered the news that all Lucid Air sedan models will have the ability to charge utilizing Tesla’s (TSLA) Supercharger network beginning July 31. Despite the rise in LCID stock price over the past month, shares are still down about 20% year-to-date, as investors remain concerned about the company missing production and delivery expectations. Lucid is seeing softer demand for its pricier luxury EVs, as consumers are shifting to cheaper hybrid and gasoline-powered cars amid an elevated interest rate environment.

Lucid is scheduled to announce its results for the second quarter of 2025 on August 5. Wall Street expects the company to report a narrower loss per share of $0.21 compared to $0.34 in the prior-year quarter. Revenue is expected to rise by about 30% year-over-year to $261.26 million.

Is LCID Stock a Buy?

Following the Uber partnership news, Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg reiterated a Buy rating on Lucid stock and increased the price target to $7 from $5. Legg sees this collaboration as a clear strategic win, which “infuses capital and two world-class partners,” while expanding Lucid’s presence into autonomous ride-hailing. The analyst recommended buying LCID stock ahead of the Q2 earnings, as he expects continued positive momentum.

With seven Holds, one Buy, and one Sell recommendation, Wall Street has a Hold consensus rating on Lucid stock. The average LCID stock price target of $3.19 indicates 32% upside potential from current levels.

Nio Stock (NYSE:NIO)

Nio stock has rallied about 43% over the past month and is up about 15% year-to-date. Optimism about the company’s Onvo L90 SUV and resilient deliveries in the highly competitive Chinese EV market have helped drive the stock higher. Launched under Nio’s mass-market Onvo brand, the L90 SUV is expected to boost the company’s top line.

Last week, Nio reported a 2.5% year-over-year growth in its July deliveries to 21,017 vehicles. The company’s August deliveries are expected to be boosted by Onvo L90 sales. Overall, Nio’s Q2 deliveries jumped by about 26% year-over-year to 72,056 vehicles.

Is NIO a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

Last week, Macquarie analyst Eugene Hsiao upgraded NIO stock from Hold to Buy with a price target of $5.50. The 5-star analyst believes that the L90, priced at RMB 265.8k, is poised to be NIO’s most competitive offering. He noted that the L90 is a six-seat large SUV near the price of the five-seat Tesla Model Y.

Hsiao added that the L90 appears to be a better value for money compared to Li Auto’s (LI) recent i8 at a 17% lower entry price, but offering many similar features. Consequently, he raised his 2025 and 2026 volume estimates to 347,000 and 500,000, respectively.

However, several analysts don’t share Hsiao’s optimism. Overall, Wall Street has a Hold consensus rating on Nio stock based on five Holds, three Buys, and one Sell recommendation. The average NIO stock price target of $4.68 indicates a downside risk of 6.6% from current levels.

XPeng Stock (NYSE:XPEV)

XPeng stock has rallied about 53% year-to-date, as the company continues to impress investors with its stellar deliveries. The Chinese EV maker reported a 229% year-over-year jump in its July deliveries to 36,717 vehicles. In fact, July marked the ninth consecutive month of XPeng’s deliveries surpassing 30,000 units. This brings XPeng’s Q2 deliveries to 103,181 vehicles, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 242%.

The company’s expansion into Europe and launch of new models, including the updated G6 and G9 SUVs and P7+ sedan, drove higher demand in the first half. Overall, XPeng expects to double its deliveries in 2025 from 190,068 units last year. Expectations are high that the company will turn profitable in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Is XPEV a Good Stock to Buy?

Recently, Goldman Sachs analyst Tina Hou upgraded XPeng stock to Buy from Hold and raised the price target to $24 from $18.60, citing improving cost structure and new product strategies. The 4-star analyst stated that the company’s organizational and supply chain restructuring efforts are beginning to show results, supporting its expectations for more sustainable volume growth and better profit margins.

Hou noted that XPeng’s recent models, including the Mona M03 and P7+, have ranked among the top-selling cars in their segments. She added that the company is also accelerating its product rollout, planning to launch around 10 new or refreshed models annually, up from one to two in previous years, helping it maintain visibility in a crowded market.

Turning to Wall Street, XPeng stock scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on six Buys, two Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average XPEV stock price target of $24.78 indicates 37.3% upside potential.

No plugs, no charging stations, no planning stops. It sounds crazy, but it’s already a reality. And the most surprising part is that it doesn’t come from Silicon Valley or any European lab, but from India.

Its creator

It is not Tesla, it is not Toyota. The person who is behind this creation is Professor Satyam Kumar Jha. This man has developed an automatic charging system based on wind energy, something never seen or thought for the moment! For us, it is an incredible brain! And wait, because the best part is that it works even when the car is moving slowly, UnionRayo reports.

How can a car charge while it’s moving?

The key lies in a compact wind generator that turns moving air into electricity. But don’t picture a giant turbine stuck to the car. This system was designed to work with very light winds, which makes it perfect for city driving or for those days when you don’t go over 30 km/h.

Thanks to that, the vehicle’s battery receives energy in real time, whether you’re on the open road, driving through the city, or waiting at a traffic light.

Advantages over traditional electric cars

One of the biggest headaches with electric cars is still charging. Not enough stations, too slow, risk of getting stranded… With this system, all of that disappears. Literally.

Unlimited range: Since the car charges as it moves, you don’t need to think about how much battery you have left or look for the next plug.

Lower costs: No more paying to recharge. The energy is generated on the go, so usage costs drop instantly.

Almost zero environmental impact: No fuel, no external power. Just air and movement. So the carbon footprint is kept to a minimum.

An invention born in India (and that’s no coincidence)

Ok, let’s explain this. This project didn’t come out of a big innovation centre or of a big brand as we have said before, and of course, it doesn’t have either the investment backing of an important company.

It was created by a physicist in Maharashtra, with the help of his wife, Preeti Jha. Both, working side by side for a better future. Together, they want to change the world by turning a practical idea into real life.

And that is exactly what makes this experiment so powerful: this technology could make a difference in cities, but, think for a moment in those rural areas or places where electricity is more than a problem, this is a realistic solution for those who need it most, don’t you think?

What now?

Ok, lets go part by part, it is still in the process of commercial expansion (for the moment), its creators are looking for partners who want to take the idea further. Investors, manufacturers, governments… whoever wants to join this revolution is welcome…

As Jha himself said “We’re on the edge of an energy revolution. This innovation is not an experiment, it’s a solution ready to change industries and lives”

A new era of transport?

Could be, don’t? This self-charging car could be the start of something much incredible and bigger: a truly autonomous form of mobility, with no plugs, no cables and no external dependence! If the system scales up and is applied to more vehicles, we might be looking at a new category of transport.

Can you imagine never having to plug in your car again? What a dream! But maybe that’s no longer just imagining. It’s already happening in India!",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EVPluggedIn.jpeg,N,,2025-08-03 19:00:18.872573

Massachusetts faces a statutory deadline to lock in contracts for at least 5.6 GW of offshore wind by 2027 but only one project–Vineyard Wind 1—is under under construction.
Two-thirds of Canadians want the federal government to prioritize clean energy development, said a study released last month by Clean Energy Canada.","Nova Scotia announced plans in late July to jumpstart Canada’s offshore wind industry, revealing four designated areas for development—the first in the country—located off the province's coast, with a goal to produce 5 GW by decade's end. Province Premier Tim Houston also noted more ambitious plans for the “Wind West"" megaproject aimed to produce 40 GW of offshore wind power for potential export across the country and into the U.S.

The offshore wind push comes as part of a larger effort by Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney, elected earlier year, to build the country's ""energy dominance"" by reducing its dependence on power imports from the U.S. and other nations, including both fossil fuel and renewables

“Canada’s new government is ready to fast-track major projects across the country that will make [it] an energy superpower,” Carney posted on social media following a meeting with oil and gas executives in May. “We all agree: it’s time to build,” he added.

Carney is seen as a clean energy proponent from past roles as chairman of infrastructure investor Brookfield Asset Management and head of its transition investing, and as UN special envoy for climate action and finance. But he is pledging to develop all forms of energy, “It’s time to build Canada into an energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy,” he said in backing construction of an “energy corridor,” although with few details yet as to projects in the ""national interest"" to be included.

Clean Energy Boost

But related to offshore wind, Nova Scotia said the province plans to issue a call for bids before year end on select parcels within the development area, in a process being managed by the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator. It aims to license development of up to 5 GW—double Nova Scotia’s current peak energy use—by 2030, with proposals for both floating and fixed-bottom wind projects to be considered.

“With some of the top wind speeds in the world, Nova Scotia has the potential to become a clean energy superpower,” said Houston on July 29, contending that Wind West would produce 27% of Canada’s energy needs but would require construction of infrastructure to deliver power westward. He said a combination of provincial, private and federal investment would be needed, citing a preliminary cost estimate of $5 billion to $6 billion but that could reach $10 billion, according to news reports.

Elsewhere on Canada's east coast, Newfoundland and Labrador announced in June that legislation passed to allow the province to also develop offshore wind. Other uses for offshore wind include supplying Canada's nascent green hydrogen industry, with a $4.45-billion Nova Scotia plant receiving environmental approvals last year and former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signing a supply agreement in 2022 with Germany.

Nova Scotia wind construction, as well as fossil fuel project development, could also receive a boost from federal legislation taking effect June 26 that allows the national government to fast-track development of certain “nation-building” projects. A new Major Federal Projects Office set to open in September is intended to meet a stated goal to generate project approvals within two years, with Canada's CBC News listing some projects that could gain fast track approval status.

US Connection?

Potential offshore wind export to New England states now is gaining momentum, as they face a gap in expected domestic production from Trump administration actions to limit US offshore wind growth—most recently cancellation of planned federal ocean lease sales in Maine, New York and central Atlantic states

The Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs could seek to procure electricity from planned offshore wind farms in Canada, according to a report by Canada’s National Observer, an online news publication focused on investigative reporting.

Massachusetts faces a statutory deadline to lock in contracts for at least 5.6 GW of offshore wind by 2027 but only one project–Vineyard Wind 1—is under under construction. It is set to add about 800 MW to the grid by the end of 2025. Other planned state projects have been halted or face delays. A spokesperson for the energy office said it is considering partnerships to leverage “significant opportunities to construct new onshore and offshore wind projects across Canada and the Northeast region.”

Similarly, Maine is ""closely tracking development of offshore wind in Canada and considering how regional efforts may deliver reliable, affordable power, modern infrastructure and broad economic benefits,"" the Governor’s Energy Office said in a statement. Workers who are citizens of tribal nations or members of international labor unions could theoretically work on projects in Canada, Grant Provost, business agent for Ironworkers international union Local 7 and Maine AFL-CIO vice president, told the Maine Morning Star. But he noted potential complications from current trade tensions.

Two-thirds of Canadians want the federal government to prioritize clean energy development, said a study released last month by Clean Energy Canada. But clean-economy tax credits introduced by the previous Liberal government remain slow moving. A spokesperson for Finance Canada said it now “is in the process of finalizing"" clean electricity and EV supply chain tax credits.

Meanwhile, market observers are awaiting possible impacts of what is termed as a ""landmark opinion"" July 23 by the UN's highest court that nations could be in violation of international law if they fail to take measures to mitigate climate change. While non-binding, the International Court of Justice ruling could boost legal arguments in suits against countries and companies seeking reparations.

The shift from nuclear to renewable energy storage reflects a broader commitment to reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy security.","The global transition to renewable energy sources has sparked innovative solutions to balance electricity supply and demand. In Germany, a transformative project is underway at the former nuclear site in Philippsburg. The energy firm EnBW plans to construct one of the country’s largest battery storage facilities, leveraging the site’s strategic location. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to stabilize the power grid, accommodating the fluctuating output from renewable sources. As the world moves away from fossil fuels, the integration of such large-scale battery systems is crucial to ensure consistent power delivery, especially during periods of low renewable energy production.

Balancing the Grid

As the reliance on renewable energy sources like wind and solar power increases, the challenge of balancing the grid becomes more pronounced. Peter Heydecker, a board member at EnBW, emphasized the critical role of large-scale batteries in this new energy landscape. These batteries are pivotal in reconciling the variable generation capacity of renewable sources with actual electricity demand. The Philippsburg project is designed to capture excess electricity generated during periods of high renewable output and release it when demand surpasses supply, thus maintaining grid stability.

Heydecker highlighted a dual strategy involving both batteries and hydrogen-ready gas power plants. While batteries manage short-term fluctuations, these advanced gas plants are intended to provide backup during extended periods of insufficient renewable generation. Together, they form a flexible system capable of adapting to varying energy conditions.

“These Simulators Are Unlike Anything You’ve Seen” Trak Racer and Airbus Join Forces to Redefine Flight Training for a New Generation of American Pilots

“In the energy system of the future, the task of large-scale battery storage systems will be to reconcile two factors in the short term: The weather-dependent generation capacity of renewable energy sources on the one hand, and the actual electricity demand of households, businesses, and industry on the other,” Heydecker explained.

Energy Site is Tactical

The selection of the Philippsburg site is strategic, given its proximity to a significant substation constructed by TransnetBW, a major transmission system operator. This substation links to the Ultranet power line, which channels wind-generated electricity from northern Germany to its industrial southern regions. By situating an 800 MWh storage facility at this location, EnBW aims to optimize the capture and redistribution of surplus wind energy.

“Germany Is Betting Everything on This” as $3.2 Billion Offshore Wind Farm Promises Power for 1.6 Million Homes but Sparks Fierce Backlash Over Costs and Impact

Mayor Stefan Martus of Philippsburg underscored the town’s historical significance in Germany’s energy landscape. He expressed optimism about continuing its legacy as a central hub for sustainable energy storage and distribution. However, the project’s success hinges on EnBW’s final investment decisions and the acquisition of necessary permits. If these hurdles are cleared, the battery storage system is expected to be operational by mid-2027.

“Philippsburg has been one of the most important energy locations in the whole of Germany for half a century – and our town is set to continue to play this outstanding role as an anchor point and huge storage facility for sustainable power generation,” concluded Martus.

Repurposing Nuclear Sites

The transition from a nuclear power generation site to a battery storage facility marks a significant shift in energy policy and infrastructure use. The development is planned on land separate from the existing nuclear plant infrastructure, allowing for an independent timeline. This separation is crucial, as the decommissioning of the site’s nuclear reactors is a complex process that will continue for several more years.

By repurposing sites like Philippsburg, Germany is not only addressing the immediate needs of its power grid but also setting a precedent for sustainable development. The shift from nuclear to renewable energy storage reflects a broader commitment to reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy security. This model could serve as an example for other countries grappling with similar transitions.

Future Implications for Energy Security

The Philippsburg project highlights the importance of innovative solutions in the global energy transition. As nations strive to meet climate goals and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, ensuring energy security becomes paramount. Large-scale battery systems, coupled with other renewable energy technologies, offer a path toward a more resilient and sustainable grid.

However, the successful integration of these technologies requires careful planning, substantial investment, and regulatory support. As the world continues to innovate in renewable energy, the question remains: How can countries best balance technological advancements with the need for reliable and affordable power for all?

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that the electricity consumption of AI data centres could double from 2022 levels to 1,000TWh (terawatt hours) in 2026. That’s approximately the same amount of electricity used by Japan each year.

Now there’s a crop of young companies aiming to help reduce the negative environmental impact of the tech, be it through developing more efficient models or improving the hardware needed to train and run them.

We asked investors which up-and-coming companies they have on their radar. There’s just one caveat: their picks can’t be in their portfolio.

Sebastian Hunte, investment director at AlbionVC

AlbionVC is a London-based VC backing companies from seed to Series A.

Nexos.ai – Lithuania

“Nexos helps businesses to reduce wasteful compute by intelligently routing across over 200 models based on context and task. Smarter orchestration means less unnecessary inference, and far better energy efficiency at scale.”

Flower – Sweden

“Much of the talk around greener AI focuses on efficiency gains, but I think that is the wrong way to think of it. Efficiency often leads to more usage, not less energy consumption. The real levers for sustainable AI are upstream: how we orchestrate workloads, where we run them and how green the energy powering them is.

That’s why Flower is such a compelling company: by combining grid-scale batteries with AI-powered trading and forecasting, they’re enabling a more stable, dispatchable supply of clean energy at scale. Their ‘green baseload’ platform could play a pivotal role in aligning AI’s rising energy demands with genuinely sustainable infrastructure.”

Terralayr – Switzerland

“Terralayr is building a flexible energy infrastructure layer by aggregating and virtualising battery storage assets. Their platform brings cloud-like flexibility to energy, helping accelerate the shift to renewables which is ultimately the only scalable way to decarbonise AI.”

Gabriele Papievyte, head of XTX Ventures

But for people who want to sum up the 2009 endangerment finding as if they study carbon dioxide as an endangerment on human health, they did not do that,” Zeldin told CNN.
So when you read through the 2009 endangerment finding, they say that where there’s silence in the law, there’s gaps that I should just be interpreting that as my own discretion.","(CNN) — Lee Zeldin, a former Republican Congressman from New York and now the Trump Administration’s head of the Environmental Protection Agency on Sunday defended the Trump Administration’s move to repeal the so-called endangerment finding that planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health.

“To reach the 2009 endangerment finding, they relied on the most pessimistic views of the science. The great news is that a lot of the pessimistic views of the science in 2009 that was being assumed ended up not panning out,” Zeldin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

The 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety, which has served as EPA’s basis for many of its significant regulations aiming to protect the environment and decrease climate pollution. If successful, the repeal could strip away the federal government’s most powerful way to control the country’s planet-warming pollution and fight climate change.

The text of the administration’s proposal to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding said that while greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise in the atmosphere, that rise has been “driven primarily by increased emissions from foreign sources,” and has happened “without producing the degree of adverse impacts to public health and welfare in the United States that the EPA anticipated in the 2009 Endangerment Finding.”

The US is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and historically has emitted more planet-warming pollution than any other country. Many rigorous scientific findings since 2009 have showed both climate pollution and its warming effects are not just harming public health but killing people outright.

In the nearly 16 years since the EPA first issued the Supreme Court-ordered endangerment finding, the world has warmed an additional 0.45 degrees Celsius (or 0.81 degrees Fahrenheit) to 1.4 degrees Celsius, according to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather.

“Both the scientific certainty around climate change and evidence of the dangers it is causing have grown stronger since 2009,” Hausfather said in an email. “There is no evidence that has emerged or been published in the scientific literature in the past 16 years that would in any way challenge the scientific basis of the 2009 endangerment finding.”

Pressed on whether he’s skeptical of the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are the overwhelming driver of man-made climate change, Zeldin said, “That might be your way to try to twist my words.”

The EPA is in a public comment period on its proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles, since they stem from the 2009 finding.

“We’re going through a public comment period. We want to make the right decision afterwards. But for people who want to sum up the 2009 endangerment finding as if they study carbon dioxide as an endangerment on human health, they did not do that,” Zeldin told CNN.

Asked whether the EPA should have a role in trying to combat climate change, Zeldin said that the Supreme Court “made it very clear that I have to follow the law.”

“I have to follow the plain language of the law, and I can’t get creative. So when you read through the 2009 endangerment finding, they say that where there’s silence in the law, there’s gaps that I should just be interpreting that as my own discretion. The Supreme Court has made it very clear that that is not what is a power that I have,” he said, adding that drawing up such a regulation should be left to Congress.

You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.

But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.

Wind power brings steady income for farms

Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricity came from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around US$3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.

Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.

Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.

In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing between 38% and 69% of tax revenue.

The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm

Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.

Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics – dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.

Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.

However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.

Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.

What’s being lost

The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.

The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.

While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies

Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.

Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.

In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing – such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries – and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.

On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.

As rural America faces economic uncertainty and climate pressures, I believe homegrown renewable energy offers a practical path forward. Wind and solar aren’t just fueling the grid; they’re helping keep farms and rural towns alive.",https://www.morningagclips.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/johanna-montoya-OZ-r0tEnW6M-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 16:00:47.996840

It is expected to produce 1.1 GW of solar power and be fitted with 200 MWh of battery storage once complete.","Egypt has been steadily increasing its renewable energy capacity in recent years in a bid to enhance its energy security. By 2024, Egypt had a total installed capacity of renewable energy of almost 7.8 GW. While its hydropower segment has remained stable at around 2.8 GW since 2018, it has significantly expanded its wind and solar energy sectors. Egypt’s solar energy capacity increased from 35 MW in 2012 to almost 2.6 GW in 2024, with several more large-scale solar projects currently under development. The North African country has also invested significantly in enhancing energy access in rural areas by expanding its off-grid renewable capacity.

Egypt has contended with severe energy shortages in recent years, as it has fallen short on its natural gas production targets, particularly at its giant Zohr offshore gas field, which has hit its economy hard. This has led the government to pursue a more diversified energy mix to boost the country’s energy security. To do this, Egypt has opened its doors to international investment in the energy sector.

Egypt’s government aims to mobilise more than $10 billion in private investment for renewable energy, including wind and solar power production, to source 42 percent of the country’s energy from renewables by 2030. However, it is currently a long way from achieving this target, having attracted a reported $4 billion in investment to date. To encourage greater investment in its green energy sector, the government is now offering tax breaks, free land, cash rebates, and other incentives to investors. However, greater efforts to improve the country’s investment and energy policies could spur investment in the sector.

In May, Egypt’s Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy selected four companies to operate under the country’s newly adopted private-to-private (P2P) power agreement model. This will allow private energy producers to generate and sell electricity directly to industrial consumers. The selected projects have a combined power capacity of 400 MW and an investment total of $388 million.

Each company will now be permitted to construct its own green energy power plant to supply industry with power, while paying a transmission fee to the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC). The awardees are Neptune Energy, AMEA Power, TAQA PV and ENARA. Egypt’s Energy Minister Mahmoud Esmat said the move aligns with the government’s Electricity Law, which aims to open the market to competition, enhance efficiency, and attract private investment.

Also in May, Egypt and Germany signed a $138.7 million financial cooperation agreement to boost wind energy development and inclusive technical education. The deal includes $101 million for the interconnection of the ACWA Power 1 and 2 wind farms and $37.6 million in grants to establish 25 training centres across Egypt. ACWA Power 1 and 2 are expected to produce 1.1 GW of clean electricity as part of Egypt’s Noufi green investment initiative, while the education centres will provide training to improve workforce skills in line with the government’s economic priorities.

Then, in July, the U.K. development bank British International Investment (BII) announced an investment of more than $300 million to support the development of two renewable energy projects in Egypt – a new 1.1 GW Gulf of Suez Wind Farm and the 1.1 GW Obelisk integrated solar and battery storage project with Scatec. The $1.2 billion Gulf of Suez Wind Farm is Africa’s biggest onshore wind development to date, and is expected to generate 4,500 GWh of clean power annually, helping to reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million metric tonnes a year. Egypt has agreed on a total of $704 million in debt financing with a consortium of development finance institutions to fund the project.

Meanwhile, Obelisk, Egypt’s first integrated solar PV and battery energy storage system, which is expected to cost $479.1 million, will receive financial support from Norway’s Scatec, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the African Development Bank (AfDB). It is expected to produce 1.1 GW of solar power and be fitted with 200 MWh of battery storage once complete.

Egypt’s Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation, Rania Al-Mashat, said, “the Obelisk solar project is another important milestone for Egypt under the energy pillar of the Nexus of Water, Food, and Energy programme, which has since its launch in November 2022 at COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh delivered 4.2 GW of privately financed renewable energy investments, worth about $4 billion.” Al-Mashat added, “The goal of NWFE’s energy pillar is to add 10 GW of renewable energy capacity with investments of approximately $10 billion, and phase out 5 GW of fossil fuel power generation by 2030.”

After several years of severe energy shortages, Egypt is working with private and international partners to develop a strong renewable energy sector that will boost the North African country’s energy security for years to come. New solar and wind capacity, as well as its well-established hydropower sector, will help Egypt to transition away from a reliance on fossil fuels to move to green alternatives, as well as expand energy access across the country.

As the world pivots toward electric vehicles (EVs), Ford's 2025–2030 strategy is a masterclass in balancing bold electrification with pragmatic financial discipline. For patient investors, the company's progress in EV innovation, cost optimization, and regulatory alignment presents a compelling case for long-term value creation.

Strategic Reinvention: Ford's EV Pivot and Operational Overhaul

Ford's recent investments in EV infrastructure and battery technology are reshaping its competitive position. The company's $50 billion EV investment through 2026—a sum equivalent to 40% of its current market cap—is not just a bet on the future; it's a recalibration of its entire business model. Key initiatives include:

- Battery Production Leadership: With the BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Michigan, set to produce LFP batteries starting in 2026, Ford is securing access to one of the most cost-effective and durable battery chemistries. This move qualifies the company for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits while reducing dependency on global supply chains.

- Product Streamlining: By consolidating body styles per platform and prioritizing high-volume models like the F-150 Lightning and E-Transit, Ford is optimizing costs. A new electric commercial van (2026) and two advanced EV pickups (2027) will further diversify its portfolio without overextending R&D budgets.

- Partnerships for Resilience: Collaborations with Google's Team Upshift and Jiangling Motors are accelerating software-driven services (e.g., predictive maintenance) and global EV architecture development. Meanwhile, the BlueOval SK joint venture ensures a steady supply of battery cells for critical models.

Financial Turnaround: From Breakeven to Profitability

Ford's EV division, while still unprofitable, is on a clear path to breakeven. In Q1 2025, losses narrowed to $849 million, down from $1.3 billion in Q1 2024. Analysts project margins will improve from -12% today to breakeven by 2026, driven by scaling production of the F-150 Lightning (150,000 units/year) and Mustang Mach-E (100,000 units/year).

The company's overall debt-to-EBITDA ratio (3.6x) remains elevated, but Ford is aggressively reducing leverage. By 2025, it aims to cut this to below 3.0x, supported by $1 billion in annual cost savings from operational efficiencies and inventory management. Meanwhile, its traditional ICE segment—anchored by the F-Series (52% of profits and 37% market share)—provides a stable cash flow buffer during the EV transition.

Technical Indicators and Price Projections: A Cautious Bull Case

While Ford's stock has faced short-term volatility (3.68% 30-day volatility, RSI at 44.32), longer-term technical indicators suggest a golden cross formation. The 50-week moving average ($13.65) and 200-week moving average ($14.10) are converging, historically signaling a 23% average gain over 12 months. Key resistance levels at $16.45 and $20.25 could become catalysts if the company meets production targets or secures IRA credits.

Analyst price targets are mixed but increasingly bullish. 24/7 Wall Street projects $13.23 in 2025 (17% upside) and $15.75 by 2030 (56% upside). These forecasts hinge on Ford's ability to scale EV production, reduce battery costs, and capitalize on hybrid demand—a strategy that has already boosted hybrid sales by 27% in Q2 2025.

Ford's risk management strategies are equally robust. By shifting battery production to the U.S., it's insulating itself from geopolitical supply chain shocks and maximizing IRA tax credits. Hybrid models (e.g., F-150 Hybrid) act as a transitional revenue stream, ensuring profitability even as EV infrastructure lags. Additionally, tariff rerouting and domestic production investments (e.g., BlueOval City in Tennessee) are reducing exposure to inflation and trade wars.

Investment Thesis: A Long-Term Buy with Caution

For investors with a 5–10 year horizon, Ford offers a rare combination of:

1. Strategic Momentum: A clear, executable plan to dominate the U.S. EV market with high-volume, high-margin products.

2. Financial Prudence: Aggressive cost-cutting and debt reduction to balance the risks of R&D overruns.

3. Regulatory Tailwinds: IRA tax credits and domestic production incentives that could boost margins by 5–7% post-2026.

However, risks remain. Delays in EV production, supply chain bottlenecks, or underwhelming consumer adoption of hybrids could extend breakeven timelines. Investors should monitor Ford's Q3 2025 earnings and the August 11, 2025, product launch for signals of momentum.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 15:59:39.332824

For investors, the Model 3's continued dominance in the EV market—despite slowing growth—signals a durable product line.
Critics may argue that the Model 3's depreciation and insurance costs undermine its value.","The Tesla Model 3 has long been a symbol of the electric vehicle (EV) revolution. But as the federal EV tax credit—a cornerstone of its affordability—nears its end, investors and consumers alike face a pressing question: Is this once-ubiquitous EV still a prudent purchase in 2025? The answer lies in a careful analysis of total cost of ownership (TCO) and strategic timing before the tax credit vanishes on September 30, 2025.

The Vanishing Incentive: A Race Against Time

The federal tax credit, part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), has been a lifeline for EV adoption. For the Model 3, it offers up to $7,500 in savings—translatable to an immediate price reduction if the buyer meets income thresholds and the vehicle is assembled in North America. However, this incentive is set to expire under the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), a 2025 tax reform bill championed by President Donald Trump. The deadline is concrete: vehicles delivered after September 30, 2025, will no longer qualify.

For buyers, this creates a narrow window of opportunity. Tesla's pricing strategy has historically adapted to such transitions—lowering costs post-credit expiration to offset losses. Yet with margins already tightening and competition from rivals like Rivian and Hyundai intensifying, there is no guarantee of further discounts. Acting before the end of September 2025 is not just advisable; it is imperative for those seeking to lock in the maximum financial benefit.

Total Cost of Ownership: The Long Game

While the tax credit's expiration is urgent, it is not the only factor. The Model 3's TCO remains compelling, even after the credit phases out. Here's how it stacks up against traditional gasoline vehicles:

Fuel Savings: At $0.05 per mile for home charging (vs. $0.13 for gas), the Model 3 costs just $518 annually for 15,000 miles driven. Even with public charging, the cost per mile remains 38–58% lower.

Maintenance Costs: Over five years, the Model 3 requires just $1,200 in maintenance—compared to $4,200 for a gasoline sedan. EVs have fewer moving parts, and regenerative braking minimizes wear on critical components.

Insurance: At $1,712 annually, Model 3 premiums are 15% higher than those for comparable gas cars. However, insurers are beginning to offer EV-specific discounts, which could narrow this gap.

Depreciation: The Model 3 retains 41% of its value after five years, a middling performance in the luxury segment but still better than most gas-powered competitors.

When combined with the tax credit, the Model 3's net savings over seven years reach $8,200, with a break-even point of just 3.2 years for the Long Range variant. Post-credit, the break-even period extends to 4.8 years, yet the savings remain robust—especially in regions with low electricity rates, such as Washington (up to $12,000 in seven years).

Strategic Timing and Market Dynamics

The Model 3's future is intertwined with broader market forces. Tesla's share price, which has fluctuated wildly over the past three years, reflects investor concerns about profitability and competition. A chart would reveal a pattern of volatility, with dips during supply chain disruptions and rallies when production targets are met.

However, the stock's performance is not the only metric. Tesla's ability to innovate—such as its recent advancements in battery technology and AI-driven Autopilot—suggests long-term resilience. For investors, the Model 3's enduring appeal lies in its role as a gateway product for Tesla's ecosystem, which includes software subscriptions, charging networks, and home energy solutions.

Investment Advice: Act Now, But Think Ahead

For consumers, the calculus is clear: purchase a Model 3 before the tax credit expires to maximize savings. Even if Tesla's pricing strategy shifts post-September 2025, the upfront discount secured now will be difficult to replicate. For investors, the Model 3's continued dominance in the EV market—despite slowing growth—signals a durable product line. However, the sector's long-term success depends on Tesla's ability to maintain its lead in software and battery technology.

Critics may argue that the Model 3's depreciation and insurance costs undermine its value. Yet these are mitigated by the vehicle's low fuel and maintenance expenses. In a world increasingly focused on sustainability and cost efficiency, the Model 3 remains a compelling proposition—provided buyers act swiftly.

— Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia

BANGOR, ME, UNITED STATES, August 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Suncovia, a leading advocate for equitable clean energy solutions, has expressed deep concern over the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, 2025. With its passing, the federal 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D) is officially ending on December 31, 2025. The legislation abruptly stops the long-standing tax credit without a phase-out period — creating a narrow and urgent window for homeowners to take advantage of this historic incentive.

Suncovia, a leading force in solar project development and clean energy financing, is calling on homeowners, contractors, and developers to move quickly. This tax credit sunset is one of the most consequential energy policy shifts in over a decade.

“This change dramatically shortens the planning horizon for families considering solar,” said Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia. “If you're thinking about going solar, the time to act is now — not next year.”

WHAT HOMEOWNERS NEED TO KNOW:

DECEMBER 31, 2025 IS A HARD DEADLINE

To qualify for the 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit, solar systems must be fully installed and operational by the end of 2025 — no extensions, no carryovers.

THERE IS NO PHASE-DOWN — NO GRACE PERIOD

Contrary to the Inflation Reduction Act’s original plan for a gradual wind-down through 2034, this legislation cuts the credit off entirely after 2025.

COMMERCIAL SOLAR CREDIT REMAINS, BUT WITH NEW DATES

The 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for commercial and utility-scale projects still stands but now includes new rules: projects must start by July 4, 2026, and be operational by December 31, 2027, to remain eligible.

IMPACTS FOR HOMEOWNERS AND THE INDUSTRY:

The end of the federal residential solar tax credit could significantly impact both consumers and the broader solar market. For homeowners, the loss of the 30% credit may result in noticeably higher upfront costs for solar installations. Without the federal incentive, many may experience longer return-on-investment timelines beginning in 2026, which could dampen enthusiasm and delay decision-making.

Additionally, the compressed deadline is expected to create logistical challenges. As the end-of-year deadline approaches, installers may become overbooked, and material availability could tighten. These bottlenecks could prevent some homeowners from completing their installations in time to qualify for the credit.

From an industry perspective, the sudden removal of the residential incentive is likely to cause market disruption. The reduced demand could lead to job losses, particularly among smaller solar contractors and residential-focused providers. This shift may also slow the overall pace of solar adoption, just as the U.S. seeks to solidify its leadership in the global clean energy transition.

Suncovia remains committed to making clean energy accessible. In response to these changes, the company is expanding its support for residential installations through Q4 2025. The company is also closely monitoring legislative activity and working with industry partners and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) to advocate for long-term policies that support clean energy adoption and economic resilience.

Suncovia strongly encourages homeowners to act now, before it’s too late. Homeowners should schedule their solar evaluations, secure permits, and finalize installations well before year-end to ensure eligibility for the 30% tax credit.

“This is the last full year for homeowners to take advantage of the most generous solar incentive in U.S. history,” added Craig Mattson. “We don’t want anyone to miss out due to delays or misinformation.”

ABOUT SUNCOVIA

“The company expressed intent to hold that against the economics of joining a (regional transmission organization),” Gilman said.
Joining forces with the California operator would give Xcel Energy broader access to cleaner forms of energy, Turner added.
Blank said the push by some parties to steer Xcel Energy to EDAM rather than the other marketplace would make integrating systems across Colorado difficult.
The Westminster-based utility is in the process of joining the Southwest Power Pool’s regional transmission organization.","Despite concerns from its staff, consumer and conservation groups, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission has endorsed a plan by Xcel Energy to join a new regional marketplace for wholesale electricity.

Two of the three PUC members voiced support in a hearing Wednesday for Xcel’s application to join the Southwest Power Pool’s Markets+, a so-called day-ahead market being formed by the Arkansas-based transmission organization and about 30 organizations.

The commission will issue a written order.

The new marketplace will allow Xcel and other utilities to buy power a day ahead, aimed at keeping electricity flowing more efficiently and cost-effectively. Xcel’s joining a day-ahead market is considered a step toward moving to an organized wholesale market, which a state law requires Colorado transmission utilities to do by 2030. The motivation is to coordinate resources across the region, get more renewable energy on the grid to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meet growing demands for electricity.

However, Megan Gilman, the commissioner who opposed Xcel’s application, contended the utility failed to show, as required by PUC rules, that the benefits of joining Markets+ outweighed the costs. She voiced concerns that the cost of joining the day-ahead market, seen as a temporary step, could delay or derail Xcel’s move to an organized wholesale market.

An organized wholesale market is a centrally managed organization that facilitates the buying and selling of electricity and other services across a region. A 2021 PUC report said utilities’ full participation in that kind of market or a regional transmission organization could produce savings of $230 million annually.

About 60% of the nation’s electric power supply is managed by regional organizations, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, most of that is in the East.

PUC Chairman Eric Blank said he is focused on the potential of saving millions of dollars per year as the purchase and transmission of power become more coordinated across the region.

“For me, incurring these small losses in the near term potentially creates an opportunity to save orders of magnitude more per year,” Blank said. “Although we’re a long, long way from realizing this level of savings, it seems worth trying to me.”

But Gilman noted the law requiring transmission utilities to eventually join a more centralized market allows for waivers. She said Xcel could cite the costs of joining the day-ahead market as a reason for seeking a waiver.

“The company expressed intent to hold that against the economics of joining a (regional transmission organization),” Gilman said.

Xcel, Colorado’s largest electricity provider, said in documents filed with the PUC that the costs of participating in Markets+ will include $2 million for the first phase of starting the organization; $14 million annually for operations for the first five years, then $10 million per year; and an estimated $13 million to $15 million for Xcel to integrate its systems with the marketplace.

The conservation group Western Resource Advocates said in a statement filed in the case that testimony showed Xcel’s costs would exceed net benefits by $30 million through 2032 and cumulative benefits wouldn’t surpass cumulative costs until 2039. For the company’s customers to reap any benefits, Xcel would have to stay in Markets+ through 2038, the group said.

“This means the company would also presumably have to delay the 2030 requirement to join an (organized wholesale market) by nine years,” Western Resource Advocates said.

The PUC staff said Xcel’s application didn’t meet the requirement that joining the marketplace is in the public interest because the company couldn’t show that the expected benefits would outweigh the costs. The staff noted that Xcel witnesses conceded during a hearing that joining Markets+ and recovering the costs for technology upgrades “will result in increased production costs through at least 2038.”

Considering the costs, staffers said it would be reasonable for the commission to deny the application. If the application is approved, the staff recommended monitoring the costs, reliability of the market and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to determine whether Xcel’s continued participation in the marketplace would be warranted.

In the public interest?

“We believe this decision was not in the best interests of ratepayers, grid reliability, or the state’s clean energy goals. And legally, the decision does not appear to be based on the law or the Commission’s own rules, and we will be asking the Commission to reconsider,” Brian Turner, regulatory director at Advanced Energy United, said in an email.

The industry group believes a better path for Xcel Energy would be to join Extended Day-Ahead Market, or EDAM, which is operated by the California Independent System Operator. The organization manages the operation of the electricity transmission grid across California and is also involved in a marketplace across 11 Western states.

The extended day-ahead market is set to launch in 2026, according to the California operator’s website. A report by the Environmental Defense Fund in June said Xcel Energy could save an average of $13.2 million a year if it joined EDAM instead of the Southwest Power Pool’s Markets+. One reason is more availability of renewable energy.

Turner said a bill is moving through the California legislature that would transfer the governing structure of the California Independent System Operator to a separate organization. The current board of directors is appointed by the California governor, but that would change if the legislation passes.

Joining forces with the California operator would give Xcel Energy broader access to cleaner forms of energy, Turner added.

Blank said the push by some parties to steer Xcel Energy to EDAM rather than the other marketplace would make integrating systems across Colorado difficult. Others suggested that Xcel forego participating in a day-ahead market altogether and plan for joining a regional organization.

Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is Colorado’s second-largest electricity provider. The Westminster-based utility is in the process of joining the Southwest Power Pool’s regional transmission organization.

While solar energy is by far more mainstream and accessible as a source of renewable power — it's much more practical to install a solar panel in your home than a turbine — setting aside land and resources for wind farms can stabilize regional power grids and drive down home energy costs while reducing the carbon pollution generated by the energy sector.

Since human-induced carbon pollution is the leading cause of our planet's rising temperatures, implementing more clean energy solutions is key to mitigating some of the repercussions of climate change, from unstable weather patterns to food and water scarcities.

First and foremost, there’s no land-use conflict. Coal mines are already cleared, flat, and often close to grid connections. Therefore, they are ideal for renewable energy projects without competing with agriculture or protected areas.

In addition, the clean energy boost is substantial. If fully developed, these sites could increase global solar power capacity by 15%, making a major contribution to global climate goals. (source: pv-magazine.com)

Moreover, this transition presents major employment opportunities. It could create 260,000 permanent jobs and another 320,000 construction jobs – far surpassing the number of coal jobs expected to be lost by 2035 (source: The Guardian).

Notably, countries like China, the United States, Australia, India, and Indonesia are especially well-positioned to benefit from this shift (source: renewableinstitute.org), thanks to their large coal mine footprints and strong solar potential.

Where coal mine solar conversion is already underway

Importantly, the idea isn’t just theoretical. In China, over 90 solar projects are already up and running on former coal mine sites, with a combined capacity of 14 GW – and another 9 GW in the pipeline (source: euronews.com). This demonstrates the viability of large-scale coal-to-solar transformation.

Europe is moving in a similar direction. Projects are under development in countries like Greece, Germany, and across the Western Balkans, where former lignite mines are being repurposed for solar (source: Balkan Green Energy News).

What are the challenges?

However, transforming old coal mines isn’t always simple. Issues such as soil pollution, land instability, and unclear land rights can delay progress or increase costs (source: Green Ubuntu). These obstacles, while real, are not insurmountable. Nonetheless, experts believe that the long-term benefits – clean energy, land recovery, and jobs – far outweigh the risks (source: renewableinstitute.org). As a result, many stakeholders continue to advocate for these conversions.

Why coal mine solar conversion is a win-win

This solution offers a rare triple win:

Restores land damaged by coal extraction.

Generates clean energy at large scale.

Creates new green jobs in affected regions.

As Global Energy Monitor puts it, this is a “perfect match” between land restoration, renewable energy expansion, and economic recovery (source: Ecowatch).

The global energy transition is seen as a race toward renewables, batteries, and smart grids. Yet even the best technologies can fail without scalable delivery systems. Projects often stall due to execution issues — blown budgets, unrealistic timelines, logistical gaps, or geopolitical hurdles — not faulty technology.

In this mission-critical space between innovation and implementation lies a discipline that rarely makes headlines: planning engineering. Valentin George Cretu has built a career with the help of this approach.

With over two decades of global experience in mechanical engineering, project controls, and portfolio planning, he has managed infrastructure and energy megaprojects from bid to commissioning in some of the most complex environments on the planet. A Certified Cost Engineer and a member of AACE International and the Association of Planning Engineers, Valentin has led projects across Russia, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Argentina, the U.S., and France. He is also the author of Planning Engineering: Principles and Memories, a professional reflection on the human and technical dimensions of his field.

But what does that mean for the future of energy? In Cretu’s view, planning isn’t just a supporting function — it’s a form of infrastructure itself. One that determines whether energy innovations reach the grid, the refinery, or the export terminal.

When Energy Projects Fail, Planning Is Often the Missing Piece

Breakthroughs in renewables and smart grids grab headlines and funding, but energy transitions fail without disciplined execution. Without risk awareness, realistic timelines, and cost control, even the most ambitious projects stall or collapse.

As he reflected in his book, “Planning in engineering is the conceptual journey from nothing to something. At its core, it blends art and science—art to envision the goal, and science to transform that vision into a structured plan that convinces you, and others, it can be achieved.”

During his work as Planning Manager on the TotalEnergies-led Mozambique LNG project, he coordinated the integrated project schedule across international contractors, multiple time zones, and unpredictable local conditions. To do it successfully, he designed and maintained risk-adjusted progress measurement systems and cost control mechanisms that allowed the project to stay aligned with budget expectations, even amid volatility.

This strategic groundwork resulted in securing the Final Investment Decision, which unlocked a $5 billion U.S. export contract and led to the creation of over 30,000 jobs globally, including more than 16,000 in the United States. He also served as a crucial liaison with high-level stakeholders, from government ministries to LNG buyers and lenders, translating complex technical realities into actionable decisions.

How Planning Future-Proofs Complex Projects

Energy infrastructure must last decades. True resilience comes from rigorous planning, ensuring systems endure long after the original teams move on.

At TotalEnergies’ Mozambique LNG project, Cretu didn’t just build schedules. He built systems that would sustain execution through volatility — and continue supporting performance long after the initial handover. His framework included risk-adjusted progress measurement, integrated cost tracking, and scenario-based scheduling — tools designed not just for day-to-day control, but for long-term clarity.

“You can’t manage a project of that scale by reacting,” says Cretu. “You need to build in the ability to self-correct — like setting the right autopilot before turbulence hits.”

The planning structure he implemented made it possible to onboard new contractors, adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks, and maintain alignment across stakeholders — even amid geopolitical uncertainty. It wasn’t a single act of recovery, but a sustained operational rhythm grounded in foresight.

Planning Synchronizes Global Execution

Modern energy projects don’t happen in one place. They are global undertakings engineered in one region, fabricated in another, and assembled in a third. Without careful coordination, complexity quickly turns into chaos.

Cretu saw this as Project Controls Lead on ExxonMobil’s Sakhalin-2, managing work across three continents. As one of the largest and most logistically complex offshore oil and gas developments in the Russian Far East, the project involved massive modular construction and coordination between global teams. Engineering was based in Houston, fabrication occurred at the DSME yard in South Korea, and the final hook-up took place in Russia’s remote Far East.

“I felt like a conductor,” he says, “bringing together engineers in Texas, welders in South Korea, and offshore crews in the middle of nowhere in Russia — people with completely different ways of working, thinking, even seeing time. My job was to create a rhythm everyone could move to. And when you see these different worlds align around a shared outcome, it’s an incredible feeling.”

Managing this required Cretu to build and maintain detailed execution plans that factored in intercontinental logistics, seasonal weather constraints, shipping timelines, and contractor coordination across languages and legal systems.

Thanks to this planning framework, massive offshore modules were fabricated and delivered on time and within scope — a rare achievement for projects of this scale and complexity. His work enabled smooth commissioning and helped the project meet its key production targets.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/8943001.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 16:59:28.987635

This plant was once known for its relentless solar generation activity. In the secret location, Mojave was recently repurposed to explore better ways of generating solar energy. In this article, we’ll discuss how this transformation came to be, the legacy, and the future goals of this intuitive plant.

Overview of Ivanpah: the idea that brought the solar factory to life

If you grab a piece of a world map and search for the location of the Ivanpah solar plant, you will find that the prestigious company used to be associated with heavy solar generation. It is found in San Bernardino County, near the California-Nevada border. The idea was simple: utilizing the power of concentrated solar power (CSP) technology to concentrate sunlight and generate huge amounts of heat energy.

In the year 2014, when the solar plant fully resumed operations, it was the largest solar thermal plant in the world, carving its name into the fabric of solar infrastructural ingenuity. A project of this scale piqued the interest of several private individuals but also caught the attention of the Department of Energy (DOE). This led to an investment of $1.6 billion in loan agreements with the department. A major key player here is the NRG group, who also contributed about $300 million to the initiative.

Ivanpah solar plant: solar energy generation on steroids

The picture behind this solar plant is simple; it involves utilizing heliostats to generate solar energy on a massive scale. To get a clearer picture, these heliostats are not miniature in size or weight; in fact, their size can be compared to a weighted gate. Getting heliostats of this size and positioning them at the best angle for solar energy generation results in large amounts of heat energy being generated toward tall structures. These tall structures have instruments within them capable of converting water into steam and eventually generating electricity.

The direct beneficiaries of such an innovative initiative are the larger community and rural areas. About 130,000+ homes, to be exact. A direct implication of the initiative is the reduction or complete elimination of carbon emissions into the atmosphere, which causes all sorts of problems for our ozone layer. This problem is much more prominent when it comes to fossil fuel extraction.

The transition from fossil to renewable: how feasible is it?

Regardless of the huge efficiency upgrade while working with CSP systems, a predictable bottleneck the technology faces is the need for an uninterrupted supply of sunlight. While technology can be quite perfect when it’s being worked upon, in the real world, weather conditions are subject to fluctuations. With time, the push for a better solar system became evident because of a growing need to iterate and satisfy.

The Ivanpah solar plant also sparked environmental debate. While it reduced reliance on fossil fuels, the plant caused unintended harm to local wildlife. Birds flying into the concentrated beams were reportedly scorched mid-air—earning the nickname “streamers”—and local desert tortoise populations were disrupted during construction.

Still, Ivanpah’s solar plant legacy is complex. It pushed boundaries, raised critical questions about energy trade-offs, and served as a testing ground for large-scale renewable infrastructure.

The idea behind Ivanpah’s subtle transformation to more efficient methods of solar energy generation is quite simple: bridging the gap between traditional solar energy conversion and rural implementation.

Ivanpah’s story is not just one of innovation but of transformation—of land, technology, and intention. What began as a photovoltaic exploration project evolved into a shimmering beacon of solar potential. And now, as it prepares for partial closure and reinvention, the plant reflects something deeper than sunlight: our changing relationship with the earth beneath us and the energy above.

Hired in May, Hannah Davis will help provide and connect residents to clean energy resources. The three communities are among 58 in the state that were selected to join the 2025 to 2027 Mass Save Community First Partnership, which aims to bring expanded energy services through the help of grant funding.

The three-year, $146,200 grant will fund the position and costs associated with it.

“This grant is really unique in that we are working to support renters, landlords, income-qualified folks — anyone who hasn’t taken advantage of Mass Save energy incentives,” said Davis. “A lot of people tend to think this program is only for high-earning homeowners and that’s not true at all. We’re really trying to get the word out.”

Mass Save is a program that represents the services and resources provided by multiple energy companies with the goal of saving energy for Massachusetts residents, businesses and communities. The collective mission is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The new hire is a part of the local communities’ larger effort to reduce energy use, lower costs, and improve the comfort and health of homes and buildings by offering community members no-cost energy assessments. The assessments identify opportunities for energy savings through insulation, weatherization, and high-efficiency heating and cooling upgrades, including heat pumps.

Davis explained there are three components to a home energy assessment. They assess the need for energy-saving devices, health and safety of heating systems, and potential for weatherization and heating improvements.

“It takes some organizing, convincing and connecting people to all of these resources,” said Ben Weil, director of Climate Action & Project Administration in Northampton. “That is some intensive work that we’re asking Hannah to do, but the payoff is really big because once you do it, you serve a lot of people.”

Davis will work with Mass Save sponsors Berkshire Gas, Eversource and National Grid, who will focus on reaching renters, landlords, non-English speakers, low- and moderate-income households, and small businesses.

In 2024, Mass Save installed 40,000 heat pumps and weatherized more than 55,000 homes in Massachusetts, according to its 2024 annual report. Additionally, energy-efficient programs implemented by the sponsors of Mass Save provided customers with more than $961 million in program incentives in the same year. Homeowners can save an average of 15% on heating and cooling costs, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“The value of this role is it will provide outreach to the residents of the three towns with the value of saving energy and potential to save money through the Mass Save grant,” said Westhampton Town Coordinator Douglas Finn.

Davis will host drop-in hours for residents on the second Tuesday of each month at the Easthampton Public Library, 9 Park St., from 6 to 7 p.m.

On Thursday at 6 p.m., there will be a tabling at Brewster Court in Northampton, between the E.J. Gare Parking Garage and Northampton Brewery. Additionally, Davis will attend and host more events for each town in the coming months.

“The program is layered with a bunch of other services we are trying to put together so that residents of our cities have good access to all the resources they need to make good decisions,” said Weil. “They can find the heat pump and weatherization services that are right for their house.”

,EPA,2025-08-03 17:03:39+00:00,www.weny.com,EPA administrator defends administration's move to revoke 2009 f - WENY News,Not Available,,,,,https://www.weny.com/story/52973035/epa-administrator-defends-administrations-move-to-revoke-2009-finding-pollution-endangers-human-health,"(CNN) — Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Sunday defended the Trump administration’s move to repeal the so-called endangerment finding that planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health.
“To reach the 2009 endangerment finding, they relied on the most pessimistic views of the science.
Many rigorous scientific findings since 2009 have showed both climate pollution and its warming effects are not just harming public health but killing people outright.

So when you read through the 2009 endangerment finding, they say that where there’s silence in the law, there’s gaps that I should just be interpreting that as my own discretion.","(CNN) — Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Sunday defended the Trump administration’s move to repeal the so-called endangerment finding that planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health.

“To reach the 2009 endangerment finding, they relied on the most pessimistic views of the science. The great news is that a lot of the pessimistic views of the science in 2009 that was being assumed ended up not panning out,” Zeldin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We can rely on 2025 facts as opposed to 2009 bad assumptions.”

The 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety, which has served as EPA’s basis for many of its significant regulations aiming to protect the environment and decrease climate pollution. If successful, the repeal could strip away the federal government’s most powerful way to control the country’s planet-warming pollution and fight climate change.

The text of the administration’s proposal to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding said that while greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise in the atmosphere, that rise has been “driven primarily by increased emissions from foreign sources,” and has happened “without producing the degree of adverse impacts to public health and welfare in the United States that the EPA anticipated in the 2009 Endangerment Finding.”

The US is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and historically has emitted more planet-warming pollution than any other country. Many rigorous scientific findings since 2009 have showed both climate pollution and its warming effects are not just harming public health but killing people outright.

In the nearly 16 years since the EPA first issued the Supreme Court-ordered endangerment finding, the world has warmed an additional 0.45 degrees Celsius (or 0.81 degrees Fahrenheit) to 1.4 degrees Celsius, according to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather.

“Both the scientific certainty around climate change and evidence of the dangers it is causing have grown stronger since 2009,” Hausfather said in an email. “There is no evidence that has emerged or been published in the scientific literature in the past 16 years that would in any way challenge the scientific basis of the 2009 endangerment finding.”

Pressed on whether he’s skeptical of the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are the overwhelming driver of man-made climate change, Zeldin said, “That might be your way to try to twist my words.”

The EPA is in a public comment period on its proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles, since they stem from the 2009 finding.

“We’re going through a public comment period. We want to make the right decision afterwards. But for people who want to sum up the 2009 endangerment finding as if they study carbon dioxide as an endangerment on human health, they did not do that,” Zeldin told CNN.

Asked whether the EPA should have a role in trying to combat climate change, Zeldin said that the Supreme Court “made it very clear that I have to follow the law.”

“I have to follow the plain language of the law, and I can’t get creative. So when you read through the 2009 endangerment finding, they say that where there’s silence in the law, there’s gaps that I should just be interpreting that as my own discretion. The Supreme Court has made it very clear that that is not what is a power that I have,” he said, adding that drawing up such a regulation should be left to Congress.",https://CNNWIRE.images.worldnow.com/images/26672871_G.jpg?lastEditedDate=1754226044000,N,,2025-08-03 16:00:00.596051

For decades, the public perception of nuclear power has been extremely poor in the U.S, following three nuclear disasters at Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island.
These incidents have led international and national nuclear regulators to employ stringent safety standards and assess new nuclear projects thoroughly before approval.
In recent years, largely thanks to the strict regulations and the safe running of nuclear power plants around the world for several decades, public perception has once again shifted in favour of nuclear power.
The NRC has since responded to Trump’s recent executive orders concerning nuclear power.","The President of the United States, Donald Trump, is betting big on nuclear power and aims to fast-track projects to prepare for the massive increase in electricity demand over the next decade. However, experts fear that his plans to accelerate project development could compromise safety standards, particularly as the independent U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission comes under threat.

In May, the Trump administration announced a target to deploy 300 GW of net new nuclear capacity by 2050 to quadruple domestic nuclear power, as well as to begin construction on 10 large reactors by 2030 and expand domestic nuclear fuel production. Trump signed three executive orders to support these aims: Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Deployment of Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security; and Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy.

Trump’s orders establish arbitrary deadlines for decisions on construction permits and operating licenses, even for new designs that have not yet been assessed; demand a review of all NRC regulations within 18 months; and allow for the construction of nuclear reactors on federal lands without NRC review.

While deploying more nuclear power could help the U.S. respond to the rising domestic electricity demand, there are widespread concerns that President Trump’s rapid approval of new nuclear projects threatens to weaken the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which assesses projects for health and safety and ensures reactors operate securely. The objective of Trump’s executive orders is to reduce regulations and accelerate the approval of nuclear plants by overhauling the NRC.

Trump has said that he believes the NRC is too risk-averse and has blamed the agency for the how few nuclear plants have been constructed in the U.S. over the last 30 years. He stated in one executive order that the NRC is overly focused on protecting the public from “the most remote risks,” suggesting that such a cautious approach to approving nuclear facilities limits access to reliable electricity. During one press conference in July, Trump said, “We’ll be very safe, but we’ll be fast and safe,” about nuclear plant development. He added that his administration will get a “whole different group of people” to regulate the industry.

However, several former chairs from the NRC have told reporters that the prohibitive cost of building new nuclear plants is to blame for the slow sectoral development, rather than the strict safety standards of the agency. Just two new reactors have been constructed in the U.S. in the last three decades, both of which are at Plant Vogtle in Georgia. Building these reactors cost $18 billion more than originally anticipated and took seven years longer. Meanwhile, two reactors in South Carolina were cancelled in 2017 due to the higher-than-expected price of construction. The nuclear company Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy following several failings in the development of these projects.

For decades, the public perception of nuclear power has been extremely poor in the U.S, following three nuclear disasters at Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island. These incidents have led international and national nuclear regulators to employ stringent safety standards and assess new nuclear projects thoroughly before approval.

The NRC has overseen the sector for 50 years without a single civilian reactor radiation-related death. In recent years, largely thanks to the strict regulations and the safe running of nuclear power plants around the world for several decades, public perception has once again shifted in favour of nuclear power.

However, reducing the powers of the independent nuclear regulatory commission in the U.S. could undermine the safety standards of the industry and spur greater public backlash when developing new projects. In June, Trump fired the NRC chairman, Christopher Hanson, as part of his bid to take away authority from the agency. Hanson said that Trump terminated his role as chairman without cause, contrary to existing law and longstanding precedent regarding the removal of independent agency appointees.”

As part of the shake-up, Adam Blake, a Department of Government Efficiency representative, reportedly told the NRC’s chair that the agency will be expected to give “rubber-stamp” approval to new reactors tested by the departments of Energy or Defence, during a meeting in May.

The NRC has since responded to Trump’s recent executive orders concerning nuclear power. “The NRC is working quickly to implement the executive orders reforming the agency and modernising our regulatory and licensing processes,” said NRC spokesperson Maureen Conley. “We look forward to continuing to work with the administration, Department of Energy and Department of Defence on future nuclear programmes.”

Weakening the powers of the independent NRC to give greater control to the government’s Department of Energy and Defence undermines the stringent safety standards that were previously enforced for the development and running of nuclear plants. At worst, this could lead to another nuclear disaster, which could jeopardise the health, or even lives, of people across the U.S.

The report shows how far we have come in the decade since the Paris Agreement sparked a clean energy revolution.
Of course, the fossil fuel lobby of some fossil fuel companies will try — and we know the lengths to which they will go.

(Excerpts of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ remarks on Climate Action ‘A Moment of Opportunity: Supercharging the Clean Energy Age’ on 22 July 2025.)","The headlines are dominated by a world in trouble. By conflict and climate chaos. By rising human suffering. By growing geo-political divides. But amid the turmoil, another story is being written. And its implications will be profound.

Throughout history, energy has shaped the destiny of humankind — from mastering fire, to harnessing steam, to splitting the atom. Now, we are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age.

Just follow the money. $2 trillion went into clean energy last year — that’s $800 billion more than fossil fuels, and up almost 70 percent in ten years. And new data released today from the International Renewable Energy Agency shows that solar — not so long ago four times the cost of fossil fuels — is now 41 percent cheaper. Offshore wind — 53 percent. And over 90 percent of new renewables worldwide produced electricity for less than the cheapest new fossil fuel alternative.

This is not just a shift in power. This is a shift in possibility. Yes, in repairing our relationship with the climate.

Already, the carbon emissions saved by solar and wind globally are almost equivalent to what the whole European Union produces in a year. But this transformation is fundamentally about energy security and people’s security. It’s about smart economics. Decent jobs, public health, advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. And delivering clean and affordable energy to everyone, everywhere.

Today, we are releasing a special report with the support of UN agencies and partners — the International Energy Agency, the IMF, IRENA, the OECD and the World Bank. The report shows how far we have come in the decade since the Paris Agreement sparked a clean energy revolution. And it highlights the vast benefits — and actions needed — to accelerate a just transition globally.

Renewables already nearly match fossil fuels in global installed power capacity. And that’s just the beginning. Last year, almost all the new power capacity built came from renewables. And every continent on Earth added more renewables capacity than fossil fuels. The clean energy future is no longer a promise. It’s a fact. No government. No industry. No special interest can stop it.

Of course, the fossil fuel lobby of some fossil fuel companies will try — and we know the lengths to which they will go. But I have never been more confident that they will fail — because we have passed the point of no return. For three powerful reasons.

First, market economics.

For decades, emissions and economic growth rose together. No more. In many advanced economies, emissions have peaked, but growth continues.

In 2023 alone, clean energy sectors drove 10 percent of global GDP growth. In India, 5 percent. The United States, 6 percent. China — a leader in the energy transition — 20 percent. And in the European Union, nearly 33 percent.

And clean energy sector jobs now outnumber fossil fuel jobs — employing almost 35 million people worldwide.

Even Texas — the heart of the American fossil fuel industry — now leads the US in renewables. Why? Because it makes economic sense.

And yet fossil fuels still enjoy a 9 to 1 advantage in consumption subsidies globally — a clear market distortion. Add to that the unaccounted costs of climate damages on people and planet — and the distortion is even greater. Countries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies — they are sabotaging them. Driving up costs. Undermining competitiveness. Locking-in stranded assets. And missing the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century.

Second — renewables are here to stay because they are the foundation of energy security and sovereignty.

Let’s be clear: The greatest threat to energy security today is in fossil fuels. They leave economies and people at the mercy of price shocks, supply disruptions, and geopolitical turmoil. Just look at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A war in Europe led to a global energy crisis. Oil and gas prices soared. Electricity and food bills followed.

In 2022, average households around the world saw energy costs jump 20 percent.

Modern and competitive economies need stable, affordable energy. Renewables offer both. There are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargoes on wind. Renewables can put power — literally and figuratively — in the hands of people and governments. And almost every nation has enough sun, wind, or water to become energy self-sufficient.

Renewables mean real energy security. Real energy sovereignty. And real freedom from fossil-fuel volatility.

The third and final reason why there is no going back on renewables: Easy access.

You can’t build a coal plant in someone’s backyard. But you can deliver solar panels to the most remote village on earth. Solar and wind can be deployed faster, cheaper and more flexibly than fossil fuels ever could. And while nuclear will be part of the global energy mix, it can never fill the access gaps.

All of this is a game-changer for the hundreds of millions of people still living without electricity — most of them in Africa, a continent bursting with renewable potential. By 2040, Africa could generate 10 times more electricity than it needs — entirely from renewables. We are already seeing small-scale and off-grid renewable technologies lighting homes, and powering schools and businesses in remote areas.

And in places like Pakistan for example, people-power is fueling a solar surge — consumers are driving the clean energy boom.

The energy transition is unstoppable. But the transition is not yet fast enough or fair enough.

OECD countries and China account for 80 percent of renewable power capacity installed worldwide. Brazil and India make up nearly 10 percent. Africa — just 1.5 percent.

Fermi America has signed a memorandum of understanding with Hyundai Engineering & Construction (Hyundai E&C) to design and build the nuclear portion of a large-scale private energy infrastructure project aimed at powering next-generation artificial intelligence in Texas. The facility, called HyperGrid, will be built near Amarillo and developed in collaboration with the Texas Tech University system.

According to the plan, HyperGrid will be the first private campus in the United States to combine multiple energy sources simultaneously: the largest private nuclear complex in the country, the most powerful combined-cycle gas turbine power plant, plus solar panels, batteries, and an external power grid. Almost all of the electricity produced, approximately 1 GW, will be consumed directly on the data centers’ premises, without being fed into the general power grid.

The key component of the project is four Westinghouse AP1000 pressurized water reactors. On June 17, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a combined construction and operation license, which Fermi America called a record-breaking decision. Construction of the nuclear “island” is scheduled to begin next year, with the first reactor expected to be operational in 2032.

The memorandum provides for Hyundai E&C’s participation in all phases of the life cycle, from design and engineering planning to the signing of the equipment supply and construction (EPC) contract. The parties plan to complete the development of all work packages and sign the EPC agreement by the end of 2025. Fermi America co-founder Toby Neugebauer noted, “America can’t afford to be a hands-on player: we need experienced partners, and Hyundai has already proven it can build safe and clean nuclear power plants.”

For Hyundai E&C, this project represents a strategic entry into the US energy market, which is currently experiencing a surge in interest in nuclear generation. Company representatives emphasized that participation in HyperGrid gives them access to promising early-stage projects and creates the conditions to participate in the creation of the world’s largest integrated power and computing complex using multiple energy sources.

Looking ahead, Hyundai intends to use this collaboration as a springboard to expand its presence in the nuclear power segment. new energy solutions not only in the United States, but also in other countries, while strengthening its technological and competitive base.

The architecture chosen for the complex, which combines baseload nuclear generation, flexible gas turbines, and intermittent renewable energy sources, is becoming increasingly relevant for industrial customers with 24/7 consumption. This solution helps offset the volatility of wholesale energy market prices and reduces dependence on regulatory restrictions on carbon emissions.

The investment in HyperGrid reflects a broader trend: a structural shift in US energy consumption. For the first time in two decades, rising industrial production, data center growth, and infrastructure electrification have reversed the trend, with annual demand growth now exceeding 3% and expected to continue through 2040, according to McKinsey’s Energy Report 2025.

The Trump administration has barred US government scientists from contributing to the next IPCC report, due in 2029.
Climate impacts are already visible Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said the effects of climate change are no longer theoretical.","Over the past four presidencies, the United States has repeatedly shifted its position on the Paris climate agreement—alternating between joining and withdrawing. But in his second term, President Donald Trump isn’t merely questioning climate science; his administration is actively working to dismantle the federal government’s ability to respond to climate change at all.

These efforts go far beyond Trump’s familiar opposition to renewable energy and his push for more oil drilling, as put forward by a recent CNN article. Despite the US already being the world’s top oil producer, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) this week announced a plan to revoke the ""endangerment finding""—a foundational declaration made in 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions threaten human health.

As the paper points out, eliminating this finding would strip the EPA of its authority to regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act, undermining nearly all climate-related regulations. It’s a sweeping move—one of many. Other actions include:

-Reversing previous efforts to move away from coal. Trump has signed executive orders to support the coal industry and directed the EPA to lift limits on pollution from coal and gas plants.

-Ending federal tax credits for electric vehicles, which had survived during Trump’s first term and were later expanded under President Joe Biden. Republicans now plan to terminate them as early as next month.

-Dismantling Biden-era incentives that promoted renewable energy projects—ironically driving up electricity costs.

-Stripping California of its authority to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars starting in 2035, through legislation passed by Trump and congressional Republicans.

-Preparing to overturn federal tailpipe emissions standards set by Biden’s EPA, while also targeting California’s ability to set its own emissions rules.

-Firing the authors of the National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated climate report, and scrubbing past versions from federal websites.

-Declining to participate in a major international climate summit later this year in Brazil, forgoing any leadership role in global climate talks.

-Cutting federal staff focused on climate policy and science.

While all of the above are already cause for concern, the article warns that the attempt to undo the endangerment finding that may prove the most consequential. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin—a former congressman with no significant environmental background and a strong loyalty to Trump—called it the “largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

To climate skeptics, that’s a cause for celebration. To others, it’s alarming. Zeldin has openly framed his mission not as environmental protection but as freeing businesses from regulation.

The justification for the EPA's move is a climate report commissioned by the administration and authored by five known climate skeptics. Titled "" Titled ""A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the US Climate"" and published on July 23, it was commissioned by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who generated his wealth in the fracking industry.

In the report’s preface, Wright concedes that climate change is real but downplays its urgency: “It is not the greatest threat facing humanity. That distinction belongs to global energy poverty.” In other words, he argues that cutting emissions may do more harm than good—an outlier view in the scientific community.

Mainstream science, including reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), presents overwhelming peer-reviewed evidence of the dangers posed by unchecked emissions. The Trump administration has barred US government scientists from contributing to the next IPCC report, due in 2029.

Climate impacts are already visible

Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said the effects of climate change are no longer theoretical.

“The impacts have become part of everyday life,” Dykes explained. “They’re happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.”

By declaring that greenhouse gas emissions are not a danger to human health, the administration is essentially shifting the burden of climate change onto local governments and communities.

“This is abandoning our residents to bear the full cost of climate change—health risks, infrastructure damage, and increasingly extreme weather,” Dykes said, noting rising threats like heatwaves, drought, wildfires, and flooding.

Andrew Dessler, director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M University, dismissed the EPA’s new climate report as a legal argument—not a scientific one.

“The goal is not to evaluate the evidence fairly, but to make the strongest possible case for carbon dioxide’s innocence,” he said. “That’s not science.”

Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, warned that the move could reverse decades of public health gains. “Tens of thousands of Americans die each year from particulate pollution. That number has dropped as we’ve moved away from coal—but the Trump administration is set to reverse that trend.”

Michael Mann, director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media, described the situation in stark terms: “Not since Stalin’s Soviet Union and Lysenkoism have we seen such an overt effort to distort science for ideological ends,” referring to disastrous effects that the Moscow administration’s political interference in the scientific process had across the Union.

PwC argued that without sufficient local manufacturing capacity, an abrupt ban could severely disrupt off-grid electrification programmes and reverse gains in expanding energy access to underserved communities.
To ensure a smooth transition to local manufacturing, PwC recommended a comprehensive package of fiscal and infrastructure incentives.
“Beyond fiscal incentives, Nigeria must streamline regulatory approvals, strengthen inter-agency coordination, and address infrastructural bottlenecks that currently hinder industrial growth,” said Emeka Chime, Associate Director, Tax and Regulatory Services at PwC Nigeria.

In a recent policy analysis, the advisory firm recommended a phased reduction in imports over a three to five-year period instead of a sudden restriction. PwC argued that without sufficient local manufacturing capacity, an abrupt ban could severely disrupt off-grid electrification programmes and reverse gains in expanding energy access to underserved communities.

“An abrupt policy shift risks triggering severe supply constraints, escalating the cost of solar technologies, and making clean energy inaccessible for many Nigerians,” said Bimbola Banjo, Partner, Energy, Utilities and Resources at PwC Nigeria. “A phased approach, involving import quotas, progressive tariffs, and blended procurement models, offers a more sustainable pathway to industrialisation.”

The import restriction policy—proposed by the Ministry of Science and Technology—aims to encourage local production, reduce reliance on foreign technology, and boost job creation in the manufacturing sector.

However, PwC warned that Nigeria’s current manufacturing infrastructure lacks the scale, technological capacity, and quality control systems necessary to replace imports in the short term.

The report also highlighted the urgent need for workforce development. PwC called for the creation of a national renewable energy skills framework, supported through partnerships with universities, technical institutions, and research bodies, to ensure a skilled labour pool capable of driving a local manufacturing ecosystem.

Investor confidence, the firm added, could also be jeopardised by unclear policy timelines, standards, and exemption rules. PwC noted that such uncertainty may undermine the business models of mini-grid developers and clean energy startups, threatening much-needed capital inflows into the sector.

“A sudden restriction without a parallel support mechanism will disrupt supply chains, stall project deployments, and deter investment in Nigeria’s renewable energy sector,” said Godson Ikiebey, Senior Manager, Sustainability and Climate Change at PwC Nigeria.

To ensure a smooth transition to local manufacturing, PwC recommended a comprehensive package of fiscal and infrastructure incentives. These include expanded tax holidays, customs waivers, concessional finance facilities, and the development of renewable energy industrial zones to provide manufacturers with access to shared infrastructure and efficient transport logistics.

“Beyond fiscal incentives, Nigeria must streamline regulatory approvals, strengthen inter-agency coordination, and address infrastructural bottlenecks that currently hinder industrial growth,” said Emeka Chime, Associate Director, Tax and Regulatory Services at PwC Nigeria.

Quality assurance was also highlighted as a priority. PwC urged the Standards Organisation of Nigeria, Nigeria Electricity Management Service Agency, and Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission to adopt internationally aligned certification standards to protect consumers and build trust in locally manufactured solar products.

To monitor policy outcomes and ensure transparency, PwC recommended the establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation framework. Key indicators such as local production volumes, job creation, and cost reductions should be tracked regularly to guide policy adjustments and maintain alignment with Nigeria’s clean energy goals.

“Industrialisation and energy access must be pursued in tandem. A phased approach, backed by strategic incentives and rigorous quality standards, will enable Nigeria to develop a robust solar manufacturing ecosystem without compromising its electrification ambitions,” Banjo added.

PwC concluded that while the Federal Government’s objective of localising solar panel production is laudable, a carefully sequenced and stakeholder-aligned implementation plan is critical to ensuring the policy does not inadvertently hinder Nigeria’s energy transition efforts.",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pricewaterhousecoopers-pwc.png,N,,2025-08-03 14:01:22.940567

Overweight Energy Equipment & Services: Position in companies with expertise in refinery maintenance, offshore drilling, and carbon capture technologies.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a seismic shift in the energy landscape in June 2025, as gasoline production plummeted by 491,000 barrels per day—its largest decline since the 2020 pandemic. This abrupt drop, driven by Hurricane Idella's devastation of Texas and Louisiana refineries, has created a stark divide between two critical sectors: Energy Equipment & Services and Automobiles. For investors, the fallout offers a textbook example of how supply-side shocks reshape market dynamics and underscore the importance of sector rotation.

The Energy Equipment & Services Surge

The collapse in gasoline production has directly fueled demand for infrastructure repair and modernization. Refineries like ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge and Shell's Deer Park, which operated at 20% capacity post-storm, require urgent maintenance and retrofitting. This has boosted Energy Equipment & Services firms such as Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BKR), whose shares rose 4–6% in the aftermath. The 1.2% jump in crude oil prices to $68 per barrel further amplifies this trend, as higher oil prices incentivize investment in drilling and refining technologies.

Historical backtests confirm this pattern. During past gasoline production shocks, Energy Equipment & Services stocks have consistently outperformed, with gains sustained over a 57-day period. For example, reveals a clear upward trajectory, reflecting their role in addressing supply chain bottlenecks. This sector's resilience stems from its direct alignment with crisis-driven demand: aging infrastructure, rising oil prices, and geopolitical risks all create a tailwind for companies that service the energy sector.

The Automobile Sector's Struggle

Conversely, the Automobile sector has borne the brunt of the gasoline crisis. As fuel prices surged—U.S. regular gasoline hit $3.123 per gallon in mid-July—consumer spending on fuel-intensive vehicles has waned. Ford (F) and Toyota (TM) saw their shares decline by 2–3%, mirroring broader industry concerns. The backtest data reinforces this: Automobiles experienced negative returns over 25 days following a production shock, with illustrating the sector's vulnerability.

The link between fuel costs and auto sales is well-documented. Higher gasoline prices tighten household budgets, reducing discretionary spending on new vehicles. This dynamic is compounded by the sector's long-term exposure to electric vehicle (EV) adoption and regulatory pressures, which further erode margins in a high-cost environment.

Macro Implications and Investment Strategy

The gasoline production collapse has broader macroeconomic ramifications. While the Federal Reserve may remain cautious—given the supply-driven nature of the disruption—investors must navigate the resulting sectoral divergence. Energy Equipment & Services firms benefit from a virtuous cycle: higher oil prices → increased demand for drilling and refining equipment → stronger earnings. Meanwhile, Automobiles face a double whammy: elevated fuel costs and shifting consumer preferences toward EVs.

For actionable strategies, consider the following:

1. Overweight Energy Equipment & Services: Position in companies with expertise in refinery maintenance, offshore drilling, and carbon capture technologies. These firms are poised to capitalize on infrastructure upgrades and rising oil prices.

2. Underweight Automobiles: Until gasoline prices stabilize, automakers remain exposed to demand volatility. However, EV-focused subsectors (e.g., battery manufacturers) may offer partial insulation.

3. Monitor EIA and Geopolitical Developments: The August EIA reports will be critical in assessing production recovery. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions could extend the tailwinds for Energy Equipment.

Conclusion

The June 2025 gasoline production shock is a microcosm of how energy market volatility reshapes industry fortunes. Energy Equipment & Services, with its crisis-driven growth, contrasts sharply with the Automobile sector's fuel-cost sensitivity. Investors who recognize this divide and act accordingly—leveraging backtest insights and sectoral trends—can navigate the current landscape with strategic clarity. As the EIA's next reports roll in, the key will be balancing short-term volatility with long-term sectoral realignment.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 13:03:20.191734

Proteus was established following a 2022 management buyout of Simec Atlantis Energy’s tidal energy division.
As Japan expands its renewable energy mix and reduces reliance on fossil fuels, predictable sources like tidal energy will be essential in securing a stable, sustainable energy future.
Proteus and KME are now assessing further tidal energy deployment opportunities in Japan.","A tidal energy turbine has landed in the ocean. UK-based tidal energy company, Proteus Marine Renewables’ (PMR) 1.1 MW tidal energy turbine, the AR1100, has received certification from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), confirming the system meets national standards for grid-connected power generation. The turbine is now operational and delivering electricity to the Japanese national grid.

A 1 kW system lands in the ocean

Proteus Marine Renewables has deployed the AR1100 tidal turbine in Japan, which became the country’s first ever megawatt-scale grid connected tidal energy system.

Installed in the Naru Strait, the turbine will generate 1.1 MW of clean energy, accelerating the decarbonization of the Goto Islands’ electricity supply and advancing Japan’s renewable energy transition.

Building on the success of the AR500 pilot project in 2021, where a 500 kW device operated in the Naru Strait maintaining a 97% turbine availability, Proteus signed an equipment supply and works contract with Kyuden Mirai Energy (KME) in November 2022 to upgrade the device to 1.1 MW capacity.

Leveraging its modular architecture, Proteus enhanced its existing turbine’s performance and efficiency by integrating advanced pitch and yaw systems, along with other improvements to achieve a 1.1 MW rating.

The deployment, carried out by local vessels and resources under the supervision of the Proteus Offshore Services team, was made possible through the collaboration and expertise of key partners and suppliers in Japan.

Proteus was established following a 2022 management buyout of Simec Atlantis Energy’s tidal energy division.

According to Philip Archer, Managing Director of Proteus Operations Japan: “Deploying the AR1100 in Japan is a testament to the dedication and expertise of our team working in collaboration with local professionals. The result reinforces tidal energy’s potential as a dependable renewable source in Japan. Our next immediate focus is the commissioning of the turbine, Japan’s first ever MW-scale grid connected tidal system, and the subsequent testing and accreditation phase.”

Drew Blaxland, CEO of Proteus added: “With operational turbines in both the United Kingdom and Japan, we are proving the scalability of tidal energy as a viable power source for coastal communities. As Japan expands its renewable energy mix and reduces reliance on fossil fuels, predictable sources like tidal energy will be essential in securing a stable, sustainable energy future. Proteus remains at the forefront of this transition, bringing proven solutions to new markets.”

A system which is designed for optimal efficiency in tidal currents

The AR1100 tidal turbine features a horizontal-axis rotor with three advanced composite blades, designed for optimal efficiency in tidal currents. The blade angles are independently controlled by electromechanical pitch systems housed in the turbine hub, allowing for real-time control for maximum energy capture and to minimize hydrodynamic loads.

The device incorporates a drivetrain which transmits the mechanical power extracted at the rotor through to a permanent magnet generator.

A state of the art electrically actuated, hydraulic locking yaw mechanism is used to rotate the nacelle so that the rotor faces the oncoming tidal flow as it reverses direction four times a day.

The tidal turbine is mounted on a gravity-based support structure and connected to shore via a subsea cable, transmitting power directly to an onshore station, where it is converted for grid distribution.

Receiving approval from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)

According to Drew Blaxland: “Receiving METI certification is a major milestone – not only for Proteus, but for tidal energy in Japan. It confirms the AR1100 series 2’s compliance with Japan’s rigorous safety and technical standards and demonstrates that tidal power is now a viable, scalable solution for clean electricity generation.”

The project was carried out in partnership with Kyuden Mirai Energy (KME), the representative firm behind the deployment. Proteus and KME are now assessing further tidal energy deployment opportunities in Japan. Philip Archer, adds: “We’ve operated in Japanese waters before, so we know just how demanding the conditions can be.”

On July 29, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced a formal proposal to rescind the greenhouse gas endangerment finding.
Zeldin claimed that measures aimed at curbing emissions are more harmful than the climate change impacts stemming from these emissions.
The US is currently the world’s second-largest emitter of climate pollution and the largest historical emitter.
Along with rescinding the endangerment finding, the EPA is also proposing to eliminate greenhouse gas emission standards for motor vehicles.","The Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump is following through on a plan that will revoke its primary authority to control the greenhouse gas emissions that endanger human health and welfare. The move, if it succeeds, represents a major blow to the global effort to act on runaway climate change just as rates of extreme weather, biodiversity loss, and glacier melting accelerate.

On July 29, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced a formal proposal to rescind the greenhouse gas endangerment finding. Zeldin claimed that measures aimed at curbing emissions are more harmful than the climate change impacts stemming from these emissions. The rollback proposal also cites a new Department of Energy report authored by climate contrarians who question the scientific consensus on the causes and dangers of unchecked global heating.

“As if any doubt remained, the Trump administration has formalized climate denial as the official policy of the United States government,” Sierra Club acting executive director Loren Blackford said in a statement. “If approved, rescinding the endangerment finding would strike a decisive blow to the EPA’s authority to limit deadly greenhouse gas emissions and protect our people and our planet from the very worst of the climate crisis.”

The endangerment finding was issued under the Obama administration in 2009 and serves as the legal underpinning for the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions such as CO2. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act, which then triggered the EPA’s obligation to make a science-based determination as to whether they endanger public health and welfare. The finding was the result of an exhaustive examination of peer-reviewed studies and scientific literature going back decades.

Now, the EPA under Trump is arguing that the finding lacks legal and scientific justification. When the finding was made in 2009, the EPA “unreasonably analyzed the scientific record,” Zeldin’s proposal asserts. It also claims that the EPA does not have the legal authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions based on concerns about global climate change, arguing that the US contribution to the problem is minimal. The US is currently the world’s second-largest emitter of climate pollution and the largest historical emitter.

Along with rescinding the endangerment finding, the EPA is also proposing to eliminate greenhouse gas emission standards for motor vehicles. The transportation sector is the biggest source of these planet-warming emissions in the US. Last year, the Biden administration finalized the strongest-ever rules to curb climate pollution from vehicles—an action that was expected to slash more than 7 billion tons of carbon emissions by 2055, avoid thousands of premature deaths, and yield nearly $100 billion in annual net benefits through reduced fuel and maintenance costs and public health cost savings.

“If EPA dismantles essential standards to clean up vehicle pollution, the agency is giving its blessing to more pollution that will lead to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and premature deaths that could have been prevented.""

Republican politicians and industry critics have characterized the regulations as an electric vehicle mandate, though the rules do not impose technology mandates on any particular vehicle sales. The American Petroleum Institute cheered the agency’s proposal to eliminate vehicle emissions standards, calling the Biden administration’s tailpipe rules “costly and unrealistic.”

But public health and environmental advocates say the rollbacks will sicken and kill more Americans and amount to political favors bestowed upon the oil industry.

“If EPA dismantles essential standards to clean up vehicle pollution, the agency is giving its blessing to more pollution that will lead to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and premature deaths that could have been prevented,” said Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association.

“This proposal to get rid of all greenhouse gas standards will mean more pollution that Americans experience,” Peter Zalzal, associate vice president for clean air strategies at Environmental Defense Fund, said during a teleconference. An EDF analysis of the impacts of the proposed rollbacks found that it would lead to at least 10 billion tons of additional climate pollution through 2055, at least 12,000 more premature deaths, and 8.5 million more asthma attacks.

Repealing the motor vehicle emissions standards will also cede US leadership in the $10 trillion global clean transportation market and will lead to higher prices for consumers in terms of vehicle fuel costs, experts say. “In the regulatory impact analysis that accompanied the proposal, EPA reveals that their proposal will increase gas prices by nearly 75 cents a gallon,” Josh Berman, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, told Sierra.

Back in March, Zeldin announced his intention to rescind the endangerment finding, along with all EPA regulations that have followed from that finding—including limits on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and power plants—plus other rules pertaining to air and water pollution. In that announcement, Zeldin said that the EPA will “follow the science, the law, and common sense wherever it leads, and we will do so while advancing our commitment towards helping to deliver cleaner, healthier, and safer air, land, and water.”

Scientific analysis going back decades has unambiguously shown that greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are heating up the earth’s climate systems, resulting in severe and widespread impacts such as more extreme weather disasters, species extinction, adverse health effects, and damage to ecosystems, infrastructure, and properties. The US Fifth National Climate Assessment report states, “Without rapid and deep reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, the risks of accelerating sea level rise, intensifying extreme weather, and other harmful climate impacts will continue to grow. Each additional increment of warming is expected to lead to more damage and greater economic losses compared to previous increments of warming, while the risk of catastrophic or unforeseen consequences also increases.”

To help support the EPA’s actions, the Department of Energy issued a report attempting to contest the underlying science of climate change. Energy Secretary Chris Wright handpicked the five scientific and economic experts who authored the report.

“I can’t think of anymore more qualified to present antiscientific climate denial propaganda than these five,” climate scientist Michael Mann, distinguished professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania, said in a social media post. “And I can't think of anyone more likely to seek out these fossil fuel apologists than Christopher Wright.”

Critics of the EPA’s proposal to revoke the endangerment finding say that the move is completely contrary to science, law, and reality.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-03 13:02:40.800549

How big is the mega dam?
When completed, the project will overtake the Three Gorges Dam as the world’s largest hydropower dam.
The Yarlung Tsangpo flows south into India, where it becomes the Brahmaputra River, then flows into Bangladesh.
India fears the potential weaponisation of water by China, which could use the dam to cause floods or induce droughts.","China breaks ground on what Premier Li Qiang has called the “project of the century”, but some fear a water conflict and ecological effects.

On the eastern rim of the Tibetan plateau, China envisions a future powered by the roaring waters of the Yarlung Tsangpo, also known as the Brahmaputra. The river will be the site of a mega dam — the world’s most ambitious to date — that promises to bring clean energy, jobs, infrastructure and prosperity to the region.

Construction on the world’s largest hydropower dam began on Saturday, according to Premier Li Qiang, who called it the “project of the century”.

But the project is not just about electricity and economic benefits – the stakes are far higher. Regional security, ecological stability and the future of one of Asia’s great rivers all hang in the balance.

How big is the mega dam?

The dam will be situated in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo, where a section drops 2000 metres (6562 feet) over a 50km (31 miles) stretch, creating immense hydropower potential. The dam is reportedly located in Medog, a remote county in the city of Nyingchi in the Tibet autonomous region.

When completed, the project will overtake the Three Gorges Dam as the world’s largest hydropower dam. It could generate three times more energy with five cascade hydropower stations – an estimated annual capacity of 300 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, more than Britain’s total annual power output.

It is estimated to cost about 1.2 trillion yuan (US$167 billion), dwarfing many of the biggest infrastructure undertakings in modern history at about five times the cost of the Three Gorges Dam and even more expensive than the International Space Station.

Why is it important?

The project was first announced in 2020 under China’s five-year plan as part of a broader strategy to exploit the hydropower potential of the Tibetan Plateau, with feasibility studies dating back to the 1980s. Beijing authorised the dam’s construction in December 2024.

China is the world’s top hydropower producer, but it “is fast running out of rivers to dam”, which makes the Yarlung Tsangpo “the final frontier” for large-scale expansion, according to Trivium China, a China-focused research firm.

The Chinese Government sees the project as a national strategy with major significance for Tibet’s development and China’s clean energy targets.

By tapping into the river’s vast hydropower potential and integrating surrounding solar and wind resources, China aims to establish a clean energy hub in the region, stabilising the grid while reducing reliance on coal. This aligns with Beijing’s green energy goals and 2060 carbon neutrality targets, according to state media.

The project is also expected to boost local employment, infrastructure and livelihoods in Tibet while prioritising ecological protection through rigorous geological surveys and environmental monitoring, according to official media.

“Beyond energy security, policymakers likely also have state-building on the mind. The mega dam will anchor an unprecedented wave of industrial and infrastructure investment in Tibet – deepening Beijing’s control over the politically sensitive region,” Trivium China said on its website on Monday.

What is at stake, and why is India anxious?

The Yarlung Tsangpo flows south into India, where it becomes the Brahmaputra River, then flows into Bangladesh. Both South Asian nations have raised concerns about downstream implications of a water conflict, which could potentially affect millions of people who depend on the river for agriculture, fisheries and daily consumption.

The river flows through Arunachal Pradesh, known in China as Zangnan – a territory claimed by both China and India. New Delhi views the project as a possible means for Beijing to project power and exert control over water resources for strategic and economic advantage. India fears the potential weaponisation of water by China, which could use the dam to cause floods or induce droughts.

Earlier this month, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu described the mega dam project as a ticking “water bomb” and said downstream Indian waters could “dry up considerably” once the dam was completed.

Observers have also raised concerns about population displacement and risks to one of the richest and most diverse environments on the plateau. Chinese authorities did not disclose how many people were likely to be displaced.

Tibetan groups have reportedly noted the presence of sacred sites along the river.

China asserts that the project has undergone rigorous scientific evaluation and will not adversely affect the environment, geological stability, or water resource rights of downstream countries. Beijing has also emphasised that it will not try to benefit at the “expense of its neighbours”.

The area where the dam is being built sits atop the Indian-Eurasian tectonic boundary, a seismically active zone, making it prone to earthquakes and leaving little margin for engineering error. Experts said it could take at least a decade to build the dam because of the technical challenges. The dam is expected to begin operations in the 2030s.

""This agreement marks another milestone as we grow our battery energy storage footprint,"" noted Matrix Renewables Chief Commercial Officer Chris Matthew, per PR Newswire.

Matrix Renewables and Pioneer view the partnership as a way to increase the reliability of clean power in California, making sure there is a sufficient energy supply that meets demand. The agreement supports low-cost, clean energy that the community can count on.

According to PR Newswire, Vice Chair of Pioneer Community Energy's Board of Directors and Rocklin City Councilmember Greg Janda said, ""Pioneer is proud to partner with Matrix Renewables to secure clean power that increases reliability for the California power grid.""

California's natural and man-made disasters, such as wildfires and extreme weather patterns that are linked to the planet's warming, have made some areas particularly susceptible to power outages. This battery technology can help restore power from clean energy sources faster, helping with sustainability goals.

This can benefit the companies, the area, the residents, and the planet as a whole, reducing pollution that would be produced by other energy sources. This has a positive impact on human health and the environment.

The press release reported that Matrix Renewables' portfolio consists of more than 8.9 GW of renewable energy and battery storage projects in operation and development, and that solar power, battery storage, and green hydrogen project capacity surpasses 15.5 GW globally. This contract with Pioneer is a positive step toward expanding their portfolio and diversifying clean energy.

Sweden’s carbon emissions rose by 7 percent last year, breaking a long trend, largely due to the government’s dropping of regulations requiring biofuel blending in gasoline.","Five years after the European Union vowed to lead the creation of the “first climate neutral continent” by 2050, and pledged at least a trillion euros to that effort, a long list of organizations, companies and agencies are accusing the EU of rolling back its European Green Deal with deregulation. Controversial proposals also include carbon offsets,loopholes in its emissions targets and delays of important efforts to reduce deforestation and make cleaner cars. Some critics have gone so far as to argue that the 27-nation union, the world’s third-largest carbon emitter, is now starting to mirror, rather than counter, the dismantling of climate efforts in the U.S.

Part of the explanation for the EU’s retreat on climate can be found in Sweden. For decades the small northern country pushed Europe’s climate ambitions upward, but today, Sweden is falling back from its environmental progress. Last year, its fossil fuel emissions saw their biggest increase in 15 years. During that time period, carbon uptake by its vast forests have halved. And since the country swung to the right in its last general election, the government has slashed its investments in climate action. Researchers say Sweden’s policy shifts, and its evolving role as a frontrunner, is now contributing to the weakening of Europe’s climate agenda.

In recent months, numerous institutions have criticized Sweden’s environmental retreat. In March, The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released a once-in-a-decade environmental performance review of the country that stated “recent policy shifts have created an uncertain environment for climate action.”

OECD projected Sweden would safely hit only one of its 16 national environmental targets by 2030, succeeding in protecting the ozone layer, but failing on objectives such as “sustainable forests” and “reduced climate impact.” Almost simultaneously, the Swedish Climate Policy Council declared that the nation’s climate policies were “insufficient” and rely on “optimistic assumptions.” In April, Sweden’s Environmental Protection Agency predicted the country will miss all of its national climate targets for the next 20 years, including its goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2045. And, in a 2024 global assessment by the German Climate Change Performance Index, Sweden’s “climate policy rating” dropped to 41st after being ranked 4th in 2021 (it fell from 1st to 11th for its overall response to climate change). The independent monitor quoted its experts saying that “Sweden is backtracking from being a frontrunner in international climate policy” and they demanded that “the government maintain progressive climate policies.”

“We can say with some confidence that Sweden no longer pushes the European Union to higher ambitions,” said Naghmeh Nasiritousi, a senior research fellow at the Swedish Institute for International Affairs and co-director of the Centre for Climate Science and Policy Research at Linköping University.

Roots of Progress and Retreat in a Swedish Forest

In an old woodland in Sweden’s southwest Dalsland province, a group of amateur conservationists examine decomposing tree trunks hoping to find rare lichens and wood-decaying fungus. Around them grow gnarly spruces, stately, 90-foot-tall pines and scattered birches and aspens. Dead logs spread like pickup sticks on a bed of knee-deep bilberry shrub.

If the group finds certain rare species, they might be able to save this forest. But the odds are slim. Timber prices have doubled since Russian imports stopped after the invasion of Ukraine, and many landowners are eager to sell wood quickly, usually after they clearcut a forest.

“It’s always very aggressive,” said Martin Sjöberg, a board member in the local branch of the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation who organized the event.

In a country where less than 2 percent of primary forests remain, protecting old-growth woodlands is an existential matter, both for biodiversity, where Sweden has failed to meet its international commitments, and for the sequestration of carbon to mitigate climate change.

Fifteen years ago, Sweden’s 87 billion trees, soils and wetlands absorbed almost 62 million tons of carbon each year—more than the country’s total fossil fuel emissions. But by last year, that number had halved to 31 million tons. The steep drop indicates that forests are disturbed by increased clearcutting as well as years of droughts, fires, beetle infections and insufficient soil nutrition, which hinders tree growth. It also means that Sweden risks being in violation of a range of EU agreements, including the union’s Nature Restoration Law, Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation. LULUCF is part of the EU’s Climate and Energy Framework, which demands a much higher uptake of carbon. If Sweden is found in violation of these agreements, the EU could impose steep fines on the country. In a related estimate for Ireland, its potential climate related EU fines were assessed at between 8 and 26 billion euros ($9.4 billion to $30.5 billion). But rather than redouble efforts to sequester carbon, Sweden has instead spent years aggressively negotiating to weaken EU’s forest-related biodiversity and climate regulations.

“If they wanted, Swedish politicians could also regulate tree felling and invest in closer-to-nature forestry methods, but there is little interest,” said Thomas Hahn, an ecological economist and Associate Professor at Stockholm Resilience Centre.

An Early Leader on Climate

Sweden’s tale of climate engagement dates back to 1896, when Uppsala physicist Svante Arrhenius was first to quantify the role of carbon emissions in warming the planet. The Stockholm Conference held in the country in 1972—officially the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment—paved the way for international environmental collaboration. By 1991, Sweden was taxing carbon emissions, making it one of the first nations to do so. Environmentalists argued against the nation joining the EU in 1994 fearing that Europe’s soft regulations would reduce Swedish ambitions. Once it was a member, the country became part of a “green sextet” of nations that strengthened EU commitments.

In 2015, Sweden pledged $550 million to the Green Climate Fund created by the Paris Agreement that was adopted that year. Two years later, seven of the nation’s eight national political parties negotiated a Climate Policy Framework that included long-term goals, reporting mechanisms and a scientific Climate Policy Council in a national law.

But even then, some Swedes demanded much more. In 2018, a young Greta Thunberg started weekly demonstrations outside Sweden’s parliament. Her ensuing global campaign included the Fridays for Future events in which students around the world would skip school to advocate for climate action. The movement built political momentum for the European Green Deal, which was approved by the European Commission in 2020 and aimed to launch the EU out of the pandemic with investments in clean technologies and innovation.

For many observers, one of Sweden’s most important contributions to climate action was showing how economic growth can be decoupled from fossil fuels. Since 1979, its year of peak emissions, the nation’s release of carbon has fallen over 50 percent while GDP per person has more than doubled.

But since the country’s general elections in 2022, Sweden has taken distinct steps away from its environmental legacy. A conservative coalition, supported by the far-right Sweden Democrats, focused their campaign on cheap fuel and public safety. In office, they have prioritized building up the military, being tough on crime and sharply reducing immigration. Funding for climate action has plummeted.

The government halted investments in high-speed rail; cancelled subsidies for electric vehicles; stopped its support for undersea cables, leading private companies to stop offshore wind projects; increased taxes on solar electricity; and cut its investments in several green innovation funds, making the funding available to municipalities unpredictable for things like more efficient heating systems and charging infrastructure for electric cars. At the same time, subsidies for fossil fuels and aviation have increased and gasoline prices have fallen by almost half. Sweden’s carbon emissions rose by 7 percent last year, breaking a long trend, largely due to the government’s dropping of regulations requiring biofuel blending in gasoline.

Sweden’s government, however, maintains lofty rhetoric about fighting climate change, and highlights its spending on two areas: carbon credits that pay for emission reductions in other, usually less-developed countries, to allow Sweden to maintain higher emissions, and new nuclear power plants to generate emissions-free electricity. Critics argue that credits have neocolonial implications as the programs effectively export both the blame and the consequences of emissions from rich nations to poorer ones. Other critics note that nuclear power is an economic gamble that will take decades to implement, with uranium mines and waste that can spread deadly radiation and reactors that can pose strategic risks if the country were to go to war.

A Trend Across Europe

Research into the history of Sweden’s policy shift by Nasiritousi at the Swedish Institute for International Affairs and Linköping University shows that the nation’s decarbonization effort was originally unrelated to climate. The country lacks fossil fuel deposits, so relying on coal, fossil gas and oil made little sense, especially after the oil crisis of the 1970s. The nation instead chose to generate its electricity with its strong hydropower sector complemented with an ambitious nuclear power program. Those two sources still account for 70 percent of Sweden’s electricity production; another 28 percent is also “fossil-free,” most of it generated with wind and biofuels.

Today, however, reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement requires more profound efforts across more sectors, including some with elevated social costs such as transportation, forestry, agriculture and lifestyle-related consumption. The wide-ranging efforts that reaching the U.N.’s climate goals require of the public has provided an opportunity for populist politicians, who can tell a simpler story and don’t have to explain complex, interconnected systems, said Nasiritousi. For Sweden’s government, building even more nuclear power capacity has become that story, which she said distracts from the more expansive efforts needed to achieve climate targets.

Sweden is following a European trend, said Rudi Wurzel, professor of comparative European politics at the University of Hull in England. Wurzel developed the concept of an ambitious “green sextet” of nations driving the EU’s climate agenda, but while following ongoing negotiations and statements, he saw five of those countries—Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Austria—all appear to reduce their once-bold climate policies. All of these countries have also shifted to the political right. Only Denmark, a leader in offshore wind, largely seems to be maintaining its aspirations to cut emissions and fight climate change, he said.

The Climate Change Performance Index confirmed his analysis, with its scores for all five nations dramatically falling between 2021 and 2024, while Denmark moved upwards. And Denmark, which currently holds the influential and rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union ahead of a range of important EU negotiations and decisions in the fall, might have room to sustain some European climate ambitions, even as priorities shift in other countries.

Precarious geopolitics might help to maintain some EU environmental goals, Wurzel added, because in Europe, unlike the U.S., renewables offer immediate security benefits by decreasing dependence on Russian energy imports.

“Security considerations may save EU’s climate efforts for now, and we never know where politics goes next,” said Wurzel.

Sweden’s chief climate negotiator, Ambassador Mattias Frumerie, said he is “aware of the debate inside Sweden” but noted that local issues rarely reach international negotiations. Generally, Sweden’s message that the urgent need to confront climate change presents a business opportunity is attracting growing interest, he said. As for the claims that Sweden is backtracking on its environmental ambition, he stressed the importance of being transparent about “bumps in the road” of climate action.

Sweden’s Minister for Climate and Environment, Romina Pourmokhtari, declined to make herself available for an interview for this story.

Back in the old-growth forest of Dalsland, the amateur conservationists haven’t found any rare lichens or wood-decaying fungus. The most exciting discovery was a rather common coral slime. It is neither plant, animal or fungus and resembles white frost on black soil.

But, while they didn’t find anything rare enough to keep the forest from being logged, just being out in the woods is a step toward stopping Sweden’s retreat on climate action, said Sjöberg, the organizer of the event.

“All it takes is more people caring about our future,” he said, “and that we get them out here doing something.”

A professional artist who has produced several exhibitions about threats to the forest, he said his abstract and emotional art is intended to invoke action.

“We must be able to somehow turn all this around,” he said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Wind_power_1-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 13:03:01.564902

The city awarded $1.2 million through its Environmental Justice Fund to grassroots organizations confronting climate change on the frontlines — communities facing sea level rise, storm surge, and intensifying heat. The money, raised through a payroll tax on high-income employers, is flowing directly to communities of color, immigrants, the elderly, and low-income residents — people hit first and worst by climate impacts.

It’s not just Seattle. Across the country, cities are stepping up, even as federal support for climate resilience and environmental justice collapses.

Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has wasted no time dismantling climate justice programs. His “Day One” executive orders terminated all federal environmental justice offices and staff, scrapped the Justice40 initiative, and reopened large swaths of the U.S. coast to offshore drilling. His administration has revoked a decades-old executive order requiring agencies to prioritize environmental justice in their missions, taken key tools — like the Environmental Protection Agency’s EJScreen — offline, and cut core funding programs, including disaster preparedness grants. And through the “Big Beautiful Bill,” Trump has gutted the Inflation Reduction Act’s environmental and climate justice program — slashing billions once earmarked for clean air, clean water, and green jobs in overburdened communities.

These rollbacks are not just performative political retribution. They are already threatening lives and livelihoods in communities across the country.

This is especially true in coastal cities, home to more than 47 million people, where rising seas and stronger storms are colliding with long-standing patterns of inequality, nearly 60 percent of coastal city residents are people of color — compared to 37 percent nationally. These cities also have higher rates of poverty, unemployment, rent burden, and non-citizenship. That means when disaster strikes — whether from hurricanes in the Gulf or nor’easters in New York — the communities with the fewest resources to recover are often the ones hardest hit.

In these cities, climate justice is more than a policy priority – it’s a survival strategy.

At Urban Ocean Lab, a think tank for the future of coastal cities, we spoke with local officials nationwide about how they’re navigating this new reality. Our new report shares what we learned — and what’s still possible.

Despite a hostile federal landscape, cities are forging ahead. They’re creating local funding streams, investing in community-led planning, and embedding justice into their governments and operational DNA.

In Oakland, every strategy in the Equitable Climate Action Plan is evaluated for its racial equity impact. In Seattle, the Race and Social Justice Initiative — now law — requires all city departments to review budgets and programs through an equity lens. This is real institutional change.

While the federal government wipes crucial data resources, cities recognize information is integral. In San Diego, the Climate Equity Index maps where environmental risks overlap with socioeconomic vulnerability, guiding city investments in stormwater upgrades, green space, and climate infrastructure. In New York City, the EJNYC Mapping Tool brings together over 100 datasets to highlight environmental burdens in places like the Rockaways and South Bronx — both low-lying areas with aging infrastructure and long histories of disinvestment. These tools help cities steer investments to the neighborhoods that need them most.

As federal funding evaporates, many cities are strengthening ties with frontline organizations — the local experts who’ve been leading the fight for decades. In New Orleans, the Climate Action Equity Project brings community leaders from every city district to co-design resilience strategies, from flood protection to coastal restoration. In Providence, Rhode Island, the Green Justice Zones initiative puts neighborhood groups in charge of planning for flooding and extreme heat in the city’s most vulnerable areas.

And where national workforce programs are shrinking, cities are building their own pipelines of green jobs. Cleveland is equipping youth from frontline communities with skills to restore urban forests and protect neighborhoods from flooding and water pollution. In New Orleans, programs like Ground CREW and Thrive prepare BIPOC and low-income residents to lead neighborhood-scale stormwater and flood resilience projects.

This is what climate justice looks like: tactical, community-rooted, and relentless. It’s also what real leadership looks like — in sharp contrast to the political theater playing out in Washington.

While Trump stages press conferences and bill signings to celebrate the dismantling of hard-won protections, local governments are doing the real work of protecting lives, preparing for future storms, and closing the equity gap. The stakes aren’t theoretical. They’re physical — crashing into coastal communities and people’s lives. And they’re growing more urgent every year.

We don’t need to wait for the Trump administration to get its act together. But we also can’t let cities do this work alone.

As part of a Republican-led budget package, the administration has fast-tracked the phase-out of 30% tax credits for wind and solar projects—credits that previously ran through 2032. Projects must now begin construction within a year or be in service by the end of 2027 to qualify.

In a further blow, Trump directed the Treasury Department to rewrite the rules on what counts as “beginning construction.” For years, developers could claim credits by spending just 5% of project costs and had up to four years to complete construction. That longstanding practice is now under review, with Treasury given 45 days to propose new guidelines—leaving project financing in limbo.

Industry in Disarray

The impact has been immediate. Singapore-based Bila Solar has paused a $20 million expansion at its Indianapolis plant that would have created 75 jobs.

Heliene, a Canadian manufacturer, is reevaluating a $350 million solar cell facility in Minnesota. Norwegian solar wafer producer NorSun is reconsidering its $620 million Tulsa factory. Meanwhile, two fully permitted offshore wind farms—US Wind’s 300 MW Maryland project and Iberdrola’s 791 MW New England Wind project—are now at risk of never breaking ground.

“This is a troubling level of uncertainty,” said Mick McDaniel, Bila Solar’s general manager. Heliene CEO Martin Pochtaruk added, “With so many moving parts, financing of projects, financing of manufacturing is difficult, if not impossible.”

Billions at Stake and Competing Narratives

Analysts are sounding alarms over the broader fallout.

Rhodium Group estimates the new policy endangers $263 billion in planned renewable energy projects and $110 billion in manufacturing investments.

Consulting firm ICF projects a 25% increase in U.S. electricity demand by 2030, driven largely by AI and cloud computing. A restricted pipeline of renewable projects could lead to tighter power supplies and push household electricity bills up by $280 annually by 2035, according to Princeton’s REPEAT Project.

The Trump administration argues that rapid adoption of renewables has destabilized the grid and increased consumer costs—a claim widely contested by energy experts, who point to states like Texas, where renewables have helped reduce wholesale power prices.

Yet, with U.S. energy demand surging, even industry representatives supportive of fossil fuels warn against curbing clean energy growth. “All new generation—renewables and fossil—must be encouraged to meet the coming demand,” one power sector official told Bloomberg.

Shrinking Window

Wood Mackenzie forecasts a 17% drop in solar installations and 20% decline in wind projects over the next decade. The consultancy also warns that offshore wind, already grappling with inflation and supply chain disruptions, may not recover without substantial policy support.

For now, developers are scrambling to break ground before incentives vanish. But the uncertainty surrounding Treasury’s revised rules may make even that strategy unviable.

Perspective

The clean energy sector has been one of the fastest-growing parts of the U.S. economy, buoyed by tax credits designed to attract billions in private capital and create thousands of jobs. Gutting these incentives risks stalling that momentum at a critical time—just as demand for electricity is set to soar.

If the U.S. intends to remain competitive in AI, advanced manufacturing, and grid modernization, policymakers may need to rethink whether a sharp retreat from renewable subsidies aligns with long-term economic and energy security goals.",https://pvbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Industry-Update.png,N,,2025-08-03 13:02:58.948267

The Trump administration has targeted the renewable energy industry for massive cutbacks in 2025’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB). According to NPR, the bill, signed into law on July 4, eliminates tax incentives for solar and wind projects across the United States. As a result, electricity bills throughout the country are expected to increase, according to nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation.

Here’s a look at exactly how and why power bills may be on the rise, with a specific look at the four states expected to suffer the most.

What’s in the New Legislation?

As with any large piece of legislation, there’s a bit of complexity attached to the elimination of wind and solar subsidies in the OBBB. Thanks to negotiation from some Republican senators, tax incentives will remain for companies that start construction on projects by July 4, 2026, and that place them in service by the end of 2027.

However, as Norton Rose Fulbright points out, even this provision has been muddied by proclamations from the Trump administration. An executive order issued by President Trump just three days after the legislation was signed directs the Treasury Department to issue “new and revised guidance” within 45 days “restricting the use of broad safe harbors [to treat projects as under construction] unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

This confusion prompted Ryan Sweezey, director of North America power and renewables at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, to say, “I would characterize this as a high degree of volatility expected over the next year. I mean, the policy situation is still not clear.”

For renewable energy companies, this means they are being prompted to rush new projects while at the same time being uncertain if they will actually receive the tax incentives they seek. This type of stalemate puts renewables in a state of limbo for the time being, which isn’t good for business.

It seems unlikely that Trump will backpedal on his campaign against renewables, as he called wind and solar energy “a blight” on the country during a Cabinet meeting, according to NPR. “They hurt our country very badly,” he said. “And smart countries don’t use it.”

How Will the Legislation Affect Energy Prices?

The bottom line is that even a reduction in subsidies and incentives for the renewable energy market — let alone an elimination — will drive up energy prices across the country. According to NPR, energy demand is likely to increase significantly over the next few years, and renewable energy plants were being counted on to produce relatively cheap energy for new data centers and factories.

Energy Innovation predicts that national energy rates will increase for consumers by an average of 9% to 18% by 2035. On a wholesale basis, prices are expected to rise 25% by 2030 and a whopping 74% by 2035. Additionally, it will cost the U.S. economy thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in planned investment.

Which States Are Most Vulnerable, and Why?

The states hardest-hit by the new legislation may dream of a 10-year increase of “only” 9% to 18% in energy costs. This is because some states rely completely on the federal government for renewable energy development. According to Dan O’Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, the firm anticipates that costs will rise the most in these four states:

Oklahoma

Kentucky

Missouri

Kansas

In Oklahoma, rates are expected to skyrocket by between 60% and 350% by 2035. Kentucky, Missouri and Kansas are projected to see rate increases of at least 48%, 39% and 30% over the next decade, respectively.

When factoring in job losses in addition to energy price increases, Energy Innovation sees these five states as the biggest losers:

South Carolina

Florida

Texas

Kentucky

This proposal outlines a project aimed at implementing solar-powered clean water systems in underserved communities. By harnessing renewable energy, we can provide sustainable and reliable access to clean water, improving health outcomes and enhancing the quality of life for residents.

This initiative not only addresses immediate water needs but also promotes environmental sustainability and resilience against climate change. The project seeks to empower local communities by involving them in the design, implementation, and maintenance of these systems. By integrating community participation, we aim to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility, ensuring the long-term success of the initiative.

This proposal will detail the background and rationale for the project, outline specific objectives and goals, identify target beneficiaries, and describe the methodology and approach we will take to achieve our aims.

Background and Rationale for the Project

Globally, approximately 2 billion people live in water-stressed areas, with many relying on unsafe sources for their daily needs. Contaminated water is a leading cause of disease, contributing to high rates of morbidity and mortality, particularly among children. In many regions, traditional water supply systems are either non-existent or unreliable, exacerbating the challenges faced by vulnerable populations.

The need for innovative solutions that can provide safe drinking water is more pressing than ever. Solar energy presents a viable solution to this crisis. With abundant sunlight in many regions, solar-powered systems can be deployed to pump, filter, and purify water efficiently.

This approach not only reduces dependence on fossil fuels but also minimizes operational costs associated with traditional water supply methods. By utilizing solar technology, we can create a sustainable model that addresses both water scarcity and energy needs while promoting environmental stewardship.

Objectives and Goals of the Proposal

The primary objective of this proposal is to establish solar-powered clean water systems in targeted communities to ensure access to safe drinking water. Specifically, we aim to install a minimum of five solar-powered water purification units within the first year of the project. Each unit will be designed to serve approximately 500 individuals, significantly improving access to clean water for thousands of residents.

In addition to providing immediate access to clean water, we aim to educate community members about the importance of water hygiene and conservation practices. Our goal is to conduct workshops and training sessions that will empower residents with knowledge about maintaining the systems and understanding the health benefits of clean water. Ultimately, we envision a future where communities are self-sufficient in managing their water resources sustainably.

Target Communities and Beneficiaries

The project will focus on rural communities that are currently facing significant challenges in accessing clean water. These areas often lack infrastructure and resources, making it difficult for residents to obtain safe drinking water. By targeting these underserved populations, we aim to make a meaningful impact on their health and well-being.

Our primary beneficiaries will be families living in these communities, particularly women and children who are often responsible for collecting water. Access to clean water will reduce the time spent fetching water from distant sources, allowing children to attend school and women to engage in income-generating activities. Additionally, we will work closely with local leaders and organizations to ensure that our efforts align with community needs and priorities.

Methodology and Approach

To implement this project effectively, we will adopt a participatory approach that involves community members at every stage. Initially, we will conduct assessments to identify specific needs and preferences regarding water access. This will include surveys and focus group discussions with residents to gather insights on their experiences and expectations.

Once we have gathered sufficient data, we will collaborate with local engineers and technicians to design solar-powered clean water systems tailored to the community’s unique context. The installation process will involve training local workers to ensure that they have the skills necessary for ongoing maintenance and operation of the systems. This approach not only builds local capacity but also fosters a sense of ownership among community members.

Solar-Powered Clean Water Systems Design

Advanced Filtration Technology

Each system consists of solar panels that harness sunlight to power pumps and filtration units. The design incorporates advanced filtration technologies capable of removing contaminants while ensuring that the water remains safe for consumption.

Reliable Storage and Monitoring

In addition to purification capabilities, the systems are equipped with storage tanks to ensure a steady supply of clean water even during periods of low sunlight. We will also implement monitoring systems that allow for real-time tracking of water quality and system performance.

Optimal Performance

This data will be invaluable for making necessary adjustments and ensuring that the systems operate optimally over time.

Project Implementation Plan

The implementation plan will unfold in several phases over a two-year period. The first phase will involve community engagement and needs assessment, followed by the design and procurement of materials for the solar-powered systems. Once materials are secured, we will move into the installation phase, where local workers will be trained alongside our technical team.

After installation, we will conduct a series of workshops focused on maintenance and hygiene education. These sessions will empower community members with the knowledge they need to care for their new systems effectively. Throughout the project, we will maintain open lines of communication with community leaders to address any challenges that arise promptly.

Capacity Building and Training Components

Capacity building is a critical component of our project. We believe that empowering local residents with skills and knowledge is essential for ensuring the sustainability of the solar-powered clean water systems. Training sessions will cover various topics, including system maintenance, basic plumbing skills, and best practices for water hygiene.

We will also establish a community management committee responsible for overseeing the operation of the systems. This committee will be trained in financial management to ensure that funds generated from any potential user fees are reinvested into system maintenance and future improvements. By fostering leadership within the community, we aim to create a model that can be replicated in other areas facing similar challenges.

Monitoring and Evaluation Plan

To assess the effectiveness of our project, we will implement a robust monitoring and evaluation plan. This plan will include baseline assessments conducted before system installation to establish key indicators related to water quality, access rates, and health outcomes. Regular follow-up surveys will track changes over time.

We will also gather qualitative feedback from community members through interviews and focus groups to understand their experiences with the new systems. This feedback will inform any necessary adjustments and improvements throughout the project lifecycle. By maintaining transparency in our evaluation process, we aim to build trust with community members and stakeholders.

Budget and Financial Plan

A detailed budget has been developed to outline the financial requirements for this project. The budget includes costs associated with materials procurement, installation labor, training sessions, monitoring activities, and administrative expenses. We anticipate funding from various sources, including grants from foundations focused on clean water initiatives, corporate sponsorships, and community contributions.

To ensure financial sustainability beyond the initial funding period, we plan to explore options for generating revenue through small user fees or partnerships with local businesses. This approach will help cover ongoing maintenance costs while reinforcing community ownership of the systems.

Conclusion and Potential Impact of the Proposal

In conclusion, this proposal presents a comprehensive plan for implementing solar-powered clean water systems in underserved communities. By addressing both immediate needs for safe drinking water and promoting long-term sustainability through capacity building, we aim to create lasting change in these communities. The potential impact of this project extends beyond improved health outcomes; it fosters economic development by freeing up time for education and income-generating activities.",https://fundsforngosmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/19141120/icon.png,N,,2025-08-03 12:03:07.467646

Chris Bowen, the climate change and energy minister, last week announced an increase in taxpayer subsidies available for green energy projects under its successful capacity investment scheme (CIS).

The CIS and the government’s other clean energy subsidy scheme, the renewable energy target, do not extend beyond 2030, and the commission argued that the two programs should be replaced with “market-based incentives in the electricity sector”.

The commission also said the implementation of the new vehicle efficiency standard meant federal and state governments should phase out specific concessions for electric vehicles, including on fringe benefits tax, stamp duties and registration fees.

A new emissions-reduction incentive for heavy vehicles should also be introduced, the commission said.

The commission said it takes too long to develop green energy infrastructure and there are deep concerns that the government will not reach its 2030 climate targets, which include 82% of energy production from renewable sources.

The report called for an overhaul of how green energy projects are assessed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, to allow decision-makers to consider whether a project is important to Australia’s clean energy transition.

Martin Stokie, a commissioner who is leading the inquiry alongside Sterland, said Australia’s “sluggish and uncertain approval processes are not up to the task” of delivering the huge amount of clean energy infrastructure needed to meet national climate targets.

“Overdue reforms to the EPBC Act would both speed up approvals and better protect the environment,” he said.

The environment minister, Murray Watt, is reviewing the act as part of a new package of federal nature laws, which were shelved before the election after lobbying from mining companies and the Western Australian government.

The commission also made a series of recommendations to build the country’s resilience to the effects of climate change.

The interim report called on the commonwealth to lead development of a public database of all climate hazards, and a series of goals and policies to improve the resilience of houses.

Notably, the commission backed a climate resilience star-rating system that would reflect the potential damage from climate change.

“People’s experience of climate change will depend on the resilience of their home, but most lack the information they need to invest in upgrades,” Sterland said.

“As climate risks intensify, boosting our resilience can lower the costs of disaster recovery and create a healthier, safer and more productive Australia.”

The commission will now consult on its draft recommendations before the final report due at the end of this year.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b6e6a7f81a5122689bb36af40e5406c0a552a2/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1aa9177d883187fbca80de9099e74bc7",N,,2025-08-03 10:59:26.465343

“Wildfire emissions in 2020 essentially negate 18 years of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.” In that year, wildfires released an estimated 127 million metric tons of CO₂—twice the amount produced by California’s entire power sector.
The consequences of ignoring wildfire emissions are no longer just ecological—they’re economic.
The USDA Forest Service and EPA have begun integrating wildfire emissions into national inventories.
But wildfire emissions are still excluded from the state’s formal climate goals.","When wildfires ravaged Los Angeles County earlier this year, they destroyed thousands of homes and caused exorbitant insurance claims. But a less obvious disaster also occurred: satellites detected massive plumes of CO₂, rivaling the yearly emissions of some small countries. In just days, the fires released more carbon pollution than all of California’s passenger vehicles emit in a month.

Yet none of it counts toward the state’s official climate ledger.

Despite California’s ambitious climate laws and sophisticated carbon accounting, emissions from wildfires are treated as natural disasters—uncontrollable and, therefore, unaccountable. But with wildfires now exacerbated by fossil fuel combustion, hotter weather, and poor forest management, experts say this blind spot is no longer defensible. Fires are both a consequence and a contributing factor to the climate crisis.

“Wildfires in California have become a major and growing source of greenhouse gas emissions,” said Michael Jerrett, professor at UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health, in a study. “Wildfire emissions in 2020 essentially negate 18 years of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.”

In that year, wildfires released an estimated 127 million metric tons of CO₂—twice the amount produced by California’s entire power sector. Because these emissions originate from trees rather than smokestacks, they are often excluded from climate inventories due to a technicality known as the “fast carbon cycle.” The idea is that forests will eventually reabsorb the carbon they release. However, with longer fire seasons and declining ecosystems, that reabsorption is no longer assured.

Today’s wildfires burn hotter, spread faster, and start more easily than those of decades past. Rising global temperatures, prolonged drought, earlier snowmelt, and increasingly dry vegetation are all part of the equation. So is human encroachment into fire-prone areas, which increases ignition sources—from cars to power lines—and puts more lives and infrastructure at risk.

""In a warmer world, we’re already seeing more extreme wildfires that put both people and nature at risk,"" said Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for The Nature Conservancy’s publication. ”More than a century of fuel build-up, past land and fire management, fire exclusion, and expansion into the wildland-urban interface all play a part.”

Carbon Risk Is Becoming A Financial Liability

The Global Wildfire Information System estimates that wildfires release between 5 and 8 billion tons of CO₂ each year—roughly one-fifth of the total emissions from the entire cement industry, one of the world’s biggest polluters. These fire-related emissions are often viewed as byproducts of global warming. But that’s changing.

The consequences of ignoring wildfire emissions are no longer just ecological—they’re economic. Wildfires disrupt everything from supply chains and insurance premiums to asset valuations. Companies with fire exposure may experience a decline in their valuations, particularly as investors scrutinize climate-related risks.

A McKinsey study found that 83% of Fortune Global 500 companies have climate-related targets; however, far fewer address nature-based threats, such as wildfires, drought, or land degradation. This leaves firms vulnerable not only to physical damage but also to shareholder lawsuits and director liability.

Some institutions are responding. The USDA Forest Service and EPA have begun integrating wildfire emissions into national inventories. Platforms like Climate TRACE, which use satellites to monitor pollution in real-time, reveal that we underreport carbon sources, including wildfires. Meanwhile, reinsurers and insurers—who shoulder billions in wildfire losses—are calling for climate-adjusted pricing.

And S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s warn that utilities with wildfire exposure face mounting credit risks unless they invest in prevention, resilience, and emergency planning. The real-world results and the remedies?

Few examples illustrate the financial fallout of fire-driven climate risk better than PG&E. The utility filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2019, overwhelmed by $30 billion in liabilities linked to fires between 2015 and 2018. Investigators determined that PG&E’s equipment caused several major blazes, including the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in California history.

The company emerged from bankruptcy in 2020 after agreeing to a $13.5 billion settlement with fire victims and pledging billions toward safety upgrades. The utility has become a case study in the cost of ignoring climate exposure. PG&E now routinely shuts down power during high-risk conditions. While controversial, Hawaiian Electric and PacifiCorp employ similar tactics.

Climate Leadership Requires Carbon Accountability

The bankruptcy also changed how the entire utility sector views risk. Companies now invest in vegetation management, grid modernization, and predictive analytics. But even these steps only address the triggers and technical solutions—not the obvious disconnect centered on carbon math.

California continues to lead the nation in climate policy, with ambitious targets for zero-emission energy and net-zero emissions by 2045. Governor Gavin Newsom has invested in forest thinning, prescribed burns, and firefighting capacity. But wildfire emissions are still excluded from the state’s formal climate goals.

“The debate is over around climate. Just come to the state of California. Observe it with your own eyes,” Newsom said in 2020, surveying wildfire damage.

That line captured both the urgency and irony. While California acts boldly on decarbonization, it still underestimates one of its largest and fastest-growing sources of CO₂. The result is a policy blind spot with global implications.

When California’s fires take out the forests and emit more CO₂ in a single season than the state’s power sector, we are not addressing the climate crisis—we are just greenwashing it.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6882405ba76b1047490137e0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-08-03 11:00:41.606345

The world’s first factory designed to make green jet fuel from ethanol is expected to start operations before the end of the year after several delays, according to owner LanzaJet Inc.

The $200 million facility in rural Georgia, initially scheduled to start commercial production last year, is now expected to begin operating by the end of September, LanzaJet Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Samartzis said in an interview. The latest delay was the result of equipment issues, he said.

LanzaJet, which received US government funds to build the facility, is being closely watched as a barometer for the success of the nascent ethanol-to-jet industry. The company imported Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol last year to pilot production, but more than a year later, it hasn’t been able to sell its green jet fuel in the open market.

“My hope is that by the end of the third quarter we are fully operating,” Samartzis said. “The modifications we made to the equipment that was hindering us, unrelated to the technology itself, should satisfy what we need.”

A flurry of deals among airlines, fuel makers and agriculture companies have been announced since 2021, when then President Joe Biden called for 3 billion gallons of annual domestic sustainable aviation fuel production by the end of this decade. The market has since soared more than sevenfold to 38.7 million gallons last year, according to US government data.

Green jet fuel, or SAF, can be made from a range of raw materials. But most American corn-ethanol isn’t low-carbon enough to qualify for a tax credit aimed at boosting production of domestic renewable fuels, known as 45Z.

The new law also states that the tax credit only applies to producers of SAF made using ingredients from North America. That’s freezing out the very sugar cane ethanol from Brazil that LanzaJet plans to use.

Still, Samartzis said production at the Soperton, Georgia, facility will start with Brazilian ethanol even if the company can’t benefit from the credit. That’s because only a scant amount of US product meets the required threshold of lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 50%.

LanzaJet said it plans to switch to American feedstocks as soon as possible, with Samartzis now advocating for a threshold on emissions reduction of as low as 30%. The company’s factory in Georgia will produce 10 million gallons of SAF and renewable diesel a year when operations eventually start.

New York’s newly announced Clean Mobility Program will provide funding for scalable, community-led demonstration projects highlighting micro mobility, ride sharing, and community-managed “on-demand shared transportation” options.

The Governor’s office believes these solutions could help lower air pollution in the state while offering residents affordable connections to services, jobs, and transit. Objectively needed wins, in other words – and even more needed in traditionally underserved communities.

Governor Hochul gets it

“Even as the federal government walks away from clean air and energy standards, New York continues to invest in modern, flexible and efficient electric transportation options that improve air quality and expand affordable consumer choices,” explains Governor Hochul. “Our priority is linking communities, including areas that have been historically marginalized, with resources that provide residents with a variety of flexible transportation options that allow them to conduct their daily business uninterrupted.”

The program is the latest of the state’s recent EV funding initiatives, and the official release (on the New York State website) announced more details about The Clean Mobility Program:

The Clean Mobility program offers up to $21.6 million for projects across New York State and will award up to $3 million per project, with priority given to projects in disadvantaged communities, as defined by the Climate Justice Working Group.

Additionally, up to $8 million is set aside to fund demonstration projects located in specific areas of the state, including those served by the upstate investor-owned utilities. This includes a total of up to $5 million for micro mobility projects in the Central Hudson, National Grid, New York State Electric & Gas, and Rochester Electric & Gas region and up to $3 million for any type of eligible demonstration projects located in the Bronx.

NEW YORK STATE

Proposals for demonstration projects must include a completed planning document that includes community engagement, site identification and operations, project partner identification, technical feasibility assessment, and a policy and regulatory feasibility assessment. Any e-bikes or e-scooters deployed in these projects must meet industry and state safety standards to be eligible.

Proposals are due on September 25, 2025 by 3:00 PM EST. For more information on this funding opportunity please visit the NYSERDA’s website.

Electrek’s Take

Times Square banned cars in 2009 and New York City implemented congestion pricing earlier this year, angering exactly the right people in exactly the right way for exactly the right reasons. In both cases, the plans worked, the problems were solved for, and the lives of the people of New York improved. Governor Hochul’s latest plan is sure to be the latest in an ever-growing line of green success stories.

NBC Connecticut's Mike Hydeck spoke with DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, who gave an explanation on how Connecticut is going to press ahead.
Mike Hydeck: So the offshore wind projects coming and going, right?
So one of the things that's been happening previous, up until now, some people are fighting back against solar projects.
Katie Dykes: That's definitely a huge concern, not just here in Connecticut, but across the country.","Piece by piece, the Trump administration is changing the way the federal government considers clean energy projects. Subsidies are going away for electric vehicles.

Wind and solar projects are losing federal funding that were in place during the Biden administration.

So how is all this going to affect Connecticut?

NBC Connecticut's Mike Hydeck spoke with DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, who gave an explanation on how Connecticut is going to press ahead.

Mike Hydeck: So first thing, zero emissions goal for our state is 2050. With all the changes in federal funding, is that still possible? I mean, it's still a while away.

Katie Dykes: Actually 2040. It's just around the corner, but that said, we've been investing for many years in zero emission resources, including investing in keeping the Millstone nuclear facility around. That's an enormous contributor to helping us meet that 100% clean supply.

Mike Hydeck: That was a controversial deal. Some people weren't very happy about that.

Face the Facts

Face the Facts with NBC Connecticut goes beyond the headlines, asking newsmakers the tough questions, giving an in-depth analysis of the big stories.

Katie Dykes: That's true, but we saved more than $2 billion by ensuring that that facility could keep going so we wouldn't have to replace it with other possibly dirtier sources of power. So in the long run, it's been a really good investment. But in addition, we know that investments in offshore wind and solar and energy efficiency have really been contributing to help keep keep our grid affordable and help to achieve that zero carbon supply.

Mike Hydeck: So the offshore wind projects coming and going, right? So we have the one in Bridgeport that disappeared. We have the, you know, the other one, it's great that we still have.

Katie Dykes: So we actually have the Revolution Wind project and also a Vineyard Wind project that's backstopped by Massachusetts are under construction right now. If you go down to New London, the state pier is busy as they're deploying turbines. Together those projects, which are expected to come online next year, at pretty affordable prices, because we locked in those prices before the pandemic. They're going to be supplying about a 5% additional supply of energy to New England.

Mike Hydeck: So it's clean energy, but people are concerned about prices, and the concern of wind power in the beginning and because it's a nascent industry by comparison, that it's going to be more expensive.

Katie Dykes: Sure. These are projects that, again, we locked in this pricing before the pandemic, so it's pretty competitive. It was more for newer projects coming online recently that we were seeing those prices starting to go up. But at the same time, we've been investing in solar. That's been another really important resource. We see the importance of solar from an affordability and reliability perspective, helping our grid. Just this summer, as we've seen, you know, really hot, hot weather conditions, we've seen, you know, like 2,000 megawatts of solar operating at those hot peak afternoon times when everybody's AC is cranking. And that's really provided a lot of benefit in terms of avoiding having to turn on more expensive generation resources that produce air pollution.

Mike Hydeck: So let's jump into solar. So one of the things that's been happening previous, up until now, some people are fighting back against solar projects. There's one in Ansonia that's in a lawsuit. Farmers protested in another town because they didn't want their solar field expanded. You unveiled a new tool on how to try to be more transparent about how these projects are considered, what is it?

Katie Dykes: Right. So we have debuted this tool called the Community Renewable Energy Eiting Tool, or CREST. And this is a GIS map based tool to help us locate…

Mike Hydeck: And GIS stands for?

Katie Dykes: Geographic Information Systems. But think of it as your Google Maps or Google Earth for really being able to drill down and help developers who want to propose these projects, but also municipalities and stakeholders try to figure out where is the best place to put more solar that will minimize the types of conflicts with other things we care about, like protecting core forests and protecting farmland, but also making sure that the facility is in a location where it's going to be able to plug in the grid relatively inexpensively. It's the sweet spot that we're looking for and and certainly we've seen, you know, that some projects have encountered some resistance. I think there have been a lot of lessons learned over time, but every developer I talk to, they want to avoid conflict as much as possible, because conflict adds to delay and adds to cost, and so we are excited about having this tool. So from the very beginning, we can help developers identify those places where they're going to be most welcomed and encounter the least amount of challenges.

Mike Hydeck: Now with credits going away, are you going to have a hard time finding developers to do these projects? Because if federal money goes away, then the state money starts to dwindle faster. Then what?

Katie Dykes: You bet. I mean, it's no secret the Trump administration has been singling out renewables like solar and wind to prevent them from being able to access federal tax credits that can help them, helping them maintain cost competitiveness. So DEEP has been working, you know, urgently to try to make sure we're doing everything that we can to help those projects that are already in the pipeline, make sure that they have the best chance to qualify before the tax credits go away. We hosted a webinar a week and a half ago to explore whether we should do a rapid RFP to contract for resources that may be eligible, as well as look at how we can streamline, make sure that those who are waiting on permits, that we can expedite the permitting process and just do everything we can, because that helps get these projects that were already under construction not be impacted by the whiplash that's occurring at the federal level.

Mike Hydeck: At least, gets finished, right?

Katie Dykes: You bet, and then in the longer term, of course, once the tax credits are going away, reducing some of those costs that are added when you have conflict at the local level and opposition, you know, from a project that's sited in a poorly chosen location. You know, if we can minimize those conflicts, we can actually save on the cost of the project,

Mike Hydeck: Right, because it's not spending more money just to try to get the project finished. So last question, moving forward, if all this federal money goes away, you know, we pay some of the highest rates for electric in the country. Do you expect that rate payers are gonna have to pick up part of the tab if that federal money goes away and the state money dwindles?

Katie Dykes: That's definitely a huge concern, not just here in Connecticut, but across the country. Look, we're, right now, not unique to New England, we're seeing states in every region are struggling with how to, we're seeing the demand for electricity is really increasing from data centers.

According to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the UK’s green economy grew by more than 10% last year, supporting 951,000 jobs and contributing more than £83bn of GVA. And, crucially, Britain has built not just a green industrial base but a global financial ecosystem, centred on London, capable of deploying capital into decarbonisation efforts in more than 60 countries.

This race for investment is one in which the UK should aim to finish on the podium. To achieve this, government and finance need to work in partnership and it’s here that fractured politics poses maximum danger.

The geopolitical consensus that delivered the Paris Agreement is broken. Financial institutions are stepping back or deferring their net zero commitments. But the reason for such moves is important. It is not because investors no longer believe in the economic opportunity. HSBC, which has deferred its net zero commitment to 2050, cited “the present lag in policy measures and the overall slower pace of the transition”. In other words, finance is going more slowly because governments are. Instead of partnership, we risk creating a vicious circle of political backsliding and the deferring or cancellation of transformative investment.

This creates an opportunity for the UK. Even as geopolitics fractures, Britain can become the investment destination of choice for the next wave of transition technologies. Much of the $2.1tn invested in 2024 went into mature sectors such as renewables, grids, electric vehicles and storage. In addition to continuing to scale up these 21st-century industries, the opportunity also lies in developing the next wave of climate solutions: hydrogen, sustainable fuels, electrified heat, carbon dioxide removal and nature restoration. It is here that the UK can seek to lead.

These sectors are currently underfunded because they are less mature and harder to finance. That’s where government needs to step in with clear policy and the provision of public capital through institutions such as the National Wealth Fund – to help “de-risk” investment and bring in private capital.

The UK has previously led the world on climate-related governance, with the 2008 Climate Change Act creating legally binding targets. It now needs to lead on the next challenge: delivery. Every UK government since the Climate Change Act has accepted the science and set ambitious goals. Finance and business must rise to meet them – and they need policy clarity, predictability and investable pipelines to do so. The upshot will be an economic imperative set as much by investors as by government.

Claims from politicians that wind power is too expensive are not supported by evidence. Besides being clean, it’s the cheapest energy source after solar. Long-term renewables are an economic opportunity that will defy the political cycle, setting a long-term investment agenda that will deliver growth, jobs and resilience in the face of our changing climate.

It is now at 27.8% share, a market share that is comparable to BYD’s in China and Tesla’s in the USA.","EVs are picking up in Europe, with some 361,000 plugin vehicles being registered in Europe in June. That’s up 23% year over year (YoY).

This is a particularly positive sign when considering that the overall market (currently at ~6.8 million units YTD) does not look good this year (5% decline in June, -1% YTD).

Interestingly, while BEVs seem to be slowing down, growing just 16% YoY in June to 242,000 units, PHEVs are picking up the pace, jumping 40% YoY in June. They were spearheaded by the #3 BYD Seal U PHEV (aka euro-spec BYD Song PHEV), but other Chinese makes are also helping out, like Chery’s Jaecoo and Geely’s Lynk & Co. PHEVs scored close to 120,000 sales in June, and their YTD numbers are now up 24% to close to 600,000 units.

As such, June saw the plugin vehicle share of the overall European auto market grow to 29% (20% full electrics/BEVs), keeping the year-to-date numbers at 26% (18% for BEVs).

Comparing the EV best sellers in each size category with their respective ICE best sellers, one can see that there is still a lot to be done.

Generally speaking, the EV best seller in each size category is still far from reaching the overall podium, with the exception being the midsize category, where the Tesla Model Y reigns supreme. But even here, things looked better a few months ago when the Tesla Model 3 was 3rd.

Now that the US sedan is in decline (more on this down below), it’s been replaced on the podium by the Volvo XC60. The model is heavily electrified, with two out of three XC60 sales come from the PHEV version, but it is still better to have a 100% BEV model on the podium than a two-thirds PHEV.

But let’s get back to June’s EV sales. The big highlight this month was Tesla’s #1 plus #2 win, maybe one of their last in Europe. Here’s a more detailed analysis on the top 5 EVs this month:

#1 Tesla Model Y — Tesla’s crossover retained its Best Seller status in June, thanks to 24,073 registrations. This is a slight 1% increase over its sales in June 2024. With the German-made EV profiting from its recent refresh, the crossover is looking to at least get close to its sales levels of 2023 and 2024. Considering all the hubris around the Texan brand, this result is welcome good news in a company where everything else seems to be falling apart…. Basically, Tesla is still floating thanks to the Model Y.

#2 Tesla Model 3 — The electric sedan scored 10,807 registrations in June. That represented exponential growth month over month (MoM), but a horrible 48% drop YoY. With the brand focussing on the refreshed Model Y, which is benefitting from higher discounts than its sedan sibling(!), and developments of new versions, like the Tesla Model Y L and a more decontented and cheaper version*, the Model 3 is being left out in the cold. This means that the sedan should continue to lose sales and podium presences will become more rare.

* My name suggestion for this cheaper and more spartan version of the crossover is the Tesla Model Y Leonidas. You are welcome, Tesla….

#3 Skoda Elroq — The recently introduced Elroq scored another record performance, 9,825 registrations in June. Will we see it go north of the 10,000-unit mark in September? Volkswagen Group has struck gold with this one. Despite minimum effort (basically, it slightly shortened its successful Enyaq), Skoda won a top three presence AND did it without significantly hurting the Enyaq’s sales. The longer crossover actually increased its sales by 8% YoY in June. Although not as spacious as its bigger sibling, it compensates for that with a competitive price, starting at 34,000 euros, which makes it one of the cheapest compact crossovers on the market, Chinese included. Could this be the new value-for-money king? This great performance allowed Skoda to score some 16,000 BEVs in June, a great result for the Czech brand.

#4 Renault 5 / Alpine A290 — The sporty hatchbacks won another top 5 presence in June, with the French duo scoring 7,788 deliveries. The EV enthusiasts’ choice, for a number of reasons, starting with its dropdead gorgeous looks and ending in the hot hatch–like handling, the 5/A290 has enough going for it to attract a wide audience, even if it is not as wide as their ICE siblings, the Renault Clio and Dacia Sandero. Then again, that’s not their responsibility, as both the Sandero and Clio will receive their own EV versions a couple of years from now.

#5 BYD Seal U (BEV+PHEV) — BYD’s star player delivered a record 7,182 sales (720 of them being of the BEV variety), with the model staying on the best sellers list in Europe. While the Seal U, the euro-spec version of the veteran Song, isn’t class leading specs-wise, it compensates for that with competitive pricing, which is especially appealing in the PHEV version that starts just below 40,000 euros, a killer price for a midsize SUV. Just for an idea, the value-for-money minded Skoda Kodiaq midsize SUV starts at 45,000 euros, with a 1.5 MHEV engine and 150 hp, while the cheapest Seal U PHEV costs 5,000 euros less, is more powerful, has a combined power of 217 hp, AND, as a cherry on top, still offers 80 km of electric WLTP range. Not bad, eh?

Outside the top 5, the highlight comes from Volkswagen, which saw the new Tiguan PHEV beat the Volvo XC60 PHEV and take the plugin hybrid category title, thanks to a record 5,234 units. With over 100 km electric range, and DC charging, the German crossover specs make it a decent PHEV effort, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it started to win the category title more often.

Another model shining was the #8 BMW iX1. With 6,499 sales, it had its best result in 18 months, comfortably outselling its direct rivals, the #19 Mercedes EQA and #13 Audi Q4.

Outside the top 20, the big highlights were the Polestar 4 hitting a record 2,966 units, helping the Sino-Swedish brand to get much needed sales volumes, and the VW ID.Buzz scoring another record performance, 2,757 sales.

Speaking of VW’s neo-retro Hippy Van, the German-made EV is helping MPVs to have something of a resurgence. This family-friendly vehicle category is seeing its sales jump 99% YoY this year, well above the 24% average, allowing MPVs to have 3% of the market. Sure, it is still a small portion of the market, but sales are going in the right direction. MPV segment growth beat almost every other vehicle category, with the exception being the even more niche sports cars/coupés/convertibles category, which we could call Sports Specialties. That segment grew 209% YoY, gaining a grand total share of … 0.3%.

Still, these are necessary steps to help the EV market to become more diversified and less stereotypically crossover-heavy.

And as I have been saying for years — MPVs will rise again!… [Editor’s note: Knowing José for about 10 years, I can confirm that he has been on this bandwagon for a long time, and his heart is fully in it. —Zach]

Looking at the 2025 ranking, there were plenty of changes. The Tesla Model 3 had its expected end-of-quarter surge, but this time it wasn’t enough to recover the #2 spot from the VW ID.4, giving strength to the idea that, after three (2022/23/24) consecutive #1 plus #2 wins by Tesla in the model table in Europe, 2025 will be the year that this kind of domination will start to fade.

Even the 3rd spot is all but guaranteed for the Tesla sedan, as plenty of models (Renault 5, VW ID.7 & ID.3…) are dangerously close and could surpass it. The rising #8 Skoda Elroq could especially become an adversary too strong to contain in Q4.

And with the Tesla Model 3 in a seemingly downward spiral (it is down 35% YoY this year, while in June it fell by 48% YoY), 2015 could see the US sedan stay below the European EV podium for the first time since 2018!

The remaining changes allowed the #15 VW Tiguan PHEV, #16 Ford Kuga PHEV, and #17 Volvo EX30 to climb a position each, benefitting from another disappointing performance from the Citroen e-C3.

Finally, the BMW i4 surpassed the Toyota C-HR PHEV and is now #19, with the Japanese crossover now feeling the heat from the #21 Cupra Born, which is only some 200 units behind.

Looking at the plugin auto brand ranking, this time the leader, Volkswagen, has lost share (11.2% in June vs. 11.5% in May), but it still holds a comfortable 2.2% share lead over #2 BMW.

This means that the German make is on its way to finishing a three-year Tesla reign (2022/23/24) in Europe, winning its first manufacturer title since 2021.

Speaking of Tesla, the Texan automaker profited from its end-of-quarter push, raising its share by 0.9% from 5.2% to 6.1%, and thus climbing into … 4th. Not bad, but … we are talking about the trophy holder. Tesla’s 2024 title was its 3rd in a row. And now it is fighting for a spot in the top 5.

The end of an era?

Below the top 5, growing #7 Skoda rose from 5% in May to its current 5.1% share. The Czech brand is probably the best candidate for a top 5 presence, and also a welcome addition to the table, as Volkswagen is the single mainstream brand in the top 5, followed by four premium makes.

Having Skoda on the best sellers table will be a good sign of EVs going mainstream. Fingers crossed….

A deserving mention also goes to BYD, which is already appearing on the radar with 4.1% share, a 0.1% increase over May.

Arranging things by automotive group, Volkswagen Group is firmly in the lead, despite losing 0.3% share in June. It is now at 27.8% share, a market share that is comparable to BYD’s in China and Tesla’s in the USA. This is an important metric for the German conglomerate if it wants to stay relevant in a fully electrified global automotive market.

If you can’t win at home….

BMW Group (10.5%, down from 10.6% in May) remained in the runner-up position in June, while #3 Stellantis is in its long hard road to hell (9.2% in June vs. 9.5% in May). With too many brands and too little money to develop them, maybe it would be good to sell a couple of them? Say, Lancia and Maserati? Both storied makes need attention and lots of money in order for them to develop and flourish, and right now, these two items are in short supply at Stellantis….

And do something about DS. Either reintegrate it into Citroen, or make it a proper premium brand. But for that, you will need patience and money. After all, making a successful French premium brand is something for decades, not years. Just look at what Renault is doing with Alpine.

But back to the top 5, Hyundai–Kia (7.9%, down from 8.1% in May) remained in 4th, but has seen Geely (7.8%, up 0.1%) get closer, and might threaten the Korean’s 4th position.

Despite seeing Volvo lose sales, Lynk & Co, Zeekr, and Polestar are compensating for the Swedish brand’s falling sales, thus keeping Geely on a growth path.

Finally, a note on the recent USA-EU tariff agreement.

Regarding EVs, it’s not as bad as it seems. Here’s how it works:

The EU didn’t want to impose tariffs on US-made cars because the biggest US exporters to the EU are … German brands. (BMW X5, Mercedes GLE, etc. are made in the US and exported here.) So it didn’t make sense to do that.

Regarding Tesla, things won’t change much. The Model Y is already made here in Germany. The Model 3 is cheaper to make in China than in the US, even with the tariffs on China as they stand.

Regarding the Cybertruck and Semi, the most important question isn’t the tariff or the price, but the regulations, which are different here in Europe. Thus, this difference in tariffs doesn’t make much difference to the viability of selling both in Europe.

The Model S and X could see their prices reduced, but it doesn’t solve their main problem: they are models that are more than 10 years old, and as such, not very competitive.

In conclusion, there will be a little more competition at the top end of the market, but the rest will be the same.

As for US buyers, there will be less choice. Cheaper models will probably be canceled, and the ones that stay will cost more. Still, most best selling European models in the USA are already made there, so … it’s not as bad as it seems.

And I am talking about the EV niche. Regarding the larger agreement, I am not an expert on trade, but personally, both options (going to a trade war or trying to reach an agreement) were worse than what was there before. You can choose one or the other; I’m not a politician, so I don’t have to choose. 😄

But have no doubt, neither of the two options are better than what was there before. Whoever says otherwise either doesn’t know, or is a politician looking for easy votes.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-06-Europe-OG-Image-1600x890-1.png,N,,2025-08-03 12:05:10.615220

Political realignments in state regulatory bodies, particularly public utility commissions (PUCs) and energy agencies, are redefining the rules of the game for clean energy investors. These changes are not just policy tweaks; they are strategic recalibrations that could either accelerate the clean energy transition or create a patchwork of regulatory hurdles. For investors, understanding this evolving landscape is critical to navigating opportunities and mitigating risks.

The Rise of Performance-Based Regulation: A Game Changer

State PUCs are increasingly adopting performance-based regulation (PBR), a framework that ties utility profits to metrics like renewable energy deployment, grid resilience, and energy efficiency. This marks a departure from traditional cost-of-service models, which rewarded utilities for building more infrastructure regardless of environmental impact.

In 2025, 30+ states are piloting or expanding PBR programs, with jurisdictions like Hawaii, Illinois, and New York leading the charge. These models incentivize utilities to invest in solar, storage, and grid modernization while penalizing reliance on fossil fuels. For example, Hawaii's PBR framework rewards utilities for achieving 100% renewable energy targets, while New York's PBR includes penalties for grid failures during extreme weather events.

Investors in companies like NextEra Energy (NEE) and Enphase Energy (ENPH)—which provide grid modernization and renewable infrastructure—stand to benefit from PBR-driven demand for clean tech. However, this shift also creates risks for traditional utility stocks tied to legacy infrastructure.

Federal Rollbacks and State-Level Pushback

While the federal government has rolled back climate policies under Executive Orders like Unleashing American Energy, state energy agencies are doubling down on clean energy in response. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has provided a lifeline, offering $369 billion in clean energy incentives that states are now leveraging to offset federal inaction.

For instance, California and New York have used IRA funding to fast-track offshore wind projects and EV charging networks, while states like Colorado and Minnesota are expanding community solar programs. These efforts are supported by PBR frameworks that align utility profits with decarbonization goals.

Yet, the patchwork of state policies introduces complexity. A clean energy project approved in New York might face delays in Texas due to differing regulatory priorities. Investors must now evaluate opportunities on a state-by-state basis, factoring in local PUC dynamics and political climates.

The Deregulation Dilemma: Risks for Renewable Energy

The Trump administration's 2025 executive orders—such as eliminating subsidies for wind and solar, imposing tariffs on imported energy components, and streamlining fossil fuel permitting—pose significant risks. These policies are mirrored at the state level in conservative-leaning regions, where agencies are prioritizing domestic oil and gas over renewables.

For example, the administration's “zero-based regulatory budgeting” approach has led to the expiration of long-term clean energy incentives in states like Wyoming and North Dakota. Meanwhile, tariffs on solar panels and wind turbine parts have increased project costs, making renewables less competitive against natural gas.

Investors in solar and wind companies must now weigh the potential of states like California and New York against the regulatory headwinds in others. Companies like First Solar (FSLR) and Vestas Wind Systems (ENR.DC) are seeing mixed performance, with growth in progressive states offsetting declines elsewhere.

Strategic Investment Opportunities in a Fragmented Landscape

Despite the challenges, state-level policy shifts are creating new avenues for innovation. Here's how investors can position themselves:

Grid Modernization and Energy Storage:

PBR frameworks prioritize grid resilience and flexibility, driving demand for companies like Tesla (TSLA) (via its Powerwall and Megapack) and Fluence (FLOU). Investors should monitor PBR adoption rates in their target states.

State-Specific ETFs and Funds:

Diversify across regions by investing in state-focused ETFs like the iShares MSCI New York Index (EWN) or iShares MSCI California Index (EZUC), which capture exposure to states with aggressive clean energy agendas.

Environmental Justice and Equity-Focused Projects:

States like Illinois and New Mexico are using IRA funds to subsidize low-income electrification programs and community solar. Companies like Sunrun (RUN) and SunPower (SPWR) are well-positioned to benefit.

Hybrid Energy Models:

In deregulated states, companies that combine renewables with fossil fuels (e.g., Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) investing in carbon capture) may gain regulatory favor.

Navigating the Risks

The biggest risk lies in overexposure to states with anti-clean energy policies. For example, the Department of the Interior's centralized permitting process under Secretary Doug Burgum has stalled solar projects in Utah and Nevada. Investors should avoid companies reliant on federal permitting in conservative states and instead focus on states with stable regulatory frameworks.

The EV sector also faces headwinds. With federal subsidies for EVs eliminated, companies like Tesla may see slower adoption in states that haven't stepped in to fill the gap. However, states like California and Massachusetts are offering their own incentives, creating a split in market potential.

Conclusion: The State of the Future

The clean energy transition is no longer a monolithic federal initiative—it's a mosaic of state-level experiments. While federal rollbacks create uncertainty, state PUCs and energy agencies are stepping up to fill the void. For investors, this means both opportunities and risks, depending on where they choose to allocate capital.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 19:00:22.880459

Here are five e-bike brands you can shop that prioritize U.S.-based manufacturing.
Electric Bike Company is an incredibly transparent e-bike company, with a whole video outlining exactly how each bike is crafted and detailing the behind-the-scenes action.
Hi Power Cycles is another fantastic e-bike brand to look into if you're prioritizing goods from America.
When you take the time to find an e-bike manufactured in America, like Co-Motion Cycles e-bikes, you're making life easier on your future self when you potentially need to fix or replace parts to extend the life of your e-bike.","Finding an item that's fully made in America can be like trying to find a needle in a haystack. If you look closely at most of the major e-bike brands in the U.S., you'll see that a lot of the companies assemble their e-bikes in the United States, but the parts used to assemble them are often manufactured in other countries.

E-bikes from these major retailers aren't necessarily bad bikes — many of them are among the best electric bikes you can buy right now. However, if you're looking to support the American economy by investing in an e-bike that's both manufactured and assembled in America, you should steer clear of most big-name brands.

Meanwhile, other brands have prioritized keeping the manufacturing process within the States. This doesn't mean that certain raw materials needed to craft an e-bike aren't imported from other countries — the U.S. simply doesn't have access to all the raw materials needed — but instead, it means that as much of the manufacturing and assembly process as possible is completed in America. Here are five e-bike brands you can shop that prioritize U.S.-based manufacturing.

According to Electric Bike Company, every e-bike is built to order in Southern California, from the frame to the fenders, to the coats of paint, and almost everything in between. In addition to making sure everything is customized just the way you want it, the company says it prioritizes building in America to ensure the e-bikes don't receive any unnecessary markups due to importation, and also to allow the team to ""cherry-pick materials and accessories from suppliers around the world.""

After the bike is assembled by Electric Bike Company in the U.S., it's then inspected and tested in America as well before finally being delivered to the customer's door. Electric Bike Company is an incredibly transparent e-bike company, with a whole video outlining exactly how each bike is crafted and detailing the behind-the-scenes action.

The fenders and chain guards used in Electric Bike Company's e-bikes are made with real walnut and maple wood. Each rim is hand-spoked and then run through a machine to ensure each individual spoke is at the perfect tension, allowing for even wear on the tires. Even the e-bike batteries are assembled in America, too.

Bike Friday has manufactured its e-bikes in America for over 33 years, and the company doesn't have any plans to change this strategy in the future. According to Bike Friday, ""over 95% of the bike industry has moved production overseas,"" making its commitment to stay in the U.S. even more impressive.

The company is required to source some parts from other countries because there's no manufacturer or raw materials available in America right now. This includes parts like tires, chains, and shifters, but nearly everything else is made or assembled in the U.S., specifically in Eugene, Oregon.

American-made e-bikes like these may never earn the title of best budget e-bike, as materials and wages tend to be higher in the U.S. compared to many of the Asian countries that other big e-bike brands use to outsource manufacturing. But if you're looking to support the American economy and help fund living wages for local jobs, Bike Friday is certainly worth that premium.

Hi Power Cycles is another fantastic e-bike brand to look into if you're prioritizing goods from America. The company was founded in 2008 by two brothers, Chris and Derek Hunt, and despite adding multiple new team members since its founding, Hi Power Cycles has always crafted each bike from scratch in a Los Angeles warehouse. The company writes, ""We take great pride in our company, our commitment to customer service, [and] our commitment to manufacturing in the USA, and it shows in the products we sell.""

In a Reddit comment from Chris with Hi Power Cycles, he specifies that as much as possible is done in the U.S., which includes mitering, welding, heat treating, powder coating, and otherwise creating the aluminum frames. He goes on to explain that the battery systems are welded and packaged in America, and the wheel spokes are hand-cut and cold-rolled to size here, too.

Unfortunately, not all components can be sourced in America, but Hi Power Cycles doesn't try to hide this. Chris explains that the e-bike motors come from China, only because ""no one makes any bike motors we have access to in the USA."" That said, Hi Power Cycles is currently ""looking for a potential grant ... to manufacture [its] own motors,"" so this could be another component to add to the American-made list in the future.

There are many things you should know before buying an e-bike, but perhaps one that's not mentioned as frequently as it should be is knowing where your e-bike is made. Of course, the holy grail for supporting your local economy is finding a company that manufactures and assembles its e-bikes in America.

While this is a positive choice in its own right, there's an added perk to American-made bikes: They're often easier to source replacement parts for. When you take the time to find an e-bike manufactured in America, like Co-Motion Cycles e-bikes, you're making life easier on your future self when you potentially need to fix or replace parts to extend the life of your e-bike.

Co-Motion Cycles has been making e-bikes in America for the last 30 years, with a factory nestled in Eugene, Oregon. The company prides itself on hand-crafting high-quality results, saying, ""Every bike we make is for an important person who has cast their vote for quality. For American manufacturing. ... For a real human touch from start to finish."" That said, an e-bike from Co-Motion Cycles will cost you a pretty penny. For example, the Metolius e-tandem bike starts at $18,495.

Another company with a proud ""Made in the USA"" title is Detroit Bikes. The company makes both traditional bikes and e-bikes, and the entire U.S. Chromoly line of bikes is crafted in America. Detroit Bikes does sell a few entry-level bikes that are largely manufactured in China, and then assembled in the company's factory. However, frames in the U.S. Chromoly line utilize a high-end steel material called chromoly and are all made in America.

In a large 50,000-square-foot factory in Detroit, the company does ""complete assembly and wheel building on [its] US Assembly bikes,"" ultimately producing up to 150 frames and assembling up to 400 bikes every single day. At the factory, bikes made with chromoly are ""cut, coped, bent, welded, painted, assembled, and packaged."" If you're ever in Detroit, you can even visit the factory to see how bikes are made and potentially view all the production stages for yourself.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/5-e-bike-brands-that-are-manufactured-in-america/l-intro-1753786505.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 12:04:33.626713

The company added production sites in Georgia to meet demand, company official Scott Moskowitz told EnergySage.
Solar accounted for about 7% of all U.S. electricity generation last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association and S&P Global.
""Solar equals energy independence,"" Texas-based Solartime USA owner Martyna Kowalczyk told EnergySage.","Cleaner solar energy technology is increasingly being made stateside with wide-reaching economic benefits, according to industry experts.

Their comments were part of an EnergySage report that highlighted optimism in the industry — shared among large companies and family-owned businesses alike — despite federal policy changes that will sunset tax incentives early.

""It's kind of the American dream,"" Gold Path Solar co-founder Alex Hay told EnergySage.

The leader of the Ohio-based company said that ""going solar"" is now akin to home ownership. The constantly improving, high-tech panels that convert sunrays into electricity are part of a job-creating sector that can reduce or eliminate household utility bills.

EnergySage is a trusted resource that can help you navigate all the incentives — local, state, and federal — to ensure you get the best price for adding panels to your property. The experts can even help you compare quotes from pro installers. Savings can reach up to $10,000 off the upfront costs.

The expert advice is timely, as the so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill"" ends 30% federal tax credits early on Dec. 31, according to NPR. But the sun will come out tomorrow, the experts interviewed by EnergySage reported.

""All the things that people tend to associate with American values — that's what solar is,"" Hay said in the story, referencing the free market and solar's ability to provide energy independence.

QCell, with American headquarters in California, is the country's second-largest solar manufacturer behind First Solar. The company added production sites in Georgia to meet demand, company official Scott Moskowitz told EnergySage.

""Slowly but surely, this stuff is getting reshored. And in some cases, there's incentive to do it directly. Ideally, there will be solar factories all over the country,"" the vice president of marketing strategy and industry affairs said.

The report noted that the United States has risen from 14th to third on the list of global solar manufacturers. It's a sector that has created more than 263,000 jobs nationwide. Solar accounted for about 7% of all U.S. electricity generation last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association and S&P Global.

EnergySage offers a mapping tool that allows customers to view the average cost of systems by capacity in each state. It's not uncommon for sizable setups to be priced at more than $30,000. That's why action to lock in rebates before they expire is paramount. Investments from foreign companies to manufacture panels in America, combined with breakthrough technology from around the world that improves efficiency and longevity, can help lower costs.

Solar panels have multiple benefits in addition to reducing electricity expenses. If the power is stored in a battery such as Tesla's Powerwall, homeowners can use it later, serving as outage protection. Panel owners participating in virtual power plants can sell the extra energy back to the grid. What's more, you can use free solar power to charge your electric vehicle, too.

Renewable energy is produced without heat-trapping air pollution, which, according to NASA's experts, is linked to increased risks of blackout-causing severe weather, heatwaves, and floods. Some places may even become uninhabitable due to the high temperatures, per the researchers.

By investing in solar, you can take control of your electricity source and reduce the amount of planet-warming gases being released from dirty fuels.

""Solar equals energy independence,"" Texas-based Solartime USA owner Martyna Kowalczyk told EnergySage. The business is family-owned.

“The company expressed intent to hold that against the economics of joining a (regional transmission organization),” Gilman said.
Joining forces with the California operator would give Xcel Energy broader access to cleaner forms of energy, Turner added.
Blank said the push by some parties to steer Xcel Energy to EDAM rather than the other marketplace would make integrating systems across Colorado difficult.
The Westminster-based utility is in the process of joining the Southwest Power Pool’s regional transmission organization.","Despite concerns from its staff, consumer and conservation groups, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission has endorsed a plan by Xcel Energy to join a new regional marketplace for wholesale electricity.

Two of the three PUC members voiced support in a hearing Wednesday for Xcel’s application to join the Southwest Power Pool’s Markets+, a so-called day-ahead market being formed by the Arkansas-based transmission organization and about 30 organizations.

The commission will issue a written order.

The new marketplace will allow Xcel and other utilities to buy power a day ahead, aimed at keeping electricity flowing more efficiently and cost-effectively. Xcel’s joining a day-ahead market is considered a step toward moving to an organized wholesale market, which a state law requires Colorado transmission utilities to do by 2030. The motivation is to coordinate resources across the region, get more renewable energy on the grid to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meet growing demands for electricity.

However, Megan Gilman, the commissioner who opposed Xcel’s application, contended the utility failed to show, as required by PUC rules, that the benefits of joining Markets+ outweighed the costs. She voiced concerns that the cost of joining the day-ahead market, seen as a temporary step, could delay or derail Xcel’s move to an organized wholesale market.

An organized wholesale market is a centrally managed organization that facilitates the buying and selling of electricity and other services across a region. A 2021 PUC report said utilities’ full participation in that kind of market or a regional transmission organization could produce savings of $230 million annually.

About 60% of the nation’s electric power supply is managed by regional organizations, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, most of that is in the East.

PUC Chairman Eric Blank said he is focused on the potential of saving millions of dollars per year as the purchase and transmission of power become more coordinated across the region.

“For me, incurring these small losses in the near term potentially creates an opportunity to save orders of magnitude more per year,” Blank said. “Although we’re a long, long way from realizing this level of savings, it seems worth trying to me.”

But Gilman noted the law requiring transmission utilities to eventually join a more centralized market allows for waivers. She said Xcel could cite the costs of joining the day-ahead market as a reason for seeking a waiver.

“The company expressed intent to hold that against the economics of joining a (regional transmission organization),” Gilman said.

Xcel, Colorado’s largest electricity provider, said in documents filed with the PUC that the costs of participating in Markets+ will include $2 million for the first phase of starting the organization; $14 million annually for operations for the first five years, then $10 million per year; and an estimated $13 million to $15 million for Xcel to integrate its systems with the marketplace.

The conservation group Western Resource Advocates said in a statement filed in the case that testimony showed Xcel’s costs would exceed net benefits by $30 million through 2032 and cumulative benefits wouldn’t surpass cumulative costs until 2039. For the company’s customers to reap any benefits, Xcel would have to stay in Markets+ through 2038, the group said.

“This means the company would also presumably have to delay the 2030 requirement to join an (organized wholesale market) by nine years,” Western Resource Advocates said.

The PUC staff said Xcel’s application didn’t meet the requirement that joining the marketplace is in the public interest because the company couldn’t show that the expected benefits would outweigh the costs. The staff noted that Xcel witnesses conceded during a hearing that joining Markets+ and recovering the costs for technology upgrades “will result in increased production costs through at least 2038.”

Considering the costs, staffers said it would be reasonable for the commission to deny the application. If the application is approved, the staff recommended monitoring the costs, reliability of the market and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to determine whether Xcel’s continued participation in the marketplace would be warranted.

In the public interest?

“We believe this decision was not in the best interests of ratepayers, grid reliability, or the state’s clean energy goals. And legally, the decision does not appear to be based on the law or the Commission’s own rules, and we will be asking the Commission to reconsider,” Brian Turner, regulatory director at Advanced Energy United, said in an email.

The industry group believes a better path for Xcel Energy would be to join Extended Day-Ahead Market, or EDAM, which is operated by the California Independent System Operator. The organization manages the operation of the electricity transmission grid across California and is also involved in a marketplace across 11 Western states.

The extended day-ahead market is set to launch in 2026, according to the California operator’s website. A report by the Environmental Defense Fund in June said Xcel Energy could save an average of $13.2 million a year if it joined EDAM instead of the Southwest Power Pool’s Markets+. One reason is more availability of renewable energy.

Turner said a bill is moving through the California legislature that would transfer the governing structure of the California Independent System Operator to a separate organization. The current board of directors is appointed by the California governor, but that would change if the legislation passes.

Joining forces with the California operator would give Xcel Energy broader access to cleaner forms of energy, Turner added.

Blank said the push by some parties to steer Xcel Energy to EDAM rather than the other marketplace would make integrating systems across Colorado difficult. Others suggested that Xcel forego participating in a day-ahead market altogether and plan for joining a regional organization.

“At a time when the demand for electricity is outpacing supply in Downstate Illinois, more energy needs to be generated and connected to the grid faster to provide reliability and cost saving benefits for our customers,” said Lenny Singh, Chairman and President of Ameren Illinois. “Thanks to a provision in the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, the Peoria Solar Energy Center – alongside our two other solar facilities in East St. Louis – will produce clean, reliable, and equitable energy in the community, for the community.

The facility will be constructed on a 37-acre site on Prichard Road in northwest Peoria and feature nearly 5,000 solar panels which will harness energy from the sun and feed clean power onto Ameren Illinois’ distribution system.

The Peoria Solar Energy Center is a continuation of Ameren Illinois’ commitment to powering a stronger regional economy.

Imagine waking up every day and being told your very existence is a threat — your pickup, your tractor, your job, your way of life. For the past 15 years, that’s exactly what Washington’s climate elite have been selling to the American people. And now, finally, someone had the guts to tear up the script.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s decision to reverse its 2009 “Endangerment Finding” is more than a policy change. It’s a moment of truth. It’s a line in the sand where fear-mongering ends and common sense begins.

This so-called finding claimed that carbon dioxide — the gas we exhale, the same one that feeds the crops we grow — was a dangerous pollutant. And with that one bureaucratic ruling, Washington handed itself the power to regulate nearly every corner of the American economy. Farms. Trucks. Factories. Power plants. All under the guise of “saving the planet.”

Let me put it this way: It’s like declaring water a hazard because someone once slipped in a puddle. It gave the government an excuse to micromanage how much water you use, when you use it, and how much you’ll pay for it.

That’s exactly what happened with carbon.

We weren’t fighting pollution. We were fighting a narrative. A doomsday narrative wrapped in scientific jargon, funded by taxpayer dollars, and peddled by people who’ve never had to fill a diesel tank or check a thermostat during a polar vortex. While they held conferences and got awards, we got mandates, fines and higher bills.

But this reversal? It’s the sound of sanity returning.

This doesn’t mean we’re throwing trash in rivers or going backward on clean air. Quite the opposite. America already leads the world in emissions reductions without draconian controls. Our air is cleaner not because of fear-driven policies, but because of real innovation by real people.

Scrapping the Endangerment Finding says loud and clear: Carbon is not the enemy. Tyranny wrapped in lab coats is.

Let’s talk about what this means for real people:

For farmers, it means no longer being painted as climate villains for growing food.

For truckers and factory workers, it means fewer senseless rules designed by people who couldn’t change a tire if their life depended on it.

For families, it means maybe affording to keep the lights on and gas in the tank without choosing between dinner and heat.

And for all of us, it means reclaiming our right to debate, to question, and to stop being ruled by worst-case scenarios disguised as settled science.

The fear peddlers will scream. They’ll say we’re anti-science, reckless, even dangerous. But here’s the truth they don’t want to admit: When everything is an emergency, nothing is.

Science is a tool, not a weapon. It’s not supposed to be used to scare people into submission. It’s supposed to inform, to guide, and to help us weigh costs and consequences. And when science becomes dogma, that’s not progress. It’s just a fancier form of tyranny.

The EPA’s move is a win for the working class, for rural America, for anyone who’s tired of being lectured by people who’ve never set foot in the real world. It’s a long-overdue shift from feelings back to facts.

Thomas Sowell wrote: “When you want to help people, you tell them the truth. When you want to help yourself, you tell them what they want to hear.”

We’ve had enough of being told what we want to hear. It’s time we start telling the truth again. America works best when it trusts its people.

Rather than denying climate change is occurring, Prof Carlson said: “What they’re trying to say instead is, ‘Well, it’s not so bad.","– A new report from the US Department of Energy says projections of future global warming are exaggerated, while benefits from higher levels of carbon dioxide such as more productive farms are overlooked.

It concludes, at odds with the scientific mainstream, that policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions risk doing more harm than good.

Released on July 28, the report is part of an effort by the Trump administration to try to end the US government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases. It is the output of scientists known for contradicting the consensus embodied in volumes of research by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose work is approved by virtually every nation.

Publishing an alternate approach to the science of global warming on the same day that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it

plans to revoke the endangerment finding

– a determination that greenhouse gases harm public health and welfare – marks a step-up in the administration’s war on regulations.

Since its adoption in 2009, the endangerment finding has become the bedrock of many US environmental rules.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said repealing the finding would “end US$1 trillion (S$1.3 trillion) or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families”.

Climate experts say it will hobble the country’s efforts to rein in rising temperatures and lessen the impacts, such as more intense storms, droughts and wildfires. The federal government’s own research shows

climate-fuelled extreme weather

is already causing US$150 billion in losses a year in the US.

In its proposed rule to nix the finding, the EPA references the Energy Department’s report more than two dozen times. Energy Secretary Chris Wright wrote in the report’s foreword that he had commissioned it and selected the authors to form a working group.

The agency’s support for the contrarian research stands in contrast to the broad rollback of other climate work under US President Donald Trump.

Since his inauguration in January 2025, hundreds of scientists

have been dismissed from agencies

, including some who had focused on climate change. The EPA recently moved to shutter its main scientific research arm, which has been a crucial tool for policymaking.

The US

cancelled a landmark climate change report

, the sixth National Climate Assessment, and has taken down numerous webpages on climate science. Some of those were related to previous National Climate Assessments – studies that hundreds of researchers spent years painstakingly compiling.

The new report’s authors include Dr Steven Koonin, a fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution who has argued that climate science is “unsettled”; Dr Roy Spencer, a University of Alabama in Huntsville scientist and senior fellow at the climate-denying group Cornwall Alliance; and Dr Judith Curry, a climatologist formerly of Georgia Tech who testified to a Senate committee in 2023 that climate change has been mischaracterised as a crisis.

An Energy Department spokesman said the report’s authors “represent diverse viewpoints and political backgrounds and are all well-respected and highly credentialed individuals”.

The spokesman added that the report “was reviewed internally by a group of Energy Department scientific researchers and policy experts from the Office of Science and National Labs”, and that there will be a 30-day comment period for the public to weigh in.

Professor Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, said the report presents a series of arguments the administration can draw on to contend “public health and welfare is not endangered by emissions that come from the auto sector, from the trucking sector, from the electricity sector”.

Rather than denying climate change is occurring, Prof Carlson said: “What they’re trying to say instead is, ‘Well, it’s not so bad. It’s really expensive to mitigate. And that expense actually harms people more than anything we could do to slow it down.’”

That is in keeping with past comments by members of Mr Trump’s Cabinet that have downplayed global warming or public concern about it.

Prof Carlson said the report is “a wholesale assault” on climate science and previous policy.

Dr Zeke Hausfather, the climate lead at Stripe and a research scientist at non-profit Berkeley Earth, has contributed to major US and international climate reports. He described the Energy Department publication as “scattershot” and said it “would not pass muster in any traditional scientific peer review process”.

That the administration released it after taking down webpages hosting “the actual, congressionally mandated National Climate Assessments”, he said, is “a farce”.

The report is a “package of punches” against the scientific consensus that previously grounded US climate policy, and against that policy itself, said Dr Jennifer Jacquet, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami. “It’s really surreal to think that’s where we are in 2025.”

The EPA will have to go through the lengthy federal rulemaking process to try to abolish the endangerment finding. If the proposed rule is finalised, legal challenges are inevitable. The issue could end up before the Supreme Court, which ruled in 2007’s Massachusetts v EPA that greenhouse gases were pollutants the EPA could regulate under the Clean Air Act.

Getting the court, which now has a conservative supermajority, to overturn the 2007 decision may be the endgame, said Prof Carlson. The effort would be risky but could succeed, she said.

“I think on every front, the arguments that the (EPA) administrator is going to make – based on the Energy Department report – are extremely weak,” said Prof Carlson. “But we also have a court that’s very hostile to environmental regulation.” BLOOMBERG",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fe7e295a640a39689de6dab66b35ecbf16f28f3a12cdceede6a721ce9e0f87c2,N,,2025-08-03 12:04:25.184874

Appointing someone with industry ties to a board that is supposed to protect the public from utility wrongdoing “reflects incredibly poorly on Governor Whitmer”, said Chris Gilmer-Hill, policy associate with the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition non-profit.
Whitmer appointed Carreon to the MPSC board in July 2023 to fill a partial term.
Environmental groups in June lambasted the decision, which they alleged came amid pressure from DTE and Consumers Energy, Michigan’s second largest utility monopoly.
“We need an MPSC that’s willing to say no to the utilities, otherwise we mess things up for decades,” Gilmer-Hill said.","Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has effectively ousted a clean energy advocate from serving on a board that regulates the state’s energy utilities monopoly, and replaced her with someone who environmental groups charge is an “industry ally”, campaigners say.

The groups allege the move was made at utility giant DTE Energy’s behest because it was unhappy with Michigan public services commission (MPSC) board member Alessandra Carreon’s position on clean energy and opposition to rate increases, among other issues.

Each MPSC board vote is important because the commission is made up of three gubernatorial appointees, and Whitmer’s decision amid a debate over rate increases could slow the state’s ambitious clean energy transition and lead to higher energy bills, opponents warn.

The decision marks the latest in a series of environmental controversies for Whitmer, a Democrat whose name has been discussed as a potential leading candidate for the party’s nominee for president in 2028, but now faces increasing scrutiny over her record.

Appointing someone with industry ties to a board that is supposed to protect the public from utility wrongdoing “reflects incredibly poorly on Governor Whitmer”, said Chris Gilmer-Hill, policy associate with the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition non-profit.

“This is part of this pattern of this administration being very quick to give utilities what they want and not giving Michiganders what they need,” Gilmer-Hill added.

Whitmer appointed Carreon to the MPSC board in July 2023 to fill a partial term. Among other causes, Carreon was an advocate for greater public involvement in and transparency around the arcane regulatory process for utilities at a time when public frustration over DTE’s poor service and high rates has steadily mounted.

In a highly unusual move, the governor announced in June that she would not renew Carreon’s appointment. Environmental groups in June lambasted the decision, which they alleged came amid pressure from DTE and Consumers Energy, Michigan’s second largest utility monopoly.

“My understanding is that DTE and Consumers were very unhappy with recent decisions the commission has made around the utilities’ profit margin,” Charlotte Jameson, chief policy officer of the Michigan Environmental Council, told the Detroit News at the time.

Many of the state’s top environmental groups signed an 18 June letter to Whitmer that stated they were “deeply concerned” with the decision not to renew Carreon’s appointment and potentially replace her with someone who has “clear conflicts of interest or strong industry allegiances”. They urged the governor to reconsider.

Whitmer did not. In mid-July, she appointed Shaquila Myers, who, during the 2023-2024 legislative session, was chief of staff for former Michigan House speaker Joe Tate, a pro-business Democrat. He faced a stunning revolt from his own party in December because he generally refused to allow votes on legislation opposed by big business, and was seen by many as hostile towards environmental causes.

Despite a chorus of calls for change, Tate did not allow multiple utility reform bills to move through the legislature.

“There was a quiet, steady refusal to do anything but ignore [utility] bills,” said Rachel Hood, a former Democratic state representative who served with Tate last session, and has worked on energy policy in Michigan for nearly 20 years.

Hood characterized Myers as “not just an industry ally”, but also “deeply enmeshed in the governor’s policy agenda”.

“And it’s clear that the governor is pushing DTE’s agenda to the best of her ability,” Hood said.

DTE and Consumers are among the state’s powerful political forces. The former, either via the company, its employees or its affiliated dark money non-profit, has given millions of dollars in campaign donations to Whitmer or the state Democratic party over her two terms.

Meanwhile, a 2022 analysis found DTE had donated to all but 10 of 148 state legislators the previous session. Amid furor over prolonged power outages that left hundreds of thousands of people in Michigan without power for days in late 2023, DTE’s affiliated dark money non-profit gave Tate $100,000. Tate would not let a 2023 reform bill aimed at improving accountability and affordability be introduced in committee.

“This is Michigan’s powerful political entities acting to maintain their way of life and their balance sheets,” said Hood.

Meanwhile, Tate and Whitmer ushered through a datacenter bill that may derail Michigan’s climate goals.

Whitmer’s office did not comment, but a Whitmer spokesperson sent statements on behalf of DTE and Consumers. The utilities separately sent their own statements in which they both denied involvement in the process.

In its statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “Our team at DTE works collaboratively with the MPSC commissioners and staff to ensure we’re providing safe, reliable, cleaner and affordable energy to our customers and the state of Michigan.”

The move comes at a particularly critical juncture. The MPSC is weighing over $1bn in proposed rate increases between the two companies, and each are slated to deliver to the MPSC formal long-term plans for delivering power. Commissioners have the power to shape those proposals with decisions about billions of dollars in infrastructure.

The MPSC has not allowed a DTE proposal to build a methane plant, and advocates fear that decision could be reversed with Myers on the board, Gilmer-Hill said.

Meanwhile, the utilities are negotiating datacenter deals that could result in dramatic cost increases to customers and take a toll on the environment if they are not checked by the MPSC, Gilmer-Hill added.

“We need an MPSC that’s willing to say no to the utilities, otherwise we mess things up for decades,” Gilmer-Hill said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f58ef0e0619a1269c21d9833633ff2df42907861/1431_222_4156_3324/master/4156.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50e0ce0fc6ea9fa97e20b507363e5d7e",N,,2025-08-03 08:02:28.661825

Last month, a Maryland federal district court ruled on another lawsuitagainst the EPA concerning canceled environmental justice grants.
Of the $2.8 billion in funding initially available for the environmental and climate justice program, about $500 million has not yet been obligated.","A coalition of nonprofits, tribes, and local governments is suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the termination of $2.8 billion in environmental and climate justice grants for disadvantaged communities.

One member of that coalition is located a few miles off the coast of the Bering Sea. The Native Village of Kipnuk (Qipneq), Alaska, is built on thawing permafrost. Qipneq means ‘bend’ in the Native Yup’ik language, referring to the village’s location along the meandering Kugkaktlik River.

In recent years, high water has become a common phenomenon in Kipnuk, as the riverbanks become destabilized by melting permafrost, flooding, and erosion. Stronger storms in the region exacerbate damage to the village’s infrastructure.

The Native Village of Kipnuk is a federally recognized Tribe with around 1,700 members, including about 800 members who live along the river in Kipnuk. The Tribe relies on the surrounding land for subsistence living, and historically, members moved around the region following a nomadic lifestyle. But after the government built a school along the Kugkaktlik River in the 1930s, many families moved to the village of Kipnuk.

Today, erosion rates along the riverbank are between 10–28 feet a year, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director. And despite a number of assessments having been conducted in Kipnuk by the state and federal government over the past 15 years, the Tribe has yet to see any action to protect their community from high water.

“There’s been so many assessments that our tribe is getting tired of them,” said Paul. “They just want some action done.”

Earlier this year, it appeared that action might be on the horizon. Kipnuk was awarded a $20 million Community Change Grant under a $3 billion program from the EPA to carry out environmental and climate justice projects across the country. That program made $2.8 billion available for direct financial assistance to communities, local governments, and tribes. Kipnuk would use the money to address erosion along a stretch of riverbank that houses the community’s critical infrastructure, including the wind turbines that generate power, fuel tanks, several buildings, and the boardwalk connecting them.

The award was finalized in early January 2025, and Kipnuk’s project start date was set for March 1 of 2025. When the funds were made available in early March, Paul hired a bookkeeper to keep track of grant spending and posted a job vacancy for a project manager. But a few days later, the project’s funding flow was turned off as part of President Donald Trump’s federal funding freeze. By May, the Trump administration had terminated the EPA’s environmental and climate justice grant program altogether.

For Paul, who also worked to put together the grant application in 2024, receiving the termination letter less than two months into starting the project was a significant blow. Amidst frozen funds and the grant cancellation, Paul has still not been compensated for her time, including the months she put in leading up to the award. Relaying the news about the grant cancellation to the rest of the community has been “discouraging,” Paul said.

“Everyone I’ve spoken to was like, ‘Oh man, what are we gonna do now?’ Their hopes fell,” Paul said.

Since May, the Native Village of Kipnuk and more than twenty others who have had their grants canceled have signed onto a class action lawsuit against the EPA and the Trump-appointed administrator, Lee Zeldin. The lawsuit, which was filed June 25, will be heard in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia August 5.

Broken Promises

The town of Clinchco, Virginia, is at the heart of Dickenson County along the McClure River in the southwest corner of the state. It’s among a number of former coal camps in the region dealing with the economic impact of the coal industry’s decline: the town’s poverty rate was over 40 percent at the last U.S. Census. For the population of around 300, building resiliency is made more complicated by floodwaters from increasingly intense storms, including Hurricane Helene.

During a series of listening sessions over the past several months, Clinchco residents dreamed up a multifaceted approach to economic and disaster resilience. They envisioned a new green space along the McClure River that would mitigate flooding and serve as a local dog park. They also started designing a resiliency hub equipped with backup power and emergency supplies for shelter in times of need.

Clinchco is one of five rural communities in southwest Virginia included in a $500,000 grant to the nonprofit advocacy group Appalachian Voices, which hosted the listening sessions.

The grant money comes from the EPA’s now-canceled environmental and climate justice program, the same pool of funding as for the grant awarded to Kipnuk.

Appalachian Voices held more than a dozen listening sessions with residents across the region to plan community-level projects that would be paid for by the EPA grant. Clinchco had requested approximately $40,000 for start-up costs associated with engineering designs, surveys, and permitting to pursue the resiliency projects.

Like others in the region, those projects are now “dead in the water,” according to Tina Deel, Clinchco Clerk of Council.

“It’s just heartbreaking,” said Deel. Without the grant money, Clinchco cannot afford to build the green space and resiliency hub on its own. Appalachian Voices’ new economy program manager Emma Kelly said that even with the help of state and private funding, projects like the one in Clinchco have been set back years.

“It was a lot of effort to get this initial application in, and now that’s all gone, and there’s not a lot of time and energy left to do that again,” said Kelly. “This promise has been broken.”

In towns like Clinchco that voted heavily for Trump, Kelly described a “widespread sense of betrayal and confusion,” particularly among former coal miners and their families who had believed the administration would support their interests. Deel said that she and others in the town were shocked that the funding had been withdrawn. She said it’s not an action by the Trump administration that she or others support.

A Power of the Purse Argument

When the hearing begins on August 5, much of the plaintiffs’ case will rest on the separation of powers between the three branches of government. Under the U.S. Constitution, the plaintiffs will argue that the executive branch does not have the authority to make decisions over programs that have been authorized and funded by the legislative branch.

Hana Vizcarra is a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the firms representing plaintiffs in Appalachian Voices et al. v. EPA. She said plaintiffs will argue that the EPA, an agency under Trump’s executive branch, violated the legislative branch’s “power of the purse” by canceling its environmental and climate justice program, which Congress created in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and section 138 of the Clean Air Act.

“This administration is trying to take power it doesn’t have,” said Vizcarra.

Last month, a Maryland federal district court ruled on another lawsuitagainst the EPA concerning canceled environmental justice grants. Vizcarra said attorneys will cite that case, Green & Healthy Homes Initiatives, Inc., et al. v. EPA as part of their argument on August 5.

There, the court found that the federal government violated the law by canceling grants made to regional grantmaking organizations selected to administer smaller grants to tribes, local governments, and community-based organizations. The Green & Healthy Homes ruling, which has been appealed by the EPA, did not go so far as to mandate the reinstatement of canceled funding for the three grantees involved, but it did make clear that the EPA cannot lawfully cancel grants on the grounds that environmental justice isn’t a priority of the current administration.

Rebecca Kaduru is the president of the Institute for Sustainable Communities, a plaintiff in Appalachian Voices.

The Institute for Sustainable Communities was selected as a national grantmaker for a portfolio of community-level grants ranging from $75,000 to $350,000 under the environmental and climate justice program. Kaduru said she believes the Green & Healthy Homes ruling sets up her organization’s case because it re-establishes grantmakers in some regions while organizations in others, like hers, are facing grant cancellations.

“There’s no reason why some Americans should have access and others not,” said Kaduru. “All Americans should have access to small grants for clean air and clean water.”

While there are similarities between the cases, Vizcarra stressed the two lawsuits differ in scope. Appalachian Voices is a class action lawsuit seeking a reinstatement of grant funding for all awardees impacted by the EPA’s cancellation of the environmental and climate justice program, not just the plaintiffs listed on the case.

The EPA filed a motion to dismiss the Appalachian Voices on July 14, arguing that the case is moot due to Congress’s recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). The EPA did not respond to the Daily Yonder’s request for comment for this story.

Attorney Ben Grillot with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is also representing plaintiffs in the case, said the OBBB does not amend any laws, like the Clean Air Act, to retroactively bar money from being spent on environmental and climate justice projects.

“The big beautiful bill did not change that language. What it did do was rescind any unobligated funds, but all the grants that have been awarded are in fact still obligated,” said Grillot.

Of the $2.8 billion in funding initially available for the environmental and climate justice program, about $500 million has not yet been obligated. Approximately $2.3 billion has been obligated in the form of awards made to grantees across the country.

Among the plaintiffs living or working in rural communities, there are mixed emotions leading up to the August 5 hearing. While some are cautiously optimistic about the funding being restored, for others, the damage has already been done.

In Kipnuk, the construction season is limited by Alaska’s long winter. If funds were to turn back on after the hearing in August, the village would have about a month to begin working on the riverbank before having to pause until next spring. In the meantime, community members continue to grapple with the impacts of riverine erosion, thawing permafrost, and flooding from storms that can take up to an acre of land at a time.

When asked whether there was hope the funding would be restored after the court case, Tina Deel of Clinchco said, “We’re not holding our breaths.”",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-08-03 13:02:33.074319

Its EBITDA guidance, while conservative, is underpinned by a 1.7x leverage ratio and a disciplined approach to capital allocation.","In the shadow of a global manufacturing sector clawing its way out of a prolonged slump, Ingersoll Rand (NYSE: IR) has emerged as a standout industrial player, leveraging strategic acquisitions and operational discipline to position itself as a high-conviction growth story. With its 2025 EBITDA guidance lifted to $2,100 million to $2,160 million—a 4% to 7% increase year-over-year—and an aggressive M&A pipeline targeting life sciences and renewable energy, the company is betting big on the industrial renaissance. But is this momentum sustainable, and what does it mean for investors?

Strategic Momentum: M&A as a Catalyst for Growth

Ingersoll Rand's recent acquisitions—Lead Fluid, a Chinese fluid handling specialist, and Termomeccanica Industrial Compressor S.p.A. (TMIC), an Italian RNG compressor maker—underscore its focus on high-growth niches. These deals, part of a $47 million M&A push in Q2 2025, align with the company's “Economic Growth Engine” and “Execution Excellence (IRX)” strategies. The acquisitions not only diversify revenue streams but also plug gaps in its industrial technologies and life sciences portfolios, sectors poised to benefit from decarbonization and healthcare innovation.

The results are already materializing. The Industrial Technologies and Services (IT&S) segment reported a 7% year-over-year rise in orders, while the Precision and Science Technologies (P&ST) segment saw a 13% increase, despite organic order declines. These figures, coupled with a 16% growth in total backlog since 2024, suggest Ingersoll Rand is capturing market share in critical areas.

Financial Strength: Liquidity and Guidance Revisions

The company's financials tell a story of cautious optimism. With $3.9 billion in liquidity—$1.3 billion in cash and $2.6 billion in undrawn credit facilities—Ingersoll Rand is well-capitalized to fund its M&A ambitions and weather macroeconomic headwinds. Its 2025 EBITDA guidance, while modest, reflects confidence in its ability to offset margin pressures from integration costs and organic volume declines.

Notably, the company raised its full-year revenue outlook to a 4–6% growth range, up from 2–4%, citing strong order momentum and M&A synergies. This upward revision is significant in a sector where many peers are grappling with flat or declining demand.

Risks and Realities

No story is without shadows. Ingersoll Rand's adjusted EBITDA margin dipped to 27.0% in Q2 2025, down 0.4 percentage points year-over-year, due to lower organic volumes and acquisition-related dilution. The company also reported a GAAP net loss of $115 million, driven by non-cash impairments totaling $265.8 million. These losses, while non-recurring, highlight the risks of relying heavily on inorganic growth.

Moreover, the industrial equipment sector's PEG ratio of 83.4x suggests the market may be pricing in aggressive earnings growth. Investors must ask: Can Ingersoll Rand sustain margin expansion and justify its valuation premium? The answer lies in its ability to integrate acquisitions efficiently and maintain pricing power in a competitive landscape.

The Bigger Picture: Manufacturing's Quiet Revolution

The broader manufacturing sector is undergoing a transformation. Digital tools, AI-driven supply chains, and clean energy technologies are reshaping demand dynamics. Over 78% of manufacturers are investing in supply chain software, while hydrogen and electrification projects are accelerating. Ingersoll Rand's focus on RNG compressors and life sciences fluid handling positions it at the intersection of these trends.

Investment Thesis

For investors seeking exposure to the industrial renaissance, Ingersoll Rand offers a compelling mix of strategic agility and financial resilience. Its EBITDA guidance, while conservative, is underpinned by a 1.7x leverage ratio and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. The company's ability to navigate margin pressures while expanding its M&A pipeline—now more than halfway toward its annualized inorganic growth target—demonstrates operational rigor.

However, the path forward is not without challenges. Tariff uncertainties, supply chain bottlenecks, and macroeconomic volatility could test the company's resilience. For now, though, the fundamentals are in its favor.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 11:00:29.231866

Republican aversion to electric vehicles rose again after Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump fell out.
Fear of not being able to charge is a big reason many people hesitate to buy electric vehicles.","Sales of Teslas are plunging. General Motors and other automakers are increasing production of big pickups and sport utility vehicles. Republicans have killed incentives for electric vehicle purchases.

Electric vehicles have clearly lost momentum in the United States. And combustion engine cars and trucks are enjoying a renaissance to the dismay of environmentalists who worry about air pollution and greenhouse gases.

But there’s reason to believe that electric vehicles will remain a significant part of the U.S. car market and that sales of these models will eventually grow again in the coming months.

Electric vehicles from Tesla and some other automakers are less vulnerable to President Trump’s tariffs than many conventional cars because more of their parts are made in the United States. Advocacy groups are conducting marketing campaigns to emphasize the lower fuel costs and other advantages of electric vehicles. And automakers appear to realize that they cannot give up on electric cars if they hope to remain competitive globally.

Washington has become hostile to electric cars.

Government policy on electric vehicles has reversed since Mr. Trump was elected. For consumers, the most visible change is the elimination of tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric vehicle purchases and leases.

The credits, which Democrats put in place when Joseph R. Biden Jr. was president, will now expire at the end of September under the big policy and tax law that Mr. Trump signed in July.

The president in June described the federal incentives for electric vehicles as a “mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody wanted.” The Biden administration’s goal was for half of new car sales to be electric by the beginning of the next decade, meaning it would still have been easy to buy a gasoline car.

Analysts expect a spike in electric vehicle sales as people rush to take advantage of the credit, but a sharp decline afterward. By 2030, there will be 8.3 million fewer electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids on U.S. roads than there would have been if incentives had remained in place, according to a study led by Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor at Princeton University.

Republicans have also abolished penalties for violations of clean air standards, which had pushed carmakers to produce electric vehicles. That has given carmakers a green light to produce more big pickups and sport utility vehicles that tend to be very profitable.

G.M. is among companies exploiting such policy changes. The carmaker, American’s largest, is investing $900 million to manufacture V-8 engines near Buffalo. Vehicles that run on gasoline or diesel now have “a longer runway,” Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive, said last month.

But carmakers cannot give up on electric models.

U.S. electric vehicle sales rose just 1.5 percent in the first six months, according to Cox Automotive. But globally sales rose 28 percent to 9.1 million vehicles, according to Rho Motion, another research firm. That figure includes the United States and Canada as well as China and the European Union.

Carmakers that ignore this fast-growing market may not be in business 10 years from now. Ms. Barra acknowledged as much. “Despite slower E.V. industry growth, we believe the long-term future is profitable electric vehicle production,” she said.

The growth of autonomous driving technology favors electric vehicles because it is much easier to integrate self-driving software into a car where all the systems are electronic.

“If you don’t electrify fast enough you’re also losing out on the autonomous transition, whenever that happens,” said Anil Khurana, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.

The quandary for G.M. and other automakers is that they do not yet make money from electric vehicles. Development costs are high, and sales volumes are too low to achieve the cost savings that come from mass production.

Ford said this week that it lost $1.3 billion on sales of electric cars during the second quarter, although it edged closer to profitability. Now that U.S. government policy has shifted in favor of fossil fuels, it will take longer for carmakers to turn a profit on electric vehicles.

Many groups remain committed to electric vehicles.

The ad highlights the easy maintenance of electric vehicles, which don’t require oil changes. “E.V.’s have fewer parts, fewer repairs and are less expensive to drive,” Mr. Offerman says. The ad is part of a $43.5 million marketing campaign funded by Electrify America, a subsidiary of Volkswagen that operates fast chargers in the United States and Canada.

Many states still offer rebates of several thousand dollars on electric vehicle purchases, as do some utilities. Residents of California, one of the most generous states, can receive up to $12,000 toward the purchase of an electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid if they scrap an older vehicle with a combustion engine and meet certain income limits.

But electric vehicle bashing by Mr. Trump, who has called them “lunacy” and a “hoax,” could be pushing some Republicans away from the technology, said Mike Murphy, the chief executive of the EV Politics Project, a group that seeks to end what it calls “the needless partisan divide over E.V.s.”

Republicans have long been skeptical of electric vehicles, but some showed more openness to the technology after Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help elect Mr. Trump, Mr. Murphy said, citing survey data. Republican aversion to electric vehicles rose again after Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump fell out.

“The bashing does have an effect on Republican consumers,” said Mr. Murphy, who previously worked as a Republican consultant.

E.V.’s are getting better and cheaper.

Tesla’s sales have been declining since last year, falling 14 percent in the April to June quarter. But the decline stems, in part, from the company’s reliance on two older designs, the Model 3 and Model Y.

It is pretty clear that there is strong demand for electric vehicles if they are affordable, stylish and able to travel 300 miles or more between charges. G.M. more than doubled its sales of electric vehicles in the second quarter, helped by the Chevrolet Equinox, which has a starting price of around $35,000.

Tesla’s decline creates an opening for other carmakers to convince buyers to try electric models.

Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, describes herself as an “E.V. skeptic,” but was impressed by a Hyundai Ioniq 9, a large electric sport utility vehicle, that she drove recently. “It looks familiar to me,” she said. “I’m not looking at it like it’s a spaceship.”

Ms. Keating said she expected sales of electric vehicles to grow gradually as more people like her become comfortable with the technology.

Electric vehicles typically cost thousands of dollars more than cars fueled by gasoline, but the tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on imported vehicles and parts could narrow the gap. Six of the ten most American-made cars are electric, according to Cars.com, an online car buying site. The top four are Teslas. Volkswagen’s ID.4 and Kia’s EV6, which roll out of U.S. factories, also made the list.

“Certainly the more that a vehicle uses U.S. parts, the less impacted they are by tariffs,” said David Greene, an industry analyst at Cars.com. But he added that retail prices would depend on how carmakers spread the cost of tariffs among different models.

The number of public chargers is growing even though the Trump administration has blocked federal funds that cover some of the cost. Nearly 17,000 new fast charging ports, which can recharge an electric vehicle in half an hour or less, will go into operation this year, the most in a single year, according to Paren, a research firm. Fear of not being able to charge is a big reason many people hesitate to buy electric vehicles.

Robert Barrosa, the chief executive of Electrify America, said that some of its stations were in almost constant use, and there are still not enough chargers. That provides a strong incentive to keep building more.

“When you look at this more from a global perspective, the E.V. space is taking off,” he said. “As much as people may try to push back against it, it’s coming.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/31/multimedia/00biz-evmarket-cpmt/00biz-evmarket-cpmt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 08:02:01.028736

The energy demands of these data centers, coupled with the state's existing energy infrastructure, may lead to increased carbon emissions.

The author questions the current approach to energy planning and advocates for a more integrated approach that considers environmental and societal impacts.

The potential economic benefits of data centers for Wisconsin are questioned, given the limited job creation and profit outflow.

Recent articles in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel tout the return of coal and the expanding use of natural gas as energy sources for the future. Only in America and Russia are there still leaders who do not understand that burning these fossil fuels has brought the Earth to the brink of catastrophic climate change.

China recognizes that rapidly and completely shifting to renewable energy production. Short and long-term energy storage provides the only path to a livable planetary future. Yearly, China installs about 60% of the world’s new wind and solar energy-based electrical power and is positioned to dominate the global market for these new technologies.

In contrast to old fossil fuel technology, renewables use virtually no water, produce no heat, toxic air pollutants and reconnect rich and poor societies, alike, with the unlimited inexpensive source of energy for our planet, the sun. How to make the transition to renewable solar energy quickly is a prime example of a multi-faceted, real world, wicked problem. Consider We Energies’ plan to produce electricity solely with net-zero carbon (greenhouse gas) emissions by 2050. Between 2005 and 2023, its emissions declined 54% as coal was replaced by natural gas. Renewable energy infrastructure would be built between 2023 and 2030 that reduced total carbon emissions another 26%.

Data centers, like Port Washington, present a 'wicked' problem

Something unexpected, something wicked, happened between 2023 and 2025. New energy demand nationwide shot up with the appearance of artificial intelligence applications or “AI” that use energy devouring, large language model computer programs like ChatGPT. In the next 5 years, data centers that house the hardware for such programs are projected to require 20-50% of all the new energy output of the U.S.

Locally, We Energies’ plan must now accommodate the Microsoft data centers under construction or planned in Mount Pleasant and Kenosha WI, which will utilize more energy than all the homes in the city of Madison. A much larger data center envisioned for 1900 acres of farmland west of Port Washington will eventually require as much energy as all the homes in the state of Wisconsin! Together, these data centers will impose at least a huge 40% increase in the production of base-load power during the next 5 years.

How would such a precipitous increase in energy generation impact the fundamental objective to make energy production carbon-free by 2050? There is little clarity about modes of energy generation for these data centers. Cloverleaf in Port Washington will only commit to employing 30-40% renewable energy for the first part of its gigantic facility.

With two other data centers in Beaver Dam and Wisconsin Rapids also being planned, Wisconsinites are facing the likelihood that carbon dioxide emissions will increase substantially not decrease in the future. In turn, efforts to get to net-zero carbon emissions, will be significantly slowed, if not thwarted.

Wisconsin leaders seem oblivious to impacts of data centers

The state legislature and executive branch seem oblivious to the outsized impacts that huge data centers will have on state-wide energy demand, availability, and cost, let alone their deleterious impact on bottom-line climate goals. It appears that legislators have not considered the environmental consequences of the enormous need for water to cool data centers.

Moreover, after construction, new sprawling data centers will provide few on-site jobs; most profits from their operations will be made almost entirely outside Wisconsin. Exactly, how will Wisconsin benefit from a plethora of data centers?

Finally, no one is talking about the gorilla in the room: A Chinese company, DeepSeek, has developed a generative AI program of comparable sophistication to American versions that operates with about 10% of the energy of its US counterparts. Its computer code is open-sourced so that anyone can use it and compete with big tech. Why do we need all of these voracious data centers when 10% of them will do?

We are faced with a wicked knot of interconnected problems and issues. Currently, requests for new energy infrastructure are considered independently by the Public Service Commission without evident recognition of the intertwined concerns of environment, human health, and the common good.

Collectively, we got ourselves into the existential climate change dilemma by not understanding and establishing policy based broadly on planetary limits not simply economic considerations. We can amend our ways by adopting “Integrated Resource Planning” to coordinate and integrate education, evaluation and decision-making about all facets of energy production and use. The “wicked knot” of climate change and data centers demands it.

Wind power brings steady income for farms Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.","Drive through the plains of Iowa or Kansas and you’ll see more than rows of corn, wheat and soybeans. You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.

But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.

Wind power brings steady income for farms

Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricity came from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around US$3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.

Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.

Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.

In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing between 38% and 69% of tax revenue.

The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm

Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.

Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics– dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.

Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.

However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.

Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.

What’s being lost

The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.

The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.

While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies

Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.

Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.

In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing – such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries– and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.

On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.

As rural America faces economic uncertainty and climate pressures, I believe homegrown renewable energy offers a practical path forward. Wind and solar aren’t just fueling the grid; they’re helping keep farms and rural towns alive.",https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com/?uuid=0959B351-6305-46AB-BCCF-836D537B7EB4&type=preview&q=75&width=1200&height=800,N,,2025-08-03 06:58:07.048828

Helene, the deadliest storm to ever hit the state, took 108 lives and caused an estimated $48.8 billion in damage. Less than a year later, Tropical Storm Chantal killed six North Carolinians and did more than $56 million in damage to Orange County. This is just one of the 13 counties for which Governor Stein declared a state of emergency. The physical and emotional trauma being felt during this time reminds me of watching my hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana struggle to overcome tragic extreme weather events.

As a Gulf Coast native, I’ve felt the presence of natural disasters my entire life. When I was three, I evacuated New Orleans with my mother and younger sister ahead of Hurricane Katrina. When the levees broke, my dad watched the water rise up, filling our street and submerging our front lawn, creeping up the steps to the top lip of our front porch. We were lucky the water began to drain before it could make it into the house.

As I grew older, I felt Katrina’s legacy in New Orleans. Many people were not as fortunate as my family – some lost their homes and others their lives. Some who made it out during evacuations or in the storm’s aftermath never returned to New Orleans. I worry for my family that still lives there.

Throughout my childhood and adolescence, we experienced other large storms. None were as seriously damaging as Katrina, but it was common to wake up to felled tree branches and flooded streets. In 2021, Category 4 Hurricane Ida whipped through New Orleans, leaving the city without power for over three weeks at the hottest time of the year. Unfortunately, such extreme weather experiences were not limited to my time in New Orleans.

The morning after Chantal hit Durham, my coworkers and I watched live news reports of the 130 casualties caused by flash flooding in Texas. Twenty-seven young girls were killed by the floods while attending a sleepaway camp similar to the one I attended for seven summers.

While watching these reports in shock and horror, I listened to people calling the disaster an unavoidable “act of God.” Of course, we should dedicate thoughts and prayers to the families suffering during this tragedy, but the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather is not random. It is directly attributable to human-induced climate change. To prevent future tragedies, we need accurate forecasts and warnings, timely federal relief programs, more resilient infrastructure, and climate action plans.

It is mystifying to me that the president claimed that he is investing in technology to protect people from extreme weather events on the same weekend he slashed support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and renewable energy. We need to be proactive, not reactive, and that means investing in climate adaptation.

Devastating extreme weather events are our new reality, no matter what state you live in. If it’s not a hurricane, it’ll be a tornado like the one that hit St. Louis in May of this year. Or wildfires like those that burned through Los Angeles in January. Or an extreme heat wave like the heat dome that is triggering heat alerts from Nebraska to Florida this past week.

As someone just starting to establish a career and life as a young professional, I fear the upcoming years during which extreme weather will become an even more powerful and disastrous force. Flooding from Chantal in Durham wiped out an entire suspension bridge in the Eno River State Park, where I frequently hike and recreate with friends. This is reality for my lifetime, and I want to do something about it.

We need to get serious about climate action. Without concerted environmental efforts, communities will continue to suffer, and people will needlessly die. We need to make our voices heard.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7182574-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 08:02:31.915523

TL;DR:

Qatar has installed over 300 fast EV chargers nationwide as of 1 August 2025 under its green mobility initiative.

These DC fast chargers deliver high-power, rapid charging, often bringing EV batteries from 20% to 80% in under 30 minutes.

This infrastructure supports Qatar National Vision 2030 by promoting clean transport, reducing emissions, and enhancing convenience through digital tools.

On 1 August 2025, Kahramaa, Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation, announced that Qatar has surpassed 300 fast electric vehicle (EV) chargers, a major milestone in building a robust EV ecosystem aligned with its sustainability goals. During a community engagement event at Al Thumama's Kahramaa Awareness Park, engineers and EV users gathered to assess charger performance, usability, and discuss future expansions. The mobile app showcased allows users to track charging sessions, receive real‑time updates, and report issues, increasing transparency and control for EV drivers. Kahramaa officials emphasised that public feedback will shape further infrastructure enhancements. Looking ahead, plans include expanding charger availability in residential areas, shopping malls, and public parking zones to meet growing demand from EV owners.

What are EV chargers and what makes them “fast”?

EV chargers, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), come in two major types: AC chargers and DC chargers.

AC chargers (Level 1 & 2) supply alternating current which is converted within the vehicle’s onboard charger before entering the battery, these are slower and typically used at homes or offices.

DC fast chargers bypass the vehicle’s converter and feed direct current straight to the battery—offering power outputs ranging from 50 kW to over 350 kW and enabling rapid charging.

Charging speeds are categorized as:

Level 1 (trickle charging): Adds about 2–5 miles of range per hour.

Level 2: Delivers 10–30 miles of range per hour, suitable for overnight residential charging.

Level 3 (DC fast charging): Adds 20–60+ miles in just 15–30 minutes; ultra-fast chargers can deliver over 150 kW for even quicker fill-ups.

These fast chargers installed in Qatar fall under Level 3: high-voltage DC units capable of charging most EVs to 80% in under 30 minutes, ideal for roadside use, malls, and strategic hubs.

Why this expansion is important for Qatar

Supporting National Vision 2030

The EV charging rollout aligns with Qatar’s broader strategy to diversify energy use, lower carbon emissions, and nurture sustainable mobility avenues.

Enhancing Convenience and Reliability

Fast DC chargers reduce range anxiety, making EV ownership more practical, especially given that most users rely on public infrastructure while apartment charging remains limited.

Smart Infrastructure and User Engagement

Kahramaa’s mobile app, data tracking, and community dialogue models reinforce a user-centric approach, ensuring charger performance evolves with feedback.

Broader context: EV charging explained

EVSE devices support various connector standards: CCS (Combined Charging System), CHAdeMO, Type 2, and Tesla’s proprietary plugs, which differ regionally.

Smart chargers can optimise grid load, schedule charging during lower-tariff hours, and monitor performance, all of which are essential for modern EV networks).

The global EV charging landscape still navigates challenges like standardizing connectors and ensuring equitable access—a concern highlighted by users in Qatar living in apartments where charging access remains sparse.

Future outlook for Qatar’s EV ecosystem

At the forefront of this effort is a groundbreaking development in battery technology. Researchers at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin have unveiled a novel approach to creating high-performance anodes for lithium and sodium-ion batteries. These advancements promise not only to enhance the efficiency of energy storage systems but also to provide safer and longer-lasting solutions. By challenging conventional norms, the scientists have opened new possibilities for rapid charging electric vehicles and other critical applications, marking a significant milestone in the energy sector.

Rethinking Battery Design with Targeted Disorder

Traditionally, battery materials have relied heavily on highly ordered crystal structures. This order was believed to enable predictable pathways for ion transport. However, this approach often results in structural rigidity and limited ion mobility, hindering performance at high charge rates. In a bold departure from this norm, researchers have discovered that targeted disorder can significantly enhance ionic conductivity.

In two studies published in Nature Communications and Advanced Materials, the team demonstrated that introducing imperfections in the atomic structure could increase cycling stability and unlock novel storage mechanisms. “Our results show that targeted imperfection can be a powerful tool in material design,” stated Professor Nicola Pinna. This approach could redefine material design strategies across the field, potentially leading to more sustainable high-performance batteries.

The researchers employed structural disorder in niobium-tungsten oxides and controlled amorphisation in iron niobate. This innovative strategy has produced particularly durable materials for lithium-ion batteries, offering new hope for the future of energy storage.

Prolonged Service Life and Enhanced Capacity

The benefits of these new materials extend beyond increased charge rates. Tests have shown that even after 1,000 charging cycles, these batteries retain a large portion of their original performance. The implications for consumer electronics and electric vehicles are profound, as these technologies demand reliable and long-lasting power sources.

Additionally, the team has developed a new material for sodium-ion batteries, which are considered an environmentally friendly alternative to lithium-based systems. This material undergoes significant changes upon its first charge but retains essential structures, resulting in exceptional storage capacity. Remarkably, it maintains a long service life of over 2,600 charging cycles with almost no loss in performance.

The introduction of an iron niobate with a columbite structure as a high-performance sodium storage anode is a significant breakthrough. This innovation offers a sustainable pathway for future battery technologies, addressing both environmental and resource concerns.

Implications for Electric Vehicles and Renewable Energy

The potential applications of these advancements are vast. The combination of disordered lithium anodes and amorphous sodium anodes opens up new perspectives for ultra-fast charging electric vehicles. This could drastically reduce charging times, making electric vehicles more practical for everyday use and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Furthermore, these innovations hold promise for stationary storage solutions for renewable energy sources. By providing safe and efficient alternatives to current battery technologies, these materials could play a crucial role in the transition to a more sustainable energy landscape.

The research underscores the potential of atomic design principles to address global energy challenges. By focusing on the deliberate introduction of disorder, scientists are paving the way for safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly energy storage solutions.

Future Directions and Challenges

While the findings from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin are promising, the path to widespread implementation is not without challenges. Scaling these technologies for commercial use will require further research and development. Additionally, the long-term stability and safety of these new materials must be thoroughly tested.

However, the potential benefits make this an exciting area of research. As the world increasingly shifts towards renewable energy sources, the demand for efficient, reliable, and sustainable storage solutions will only grow. This research represents a significant step toward meeting those needs.

Moving forward, collaboration between academia, industry, and policymakers will be critical in transforming these scientific breakthroughs into real-world applications. The journey to a sustainable energy future is complex, but innovations like these bring hope for a cleaner, greener world.

As these developments continue to unfold, one key question remains: How will industries and governments adapt to integrate these revolutionary technologies into the existing energy infrastructure?

Big bill trickle

Trump’s big, beautiful bill cast a cloud over the budget work facing the General Assembly. Surely, North Carolina will get a trickle-down effect. It may require taking some state rainy day funds to clear the air and brighten the days for many of our affected residents.

Cooper support

With Congress seemingly determined to help billionaires at the expense of everyday Americans, slashing funding for healthcare, SNAP, FEMA, and public broadcasting, Roy Cooper stands in stark contrast. Throughout his tenure as governor, Cooper fought for the rights of every North Carolinian.

Whether adding hundreds of thousands of jobs, expanding access to healthcare or providing assistance to those hit by natural disasters, he has always put us first. North Carolina’s first competitive Senate race in over a decade comes with high stakes, being one of the only pick-up opportunities for the Democrats.

Cooper disdain

In the statement announcing he’s running for senate, Cooper said he had “prayed about it”. Progressives need not be alarmed by this language. Cooper still supports gay rights, open borders, transgender surgery for minors, men in women’s sports, anti-ICE protests and public funding for Planned Parenthood.

When he said he prayed about it he was only appealing to old-school Democrats who were raised in the Bible Belt. So take his aw shucks Mayberry prayer with a grain of salt.

The move follows voter approval in February and marks a major milestone for the town’s sustainability goals.

The 26-kilowatt system, installed by Hampton-based Harmony Energy Works, was fully funded through a competitive Energy Efficiency Conservation Block Grant awarded to the Kensington Energy Committee last year. With no tax impact on residents, the project is expected to offset up to 70% of the town’s annual electric costs. It will offset 72% of the town hall’s electricity load— saving an estimated $7,000 each year. Additionally, the system is projected to generate approximately 35 Renewable Energy Credits, which are expected to yield roughly $1,000 annually.

Beyond its financial impact, the project sets a precedent throughout the state. It is the first system to be funded through the NH Department of Energy’s Municipal Solar Grant Program and the first to be aesthetically approved for installation on a historic town hall in New Hampshire.

To celebrate the launch, town officials and partners gathered for a community event, including representatives from Clean Energy NH, the Community Power Coalition of NH, the NH Department of Energy, and Harmony Energy Works, as well as members of the Kensington Heritage Commission and Energy Committee.

Designing the solar array for the historic building required close collaboration between the town’s Heritage Commission and Board of Selectmen to meet aesthetic and structural criteria. Both bodies voted unanimously in support of the effort, which was also backed by multiple state representatives and clean energy advocates.

The solar array is expected to serve the town for the next 30 years.

administrator and helped establish the power-plant rules based on the endangerment finding.","Ever since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson’s science advisory committee warned of the dangers of unchecked global warming, the United States has taken steps to protect people from these risks.

Now, however, the Trump administration appears to be essentially abandoning this principle, claiming that the costs of addressing climate change outweigh the benefits. The effect is to shift more of the risk and responsibility onto states and, ultimately, individual Americans, even as rising temperatures fuel more extreme and costly weather disasters nationwide, experts say.

“It’s a radical transformation of government’s role, in terms of its intervention into the economy to try to promote the health and safety of citizens,” said Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy.

Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, this week proposed to repeal the landmark scientific finding that enables the federal government to regulate the greenhouse gases that are warming the planet. In effect, the E.P.A. will eliminate its own authority to combat climate change.

Speaking at a truck dealership in Indianapolis, Mr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would reverse a 2009 scientific conclusion, known as the endangerment finding, that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health. He said the agency would also rescind Biden-era regulations designed to reduce planet-warming emissions from automobile tailpipes.

While few people have heard of the endangerment finding, it has had a profound effect on society. Its establishment cleared the way for the Obama administration to set the country’s first limits on greenhouse gases from cars and power plants, with the goal of putting more electric vehicles on the roads and adding more renewable energy to the electric grid.

But Mr. Zeldin’s announcement was only the latest in a rapid-fire series of actions to weaken or eliminate protections against climate change.

In April the Trump administration dismissed hundreds of scientists and experts who had been compiling the federal government’s flagship analysis of how climate change is affecting the country. In May, Mr. Trump proposed to stop collecting key measurements of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as part of his 2026 budget plan. And since January he has called for eliminating or overhauling the Federal Emergency Management Agency to shift disaster response to the states.

“It’s never been the role of government to completely take care of people,” said Sarah Pralle, a professor of political science at Syracuse University. “But this conservative, anti-regulatory, anti-welfare-state ideology all comes together in kind of shifting risks back to individuals.”

The government has a track record of tackling environmental problems under both Democratic and Republican administrations. The E.P.A. itself was created more than a half-century ago by a Republican president, Richard M. Nixon. Environmental action “has to be done on a bipartisan basis and it also has to be on a bigger-than-federal-government basis,” Nixon said in 1970 before signing a law that required federal agencies to study the environmental consequences of major infrastructure projects.

Mr. Zeldin has struck a different tone.

This year, he essentially reoriented the E.P.A.’s mission away from environmental stewardship, saying the mission would now be to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.” Building on that message this week, he said the endangerment finding had led to costly new regulations that burdened households and businesses. “We’re strangulating our own economy,” he said, adding that past administrations had found “new ways to put trillions of dollars of new handcuffs around the American family.”

Joe Aldy, a professor of environmental policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that by repealing the endangerment finding, the Trump administration was relinquishing the country’s historical role as a protector of public health. “The concern here isn’t just the attack on regulation,” he said. “There is this much bigger question of what does it mean to promote the general welfare?”

In response to questions, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, Brigit Hirsch, said in an email, referring to the 2009 endangerment finding: “How does a partisan policy from the mid-2000s qualify as a ‘time-honored American tradition’? E.P.A. is bound by the laws established by Congress and Congress never explicitly gave E.P.A. authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks.”

Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said that the endangerment finding had been misused to justify excessive regulation and that the administration was “putting everyday Americans First by restoring consumer choice and sidestepping the left’s out-of-touch climate policies.”

Governments have taken steps to protect citizens from environmental hazards for centuries. After cholera outbreaks in the mid-1800s, England worked to improve sanitation and water quality. In the United States, research into contaminated drinking water in the early 20th century led to investments in sanitation. And the Clean Air Act, enacted in 1963 and amended in 1990, helped solve issues including smog in Los Angeles, acid rain in New England and the depletion of the ozone layer high in the atmosphere.

“This is a real retreat from the social compact that I think has been dominant in the U.S. for some time,” said Margaret Levi, a professor of political science at Stanford University. “Part of government’s responsibility is to protect the health and well-being of its citizens to the extent that it can, and that does require some regulation.”

The Trump administration’s approach has supporters. Several conservative scholars and politicians applauded the imminent end of the endangerment finding, saying it had empowered the E.P.A. to restrict Americans’ choices of how to heat their homes and what kinds of cars to drive.

“The endangerment finding became a pretext for the agency, without congressional authorization, to impose centralized economic planning on the U.S. transportation and electric power sectors,” said Marlo Lewis Jr., a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a right-wing research organization.

Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana’s secretary of energy and natural resources, said at the event in Indianapolis that the proposal was “a reaffirmation of common-sense government and moving away from years of regulatory overreach that I think we’ve all seen and felt, whether it was at the grocery store or the gas pump.”

The endangerment finding has sparked fierce legal and political battles in Washington for nearly three decades.

In 1999, several states and environmental groups filed a petition urging the Clinton administration to limit greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide from motor vehicles. In 2003, the Bush administration denied the petition, saying the Clean Air Act did not authorize the E.P.A. to regulate greenhouse gases.

Massachusetts challenged the denial in federal court, and the case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which issued a landmark 2007 decision affirming the E.P.A.’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases. The justices, emphasized, however, that the agency needed to demonstrate that those emissions threatened public health and welfare.

That’s what led to the E.P.A.’s 2009 endangerment finding, which concluded that, based on the scientific evidence, greenhouse gases do, in fact, endanger public health and welfare. In more than 200 pages, the agency outlined the science and detailed how increasingly severe heat waves, storms and droughts were expected to contribute to higher rates of death and disease.

“For so long at E.P.A., Republicans and Democrats have understood that they had a job to do, and that their job was dictated by the law, and they did not toss the science aside,” said Gina McCarthy, who served as Mr. Obama’s second E.P.A. administrator and helped establish the power-plant rules based on the endangerment finding.

“There may have been differences of opinion over what that science meant and how to do the regulations in accordance with what we understood the science said, but I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ms. McCarthy said. “They are basically just disowning their responsibilities entirely at E.P.A.”

Mr. Zeldin has rejected such allegations.

“Conservatives love the environment, want to be good stewards of the environment,” Mr. Zeldin said on Tuesday on a conservative podcast titled Ruthless. “There are people who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country.”

After the proposal to repeal the endangerment finding is published in the Federal Register, the E.P.A. will solicit public comments for 45 days. The agency will then finalize the rule, most likely within the next year.

The debate over the proper use of the government’s regulatory hand has been going on for centuries. Adam Smith, the 18th century philosopher and economist, argued that governments should play a limited role, emphasizing the importance of free markets and individual rights. A century later the philosopher John Stuart Mill contended that governments should promote the common good.

“What this government is doing is going outside the frame of that debate,” Ms. Levi said. “It’s not talking about what are the cost to citizens. It’s only really focusing on what are the costs to business, and denying the science that demonstrates there is a cost to the public.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/01/multimedia/00cli-climate-protection-01-tgcf/00cli-climate-protection-01-tgcf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 06:01:16.945480

Some of them, it’s renewable energy.
Those industries should be right here in Virginia,” Spanberger said.
Dominion Energy, which is working to launch a natural gas plant in Chesterfield County and considering how to ease emission controls for coal-powered plants, is proposing a suite of renewable energy sources.
Under that law, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, which serves Southwest Virginia, are required to add solar to their energy portfolios.","Former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger is campaigning for Virginia’s governor’s race on an energy platform that supports robust renewable development and continued use, as needed, of natural gas. The former Democratic lawmaker also aims to make energy-reliant data centers pay for upgrades to the electrical grid.

Spanberger represented the 7th Congressional District outside Washington, D.C., from 2019 to 2025. Now, she believes she is positioned to make her home state a “dominant” player in developing a multi-faceted energy landscape.

Spanberger said that her years on Capitol Hill helped frame climate change as an opportunity and challenge for Virginia, and energy use and conservation will be key issues in her bid for the governor’s mansion. “Virginia’s on a path to really be dominant and strong in the renewable energy space,” Spanberger said in an interview.

Spanberger is facing Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears on Nov. 4 and polls give her an early lead. So far, Spanberger has raised $27 million in political donations and Earle-Sears, $11.5 million, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.

Last month, Spanberger released a game plan for energy that focused on six priorities, including increasing local generation, all efforts she said will help the state avoid an energy crisis. “Some of these new opportunities, it’s in new technology. Some of them, it’s renewable energy. Some of it, the pitch is jobs. Some of it is the pitch is affordability,” she said.

Spanberger, a University of Virginia graduate who was a CIA case officer early in her career, faces widely divergent interests across the state and has represented a politically split constituency. Her former district is described as “purple” for its close voter margins between Democrats and Republicans, and an economy that benefits from Capitol Hill interests.

Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a former chief executive at The Carlyle Group private equity firm, won in 2022 with strong business support. He has aligned himself with President Donald Trump and, in recent weeks, has supported the administration’s effort to shift federal workers and agencies from the District into Virginia. Youngkin, who is term-limited, has encouraged robust data center development in the state.

Such growth will be challenging. Virginia faces skyrocketing energy demands from proposed and existing data centers with some estimates showing that electricity needs will triple over the next 15 years from about 10,000 gigawatt hours in 2023 to just over 30,000 gigawatt hours. The state also depends on PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States and which has been roundly criticized for slow expansion and connection to its grid, notably for renewable energy projects.

Spanberger, in a series of recent interviews and policy statements, has said she wants communities to be better informed about the benefits and costs of growth.

She said Virginia will need a reliable portfolio of energy to stay competitive. Solar projects must be encouraged, she said, as well as an ongoing offshore wind project by Dominion Energy, the pivotal utility based in Richmond. Spanberger said she wants to pursue energy saving measures that make sense for residents and businesses, and she acknowledged that natural gas will be a key component for economic growth, for now.

“At this juncture, natural gas is going to be part of the energy mix into the future,” Spanberger said.

“However, I think when it comes to new natural gas infrastructure, that’s where we really need to be focused and sort of thinking carefully about the lifespan of those projects and whether indeed they are the most cost-effective solution.”

In an interview with Cardinal News, Spanberger said the state government could better research how and where to select sites for solar projects, including assessing formerly mined land and the use of rooftops. The state saw a boom in solar development after 2014 when local governments approved 100 percent of proposals for solar panel projects. Concerns over protecting farmland dented that approval rate in recent years. Half of all proposed projects were approved in 2024.

Spanberger also supports the state’s broader offshore wind development plans. Dominion is now constructing a $10.7 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project about 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. That project is expected to produce 2.6 gigawatts of electricity for more than 2.5 million households and businesses in Virginia.

Dominion has two other wind lease areas available for development, but any potential work has stalled because the Trump administration in January temporarily withdrew all lease rights in order to review permitting practices for wind projects. The move has widely been seen as a way to slow such renewable development.

Spanberger said she wants to see energy storage developed as an industry in Virginia—a job creation opportunity she said that acknowledges that there are some limitations to when and how renewables can be used. “Wind and solar are not 24-hour kind of constant production,” she said. But businesses can innovate to blend energy sources and reliable storage methods.

“Whether it’s in the construction and manufacturing installation, those jobs should be right here in Virginia. Those industries should be right here in Virginia,” Spanberger said. “Expanding the type of generation and source of generation that we have in Virginia also meets that goal of contending with rising prices.”

Spanberger’s plan calls for Virginia to “work collaboratively” with other governors to add new generation sources to PJM’s grid. A bipartisan group of nine governors, including Youngkin, sent a letter to PJM on July 17 to express frustration over its performance, noting continued long delays in reviewing applications for interconnection.

Spanberger also said in her plan that she wants to explore greater energy efficiency programs, ratepayer project programs, and the use of virtual power plants. A virtual power plant is a system made up of residents and businesses who agree to reduce their electricity demand and share energy to the grid when needed. The system is controlled by the utility, which can activate notices to the groups. Participants are compensated for their efforts.

Spanberger’s proposals are emerging as utility companies that serve Virginians are attempting to expand the energy arsenal. Dominion Energy, which is working to launch a natural gas plant in Chesterfield County and considering how to ease emission controls for coal-powered plants, is proposing a suite of renewable energy sources.

Dominion has said it is examining and attempting changes that will help maintain grid reliability, particularly during peak demand periods.

The Clean Economy Act

The Virginia Clean Economy Act, passed in 2020, aims to decarbonize the electric grid by reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

The law mandates utilities serving Virginia reduce carbon-emitting generation sources by 2045 unless there’s a concern over grid reliability. Under that law, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, which serves Southwest Virginia, are required to add solar to their energy portfolios. Dominion must create a renewable energy credit portfolio–which sustains 100 percent of the electricity through renewables–by 2045 and Appalachian Power must do the same by 2050.

For Dominion, that means the utility must petition regulators, by the end of 2035, to approve proposals for solar projects that will produce a total of 16,100 megawatts, offshore wind projects that will produce a total of 5.2 gigawatts, and battery storage that can accommodate 2,700 megawatts. Appalachian Power must prepare to build 600 megawatts of solar by the end of 2030 and 400 megawatts of battery storage by the end of 2035.

In an interview, Spanberger said she is “committed to the long-term goals” of the Virginia Clean Economy Act. She noted that 2045 is “a long way away” but “the landscape in Virginia has changed in the last few years.” There are “some opportunities” for more small-scale distributed generation at certain locations, such as shopping centers, which could alleviate demand. Small-scale energy production could help ease the strain on large centralized energy sources, she said.

“How can we be more aggressive in our pursuit of other types of clean energy generation?” Spanberger said. “I don’t think the immediate response should be, ‘Okay, we’re not 100 percent on pace with where we thought we should be, therefore, let’s just throw up our hands and walk away.’”

Dominion has nuclear plants at North Anna and Surry in the central and tidewater regions, which together can produce about 3.6 gigawatts of electricity, equal to powering 870,000 homes or about 30 percent of the state’s current electricity demand.

Smaller modular reactors or SMRs are increasingly showing promise as complementary energy sources—and Dominion is actively considering if one could be added to the North Anna units. The modular reactors can produce 300 megawatts of electricity compared to the 1,000-watt capacity of older nuclear units, and they may well be a model way for Virginia to meet its renewable target, Spanberger said.

“We have a potential to really be a global leader in new technologies, given the offshore wind project, the SMR project in North Anna and then the fusion project, which is admittedly a little bit further off, but that one is planned to go in Chesterfield County,” Spanberger said.

Data Center Growth

Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta all have invested in data centers in Virginia and may expand their operations in artificial intelligence, which will increase energy demand. Spanberger thinks that sort of growth can be managed to benefit all Virginians.

“(Data centers) are going to need to go somewhere, and Virginia can benefit from having them here,” Spanberger said, adding she wants to have a statewide plan to help communities understand and deal with siting proposals as well as energy and water consumption forecasts.

“Some localities just don’t necessarily know the things they should be asking,” she said. Local communities and governments need to have a “best practices standard” to know what “they should be able to ask for as it relates to the actual rates.”

Clean Virginia, an advocacy group that has long criticized Dominion Energy’s policies, is supporting Spanberger. The group, founded by hedge fund executive Michael Bills who lives in Charlottesville, has pumped millions of dollars into legislative races.

Clean Virginia has pushed for more stringent reviews of data center development proposals at Virginia’s utility regulators, the State Corporation Commission (SCC). The group advocates for utilities to be required to source electricity from clean technologies, and it has called for data centers to pay for the grid upgrades that will be needed to operate their for-profit businesses.

Dominion Energy’s latest rate review is a chance to gauge cost allocations, and Spanberger said she is studying that issue to ensure electricity rates, for residents and other businesses, are affordable.

“I am looking very closely at the rate case that’s before the SCC,” she said. “I want to ensure that (data centers) are paying their fair share, but also as generation needs continue to increase, I want Virginians to have the clarity that they are not impacted by the type of data center choices that their localities are making.”

Virginia’s energy and political debates are gaining pace as the Trump administration rolls back clean air and water protections, weakens drinking water standards and dismantles the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) tasked with supporting disaster response.

Virginia in 2024 experienced $4.4 billion in damages from Hurricane Helene, and Spanberger said the federal cuts–notably in FEMA–are worrisome.

“I’m watching it closely, because there presumably will be things to react to or to plan for in recognizing what’s happening at the federal level,” Spanberger said. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act has slashed money for energy transition efforts and that will hurt Virginia’s momentum to cope with rising energy demands, she said.

That’s “a problem for a state that’s doing so well in this space,” Spanberger said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2220489974-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 05:59:44.963024

The White House released its AI Action Plan on July 23, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others pour billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat ""radical climate dogma,"" a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump's ""American energy dominance"" agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

Environmental concerns

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are increasingly severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

Big Tech moves

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most power plants in the U.S. still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

Tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often that's not from renewables. Sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

In recent days, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world's largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means ""relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,"" Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear, power generation.

What's ahead

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for.

""In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,"" said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

""They're planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that's projected, which is what we want them to do,"" she added. ""But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.""

According to the IEA, clean technology will account for two-thirds of total energy investment worldwide in 2025, up from 40% in 2020.
The investment surge could lead to cheaper energy bills, more local clean energy jobs, and cleaner air.","In a significant development for the planet, global clean energy investment is projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025, exceeding investments in fossil fuels.

This milestone, highlighted in the Environmental Defense Fund's newsletter, is detailed in a new report by the International Energy Agency. The IEA's World Energy Investment 2025 outlook reveals that solar, wind, battery storage, and electric vehicles are seeing booming investment globally.

Despite ongoing opposition to green climate policy from U.S. conservative leaders, clean energy is charging ahead. According to the IEA, clean technology will account for two-thirds of total energy investment worldwide in 2025, up from 40% in 2020.

Much of this momentum is driven by China, the European Union, and emerging economies like India and Brazil, but the U.S. still plays a crucial role, with $400 billion in clean energy investments outstripping the $187 billion put into fossil fuels.

The investment surge could lead to cheaper energy bills, more local clean energy jobs, and cleaner air. And it is already working: the IEA reported that the cost of solar panels has fallen by 30% over the past two years alone.

Significant infrastructure upgrades, expanded battery storage, and smarter electric grids are facilitating the transition to cleaner energy, helping protect communities from rising energy costs and worsening pollution.

This shift toward renewables is expected to prevent billions of tons of heat-trapping pollution and reduce the risk of oil and gas price shocks.

The clean energy boom was first covered in the EDF's Vital Signs newsletter, which shares inspiring good news stories on environmental solutions, clean tech breakthroughs, and actions individuals can take.

Many online were relieved with the optimistic outlook.

""This is great news,"" one Reddit commenter in r/energy said.

""If Trump wants energy dominance, maybe we should be investing in the sectors that are growing?"" another asked. ""Seems like basic common sense.""

This follows many recent clean energy advancements in the U.S., from investments in EV charging technology to community-focused solar and nuclear fusion.

Everyday people are beginning to see the benefits and are switching to options like home solar through companies like EnergySage, which offers a free service to compare quotes and save up to $10,000 on solar installation that could bring your energy costs toward $0.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/clean-energy-investmentimage-recZSrIk3oIkOvnmC.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 05:59:51.986118

This latest government-backed financing marks the third such agreement between Ford and UK Export Finance in just four years.
Previous support packages included a £625 million loan for global R&D work in Essex and a £750 million facility to scale up production of EV power units.
Looking further ahead, the government has pledged £2 billion in capital and R&D support for the EV sector through 2030.
This reduction is expected to save UK manufacturers hundreds of millions of pounds annually and could play a crucial role in making British EVs more competitive abroad.","The UK Government has unveiled plans to support a £1 billion loan to Ford UK as part of a broader effort to accelerate the company’s transition to electric vehicle production and secure thousands of jobs across its British operations. The funding will be backed by an export development guarantee, with UK Export Finance agreeing to cover 80% of the total facility. That amounts to £800 million underwritten by the government.

Citi is leading the deal along with a syndicate of commercial lenders. The funds will be used to bolster Ford’s engineering and manufacturing capabilities for electric and connected vehicles. This includes continued investment in the company’s Halewood facility, which is being retooled to produce electric motors, as well as expanded support for its research and development centre in Essex.

Ford employs more than 5,500 people across the UK and has already committed over £450 million toward EV-related upgrades since 2020. This latest government-backed financing marks the third such agreement between Ford and UK Export Finance in just four years. Combined, the total value of these loans now reaches nearly £2.4 billion. Previous support packages included a £625 million loan for global R&D work in Essex and a £750 million facility to scale up production of EV power units.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: “Ford has been the pride of Essex since 1911, over a century of innovation and industry. The R&D centre in Basildon employs thousands of people in well-paid, highly skilled jobs.

“This £1bn loan guarantee is a major boost for Britain’s auto sector. It will help develop world-leading products, open new export markets, and secure jobs. This is our Plan for Change in action – delivering growth and putting more money in people’s pockets.”

Ford Britain’s chair Lisa Brankin added: “Recent investments in the UK have proved crucial to our European operations and have expanded our UK export capability, on top of supporting Ford’s investment in an all-electric product line-for Europe.

“This new UKEF facility will play an important role in supporting our UK exporting footprint, especially amid the continued uncertainty in the trade landscape and the disconnect between EV targets and customer demand.”

The timing of this new loan coincides with the mounting challenges facing the UK automotive sector. While regulations continue to push toward electrification, consumer demand has been softening. Rising costs, infrastructure delays, and shifting government incentives have further complicated the landscape.

Even major manufacturers are adjusting their expectations. Volvo recently revised its goal of becoming fully electric by 2030, now allowing for up to 10 per cent of its sales to come from plug-in hybrids. The company cited slow progress in public charging availability and a reduction in incentive programmes as major factors behind the pivot.

In response to industry concerns, the UK Government has rolled out new initiatives aimed at encouraging both production and adoption. These include the Electric Car Grant and updates to the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, which requires manufacturers to steadily increase the proportion of zero-emission vehicles in their total sales.

Last year, Nissan warned the Government that the market shift to EVs is not keeping pace with expectations, citing weak consumer demand and increasing regulatory burdens. “The reality is that the customer is not moving at the same pace as we had expected,” the company said.

Looking further ahead, the government has pledged £2 billion in capital and R&D support for the EV sector through 2030. An additional £500 million has been earmarked to extend that support window to 2035.

The push to transform the UK’s automotive sector is not limited to domestic policy. Officials have also been working to improve international market access for British-made vehicles. A recent trade agreement with the United States has significantly lowered tariffs on UK car exports, cutting them from 27.5 per cent to just 10 per cent.

This reduction is expected to save UK manufacturers hundreds of millions of pounds annually and could play a crucial role in making British EVs more competitive abroad.

Together, these developments paint a picture of a sector in flux. The UK is navigating a difficult transition, balancing the urgency of climate targets with the economic realities facing manufacturers. Ford’s new loan package is just one example of how the public and private sectors are collaborating to build a greener, more resilient automotive industry for the years ahead.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c2a2be60ae6e1e97e231ddde94d28e16.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/c2a2be60ae6e1e97e231ddde94d28e16.jpg",N,,2025-08-03 05:59:56.260383

At least 18 states now charge additional registration fees for electric vehicles, ranging anywhere from $50 to over $200 per year.
In 2019, lawmakers proposed raising the state’s annual EV registration fee from just $17.50 to an eye-popping $1,000.
After public backlash, the proposal was scaled back, but EV owners still now pay $100 annually on top of the $158 standard vehicle registration.
But while the market moves to make electric vehicles more accessible, state policies may inadvertently create new barriers.","Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly seen as the future of transportation, cleaner, quieter, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Yet for many American drivers, the shift to electric mobility comes with a hidden financial sting: annual fees that states are imposing on EV owners, often with little warning.

At least 18 states now charge additional registration fees for electric vehicles, ranging anywhere from $50 to over $200 per year. California, a long-standing champion of green transportation, sets its annual fee at $100 for zero-emission vehicles. But some states are less modest. Georgia charges $200, and Indiana asks EV owners to pay $150. In Michigan, the fee can reach $235 depending on vehicle weight. Even states with relatively few EVs on the road are adopting these measures, compounding costs for environmentally conscious drivers.

Illinois offers one of the most dramatic examples. In 2019, lawmakers proposed raising the state’s annual EV registration fee from just $17.50 to an eye-popping $1,000. The stated goal: recoup lost gas tax revenue that traditionally funds road maintenance. After public backlash, the proposal was scaled back, but EV owners still now pay $100 annually on top of the $158 standard vehicle registration.

The rationale behind these fees stems from a shrinking pool of gas tax revenue. Since EVs don’t rely on gasoline, their drivers don’t contribute to highway maintenance in the same way as conventional motorists. With roads and bridges in need of repair and no federal gas tax increase since 1993, states are looking for new revenue streams. That search has led directly to EV owners’ wallets.

However, this added cost raises concerns. On one hand, several states, including California and Colorado, still offer rebates and tax incentives to encourage EV purchases. On the other, they penalize those same drivers with recurring fees, creating a financial and policy contradiction that can confuse potential buyers.

Some states have explored mileage-based fees as a fairer alternative, charging drivers by how much they use public roads rather than what kind of fuel they use. These systems, though, face resistance due to privacy concerns and logistical hurdles.

As EV adoption continues to grow and vehicle prices trend downward thanks to cheaper batteries and rising competition, affordability remains a central issue. But while the market moves to make electric vehicles more accessible, state policies may inadvertently create new barriers.

What is clear is that while EVs promise long-term savings in fuel and maintenance, many owners are discovering that going electric may come with an unexpected price tag, and not just at the dealership.",https://www.explica.me/__export/1754185110389/sites/debate/img/2023/08/02/tesla_nuevas_vacantes_remotas_y_presenciales_en_mxxico_xagosto_2023x_trabaja_para_elon_musk.jpg_673822677.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 08:02:56.353658
,American Energy,2025-08-03 08:07:37+00:00,The Japan Times,How Trump is gaslighting the climate — with Japan's help,"Mara Budgen, Mara Budgen Contributing, www.japantimes.co.jp, mara-budgen",,,,,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/environment/2025/08/03/energy/trump-lng-push-japan/,"With its LNG export capacity set to triple, accounting for one-third of the global total by 2030, the U.S. needs buyers.
In February, Trump said Japan would start importing “record numbers” of American LNG.
Trump also lifted a moratorium on permits for new LNG export facilities that was adopted by Biden in January 2024.
This push “has been largely successful” as Asian, European and Middle Eastern buyers sign on to purchase more American gas.
Melanie Oldham, founder and director of environmental justice organization Better Brazoria, lives a few kilometers from the Freeport LNG export facility in Freeport, Texas.","Nestled among the bold characters of headlines about freshly signed U.S. trade deals are equally bold numbers: $550 billion, $250 billion, $100 billion. These are some of the eye-watering figures that countries have promised to invest in or buy from the United States’ energy sector — primarily its fossil fuel industry — as part of the agreements.

Whether such large amounts of money will actually be pumped into the U.S. economy is yet to be seen, but in the meantime, U.S. President Donald Trump is living up to his promise to “drill, baby, drill” by aggressively promoting America’s energy resources, especially natural gas.

Increasing the United States’ oil and gas production means it can rely on these as cheap energy sources domestically while also selling them abroad to reduce its trade deficit with other countries — so the MAGA argument goes.

Major environmental concerns about boosting this industry aside — particularly given the country’s status as the top emitter of methane from oil and gas production — the economic case is also far from clear.

Increased American gas exports, most of which are traded abroad via ship as liquefied natural gas (LNG), could push up domestic energy prices at a time when households are already feeling the pain of high living costs.

Plus, as the world gears up for an unprecedented increase in LNG export capacity, many believe that global supply will outstrip demand, which is falling in major markets such as Japan and Europe and may not grow as much as the industry hopes in emerging economies such as China and India.

With its LNG export capacity set to triple, accounting for one-third of the global total by 2030, the U.S. needs buyers. This is where Trump’s leverage tactics come in handy as Washington pushes America’s trading partners — including Japan — to buy more U.S. gas in exchange for more lenient tariffs.

In February, Trump said Japan would start importing “record numbers” of American LNG. While the president’s hyperboles should be taken with a comparably large grain of salt, Japanese companies have indeed been buying more of the fuel this year, on top of already sizable contracts and investments. Japanese banks are the top three financiers of LNG export projects in the U.S.

Jera, Japan’s largest power generator and one of the biggest LNG importers globally, has increased the U.S. share of its gas mix from 10% to nearly 30%. On July 22, as the ink on the U.S.-Japan trade deal was still drying, Trump said Japan had agreed to form a joint venture to develop an LNG project in Alaska, without specifying which project. The details of any potential venture remain unclear.

But the reality for those living at the heart of the American LNG buildout, in the coastal communities of Texas and Louisiana that look out on to the Gulf of Mexico, is one of diminishing returns.

Having already suffered the brunt of decades of oil, gas and petrochemical development — including a boom in LNG export facilities in the wake of the 2016 U.S. shale gas revolution that transformed the country from a net gas importer into the world’s No. 1 exporter — their health, livelihoods and environment are at stake as more facilities are due to come online.

“Paying for, financing, funding and insuring these projects is ensuring my children’s deaths,” says Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project of Louisiana, a disaster relief and environmental justice organization, and co-director of the Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub, who lives in Sulphur, Louisiana. Ozane’s six children suffer from ailments including skin, respiratory and neurological disorders.

Near where her family lives, CP2 LNG, a planned LNG export facility, reached a final investment decision — a key milestone for large energy projects — last month, thanks in part to a political and regulatory environment that is proving to be as accommodating to fossil fuel development as it is hostile to climate policies and renewable energy.

Redrawing the energy map

The U.S. government is doing everything in its power to move gas projects ahead, with Trump kicking off a wave of environmental deregulation and oil and gas permitting.

On his first day back in office, the president signed an executive order called Unleashing American Energy, undoing predecessor Joe Biden’s investments in clean energy and electric vehicles and boosting production of oil and gas — the “liquid gold under our feet,” as Trump called it in his inaugural address.

Soon after, Washington established the National Energy Dominance Council, headed by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fracking millionaire. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the gargantuan Republican spending legislation adopted in July, incentivizes oil and gas leasing, including by lowering federal royalties rates, and repeals a fee on methane emissions.

Trump also lifted a moratorium on permits for new LNG export facilities that was adopted by Biden in January 2024. Among such facilities, CP2 LNG, located in the Calcasieu Ship Channel in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, has received federal approval; if constructed, it would put the company that owns the project, Venture Global, in the lead as the United States’ biggest LNG exporter.

LNG has also become a major bargaining chip in Trump’s trade wars.

While this isn’t the first U.S. administration to use the fuel as a geopolitical tool, “Trump has taken a sticks, not a carrot approach” like others before him, says Sam Reynolds, a research lead at the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). This push “has been largely successful” as Asian, European and Middle Eastern buyers sign on to purchase more American gas.

“The administration is trying to redraw the map of energy dependence,” says Reynolds, though the growing competitiveness of renewable energy globally “will challenge what the U.S. can feasibly achieve by doubling down on fossil fuels.”

Footing the bill

On an early morning in mid-July, Ray Mallet is on his boat in the Calcasieu Ship Channel, where CP2 LNG is being built, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico — waters he knows well, having worked there as a commercial fisher all his life.

But on this day, Mallet isn’t casting his nets and lines as usual. Together with other fishers, as well as scientists and local environmentalists, he’s deploying hydrophones in the water to test whether noise pollution from the Calcasieu Pass LNG export terminal, which sits where the channel meets the gulf, is causing a severe decline in seafood catch rates.

The hydrophones are being used to scientifically verify what local fisherfolk already “know and see,” says Alyssa Portaro, founder of the Habitat Recovery Project, a Louisiana-based conservation nonprofit that is running the data collection project: Since Calcasieu Pass LNG started production in 2022, catches of shrimp, crabs and fish have decreased dramatically year after year.

“I’ve had to go fish elsewhere to try to support my family,” Mallet says.

Anthony Theriot, known as “Tad,” who lives a little over 1.5 kilometers from Calcasieu Pass LNG, has also been fishing here his whole life. Shrimpers and fishers used to make a good living, he says, but income has declined sharply since the plant started.

“This was the No. 1 seafood capital of the U.S. and now it’s the world capital of LNG exports,” says Portaro.

What is happening in Cameron Parish mirrors conditions across the Gulf Coast. Existing socioeconomic disparities are being exacerbated as American LNG facilities “tend to be sited in areas that are disproportionately home to communities of color and low-income communities,” according to a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) study on the impacts of U.S. LNG exports that was mandated by the Biden-era moratorium.

But the consequences may be felt further afield: The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects domestic gas prices to more than double through 2026 compared with last year and the DOE study finds that increasing LNG exports will lead to higher electric bills. Rising prices are also a concern for the industry as the cost of building LNG plants has soared, compounded by 50% U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminium.

Among those caught in the fallout is a major Japanese engineering, procurement and construction contractor, Chiyoda Corp., which in July stated that it will stop pursuing large-scale LNG projects overseas due to losses incurred from some U.S. facilities.

Ultimately, international buyers will foot at least part of the bill.

“U.S. LNG prices abroad are based on that domestic gas price as well as the capital expenditure of the facilities and both of those are rising,” says IEEFA’s Reynolds. In signing up for more American gas, Japan is “essentially committing over the long term to pay more for LNG.”

Unleashing a carbon bomb?

The world’s top LNG players, including Japan, are predicting high prices and high demand for the fuel, especially in Asia, over the next couple of decades. Yet many others foresee a glut in the market, with expected amounts of additional LNG supply above the level of demand in developing parts of Asia, according to Anne-Sophie Corbeau, global research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.

“There is a reasonable question about where all this LNG is going to go,” Corbeau says.

Reynolds points, for example, to the industry’s overly optimistic predictions about China. While it is the world’s largest buyer of LNG, having surpassed Japan in 2021, its imports haven’t grown significantly since then, in part due to a record-breaking adoption of renewable energy.

In Japan, gas demand is declining year after year, though according to the economy ministry, predicting future trends is difficult given the advent of new industries and technologies.

This means preparing for several scenarios, including one in which electricity demand increases due to the growth of artificial intelligence, among other factors, but energy sources such as renewables are deployed slowly. The government envisions a significant reduction of thermal power — including coal and gas — in Japan’s energy mix, but continues to set high targets for how much LNG its companies should contract.

What LNG isn’t needed domestically is increasingly being resold to countries in South and Southeast Asia.

The question of Asia’s gas needs also hangs over what Trump hopes will become the crown jewel of American energy dominance: Alaska LNG.

The project entails building a 1,300-kilometer north-south pipeline to transport gas across the largest U.S. state. From the south coast, LNG would be shipped to Asia via a much shorter route than that from the Gulf Coast — for example, gas would reach Japan in around 10 days rather than the typical 30 to 40 days.

Despite being under discussion for decades, Alaska LNG has never been developed due to the huge cost of building and operating a pipeline in the state’s harsh geographic and climatic conditions. In 2016, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie called it “one of the least competitive” LNG projects in the world.

Estimated to cost $44 billion — proportionally double the price of LNG export projects in the Gulf Coast — additional expenses, such as those incurred from the new tariff regime, haven’t even been factored in yet, Reynolds points out.

Alaska LNG has signed a nonbinding agreement with a Thai buyer and received interest from Indian, Taiwanese and South Korean players as well as Japanese companies such as Jera, Tokyo Gas and Mitsui. In contrast, the president of Japan Petroleum Exploration told Reuters in February that Alaska LNG “is not a realistic investment proposition due to its unclear economics and large scale.”

“If it has not taken a final investment decision, there is a very simple reason for that — economics,” Corbeau says.

Climate concerns also loom large when it comes to Alaska LNG — labeled a “carbon bomb” by environmental groups — and other such developments.

As global demand for oil collapses, gas is the fossil fuel industry’s last frontier. To some, this is good news, as gas emits less carbon dioxide than coal and oil when burned and can keep the lights on as societies transition to less carbon-intensive energy systems.

Others are concerned that investments in gas compete with those in renewables — a fact also highlighted by the DOE study — while experts note that lower carbon dioxide emissions does not mean it is a clean alternative, particularly because of the significant amount of methane emitted along the value chain.

“It’s like you’re trying to eat a healthier diet and instead of eating cookies, you’re going to eat candy,” says Allie Rosenbluth, U.S. campaign manager at U.S.-based nonprofit Oil Change International. Why not “try an apple”?

Some Gulf Coast communities are taking matters into their own hands. Melanie Oldham, founder and director of environmental justice organization Better Brazoria, lives a few kilometers from the Freeport LNG export facility in Freeport, Texas. Her community has started recording methane emissions from the plant using an optical gas imaging camera so that “people can see that we’re telling the truth” about LNG pollution, Oldham says.

While climate skeptics such as Wright — Trump’s energy secretary, who has described concerns about climate change as a “mania” — are too vocal a contingent in the U.S. government, Oldham urges “decision-makers in Europe and Asia (to) take a look at the whole picture.”

“People know that these projects are not a done deal,” says Rosenbluth. “They need local and state permits. They need financiers, they need actual buyers, and many of these projects do not have all of those things.”",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/08/03/485027.jpeg?v=3.1,N,,2025-08-03 04:59:54.738756

There are 14 million households without air conditioning in the US, but lack of access is more acute in some communities.
In New York, 10% of households don’t have AC, but that percentage doubles in many Black, Latino and low-income neighborhoods.
As it gets hotter, though, free home cooling programs are becoming more common.
“Low-income households are about one-third as likely to receive an energy-efficiency incentive.” Atalla underscored that programs that can help cover the costs of energy bills — which low-income households spend a disproportionate amount of income in — can also help make free air conditioner programs more effective.","With heat advisories blanketing the eastern half of the US, air conditioners are once again working over time as essential resources to keep millions cool. But they’re unevenly distributed: Many poor households are unable to afford them.

To reduce the gap between the air conditioning haves and have nots, a growing number of programs are giving them out for free with waiting lists numbering in the thousands. And they view them as means to protect public health and reduce poverty.

Heat-related deaths have doubled over the last quarter century, and more people will be at risk as the planet warms. Temperature increases are correlated with higher disease risk and mortality rates. Extreme heat can reduce productivity, impact children’s cognitive development and lower overall wellbeing.

“Each individual heat-related death is preventable,” said Kai Chen, a researcher of environmental health at Yale University, “and in the past 20 years, air conditioning use has drastically reduced heat-related mortality.”

He added that without ACs, the amount of heat-related deaths in the US would likely double, especially for older adults.

There are 14 million households without air conditioning in the US, but lack of access is more acute in some communities. In New York, 10% of households don’t have AC, but that percentage doubles in many Black, Latino and low-income neighborhoods. Over 500 people die from heat in New York City each summer, mostly at home with a broken or underpowered air conditioner, according to the city’s most recent report on heat mortality. The top reason for the lack of cooling: cost.

The state’s Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) provides ACs to low-income households with members over 65 or under 6, and Governor Kathy Hochul launched a program in June that makes units available to any low-income adult with asthma, which is exacerbated by heat.

The new program, which distributes the ACs through enrollment in the state’s Essentials Healthcare Plan, focuses on ages that HEAP does not cover.

“We think this is really important as extreme weather events are happening more and more and with a lower-income population with health needs, this is absolutely a meaningful way we can help them manage their health,” said Danielle Holahan, executive director at New York State of Health, the state’s marketplace for affordable health insurance, which administers the program.

But the program and others like it face challenges due to funding cuts. Federal money for many state-level heating and cooling relief programs is in peril, and energy-efficiency tax credits, which help households afford better cooling appliances, have been cut as part of President Donald Trump’s recently signed tax law.

The bedrock of New York’s program, the Essentials Healthcare Plan, was implemented under the Affordable Care Act. According to Holahan, the program has funding for the next five years, but cuts to the ACA in the new law could remove eligibility for about 730,000 enrollees, especially lawfully present immigrants.

Local, non-governmental groups run similar programs and have found strong demand. In Cincinnati, which will see a run of extreme heat break by the end of the week, there's a waiting list of more than 2,700 people for a program that gives out free air conditioners.

The program, run by the anti-homelessness charity St. Vincent de Paul, provides ACs to anyone 65 and older or with a medical need. Their waiting list grew by 700 in the last few weeks alone.

While St. Vincent de Paul Cincinnati’s program initially gave out fans, that felt like a “band-aid” for a persistent problem, said Kaytlynd Leinhart, who leads the organization’s development and marketing. The group switched to ACs in 2019. It is funded by local donors, businesses and foundations.

Leinhart said nonprofits carry more responsibility after pandemic-era support tapered off. She emphasized how cooling can be a stepping stone out of a crisis by providing something as simple as good night’s sleep.

“If you're a single mom on one income, imagine that that's how you're starting your day every day, with your baby having not slept, you've not slept, you've been severely uncomfortable all night,” she said.

Providing a free AC can help individuals cope with heat stress and better attend to pressing challenges.

Demand is especially high this year. The Cincinnati program gave out over 700 ACs in both 2023 and 2024 while in 2022, it provided 980 units. This year, it expects to exceed 1,000 units.

However, providing that many will cost $110,000, and the group only has $75,000 in funding this year. With such a long waitlist, many won’t receive relief.

Climate change is making summers hotter in New York and Cincinnati, places that already regularly experience temperatures above 90F (32C). Traditionally cool cities where air conditioning is less prevalent are also seeing temperatures rise. As it gets hotter, though, free home cooling programs are becoming more common.

“Cooling is going from being a luxury or a ‘nice to have’ in many places to being essential for health and safety,” said Laila Atalla, a building decarbonization expert at clean energy nonprofit RMI.

In the wake of a 2021 heat dome that killed hundreds across the US Pacific Northwest and Canada, the city of Portland, Oregon, formed Cooling Portland with the nonprofit Earth Advantage to install energy-efficient heat pumps in households at high risk of heat-related illness.

Using heat pumps is the ideal solution because of their reliability, smaller environmental footprint and affordability, reducing cooling costs by about 20%, Atalla said.

In 2022, Cooling Portland set a target of installing 15,000 units by 2027, but it reached that goal earlier this summer and plans to install 5,000 units this year alone. In a city that is 70% white, the program is helping close the racial cooling disparity: Of those served, about a third are Black and 14% Hispanic or Latino.

Portland funds its work through a 1% surcharge on local billion-dollar corporations, passed via a 2018 ballot measure. The fund — which has raised $1.2 billion — can only be used for climate justice initiatives.

Amidst the Trump administration’s cuts to social welfare and climate programs, Atalla said that local governments and utilities can do more to improve cooling access using money they already have. They noted that the US spends $9 billion a year on energy efficiency programs that only 3% of households take advantage of because of complex applications, inconsistent eligibility requirements and income verification hurdles.

“There’s an equity dimension here too,” Atalla said. “Low-income households are about one-third as likely to receive an energy-efficiency incentive.”

Atalla underscored that programs that can help cover the costs of energy bills — which low-income households spend a disproportionate amount of income in — can also help make free air conditioner programs more effective. They also pointed to a Colorado bill that would prevent utilities from disconnecting power for nonpayment during extreme heat events as another means to keep people safe.

As the state adds over 3 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale solar capacity annually—surpassing even California—Florida is quietly cementing itself as a national leader in renewable energy. But beneath the surface of this surge lies a complex investment landscape, shaped by legislative shifts, supply chain dynamics, and the urgency of federal tax credit deadlines. For investors, the question is not just whether Florida's solar boom is real, but whether it is sustainable—and how to position for both its opportunities and risks.

The Policy Catalyst: Streamlining Permitting and Accelerating Deployment

Florida's 2025 solar legislation, HB 683, has emerged as a game-changer. By mandating five-day permitting timelines for single-trade solar projects and allowing private and virtual inspections, the law cuts through decades of bureaucratic bottlenecks. This reform is particularly timely as the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for residential solar projects expires at year-end 2025. For developers, the law slashes “soft costs”—administrative and permitting expenses—by up to 30%, making Florida a more attractive market.

However, the same year saw the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA), a federal policy that accelerates the phase-out of solar tax credits. While the ITC remains at 30% for projects starting construction by July 2026, it drops to 80% by 2029 and vanishes by 2032. This creates a “use-it-or-lose-it” scenario for developers, particularly those reliant on tax equity financing. Florida Power & Light (FPL), the state's largest utility, has capitalized on these dynamics, accounting for 70% of new solar installations in 2024 and planning 4 GW of battery storage by 2033.

The Investment Playbook: Timing, Arbitrage, and Resilience

For investors, the key to Florida's solar market lies in timing. Projects that can begin construction by July 2026 are eligible for the full 30% ITC, creating a window for tax credit arbitrage. This has triggered a “rush to file” among developers, with larger firms leveraging capital to meet tight deadlines. Smaller companies, however, face existential risks due to limited liquidity and supply chain constraints—tariffs on Chinese solar equipment have inflated costs by 15–20%, squeezing margins.

Meanwhile, grid infrastructure and energy storage present underappreciated opportunities. FPL's $300 million investment in battery storage by 2026 reflects a broader trend toward hybrid systems that pair solar with backup power. Babcock Ranch, a solar-powered town that maintained energy independence during Hurricane Ian, is piloting microgrid technology—a model likely to gain traction as climate risks intensify. For investors, companies specializing in smart inverters, grid modernization, and decentralized energy solutions (e.g., Enphase Energy, Sunrun) could outperform the broader sector.

Corporate Demand and Market Resilience

Corporate clean energy procurement is another tailwind. Tech giants like Meta and Amazon have secured long-term solar contracts in Florida, drawn by the state's low levelized cost of energy ($25/MWh) and abundant sunlight. These agreements provide stable cash flows for developers and insulate projects from market volatility. Additionally, Florida's solar industry now employs 14,108 people, with 447 active solar companies, creating a robust ecosystem of suppliers and service providers.

Yet challenges persist. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warns that Florida could lose 21,800 solar jobs if the OBBBA's accelerated tax credit phase-out remains unaltered. Moreover, the state's lack of a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) means long-term growth depends on market forces rather than regulatory mandates.

Risk Mitigation and Strategic Diversification

Investors should hedge against policy uncertainty by diversifying geographically. While Florida remains a solar hotbed, states like Texas and Georgia offer more stable regulatory environments. Additionally, focusing on storage and grid infrastructure—sectors less sensitive to ITC fluctuations—can provide downside protection. For example, companies like Tesla and SunPower, which integrate solar with battery solutions, are well-positioned to capitalize on Florida's resilience-driven demand.

Conclusion: A Solar Frontier with Nuanced Opportunities

Florida's solar surge is not just a story of sun and silicon—it's a case study in policy agility and market adaptability. For investors, the path to returns lies in capitalizing on the 2026 ITC deadline, embracing storage and grid infrastructure, and navigating the risks of a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. While the OBBBA introduces headwinds, Florida's combination of economic incentives, corporate demand, and innovation in resilience makes it a compelling frontier for solar investment. The key is to act decisively—and to look beyond the panels themselves to the systems that will power the state's future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 12:04:49.007268

India, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia are among the most prominent proponents of the Global South, spearheading substantial reforms in climate action within the global governance architecture through platforms such as the G20, the India, Brazil, and South Africa initiative (IBSA), BRICS+, and multilateral development banks (MDBs). The energy transitions of these countries and their partners are critical to global emissions reductions. Collectively, these countries represent nearly 25 percent of the global population and 12 percent of the global emissions. Despite diverse contexts, these countries share similar challenges that can be effectively addressed collectively.

This special report outlines the challenges posed by legacy fossil fuel infrastructure, inadequate financial commitments, and reliance on concentrated supply chains. Together, these countries can strengthen their collective bargaining power, fortify institutional capacity to absorb climate finance, harmonize climate finance taxonomies, implement comprehensive strategies to phase out fossil fuels, create channels for sharing knowledge of best practices in climate finance deployment, and maintain long-term competitive advantage through clean industrial strategies.

I. Introduction

India, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia are regarded as the emerging powers in the developing world, or what some have termed the Global South. Founded in 2003, the India-Brazil-South Africa, or IBSA, initiative provided a forum to promote development cooperation and knowledge sharing among the three largest democratic developing economies across Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The four countries are members of the G20, where they have held consecutive presidencies starting with Indonesia in 2022, leveraging the opportunity to put energy transition as a key priority for the G20. In 2025, Indonesia joined the expanded BRICS as a full member, providing another platform where the four countries can collaborate to advance the goals of energy transition, building on the lessons from their G20 presidencies.

This special report explores how an IBSA+Indonesia framework could alleviate constraints and address the shared challenges of energy transitions. Together, IBSA and Indonesia represent nearly 25 percent of the global population and 12 percent of global emissions. These countries have set ambitious targets to transition away from fossil fuels, but they face both distinct and common challenges in their energy transition strategies. Electricity demand is expected to increase by 38 to 55 percent by 2035 across the four countries, further complicating the challenge of reducing reliance on fossil fuels without compromising universal energy access. The diversity in energy profiles shapes each country’s energy transition pathways and constraints. Brazil’s relatively clean power sector (nearly 90 percent renewables) creates a strong foundation for renewables, but it is increasingly dependent on fossil fuels for transportation and other hard-to-abate sectors, such as steel. On the other hand, South Africa remains heavily dependent on coal, which accounts for over 70 percent of its total energy supply and faces the challenge of transitioning coal-dependent communities while maintaining energy security. India and Indonesia are gradually increasing renewable capacity, but must strike a balance between rapidly growing energy demand and efforts to decarbonize.

Despite their differences, all four countries share common challenges, including political and economic sensitivities, infrastructure gaps, and social equity concerns. They encounter significant climate finance gaps: developing countries, excluding China, will need an estimated $2.4 trillion annually by 2030 to achieve climate and development goals. Additionally, fragmented regulatory systems and reliance on foreign supply chains, especially China, which controls up to 90 percent of global clean tech manufacturing, create structural risks to energy security and long-term competitiveness. Effective energy transition strategies require coordinated, locally adapted policies, informed by the shared experiences of the Global South.

To identify areas of cooperation, Section II provides a brief overview of how IBSA and Indonesia are advancing their energy transition ambitions into practice. These countries are at different stages of integrating renewable energy into the energy mix, phasing out fossil fuels, and implementing industry-specific shifts. The phase-out of coal and oil from the energy mix touches sensitive issues surrounding countries’ employment footprint and is further deterred by steep increases in projected energy demand. Despite ambitious emissions reduction targets, these countries struggle to achieve cross-ministerial alignment that embodies whole-of-government efforts. This is crucial for ensuring clean energy access across diverse social groups and geographies, and more broadly, for achieving the dual goals of development and energy transitions.

In Section III, the discussion on climate finance highlights the twin crises of insufficient climate finance and insufficient institutional capacity to absorb funds. Additionally, inspite of the deployment of various climate finance instruments, there is a lack of coherence in the investment environment for both domestic and international participants. To solve these crises cooperatively, IBSA and Indonesia have a significant opportunity to harmonize climate finance taxonomies, share lessons learned from the deployment of climate finance instruments in similar environments, jointly strengthen the political and financial fluency of institutions, and elevate similar local initiatives for greater investor visibility.

All four countries heavily rely on external manufacturers, principally China and Europe, for key clean energy inputs. Section IV explains how access to critical minerals, grid modernization, storage, and emerging fuels (like green hydrogen) are becoming bottlenecks in energy transitions, especially as Global North countries pursue aggressive industrial strategies that disadvantage developing countries with limited capabilities to decarbonize. IBSA and Indonesia must limit their reliance on concentrated supply chains by adopting strategic clean industrial policies, as well as co-developing clean technologies of the future made by and for the Global South.

The final section recommends an IBSA and Indonesia framework that addresses the shared constraints of the energy transitions and foster long term competitiveness through alignment: facilitating collective bargaining of capital, developing clean technologies, building institutional capacity, enabling workforce transitions away from fossil fuels, and establishing effective clean industrial strategies.

II. Energy Transitions Strategies

IBSA, the tripartite cooperative framework between India, Brazil, and South Africa, has had some success in poverty and hunger alleviation, access to life-saving medications, education, safe drinking water, and the development of biofuels. The initiative has also focused on funding projects led and driven by the Global South, and concurrently called for reforms in the international financial architecture. Indonesia shares in the legacy of ensuring Global South priorities remain a part of the global governance agenda, beginning with its founding membership in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and its role in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). As of 2023, together IBSA+Indonesia represent nearly 25 percent of the global population, just over 7 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), and about 12 percent of global emissions (Figure 1), with expected increases in emissions till 2030 and a decline thereafter (Table 1).

Despite these successes, IBSA's role and impact have been eroded recently due to the emergence of competing groupings, most notably BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). Indonesia became a full member in January 2025, and along with Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Iran now form an expanded BRICS+ group. However, as some of the fastest-growing clean energy markets globally, IBSA+Indonesia offers opportunities for coordination and flexibility to pursue their shared agendas on just energy transitions that go beyond the limitations of groups like BRICS+.

Brazil has a clean electricity mix, which positions the country well to decarbonize its economy through electrification (Figure 2). In 2023, the share of renewables in the electricity mix reached 89.2 percent (49.1 percent of the total energy supply). Brazil's clean electricity mix has remained well above global levels, at over 70 percent, over the last 20 years. Since 2015, Brazil has become a net exporter of oil, consuming 50 percent of its total production. Conversely, it depends on natural gas (30 percent) and coal imports (80 percent). Brazil plans to phase out coal-fired power plants by 2040. Brazil's energy transition strategy (outlined in Table 1) emphasizes a broader economic-ecological approach that includes a strategy to promote sustainability through the use of biological alternatives such as bio-fuels rather than a conventional shift in the energy mix. In 2022, Brazil's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) pledged to achieve net zero by 2050, with a 35 percent emissions reduction compared to 2005 levels by 2025, and 59 percent - 67 percent by 2030. Some of the hard-to-abate sectors, including aviation and steel, require different approaches. South Africa's mitigation strategy involves a Peak, Plateau, and Decline (PPD) emissions trajectory that targets peak emissions in 2025, plateau through 2035, and absolute decline thereafter (Table 1). In its updated NDC, published in 2021, the country commits to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions further, a significant tightening from its initial targets (Table 1). However, as Figure 1 and 2 depict, coal accounts for a large part of South Africa's total energy supply, over 70 percent, making it one of the most coal-dependent countries in the world. It ascribes South Africa's high per capita emissions status, which is many magnitudes higher than India, Brazil, and Indonesia. This makes South Africa the least well-positioned to achieve its net-zero goals. Powerful historical and socio-cultural narratives surrounding the ownership of coal mines and the centralized electricity supply (approximately 90 percent) by Eskom, the state utility, have complicated South Africa's transition away from coal. The financial instability at Eskom, end-of-life coal deposits, infrastructure constraints, and the NDC goals have prompted the government to lead several initiatives aimed at creating a more pro-investment environment in South Africa. Furthermore, despite delayed delivery, the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) Investment Plan in South Africa is ambitious and expansive, targeting clean energy for electricity, clean energy vehicles, and green hydrogen.

India faces similar struggles in phasing out coal, which accounts for 45 percent of India's total energy supply (Figure 2). India's federalized electricity sector and coal's regional employment footprint heavily constrain reform. India has one of the most ambitious energy targets, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2070, and seeks to achieve 50 percent of its cumulative installed capacity from non-fossil sources, totaling 500 gigawatts (GW), by 2030 (see Table 1). As of July 2025, India achieved its 2030 target of 50 percent electrification from non-fossil fuel sources, 5 years ahead of set goals. India is growing its renewables capacity at the fastest rate among emerging economies. However, energy access is bifurcated, with large portions of rural and peri-urban populations relying on non-modern biomass. When faced with fragmented institutional coordination and state-level politicization, achieving clean energy targets and integrated energy access presents a significant challenge.

Indonesia's energy transition bottlenecks mirror IBSA countries in addressing captive coal use, transmission connectivity in remote areas, and equity concerns surrounding the costs of the energy transition. Indonesia's optimistic scenario envisions net zero emissions by 2060 (Table 1), with a 43.2 percent reduction by 2030. Indonesia's core decarbonization strategy involves the JETP. Despite the United States' recent departure from the JETP, Indonesia has signaled its intent to continue towards its commitments, with support from Germany, Japan, and several international organizations. In contrast to these developments and despite growing concerns about economic efficiency, construction of

coal power plants has continued, and fossil fuel subsidies remain politically sensitive and a socially embedded issue. The country is also increasingly turning to the United States and BRICS for liquefied natural gas and oil to secure its energy supply.

All four countries are pursuing ambitious energy transition strategies and goals, both domestically and through international platforms like the G20, BRICS, and the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP). Table 1 details the latest NDC targets, where India, Indonesia, and Brazil pledge an immediate decline in emissions, and South Africa tries to balance its development targets with a PPD approach. Across the board, access to energy across social groups and geographies remains central to transition strategies but is met with significant challenges of cross-ministerial alignment, phasing out of fossil fuels, and projected peak energy demand outpacing emissions reduction targets.

III. Climate Finance: Leadership, Opportunities, And Constraints

The past few years have witnessed escalating military conflicts globally, leading to increased defense spending and reducing the fiscal space available for Global North and multilateral contributions to energy transitions. Reorienting climate finance systems to address these ambitious clean energy targets requires multilateral coherence and leadership from Global South countries to set norms that support just and equitable energy transitions. This section on climate finance explores IBSA and Indonesia's push for climate finance for the Global South through the multilateral processes, the role of international climate finance in achieving NDC targets, and the effectiveness of domestic climate finance vehicles and instruments.

As a baseline, to get to net zero, an estimated $10 trillion by 2070 is needed for India, $6 trillion by 2050 for Brazil, $450 billion by 2050 for South Africa, and $2.4 trillion by 2060 for Indonesia (Table 2). At Azerbaijan's COP29, the new deal to provide developing nations with at least $300 billion a year and $1.3 trillion by 2035 fell short of the estimated climate finance for developing countries to meet their net-zero targets. Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) also fell short by reiterating previously set goals of $120 billion by 2030, instead of setting new targets. Despite limited commitments from traditional donors, these developments have shed light on the important role of non-traditional donors in this sector like the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states (especially Saudi Arabia) and BRICS countries. For instance, the $30 billion Alterra Fund, aimed at mobilizing climate-related investments, and Masdar, both launched by the UAE, are actively investing and entering joint ventures in Indonesia. Qatar's central bank has similarly been injecting large sums of climate finance and activating green bonds across Asia.

IBSA and Indonesia are attempting to attract private capital by offering attractive incentives, but the cost differential between multilateral and private financing is both substantial and unsustainable, making it difficult for private finance to fund the energy transition solely. Current climate finance mechanisms remain severely fragmented, burdened by conditionalities, and structurally unequipped to attract investment at the scale required for equitable transitions. For instance, Brazil will require an estimated $200 billion in investment to meet its 2030 climate goals, which is over $100 billion more than the country is currently projected to receive by 2030, ranking it as the seventh-highest climate investment gap globally and the second-highest among emerging markets outside of China. In South Africa, tracked annual climate finance averaged $7.4 billion during 2019-2021, a record high. However, this figure remains significantly below the estimated average annual requirement of $18.9-$30.2 billion to meet 2030 objectives, suggesting the need to increase flows fivefold (Table 2).

International Climate Finance

The past four Global South G20 presidencies have seen significant traction on climate finance through the Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG) and the Energy Transitions Working Group (ETWG). Indonesia's 2022 presidency set the agenda by identifying key pillars at the core of Global South energy transitions. India's presidency provided a platform for voices from the Global South by mainstreaming African challenges, the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and poverty in the G20 agenda. Brazil's presidency carried forward these initiatives and further anchored the G20 narrative of green transitions in development realities. This year, South Africa's message has maintained consistency by underscoring the need to scale energy transition investments globally by derisking private investment for climate change. A crucial omission, however, has remained: accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels. The G20 has served as an important platform for these four emerging economies to set norms for their needs and highlight climate financing gaps. It has introduced new targets and mechanisms for achieving them. However, these countries must now focus on implementing and operationalizing existing mechanisms that the G20 process has already delivered, rather than reinventing them.

Table 3 lists some of the most notable international climate finance partnerships, among them JETPs, green bonds, and national development banks offer essential insights into the role international finance plays in the energy transitions of IBSA and Indonesia. Insufficient funding is not the sole constraint. These countries also suffer from inadequate institutional capacity to absorb and deploy these funds.

The United States was one of the global leaders instrumental in securing JETPs for South Africa and Indonesia. While its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement (for a second time) and the JETPs have hurt the total international climate finance contributions, JETP host countries and their partners have remained steadfast in continuing the partnership and have invited other stakeholders to make up the difference. In both cases, withdrawal from JETP is of consequence from a symbolic standpoint, given the United States' influence over multilateral institutions. Substantively, the contributions primarily consist of loans through the United States Development Finance Corporation, which account for a minor share. In South Africa, German leadership has tried to mobilize other actors to close the gap, but the involvement of multiple institutions (about 50) and fragmented conditionalities make strategic coherence extremely difficult.

Indonesia JETP is far more reliant on the private sector than South Africa's, for nearly half of all contributions, anchored by the International Partners Group (IPG) and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). Indonesia's and South Africa's institutional capacity to absorb these large funds, $8.5 billion and $20 billion, respectively, has been sluggish, due to the slow processing of bankable project proposals and delays in reforming key policies, and in turn, has failed to attract investors to close the gaps. A combination of both institutional capacity and committed investors is critical to making significant climate finance partnership agreements like the JETP work.

Green bonds can play a big role in mobilizing climate finance. IBSA and Indonesia have different strategies to issue them. India primarily relies on domestic issuance in rupees, with local banks and insurers serving as core investors. However, these bonds offer a lower green premium than the global average and offer no financial advantage over regular bonds, making them less attractive and India has struggled to attract both domestic and foreign participation. In contrast, South Africa and Brazil prioritize global issuance. South Africa's Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) issued a $235 million bond through private placement with a French development finance institution, Agence Française de Développement (AFD). This allowed South Africa access to a deep pool of international investors, potentially lowering capital costs but increasing dependence on foreign sentiment and exchange rate risks. Brazil released its Sovereign Sustainable Bond Framework in September 2023, shortly after which it debuted its sustainable bond. When released in November 2023, Brazil's $1.5 billion dollar-denominated bond saw 2.9 times oversubscription and was upsized to $2 billion. Like South Africa, Brazil, too, received access to new investors, although it shares similar foreign exchange risks. Indonesia offers a mixed model, with a domestic $1.25 billion Green Sukuk Bond and the world's first publicly offered sovereign international blue bond at $150 million through Japan. In this way, it balances both its local infrastructure and access to foreign capital. Overall, while global issuance offers larger, diversified funds, it introduces currency and external market vulnerabilities. A domestic strategy aligns with national priorities but can severely limit scale and investor diversity.

Beyond the JETP and green bonds, an essential international finance partnership vehicle is national development banks, which secure and channel concession finance. International experience, most notably from China, Japan, and Brazil's BNDES (Brazilian Development Bank), demonstrates the valuable role that public financial institutions can play in anchoring green industrial policy and scaling green lending (Table 3). These entities provide concessional credit, coordinate large-scale clean energy and industrial investments, and serve as institutional hubs for implementing climate strategies. In Brazil, for instance, BNDES not only channels concessional finance for sectors such as agriculture but also spearheads coordinated investment efforts through mechanisms such as the Amazon Bank Alliance and the Climate Fund.

Domestic Climate Finance Vehicles and Instruments

In response to investment gaps, countries in the IBSA + Indonesia grouping have been deploying industrial policies, taxonomies (a taxonomy is a classification system that defines and organizes economic activities based on sustainability criteria to evaluate their merit for government subsidies), as well as sector-specific and economy-wide climate finance instruments. These initiatives (Table 4) are increasingly translating into measurable domestic financial flows. India's tracked green finance in the fiscal year 2021-22 reached approximately $50 billion. Finance for mitigation was sourced predominantly through domestic channels, although there was a 2 percent year-on-year increase in international climate finance. Overall, finance flows to mitigation-related sectors rose by 20 percent during the same period.

In India, investment is driven by government-backed schemes and fiscal instruments, including the Payment Security Mechanism, Production Linked Incentives, and other targeted sector-level initiatives. In Brazil, the National Development Bank (BNDES) has sought to acquire equity stakes in companies to de-risk private capital flows into strategic sectors such as critical minerals, battery manufacturing, and electric vehicles. The bank has allocated approximately $1.6 billion in its acquisition budget for this purpose. The Brazilian government has introduced its industrial policy, ""Brazil New Industry,"" which allocates about $60 billion to modernize the national industrial sector, focused on increasing autonomy and further developing clean energy sources. Complementing this effort, Brazil's Growth Acceleration Plan directs approximately $61 million, double from the 2020 allocation, toward mining-related research and development. Additionally, the Green Mobility and Innovation program provides more than $3.8 billion in tax incentives to encourage low-carbon automobile transformation.

Similarly, in Indonesia, policy frameworks such as the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) and the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) are designed to mobilize private capital and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuel-intensive development.

Changes in electricity sector regulation have been a critical driver of growth in South Africa's climate finance landscape. These include the removal of licensing thresholds for new generation capacity, the development of wheeling and trading frameworks, and the declining costs of renewable technologies such as wind and solar. In parallel, the shift in market preferences, net-zero commitments by commercial financial institutions, and regulatory signals, such as the moratorium on new coal-fired power, have contributed to the realignment of investment strategies toward decarbonization.

IBSA and Indonesia are in different phases of publishing climate finance taxonomies to complement their clean industrial policies (Table 4). A climate finance taxonomy that provides clear definitions of green finance and climate finance and builds synergies with existing national goals can help reduce uncertainty and foster investor confidence, thereby facilitating the scaling of green finance and climate finance. The European Union's taxonomy has shown tangible outcomes over time, including higher volumes of aligned capital investments. However, interoperability and mutual legibility of taxonomies are crucial for scaling up green investments in the Global South. India and Brazil's proposed new taxonomies should be compatible with those of Indonesia and South Africa. Taxonomies must provide clarity, strict regulations, and penalties for institutions that fail to adapt. IBSA and Indonesia must share lessons learned from operationalizing taxonomies in similar contexts to further their energy transitions. For instance, Indonesia's land-use emissions are not being considered within current frameworks, despite their massive emissions profile.

Alongside industrial policy, taxonomy, and fiscal instruments, national public financial institutions are also emerging as essential enablers of climate-aligned investment. The structural bias of the global capital system continues to favor fossil fuel infrastructure, underscoring the need for systemic reform led by national platforms rather than fragmented, piecemeal efforts. A central pillar of such reform is the role of central banks in enforcing climate-aligned financial regulations. This includes implementing climate risk stress-testing frameworks and enforcing penalties for noncompliance, thereby aligning monetary stability with long-term decarbonization goals. In Indonesia, the experience of PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (PT SMI) further illustrates the potential of well-structured climate finance vehicles. Operated as a state-owned enterprise on a commercial basis, PT SMI combines sound governance and risk systems with project development expertise and the capacity to leverage private capital. Rather than establishing a new climate finance institution, the Indonesian government expanded PT SMI's mandate to include climate mitigation and adaptation, thereby capitalizing on existing institutional infrastructure and operational maturity.

Three lessons can be learned from PT SMI's institutional evolution. First, leveraging existing institutions, wherever feasible, can expedite the deployment of climate capital while maintaining alignment with national systems and standards. Second, strong and independent governance, supported by clearly defined investment mandates and comprehensive risk management frameworks, ensures discipline and credibility in financing decisions. Third, financial sustainability and leverage are essential to longevity. PT SMI maintains return hurdle rates, offers blended finance instruments such as investment grants to reduce capital costs, and preserves financial leverage without placing an undue burden on the state balance sheet. This climate finance vehicle design offers valuable insights for other developing and emerging economies aiming to scale climate action through financially resilient and institutionally anchored mechanisms. These institutional reforms operate in parallel with broader regulatory and market shifts that enable climate investment at scale.

Current trends highlight how these enabling conditions are translating into concrete shifts in sectoral financial flows. In India, foreign direct investment in the renewable energy sector has multiplied eightfold from FY 2021 to 2025. This surge is driven by large grid-scale solar projects as well as government-subsidized initiatives such as small solar power plants, solar pumps for agriculture, and rooftop solar systems. Tracked climate finance flows to electric vehicles rose from $513 million in 2020-21 to nearly $1.5 billion in 2021-22. These flows cover a wide range of vehicle types, including cars, buses, three-wheelers (such as e-rickshaws), and two-wheelers. In Indonesia, approximately 67 percent of the $35.6 billion in total investment between 2016 and 2021 went to renewable energy, primarily geothermal and hydropower. Over the same period, investments in new fossil fuel generation have been in decline. In South Africa, debt financing accounts for 75 percent of annual climate finance, with 59 percent of this debt directed toward the clean energy sector. The majority of these flows are facilitated through market-rate debt instruments, with the average cost of capital ranging between 10 and 12 percent.

While IBSA and Indonesia have made serious efforts to make their clean energy markets attractive for investment, there is a growing disconnect between donor rhetoric and the technical delivery of climate finance. To enable a coherent investment strategy and align divergent donor targets, thresholds, and red lines; robust institutional capacity along with political and financial fluency is necessary. In some of the examples discussed in this section, the availability of climate finance falls short due to the lack of hospitable investment environments. In others, despite the availability of funds, there is a lack of institutional capacity to utilize them effectively. To meet targets and accelerate energy transitions, IBSA and Indonesia must strengthen both aspects of their climate finance landscape: climate finance commitments and last-mile delivery. Most importantly, all members of the Global South must elevate local initiatives, establish their own norms, and mold the international financial architecture to meet their needs.

IV. Clean Technology Cooperation and Diversifying Supply Chains

While international climate finance remains fragmented and structurally unequal, IBSA and Indonesia are advancing simultaneous strategies to secure domestic control over their clean energy transitions. Besides financial gaps, these countries face sensitive technological dependencies, supply chain vulnerabilities, and lack access to emerging technologies. This section outlines how IBSA+Indonesia can strengthen cooperation in clean technology development and supply chain diversification to reduce reliance on external actors and to create resilient, locally anchored clean energy industries. For that to be possible, strategic industrial policies, investment in innovation ecosystems, and coordinated regional standards and efforts are needed.

Collaborating on industrial strategy, especially in clean technology, offers a strategic opportunity to reduce external exposure, which is particularly urgent given the current patterns of technological dependence across IBSA and Indonesia. As shown in Table 5, all four countries rely heavily on external manufacturers, especially China and Europe, for key clean energy inputs. Solar manufacturing is particularly concentrated, with China dominating across the board. Wind and hydro technologies have more diverse sourcing patterns, offering potential opportunities for diversification. India and Brazil, for example, already contribute to wind manufacturing and could strengthen value chains with partners like Denmark and Spain. Solar energy faces greater challenges. Recent research indicates that the main obstacle in India and Brazil is not technological capacity but the high cost of capital. Diversifying solar photovoltaic (PV) supply chains outside China could increase manufacturing costs by about 30 percent, mainly due to high capital costs rather than a lack of technical capacity an issue likely mirrored in South Africa and Indonesia. Addressing these structural barriers through joint financing platforms or special investment incentives could boost domestic manufacturing capacity in crucial technologies.

Currently, China has become the leading power in the global clean energy supply chain. It processes over 60 percent of the world's rare earth elements and refines about 90 percent of battery-grade lithium. China also accounts for 70 percent of the global manufacturing value for all major clean energy technologies including solar PV, wind, batteries, electrolyzers, heat pumps, and electric vehicles. In response, Western economies are adopting aggressive, subsidy-heavy industrial policies, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the European Union's (EU) Green Deal Industrial Plan, to reduce dependence on Chinese inputs by supporting domestic clean energy production. While these efforts aim to secure supply chains and promote decarbonization, they also deepen existing structural inequalities. Although the economies of the Global South have not significantly contributed to the historical buildup of atmospheric CO2, they are the first to suffer from its harmful effects, which are worsened by their reliance on fossil fuels for energy security, limited access to concessional finance, and technology.

These geopolitical concentrations are further aggravated by the Western subsidy regimes and trade policies, such as the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CBAM imposes a carbon tariff on imports of emission-intensive goods into the European Union, including steel, cement, and fertilizers. Although the CBAM is intended to help reduce emissions, it disproportionately impacts countries with high industrial emissions and limited capacity for decarbonization. By applying a uniform carbon price across different development contexts, CBAM risks perpetuating historical inequalities. A report by the Centre for Science and Environment estimated that, at a

rate of €100 (or $106) per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, CBAM would impose an average annual tax burden of 25 percent on the value of CBAM-covered goods exported to the EU by India. Similarly, Africa faces export losses of up to 14 percent in aluminum and a 0.5 percent decline in GDP. These measures are being implemented without commitments for financing, technology, or transitional support, thus shifting the burden of decarbonization onto developing countries. Without fair frameworks, the Global South could be further marginalized in a subsidy-driven green economy.

Nonetheless, some policymakers argue that these pressures, though unjust, could encourage industrial growth in the Global South by motivating countries to adopt low-carbon standards, boost domestic manufacturing, and become more competitive in emerging cleantech value chains. For example, South Africa has started integrating carbon pricing into its domestic framework and launched the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP), supported by $8.5 billion in pledges from international partners, to promote a low-carbon, socially inclusive transition. However, while these efforts show potential benefits, the broader landscape remains structurally unequal few countries in the Global South have the fiscal space, institutional capacity, or technological access to absorb the short-term costs of CBAM while reaping long-term gains. Without reforms in global trade, finance, and technology governance, these industrial opportunities may remain largely inaccessible. These dynamics highlight the necessity of a coordinated strategy to localize and rebalance clean energy supply chains. As shown in Table 5, current sourcing patterns across IBSA and Indonesia reflect opportunities and risks in the clean tech manufacturing landscape.

To avoid that outcome, IBSA+Indonesia cooperation must go beyond shared structural disadvantages, to build practical, forward-looking industrial alliances. The Global South must adopt strategic industrial policies that identify important value chains and leverage state capacity to build long-term competitive advantages. Countries like Brazil, India, South Africa, and Indonesia should be viewed not just as resource suppliers but as emerging economic blocs with the potential to become self-sufficient clean technology markets, driven by regional demand, innovation ecosystems, and labor-intensive manufacturing. This involves going beyond extraction to develop comprehensive capabilities in sectors such as solar PV, batteries, green hydrogen, and grid infrastructure. Additionally, the Global South must define its value proposition not only in providing raw materials but also in shaping platform-level agendas, setting standards, and asserting leadership in global climate governance.

Increasingly, these countries are no longer content with merely following Western frameworks, such as CBAM. Instead, they aim to establish their own standards in areas like trade rules, logistics, and technology regulation. Initiatives such as India's Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, the African Union's Green Minerals Strategy, and Brazil's emerging green hydrogen plan show a change in mindset. The main challenge is expanding these efforts through coordinated investment, regional cooperation, and multilateral engagement that prioritize the development goals of the Global South, rather than just adopting frameworks created by others.

Critical Minerals

As clean energy infrastructure expands across the Global South, countries are focusing on securing the upstream materials that enable this growth. Critical minerals, such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements, are no longer viewed simply as commodities to be freely traded on global markets but as strategic assets linked to national development goals. By moving away from a free market approach, governments aim to ensure that mineral wealth leads to industrial growth, job creation, and domestic technological advancement. India's Critical Mineral Mission, Indonesia's export banks, and South Africa's draft mining reforms reflect a growing consensus on the importance of retaining value locally rather than exporting raw materials overseas. Brazil's new BYD electric vehicle plant in Bahia exemplifies this shift toward vertically integrated industrial strategies, from mining to clean tech manufacturing.

However, resource sovereignty alone is not enough. Cases like Mexico's state-led LitioMx illustrate the risks of pursuing resource nationalism without proper institutional readiness, which led to regulatory bottlenecks and investment uncertainty. The strategic goal for these developing countries remains to break historical patterns of extractivism and establish a more sovereign and equitable role in the global energy transition. One that relies not only on access to critical materials and domestic manufacturing but also on developing the necessary infrastructure to support and expand clean technologies.

Grid Modernization and Storage

Grid development and battery storage have become critical bottlenecks for many countries in the Global South. While wind and solar PV capacity are expanding rapidly, infrastructure often lags, resulting in delays in project deployment and reduced system efficiency. Globally, over 3,000 GW of renewable projects, 1,500 GW of which are in advanced stages, are stuck in grid connection queues, equivalent to five times the solar and wind capacity added in 2022. In several fast-growing economies, rising electrification and demand are outpacing grid readiness. Microgrids and battery storage can supplement infrastructure, but they cannot fully replace the need for modernized grids. Smarter, more resilient grids, facilitated by stronger regulatory frameworks, are essential for turning clean energy capacity into a reliable supply.

Several countries are beginning to address these gaps. South Africa has launched the continent's largest battery energy storage system (BESS), which is expected to support the design, procurement, installation, and sustainable operation of nearly 360 megawatts (MW) of large-scale energy storage infrastructure at six Eskom substation sites. India, by comparison, had installed 219.1 MW of BESS as of March 2024. Indonesia is piloting 5-10 MW systems, aiming to implement BESS across its power plants. Brazil, meanwhile, has conducted its first-ever auction to add batteries and storage systems to its grid. The planned batteries will help store energy from wind and solar sources which, although increasingly important in Brazil's energy mix, remain less predictable than traditional thermoelectric or hydropower units, thus aiding in balancing variability and ensuring grid reliability.

Still, without modern grids and large-scale storage, the growth of renewable energy in the Global South risks falling short of its potential. Battery deployment and grid upgrades must be regarded as essential infrastructure for a reliable and resilient clean energy future. However, deploying clean technologies at scale requires more than just physical infrastructure. It also depends on knowledge infrastructure. Without localized expertise, standards, and institutional support, even the most advanced technologies cannot succeed. As emerging technologies like clean hydrogen, small modular nuclear reactors, and long-duration storage evolve, the Global South must choose whether to remain passive recipients of innovation or active co-developers. Doing so will depend not only on investments but on deeper cooperation among research institutions, regulatory bodies, and innovation hubs.

Co-Development of Emerging Clean Technology

The growing focus on technical capacity and co-development is increasingly reflected in the rise of domestic research and innovation institutions across the Global South. These hubs are not only advancing frontier technologies, such as biofuels and green hydrogen, but are also emerging as key enablers of clean energy deployment through their focus on grid modernization, battery storage, and infrastructure innovation. In India, the Clean Energy Material Initiative (CEMI) advances next-generation energy systems through research on advanced materials, with a strong emphasis on solar technologies and energy storage. Brazil's Center for Research in Energy and Materials plays a vital role in bioenergy, nanotechnology, and sustainable fuels, while also contributing to grid-energy technologies that support the integration of variable renewable energy sources. South Africa's Global Cleantech Innovation Programme (GCIP-SA), led by its Technology Innovation Agency, supports clean tech entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises, and aims to tackle real-world barriers to clean energy access, including energy reliability and storage. Indonesia's Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional (BRIN) is not only developing bio-based technologies such as sustainable aviation fuels from coconut oil but also exploring modular and distributed storage systems that are better suited to the country's archipelagic geography (see Figure 3).

Crucially, these institutions offer more than just technological progress; they represent an evolving knowledge infrastructure essential for absorbing, adapting, and scaling clean energy solutions. By investing in their domestic research ecosystems, IBSA and Indonesia are laying the foundation for greater self-reliance in clean energy value chains, reducing dependence on external technologies and standards. They also serve as regional hubs for South-South cooperation, providing platforms for the joint development of technologies, standard-setting coordination, and shared innovation in areas such as grid digitalization, long-duration energy storage, and distributed energy systems. These efforts collectively reflect a strategic shift, where countries in the Global South are no longer merely adopting imported solutions. They are striving to shape the clean energy transition through indigenous innovation and institution-building. This momentum must be complemented by broader cooperation across IBSA+Indonesia to expand these models and ensure a more equitable, secure, and resilient energy future.

Conclusion

As some of the largest developing economies in the Global South, India, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia have embarked on an ambitious path to increase their share of clean energy and achieve their NDC commitments over the coming decades. To do so, they must address similar challenges, including phasing out legacy fossil fuel infrastructure, overcoming the high cost of capital, adapting to concentrated clean energy supply chains and limited access to clean technologies. The success of these countries is key, as they represent some of the fastest-growing clean energy markets in the world. Their collective actions will significantly shape global climate outcomes.

IBSA+Indonesia as a group offers significant opportunities for coordination and collaboration to achieve a just and equitable energy transition. As a formalized grouping focused on energy transitions, IBSA and Indonesia should align their efforts by exploring five key policy priorities: workforce transitions strategies to phase out fossil fuels, building capacity to absorb climate finance, alignment to facilitate collective bargaining of the price of capital, clean industrial strategies and fostering innovation to ensure long-term competitiveness.

To bridge the disconnect between ambition and technical delivery of climate finance IBSA and Indonesia must bolster the institutional capacity and cross-ministerial alignment of their climate vehicles, including central banks, climate banks, and ministries. This can be achieved through the implementation of joint programs that strengthen the financial and political literacy of government employees critical to the energy transition and ensure last-mile delivery of climate finance. Furthermore, these countries have a significant opportunity to set norms around climate investments in the Global South by harmonizing climate finance taxonomies and jointly elevating similar local initiatives for greater eater investor visibility. This type of alignment will also facilitate the collective bargaining power of this grouping to negotiate the price of capital and build a long-term pipeline for investments in their respective energy transitions.

IBSA and Indonesia have deployed several incentives and domestic climate finance instruments to crowd in private investment. Shared learning from experiences in different clean energy sectors has great value if similar contexts can be identified at both the central and local levels. As these countries develop long-term clean industrial strategies, they must establish a recurring knowledge-sharing and feedback process that advances these strategies and collectively addresses market uncertainties, such as pandemics and conflict. This can ensure the long-term competitive advantage of IBSA + Indonesia countries.

The innovation of clean technology and emerging fuels is crucial to maintaining the long-term competitive advantage of IBSA and Indonesia's energy transitions. In this report, we have identified a few notable clean tech research hubs, however, with booming entrepreneurship and innovation in these sectors, there will undoubtedly be many more names to add to these lists. IBSA and Indonesia should expand this list, maintain a current database, and establish a cooperative framework to co-develop clean technologies of the future.

A strategy must be in place to replace jobs lost in the energy transition, particularly given the sensitivities surrounding fossil fuel sectors in IBSA and Indonesia. These countries must aim to directly mitigate adverse outcomes by offering a combination of vocational training and unemployment benefits. They can benefit by identifying transferable skills and effective place-based policies that address a variety of socio-cultural contexts. Collectively addressing these challenges of energy transitions can lighten the burden on fossil fuels to meet projected energy demand.

Beyond national collaboration, these four countries must continue to uphold unified leadership in global climate governance and trade discussions. Engaging in multilateral platforms such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the World Trade Organization, and G20, is essential to shape international norms that reflect these nations’ development goals while safeguarding their economic interests. By aligning diplomatic efforts and harmonizing policy frameworks, India, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia can assert a just and equitable energy transition.

Under the Big Beautiful Bill, homeowners must complete their solar installations and other energy-efficient projects before the end of the year in order to reap the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, which would allow them to claim a tax credit of up to 30% of the installation price.

""About 1.2 million households utilize the credits for residential clean energy investments, with over $6 billion in savings,"" a recent article for the personal finance advice publication Kiplinger noted, analyzing January reporting from NPR in light of the Big Beautiful Bill's passing in July.

In other words, getting started sooner rather than later is essential. To get started on solar energy for your home, EnergySage allows you to access installation estimates and compare quotes for local services at no cost.

Upgrading your home energy system can help you save big on your bills while reducing your household's carbon footprint.

After all, the carbon pollution released through conventional methods of powering homes — that is, involving the burning of fossil fuels — is a significant contributor to our rising global temperatures and its repercussions, from weather instabilities to resource shortages.

Electric heat pumps have been put forward as the best option for home heating and cooling needs, rather than traditional HVAC systems.

Texas is the second-most-populous state in America with nearly 31 million residents, and they need air conditioning in the summer and heat in the winter. But that requires a lot of energy.

In 2021, a major winter storm named Uri hit the area and demand for power soared. Energy grids failed resulting in blackouts, frozen pipes, and presented dangerous conditions for people all over the state.

As the U.S. Department of Energy explains, heat pumps operate by transferring heat rather than generating it. This requires less energy than traditional HVAC units, but it is still effective at heating and cooling.

And less energy use means less pollution. In fact, another study done by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found heat pumps significantly reduce pollution.

It can be complicated to find the right HVAC fit for your home, let alone the right contractor. But companies like Mitsubishi help connect homeowners with trained professionals in their trusted network.

And since HVAC systems are responsible for an enormous percentage of our monthly energy bills, the switch will ultimately save you money. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy report says electric heat pumps would save customers an average of $300 per year.

Quite simply, making the switch to an electric heat pump is good for your wallet and the environment. And Mitsubishi's HVAC consultation program is the type of setup that makes it easier than ever by directly connecting with local installers and all of the information you'd need to make a decision.

As Steven Nadel of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy explains, heat pumps offer ""an enormous return on investment.""

He goes on to explain switching to heat pumps ""will save a lot of money to the consumers and reduce the winter peak demand.""

If you install a heat pump system before Dec. 31, you also could be eligible for government tax incentives.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Texas-power-gridimage-reclqOi1IQcU57bAV.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:58:48.810115

Despite removing climate change from its official state policy in 2024, Florida added more utility-scale solar than California last year, with over 3 gigawatts of new capacity coming online.
""There's no silver bullet,"" said Syd Kitson, founder of Babcock Ranch, a town designed to be powered almost entirely by solar.
Babcock Ranch runs on its own microgrid and stayed online during Hurricane Ian in 2022, while much of southwest Florida went dark.
""It won't kill the market,"" said Zoë Gaston, an analyst who follows the solar industry at Wood Mackenzie.","Solar energy is booming across the U.S. and, for the first time, Florida is catching up to industry powerhouses Texas and California.

Despite removing climate change from its official state policy in 2024, Florida added more utility-scale solar than California last year, with over 3 gigawatts of new capacity coming online.

""This is not a fluke,"" said Sylvia Leyva Martinez, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie. ""Florida is now shaping national solar growth.""

The surge is being driven by utilities, not rooftop panels. Florida Power & Light alone built over 70% of the state's new solar last year. A state rule lets developers skip lengthy siting reviews for projects under 75 megawatts, which speeds up construction and cuts costs.

""There's no silver bullet,"" said Syd Kitson, founder of Babcock Ranch, a town designed to be powered almost entirely by solar. ""But one thing Florida got right is acceptance. Here, people want solar. And we're proving it works.""

Babcock Ranch runs on its own microgrid and stayed online during Hurricane Ian in 2022, while much of southwest Florida went dark.

""We didn't lose power, internet, or water,"" said Don Bishop, a homeowner there. ""That changes how you think about energy.""

The economics are doing the rest. With industrial demand rising and natural gas prices climbing, solar is increasingly the cheapest option, even without subsidies.

""Utilities aren't building solar because it's green,"" Martinez said. ""They're doing it because it's cheaper.""

But new challenges are emerging.

In July, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which accelerates the rollback of solar and wind tax credits. Homeowners lose the federal investment credit after 2025. Developers face tighter deadlines and stricter sourcing rules.

""It won't kill the market,"" said Zoë Gaston, an analyst who follows the solar industry at Wood Mackenzie. ""But it makes the math harder.""

Analysts now expect a 42% drop in rooftop solar installs in Florida over the next five years. And while utility-scale growth continues, grid constraints are becoming an issue. Utilities are pouring money into storage, smart infrastructure, and grid upgrades to keep up.

Babcock Ranch is piloting new microgrid systems to add resilience. The hope is that other communities can take the playbook and adapt it, storm-proofing neighborhoods one block at a time.

""We've been testing this for years,"" Kitson said. ""Now it's about scale. It's about showing others they can do it too.""

The bigger question is whether Florida can keep this momentum going without policy support, and while still leaning heavily on natural gas.

""Florida has the solar resources,"" said Mark Jacobson, a professor at Stanford's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. ""What's missing is political consistency.""

The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hosted Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in Westminster to unveil the UK-India Vision 2035 framework.

The bilateral plan aims to increase trade between the two nations by US$31.7bn annually, with a strong emphasis on sustainable development.

British firms now gain direct access to India’s expanding renewable energy market.

India’s clean energy sector is among the fastest-growing globally and the agreement gives UK green tech companies entry to one of the world’s largest clean energy transitions.

“It will create thousands of British jobs across the UK, unlock new opportunities for businesses and drive growth in every corner of the country, delivering on our Plan for Change,” said Keir Starmer at the official signing.

A gateway to India’s green energy transition

The trade deal is expected to fuel UK exports of renewable energy technologies to India, aligning with the country’s renewable energy targets.

British companies operating in solar, wind and low-carbon technologies now have access to a market undergoing rapid transition.

India’s energy policy increasingly favours sustainable solutions, creating strong demand for innovation and investment in this space.

British firms are also set to contribute to India’s clean energy infrastructure by transferring new technology and collaborating on joint research initiatives.

The agreement establishes a framework to support long-term cooperation in areas such as sustainable energy storage, grid integration and carbon-neutral industrial technologies.

This clean tech engagement is not limited to trade. It sets out structured commitments to knowledge-sharing, research and development and public-private collaboration in both countries.

These elements create opportunities for shared progress on climate and energy goals, positioning sustainability at the heart of economic growth.

Industrial cooperation expands with green tech in tow

More than two dozen UK companies are expanding operations in India under the terms of the agreement.

Aerospace firms Airbus and Rolls-Royce alone secure contracts worth about US$6.2bn, reflecting the broader industrial collaboration embedded in the trade pact.

The deal demonstrates how traditional sectors such as aerospace are aligning with broader sustainability objectives, such as more fuel-efficient aircraft and cleaner engine technology.

The UK’s Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds confirms nearly US$7.5bn in new investments and export agreements linked to the framework.

British firms from multiple sectors will benefit from reduced trade barriers, tariff cuts and liberalised investment rules, with green technology firms among the primary beneficiaries.

“India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and an emerging economic superpower,” says Jonathan, outlining how the deal opens new commercial pathways while responding to global sustainability demands.

Tariffs averaging 15% will fall to 3% for British products entering Indian markets, including low-emission vehicles, medical devices and high-efficiency machinery.

This price shift will also support India's move towards lower-carbon technologies and increase the appeal of sustainable imports.

Financial services liberalisation will allow greater UK investment in India’s green sectors.

Foreign investment caps remain stable, giving British investors more confidence to fund renewable energy projects and sustainable infrastructure across the subcontinent.

Technology and sustainability converge

The announcement coincides with the one-year mark of the UK-India Technology Security Initiative, launched in July 2024.

This initiative covers cooperation in AI, quantum computing, space exploration and cybersecurity, all of which increasingly intersect with energy and environmental priorities.

Spanning 4.7 million square feet, this facility is now one of the largest gigafactories in North America.

The Japanese company began mass production of 2170 battery cells on 14 July, setting a target for an annual production capacity of about 32 GWh.

Panasonic regards the Kansas factory as a landmark investment, among the most substantial in its 107-year history.

The facility was constructed on a 300-acre site, equivalent to more than 225 football fields, at a cost of US$4bn.

Upon full operation, it is projected to create up to 4,000 jobs.

Panasonic's manufacturing strategy

This Kansas facility is part of Panasonic Energy's strategic dual-region manufacturing model, complementing its existing Nevada Gigafactory, operational since 2017.

The Nevada plant, currently employing more than 4,000 people, has an annual capacity of 41 GWh and has delivered more than 11 billion battery cells to date.

When both North American facilities operate at full capacity, they will collectively produce approximately 73 GWh annually.

""The opening of our Kansas Factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States,"" said Kazuo Tadanobu, CEO of Panasonic Energy.

""This achievement would not have been possible without the strong support of our local partners and the State of Kansas. Together, we are accelerating the shift to electrification, reinforcing regional supply chains and nurturing the next generation of battery talent.""

""We believe that we will continue to succeed if we scale our business in a way that is sustainable for our people, sustainable for our business, sustainable for our industry, and sustainable for our planet,"" he says.

Panasonic's position in a competitive market

The launch of this facility coincides with a period when car manufacturers are actively pursuing expansions in EV production to meet growing consumer demands and comply with evolving regulatory frameworks.

While the US lacks nationwide mandates for phasing out petrol-fuelled cars, states like California have implemented regulations targeting the ban of internal combustion engine vehicle sales by 2035.

Panasonic plans to establish itself as a principal supplier to global auto manufacturers, leveraging its 30 years of expertise in lithium-ion battery production.

Globally, Panasonic generates 70 battery cells every second, producing more than six million cells daily.

The Kansas facility's anticipated annual output of 32 GWh will provide enough batteries to power approximately 500,000 electric vehicles once fully operational.

The economic impacts

Beyond direct job creation, the factory is expected to indirectly generate around 8,000 jobs in supplier and related industries.

Panasonic Energy is also partnering with institutions like the University of Kansas, fostering long-term industry-academia collaborations aimed at technological advancements and specialised talent development.

The facility's scale becomes apparent in its physical dimensions, with three passenger planes able to line up nose-to-tail in the central common area between the factory's two wings.

Walking every square foot of the facility would require nearly 13 days of continuous movement, which speaks to the sheer scale of the operation.

It is a project that is significant not only to Panasonic or the EV sector, but also the people of Kansas.

“Politics is the art of the possible, and the grand opening of the Panasonic plant in De Soto ushers in a new era for Kansas — a proud step forward in our mission to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, where they belong,"" says Ty Masterson, President of the Kansas Senate.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/fe71fa3d62528e2dcbe15cf936cc1f95:1bb7be22c52cb31b80e5d5e0e47889bd/panasonic-s-newly-opened-gigafactory-in-de-soto-kansas.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:58:40.124856

The Clear Fork solar project, located near San Antonio, is currently under construction and is expected to operate by summer 2027.

Enbridge estimates the cost of the facility at US$900m and will retain ownership of the asset. Under the agreement, Meta will offtake all electricity generated to support the company’s expanding data centre operations in the region.

“We are thrilled to partner with Enbridge to bring new renewable energy to Texas and help support our operations with 100% clean energy,” says Urvi Parekh, Meta’s Head of Global Energy.

The exact duration of the contract has not been disclosed.

“Clear Fork demonstrates the growing demand for renewable power across North America from blue-chip companies who are involved in technology and data centre operations,” says Matthew Akman, EVP Corporate Strategy & President of Renewable Power at Enbridge.

“Enbridge continues to advance its world-class renewables development portfolio using our financial strength, supply chain reach and construction expertise under a low-risk commercial model that delivers strong competitive returns.”

The project will add to Enbridge’s expanding renewable energy footprint in Texas. Earlier this year, the company brought online a 130MW solar project in Jim Wells County, also backed by a long-term PPA, this time with AT&T.

In the past year alone, Meta has announced a string of solar power deals across Texas and other US states to secure clean energy for its data centre infrastructure.

In May, Meta signed two power agreements to offtake 650MW of solar capacity across AES sites in Texas and Kansas.

That same month, it also signed Environmental Attribute Purchase Agreements (EAPAs) for two more solar farms in Texas — the 127MWdc (97.5MWac) Midpoint Solar project in Hill County and the 184MWdc (143MWac) Gaia Solar project in Navarro County — both developed by Sunraycer Renewables.

Texas remains a key market due to its land availability, favourable permitting and high solar irradiance.

While data centre developers face increasing scrutiny over energy use and grid impact, PPAs like this allow hyperscale customers to directly match their energy consumption with new renewable generation.

For investors looking to own a piece of the clean energy sector, NextEra Energy seems about as ""forever"" as it gets.","Old-school energy sources aren't going anywhere. Even as the world transitions to cleaner power, oil and gas (and the infrastructure behind them) remain integral to the global economy.

Add in rising electricity demand from AI and data centers, and you have a sector where both old-school titans and new-age renewables can thrive.

If you have $500 and want to build a long-term, diversified position in energy, the goal is pretty simple: Find companies with strong balance sheets, steady dividends, and exposure to both sides of the energy transition. The following three energy stocks fit that bill precisely.

1. ExxonMobil: old-school energy with new ambitions

ExxonMobil (XOM -1.79%) is a titan of traditional energy. With operations spanning oil fields, gas stations, and refineries, the oil stock is built to weather just about any price cycle.

It's a fossil fuel giant, but Exxon isn't acting like a dinosaur. In December 2024, the company unveiled a bold 2030 plan to generate $20 billion in new earnings and $30 billion in added cash flow, all while deploying $140 billion to major projects and boosting shareholder returns.

About $30 billion of that is earmarked for carbon capture, hydrogen, and lithium developments. That's not a plan to pivot away from oil per se, but it is one to stay relevant no matter where energy goes next.

More to the present, Exxon has a fortress of a balance sheet, with $18.5 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter and an industry-leading debt-to-capital ratio of about 12%. As the chart below shows, both of these put Exxon in a favorable position in respect to its biggest competitor, Chevron.

And perhaps most important of all, Exxon pays investors to wait. The company has raised its dividend for 42 consecutive years, with a current yield near 3.5% and plenty of free cash flow to support future increases. Add in that strong balance sheet, ongoing share buybacks, and one of the lowest break-even oil prices in the industry, and you have a cash machine with staying power.

2. Enbridge: a dividend pipeline that's going solar

Enbridge (ENB 2.01%) is Canada's energy highway. It transports about 30% of North America's crude oil and 20% of the U.S. natural gas supply. Fun fact: Its oil pipeline network stretches more than 18,000 miles, long enough to wrap around three-quarters of the Equator.

With a dividend north of 6% and three decades of consecutive hikes, Enbridge has become a go-to for income investors. What really sets it apart, however, is how it is building a dual engine for growth. The company is investing billions annually not just into pipeline expansions, but also offshore, wind, solar, and renewable natural gas.

The strategy is already in motion. Enbridge recently broke ground on Clear Fork, a 600-megawatt solar project near San Antonio, Texas, backed by a long-term power purchase agreement with Meta Platforms. The $900 million facility is expected to come on line in 2027 and start adding cash flow and earnings right away. It's a clear sign that the company isn't just moving energy anymore but helping to build infrastructure that will power tech giants and data centers.

3. NextEra Energy: the clean energy leader

NextEra Energy (NEE -0.84%) the lone renewables stock on this list, brings something the other two can't: long-term growth without the fossil fuel baggage. It's the world's largest producer of wind and solar power, and it runs Florida Power & Light, the biggest regulated utility in the country.

In the second quarter, NextEra added 3.2 gigawatts of new clean-energy projects, lifting its total backlog to 30 gigawatts, roughly the size of 30 nuclear reactors. That pipeline gives the company visibility into future earnings, which it expects to grow 6% to 8% annually through 2027.

It's also targeting 10% dividend growth through at least 2026, building on 29 straight years of increases . Today's 3% yield may not scream high income, but it's backed by strong free cash flow and one of the safest payout ratios in the industry.

One caveat is that the company trades at a premium: about 20 times forward earnings. But with projected earnings per share (EPS) of $3.45 to $3.70 this year and unmatched leadership in the renewables race, that premium isn't empty air. For investors looking to own a piece of the clean energy sector, NextEra Energy seems about as ""forever"" as it gets.

Powering your portfolio for the long haul

With Exxon's oil empire, Enbridge's pipelines, and NextEra's clean energy runway, investors have options that span the full energy spectrum.

The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Chevron, Enbridge, Meta Platforms, and NextEra Energy.","With a dividend north of 6% and three decades of consecutive hikes, Enbridge has become a go-to for income investors. What really sets it apart, however, is how it is building a dual engine for growth. The company is investing billions annually not just into pipeline expansions, but also offshore, wind, solar, and renewable natural gas.

The strategy is already in motion. Enbridge recently broke ground on Clear Fork, a 600-megawatt solar project near San Antonio, Texas, backed by a long-term power purchase agreement with Meta Platforms. The $900 million facility is expected to come on line in 2027 and start adding cash flow and earnings right away. It's a clear sign that the company isn't just moving energy anymore but helping to build infrastructure that will power tech giants and data centers.

3. NextEra Energy: the clean energy leader

NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), the lone renewables stock on this list, brings something the other two can't: long-term growth without the fossil fuel baggage. It's the world's largest producer of wind and solar power, and it runs Florida Power & Light, the biggest regulated utility in the country.

In the second quarter, NextEra added 3.2 gigawatts of new clean-energy projects, lifting its total backlog to 30 gigawatts, roughly the size of 30 nuclear reactors. That pipeline gives the company visibility into future earnings, which it expects to grow 6% to 8% annually through 2027.

It's also targeting 10% dividend growth through at least 2026, building on 29 straight years of increases . Today's 3% yield may not scream high income, but it's backed by strong free cash flow and one of the safest payout ratios in the industry.

One caveat is that the company trades at a premium: about 20 times forward earnings. But with projected earnings per share (EPS) of $3.45 to $3.70 this year and unmatched leadership in the renewables race, that premium isn't empty air. For investors looking to own a piece of the clean energy sector, NextEra Energy seems about as ""forever"" as it gets.

Powering your portfolio for the long haul

With Exxon's oil empire, Enbridge's pipelines, and NextEra's clean energy runway, investors have options that span the full energy spectrum. Each company brings something different to the table, but all three are built to endure. Whether you're looking for dividends or stability, these three offer a balanced way to invest in the future of energy.

Today’s show is sponsored by the Electric Vehicle Association! Join up to support the electrification of transport today!

And by this year’s Electric Vehicle Raffle for the Planet from CCAN Action Fund – Buy your ticket today to support CCAN Action Fund’s mission to fight for cleaner air and a healthier environment – and get three chances to win a brand-new EV!

And by Energy Sage! Time’s running out in the U.S. to get the benefit of federal tax incentives, so plan your energy independence today!

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me!.

I’m afraid today’s show is packed with a lot of not-so-great news, but hey — my job’s to report the news, not make it. So grab a beverage, put your feet up, and let’s meet the bad news head-on together.

Last week, I told you the EPA was planning to scrap the 2009 Endangerment Finding —

the rule that says greenhouse gases harm human health.

This week, the agency made it official, proposing to eliminate the finding and every regulation built around it. In a partisan press event, officials accused Presidents Obama and Biden of, quote, “twisting the law” and using “warped science.” The new EPA claims it’ll save over a trillion dollars in so-called hidden taxes. But data from the Energy Information Administration — part of the U.S. Department of Energy — shows rolling back emissions rules could raise gas prices by more than seventy-six US cents a gallon. Why? Because dirtier vehicles burn more fuel. The EPA isn’t protecting anything now — just polluters’ profits. EPA? That’s the Enriching Polluters Association, to you.

I’m afraid we’ve got more bad news from the U.S. – the U.S. and European Union have just announced a new fifteen percent tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., including cars.

This agreement came just hours after President Trump gave a rambling press conference full of lies about wind turbines and clean energy — something I debunked earlier this week on the channel (link down below).While fifteen percent is better than the twenty-five percent tariff slapped on European imports April, it’s still six times higher than the two and a half percent tariff before President Trump initiated his unpopular trade war. This, combined with no EV incentives from the end of September means that we’re unlikely to see a reversal of policies on behalf of many European automakers – who have already either stopped or restricted EV imports to the U.S.

If you’ve bought a vehicle with a warranty, you expect it to be honored. That’s just basic common sense. But if you’re a customer of Lion Electric, forget it.

This week, Deloitte Restructuring — the court-appointed firm running Lion Electric’s affairs — told fleet operators, mostly schools, their maintenance contracts have been handed to a company Deloitte plans to bankrupt. That means Lion Electric no longer feels responsible for service or warranty work, and customers are left high and dry. With such a niche vehicle, good luck finding anyone else willing or able to fix these buses. It’s a gut punch to operators who depend on these buses to keep kids safe — and a betrayal of every warranty promise. It’s infuriating. Unacceptable. And yet another dark cloud over the EV industry this week.

The Chevrolet Bolt EV is, in my opinion, one of the best low-cost EVs of the last decade. And judging by how many folks complain about the shiny new EV they traded their Bolt for at lease end, I think many of you agree.

We’ve known for a while that GM plans to resurrect the Bolt later this year, promising NACS charging, better battery performance, and—for the first time in a North American GM vehicle—a lithium-ion phosphate battery pack, which should help lower the sticker price. This week, GM teased the first photos of the new model, and I’m pleasantly surprised. It looks like much of the styling carries over from the short-lived Bolt EUV, with a similar front end, rear end, and that NACS inlet where the CCS port was on the old Bolt EV and EUV. We’ll know more in the coming months, so watch this space.

When a new vehicle hits the market, automakers like to show how thoroughly it’s been tested — helping customers gain confidence to place an order.

This week, as part of its EV4 launch program, Kia published details of battery tests done in pre-production. The car was pushed through ten thousand kilometers (about six thousand two hundred miles) at Germany’s Nürburgring, operating at ninety to ninety-five percent of its rated power, followed by hypermiling tests on the same track. It then underwent a simulated one hundred and ten thousand kilometers (around sixty-eight thousand miles) of rolling road tests. After all that, Kia reported the battery still held ninety-five percent of its original capacity — well above the seventy-percent minimum Kia guarantees over one hundred thousand miles (or one hundred and sixty thousand kilometers). Of course, no amount of testing can cover every real-world scenario, so your mileage can and will vary.

A new study from CDK Global — its EV Ownership Survey — shows that while many first-time EV owners worry their car will cost more to fuel and maintain than a gassed vehicle, that perception often changes after a few service visits.

The survey highlighted some notable trends. Many EV owners now prefer mobile service over dealership visits, though EVs are taking longer on average to repair than they were a year ago. Still, most non-Tesla EV owners come away feeling positive: fifty-three percent say their cars are cheaper to run after a few visits. Only forty-one percent of Tesla owners agree though— hinting that Tesla’s service costs might be a little too high. What do you think? Do you agree? Let us know in the comments, our Discord, or reach out to us on social media.

Another survey now — this time from EV Intelligence. Its latest Self-Driving and Electric Vehicles: U.S. Market and Analysis Report, which offers some revealing insights.

Polling both EV and non-EV owners, it found that many automakers have work to do on brand image. Toyota led with a View Intensity Score — positive opinions minus negative — of twenty, despite limited EV offerings. Honda followed at sixteen, BMW and Chevrolet at ten, and Ford, Audi, and Porsche tied at nine. Tesla came in last out of nineteen brands, with negative sixteen — fifteen points worse than VinFast, a brand most people have never heard of. Views on Tesla, Elon Musk, and Robotaxi plans were notably poor. And forty-six percent of respondents said they’d never ride in an autonomous vehicle — showing just how far there is to go to get the meat sacks out of the driver’s seat.

Ford published its second-quarter earnings this week, beating Wall Street expectations with fifty billion, one hundred and eighty million dollars in revenue and adjusted earnings of thirty-seven cents per share.

Like GM last week, Ford took a hit from White House tariffs, losing eight hundred million dollars alone. Its Model e division posted wider losses of one point three billion dollars — despite a one hundred and twenty-eight percent increase in EV sales. Most losses were due to investment in its next-generation EV platform. CEO Jim Farley confirmed we’ll learn more in ten days, with a full reveal planned for August eleventh in Kentucky. He called it a “Model T moment” for Ford’s EV plans — promising an all-electric, all-American EV for everyone. Developed in a hush-hush skunkworks led by ex-Tesla and Apple engineers, the vehicle is meant to be a game-changer. Whether it delivers? We’ll find out soon enough.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration released its May electric power report — and the numbers are encouraging for renewables.

Wind power made up twelve point two percent of electricity generated in the first five months of the year. But solar led the way, with utility-scale solar installations growing by a third year over year, plus small-scale solar up nearly nine percent. For the first time, combined utility and small solar outproduced wind — generating almost thirty-eight thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five gigawatt-hours of power. Overall, nearly thirty percent of May’s electricity came from renewables. Fossil fuels’ time is running out — even if some in power don’t want to admit it.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office has published its long-awaited report evaluating the national EV charging rollout under the NEVI and CFI program.

Commissioned before the last presidential election — and based on data from January, before the current White House took office — the report outlines serious flaws. It found rollout was far slower than promised, tracking was inconsistent, and there was widespread frustration between state and federal agencies and stakeholders. But instead of fixing the problems, the new administration has slammed on the brakes — suspending state plans, halting federal guidance, and freezing progress. The report details a mismanaged rollout under a pro-EV White House — now facing outright sabotage from a cruel dictator-wannabe who has not hidden his disdain for EVs, and who is allegedly backed by a billion dollars in fossil fuel donations.

And those are your news shorts! There will be more next week!

Our final two stories are coming up next, but first, a quick word from one of today’s sponsors — Energy Sage, who can help those of you in the U.S. green your heating and energy!

Energy Sage connects you with local, verified solar installers across the United States — and now heat pump specialists in select markets — who really know their stuff and can help guide you through installing solar panels or getting a heat pump. Not a homeowner? No worries. Energy Sage can still help you green your electricity by joining a community solar program!

We used Energy Sage ourselves when looking for installers willing to put solar panels on our roof, and their verified pros were knowledgeable and even introduced us to a great credit union to finance the project with low monthly payments.

As I’m sure many of you know, HR1 is now U.S. law, and all incentives for solar — including savings of as much as thirty percent through the federal tax credit — will disappear soon. Solar projects take time, so if you want to lock in these savings, it’s important to act now because… time is running out.

Follow the links below to sign up for Energy Sage’s free, no-obligation service and get started today! And if you choose an Energy Sage installer, we’ll receive a small referral fee — so you’ll be helping us too! Help the grid get greener, save money, gain energy independence, and support our show — it’s a win-win-win-win!

And now, it’s time for those last two stories.

We usually talk EVs, but this week, U.S. and Canadian safety bodies held a press conference exposing a harsh truth: U.S. road deaths are climbing — not falling.

From 2011 to 2021, fatalities in the U.S. jumped by a third. Among twenty-nine wealthy countries, the U.S. leads with more than double the crash death rate per person. It’s easy to blame SUV and pickups — and they do play a massive role in pedestrian deaths, thanks to their ridiculous hood heights and poor visibility. But Canada — with a similar mix of vehicles — cut its fatalities by eighteen percent in the same period. Distracted driving — especially from people misusing semi-autonomous technology and treating it like full self-driving — will only make it worse. Having taken driving tests in both the U.S. and Europe, I can say driver education and enforcement in the U.S. are embarrassingly weak. If things don’t change, more Americans will die on roads that should be safer, not deadlier.

And finally,

It’s no secret that Kate, I, and the whole TE crew are more than a little fed up with the wave of oversized, overpriced EVs flooding North America.

Vi, our DP, loves kei trucks and used to drive a Fiat 500. Kate had a Mitsubishi i-MiEV — and briefly owned the Flux Capacitor before it was famous. I’ve had not one, but three all-electric microcars. So when Honda unveiled its new N-One e in Japan this week? I nearly screamed. It’s a four-seat electric kei car with folding “magic” seats (like the old Fit/Jazz), a minimalist interior, V2L, one-pedal driving, and crucially — no need to prove you have a parking space to own it in Japanese cities. This is exactly the kind of city EV we need. Not another rolling monument to excess. And honestly? I wish I lived in a timeline where tech like this was celebrated… not mocked.

And on that note, we’re done for today!

A huge thank you to the Electric Vehicle Association for sponsoring today’s show.

If you’d like to support the channel, you can do so for just one dollar and fifty cents a month on Patreon — and if you can, we’d really appreciate it. YouTube is now putting upwards of fifteen ads in our videos – and keeping all the profits for itself, our ad revenue is now officially less than one eighth of what it was a few years back. And while we’re certainly not alone – other creators are similarly struggling at the altar of corporate greed – if we can’t increase our Patreon support, we’re done for. If just four hundred of our one hundred and fifty-two thousand subscribers who have yet signed up to patreon did so and committed to giving the equivalent of a fancy coffee a month, would put us in a much better financial position.

I should also note we’re available for third-party video production work in the Portland Oregon area, if you have a business or project you’d like us to work with you on, reach out. You’ll also find merch at our swag store, and amazon affiliate links in this video description or on our website that you can use to support TE when you worship at the altar of Bezos. We don’t like Amazon, but without affiliate links, Amazon pockets the money it would otherwise send to us.

We publish every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday here — and every Sunday we drop two videos on Transport Evolved Take Two, our informal behind-the-scenes channel.

To finish, remember this:

You are valid. You are loved. You belong — no matter what anyone says. And no corporate policy change or discriminatory rules change that.

Right now, division and hate aren’t just tolerated — they are encouraged by those in power driven by a lust for cruelty. In these times, kindness and empathy become acts of resistance. Empathy is not weakness — it’s a skill we must nurture and regularly practice to hold onto our shared humanity.

If you need to rest or step back, that’s okay. Take care of yourself. Then, when you’re ready, stand up for decency, community, and justice — peacefully and together. Build connections that celebrate every voice, embrace diversity, and learn from the past to shape a better future.

Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. And please — for the sake of everyone’s future — don’t let hate or ignorance win.

In a groundbreaking development, a fully electric Venetian water taxi, named Lucietta, has emerged as a symbol of innovation and sustainability in the world of marine tourism. This stunning vessel represents a collaborative effort between marine designers, shipyards, and energy experts, setting a new benchmark for eco-friendly transportation on Venice’s historic canals. With a focus on providing zero-emission, stylish, and functional transportation, Lucietta is poised to enhance the tourism experience in one of the world’s most visited cities while staying true to its unique history and traditions.

Venice, known for its iconic canals, gondolas, and water taxis, is now embracing a new form of travel with Lucietta, a modern reinterpretation of the classic Venetian water taxi. Powered entirely by electricity, this innovative watercraft offers a sustainable alternative to traditional petrol-powered taxis, providing both locals and tourists with a cleaner, quieter, and more eco-friendly way to navigate the city’s famous waterways.

Lucietta: Blending Tradition with Modern Innovation

Lucietta’s design is a perfect balance between tradition and innovation, staying true to the iconic aesthetic of Venice’s water taxis while incorporating advanced electric propulsion technology. The development of Lucietta stemmed from the vision of renowned marine design studio Nauta Design, who worked in collaboration with Cantiere Serenella, a respected Italian shipyard, and Swiss energy company Repower. Together, these experts have created a boat that not only upholds the beauty of Venice’s rich maritime history but also champions sustainability with its cutting-edge electric motor.

The design of the Lucietta is deeply rooted in the Venetian cultural context. The water taxi’s dimensions are specifically tailored to fit within the city’s tightly constrained canals, which are bordered by historical buildings, bridges, and narrow streets. The boat measures 9.3 meters (30.5 feet) in length, 2.25 meters (7.4 feet) in width, and 2.1 meters (6.8 feet) in height, perfectly matching the size limitations imposed by Venice’s infrastructure. Despite these constraints, the Lucietta retains a sleek, modern look that reflects its advanced technology.

Electric Propulsion for Clean, Quiet Travel

Lucietta’s electric propulsion system is powered by a 200 kW motor paired with a 180 kWh battery pack. This system enables the water taxi to reach a top speed of 30 knots (34.5 mph), with cruising speeds between 7 and 10.8 knots (8 to 12 mph), perfect for leisurely trips through the Venetian lagoon. When operating at lower speeds, the vessel can remain out on the water for an entire working day without needing to recharge, offering a sustainable solution for all-day tours.

The electric propulsion not only reduces noise pollution, making the canals quieter and more serene, but it also eliminates harmful emissions, providing a cleaner, greener way to travel through Venice. This move toward electrification is seen as a vital step in preserving the city’s environment while continuing to support the marine tourism industry. In a city where tourism plays a critical role in the economy, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional gas-powered boats is an important contribution to Venice’s long-term future.

Features Designed for Comfort and Functionality

The Lucietta is designed with passenger comfort and practicality in mind. The boat can carry up to 14 passengers, with plenty of seating options for guests to choose from. A shaded midsection offers a cool respite from the sun, while the exposed stern provides an ideal spot for those who want to bask in the Venetian sunshine. For optimal visibility, the “driver” of the Lucietta sits at the front of the boat, offering excellent views of the canal and allowing for smooth maneuvering.

Passengers aboard the Lucietta can enjoy a range of modern amenities designed to enhance the overall experience. These include USB charging ports, allowing passengers to keep their mobile devices charged during their journey, and a high-quality audio system for onboard entertainment. The boat also boasts a 42-liter fridge for cold refreshments, a 56-liter fresh water tank, LED navigation lights, and underwater aft lighting to ensure visibility even in the darker hours. The boat’s synthetic teak deck and flooring add a touch of luxury, while the carbon fiber hull ensures that the boat is both lightweight and durable.

Sustainability Meets Luxury in Venetian Tourism

One of the key features of Lucietta is its commitment to sustainability, which is a growing concern in global tourism, especially in iconic destinations like Venice. Venice’s canals are integral to the city’s charm, attracting millions of tourists every year. However, the environmental impact of tourism, particularly from gas-powered boats, has raised concerns over the years. Lucietta’s electric-powered design provides a solution to this issue, reducing the carbon footprint of the tourism industry in Venice while maintaining the luxurious, high-end travel experience that visitors expect.

The integration of fast-charging stations for electric vehicles in Venice will make it easier for operators of electric boats like Lucietta to stay fully powered throughout the day, further enhancing the practicality of this new technology. This marks a significant step forward in modernizing public transportation in Venice, making it more sustainable and efficient for both tourists and locals alike.

Lucietta’s Role in Modernizing Public Transport in Venice

The Lucietta isn’t just a new attraction for tourists; it’s also a contribution to the ongoing discussion about improving public transportation in Venice. The city has long struggled with issues of congestion, pollution, and the impact of tourism on local infrastructure. With its emission-free propulsion system, Lucietta offers a glimpse into what the future of public transport in Venice could look like.

By introducing electric boats to Venice’s historic canals, the Lucietta paves the way for a more sustainable future for the city’s marine transport system. It is part of a larger movement to rethink transportation options in Venice, blending innovation with respect for the city’s ancient traditions. As cities around the world increasingly adopt electric transport solutions, Venice is no exception, with Lucietta leading the charge in offering a more eco-friendly way to navigate the canals.

Lucietta at Major Events: A Symbol of Innovation and Sustainability

The Lucietta made its debut at the prestigious Salone Nautico di Venezia, the Venice Boat Show, where it garnered significant attention for its innovative design and sustainable features. The boat also made an appearance at the Venice International Film Festival, an iconic event that attracts visitors from around the globe. Its presence at such high-profile events showcases not only the boat’s elegance but also its potential to become a key player in the future of Venetian tourism and transport.

Despite its debut at these events, the Lucietta is still in its prototype stage, with no official production plans announced yet. However, the collaboration between Nauta Design, Cantiere Serenella, and Repower has shown that electric water taxis are a feasible and exciting new direction for the future of Venetian transport.

The Future of Electric Water Taxis in Venice

The introduction of Lucietta marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in the way Venice approaches tourism and public transport. As more and more cities around the world look to reduce emissions and embrace sustainable technologies, the electric water taxi could become a key component of Venice’s transport infrastructure. By offering a comfortable, stylish, and eco-friendly alternative to traditional boats, Lucietta is setting the stage for other cities to adopt similar solutions, not just for tourism, but for everyday use.

As the conversation around sustainability and climate change continues to grow, projects like Lucietta serve as a reminder that innovation and tradition can coexist to create a better future.

The company predominantly sourced lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, battery cells from Chinese battery-makers, including CATL, and integrated them into its ESS products.
The company was recently reported to have secured a 6 trillion won ($4.3 billion) deal to supply LFP batteries for Tesla’s ESS products.
The Tennessee plant, with an annual capacity of 50 gigawatt-hours, could potentially secure an additional 10 gigawatt-hours for LFP production.
It seeks to produce LFP ESS cells next year.","The market for energy storage systems, or ESS, in the US is at a critical juncture, as Korean battery-makers move to fill the gaps left by domestic players hurt by tariffs.

Oregon-based Powin, once a top-three ESS integrator, filed for bankruptcy after tariff-driven costs on Chinese battery imports surged, exposing how vulnerable US firms are to foreign supply shocks.

The shift, driven by Donald Trump’s push to curb Chinese dominance, is opening the door for Korean firms to ramp up local production and expand their US footprint.

According to recent media reports, Powin, headquartered in Oregon, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month at a court in New Jersey after piling on more than $300 million in debt. The Chapter 11 filing will enable the company to operate under court supervision while restructuring its finances.

The main factor behind Powin’s collapse was its inability to find alternative suppliers for battery cells outside of China. The company predominantly sourced lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, battery cells from Chinese battery-makers, including CATL, and integrated them into its ESS products.

Powin has reportedly suffered from project delays or even renegotiations with clients due to supply chain disruptions arising from its dependence on China-focused battery sourcing.

Last month, the company said in a statement that its “significant financial challenge” was “reflective of ongoing headwinds in the broader energy storage industry.”

Chinese-made ESS batteries imported into the US are currently subject to a 40.9 percent tariff, which is anticipated to rise to 58.4 percent next year.

Industry insiders indicate that while Trump’s strategy to curb US reliance on the Chinese battery supply chain may come at the expense of domestic companies like Powin, it is likely to open doors for Korean battery-makers.

Notably, LG Energy Solution, the only company capable of manufacturing LFP ESS cells in the US at its Michigan facility, is moving fast to capitalize on this emerging market with no clear leader.

The company was recently reported to have secured a 6 trillion won ($4.3 billion) deal to supply LFP batteries for Tesla’s ESS products. Tesla was considered a promising US company to start LFP cell manufacturing for its own ESS lineups, such as Megapack and Powerwall, at its Nevada facility. But its production capacity will apparently not be enough to meet market demand.

During its second-quarter earnings conference call, LG Energy Solution also hinted at the possibility of converting portions of the production lines at its joint venture facilities in the US with global automakers -- likely the second plant with General Motors in Tennessee -- from electric vehicle manufacturing to ESS. It aims to increase its capacity from a potential 17 gigawatt-hours by the end of this year to 30 gigawatt-hours by 2026.

The Tennessee plant, with an annual capacity of 50 gigawatt-hours, could potentially secure an additional 10 gigawatt-hours for LFP production. This is based on last year’s 40 percent operational rate and the potential allocation of half its capacity to LFPs.

“Utilizing a joint venture facility with GM is an efficient move to streamline capital expenditures, while swiftly addressing the fast-growing demand for ESS,” said Lee Ho-geun, an automotive engineering professor at Daeduk University. “This strategy could buy time for LG to prepare its third joint plant, acquired from GM, for ESS battery production.”

On Thursday, Samsung SDI announced that it will convert a portion of the EV production lines at its joint venture plant with Stellantis in Indiana into ESS lines, with large-scale production for nickel, cobalt and aluminum batteries set to start this year. It seeks to produce LFP ESS cells next year.

SK On is also gearing up for large-scale manufacturing of LFP cells and has signed a cathode supply deal with L&F Co. for the North American market.

Korean companies are looking to solidify their presence in the US with large-scale, containerized ESS, spurred by the rapid expansion of data centers and the increasing demand for reliable electricity supply solutions.

Among the ESS products, ranging from battery packs to containerized systems, containerized ESS is gaining momentum, driven by the rapid expansion of data centers and the increasing demand for reliable electricity supply solutions.

“Compared to small battery packs for residential applications, containerized ESS are more effective in boosting sales and profits because they are considered value-added products,” said an industry source familiar with the matter on condition of anonymity. “These systems are equipped with various features, including safety mechanisms that control humidity and temperature to protect the battery systems within the container.”

Samsung SDI’s flagship Samsung Battery Box 1.5, a fully equipped, ready-to-deploy product, is housed within a 20-foot container using nickel, cobalt and aluminum cells, with an energy capacity of approximately 5.26 megawatt-hours. LG Energy Solution’s JF2S DC Link, similar in size to Samsung Battery Box 1.5, offers a capacity of approximately 5 MWhs. However, it is powered by more cost-effective LFP batteries.

A key component of this effort is the large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources (RES), such as solar and wind, which are rapidly transforming electricity systems worldwide1. In response, many regions have adopted ambitious decarbonization targets to accelerate renewable integration. This study focuses on two major U.S. electricity markets: the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). These markets are notable for both their high annual electricity demand and significant penetration of renewables. California and Texas have also enacted distinct policy frameworks to support decarbonization2,3,4,5,6. In California, Senate Bill 100 mandates that 100% of electricity retail sales be supplied by renewable and zero-carbon resources by 20457. Texas, by contrast, was an early adopter of a renewable portfolio standard and has expanded its renewable capacity through a market-based approach8.

As of 2021, Texas and California were the first- and second-largest U.S. states in terms of electricity consumption9. While California’s overall demand has declined in part due to efficiency and conservation measures10, both states have experienced substantial growth in wind and solar generation. As shown in Table 1, renewable energy accounted for 28.4% of annual generation in California and 25.4% in Texas, a significant increase from 2010 levels, when wind and solar represented only 2.9% and 0.4% of California’s net generation, respectively11,12. Over the same period, Texas increased its share of generation from wind and solar from 6.35% and 0.002–20.7% and 3.1%, respectively.

Earlier studies examining the operational impacts of RES focused primarily on simulations rather than actual historical data. Makarov et al.13 predicted that CAISO would need additional load-following capacity (0.8 GW up, 0.6 GW down) to integrate 4.1 GW of new wind generation from 2006 to 2010. Katzenstein and Apt14 modeled a wind or solar photovoltaic plus gas system, finding that steam injection gas generators achieved only 30–50% of expected NOx emissions reductions and close to 80% of expected CO2 emissions reductions.

Others, like Eser et al.15, show the effect of increased penetration of RES on thermal power plants in Central Western and Eastern Europe. Using a power flow model, the authors show that an increase in penetration of RES induces a 4–23% increase in the number of starts in conventional plants, and a 63–181% increase in load ramp. Eser et al.’s15 findings are similar to those from other studies regarding the effect of cycling on power plant operational life: not only does increased cycling result in more wear and tear on gas generators16,17,18 but also reduces emissions performance, especially at lower capacity factors19. Valentino et al. show the change in the number of startups and the degradation of plant heat rate with lower utilization20. They use a dispatch model to determine active units and estimate a fuel consumption function based on different blocks of heat rate data. However, the study does not consider heat rate as a function of plant type, ramping, vintage, and degree of cycling, which is a key determinant of heat rates at low utilization levels.

Some studies focus on how RES may change the unit commitment and economic dispatch of generators and conclude that increasing wind and solar penetration changes market dynamics in both nodal and wholesale electricity market designs21,22,23. Other analyses find that RES lead to an increase in ramping, lower utilization, and higher operations and maintenance costs24,25,26,27,28. While unit commitment and economic dispatch studies using simulations provide valuable insights and demonstrate that increasing penetration of RES changes several operational characteristics of thermal plants, these approaches may miss real-world operations in the electricity system, including coping with transmission constraints, with policies, and with RES variability29. Empirical approaches that rely on observational data mitigate some of these limitations, but may not capture future conditions with larger RES capacity and generation. Examples of such approaches include the studies by Fell and Johnson29, Mills et al.30, and Wiser et al.31. These studies find that renewables do indeed displace thermal generation; however, the nature and magnitude of the displacement are still heterogeneous across the studies. Empirical studies examining how renewable energy affects emissions and ramping in thermal power plants remain limited. In particular, there is little analysis of how operational changes drive emissions intensity and how these effects can be mitigated through improved dispatch.

In this study, we develop a framework to evaluate the operational and environmental impacts of renewable integration on thermal generation. Using historical data from 2018 to 2023 for CAISO and ERCOT, we analyze patterns in thermal plant behavior under increasing renewable penetration. We begin by comparing emissions outcomes under simplified operational scenarios. We then use regression analysis to estimate the system-level change in generation and emissions associated with a 1% increase in wind and solar generation. Finally, we examine individual plant-level responses, highlighting heterogeneous effects by region and fuel type.

Alternate emissions scenarios for thermal power plants

We use hourly thermal generation and CO2 emissions from the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA) Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) at the generating unit and power plant level to study the operational characteristics of power plants. We start by assessing the observed emissions in each year from 2018 to 2023 in CAISO and ERCOT, and then compare those emissions to what they would have been under different operational scenarios. Specifically, we compare the historical emissions to counterfactual scenarios in which each power plant operates at its observed emissions intensity under both low and high capacity factor conditions.

The rationale for constructing simplified emissions scenarios is illustrated in Fig. 1, which presents the relationship between emissions intensity and capacity factor across generating units at two representative thermal power plants: Moss Landing, a natural gas-fired facility in CAISO (Fig. 1a), and Tolk Station, a coal-fired plant in ERCOT (Fig. 1b). In both cases, operation at lower capacity factors is associated with a marked increase in emissions intensity. For example, reducing the capacity factor from 0.3 to 0.05 results in a 133% increase in average emissions intensity at Moss Landing and a 51% increase at Tolk Station. This pattern reflects a broader trend across thermal generating units: emissions intensity rises as capacity factor declines. The underlying mechanism is thermodynamic inefficiency—when thermal units operate at low utilization levels, they consume more fuel per unit of electricity generated, leading to higher CO2 emissions per megawatt-hour. Each point in the figure represents an hourly observation of generation and emissions at the unit level, as reported to CEMS.

At Moss Landing, generating units operating at capacity factors greater than 0.3 exhibit a mean emissions intensity of 0.36 tons CO2 per MWh. When operating below a capacity factor of 0.05, this value increases to 0.84 tons CO2 per MWh. At Tolk Station, the mean emissions intensity increases from 0.94 to 1.43 tons CO2 per MWh over the same capacity factor range. These findings are not limited to the two facilities examined. Across the full fleet of natural gas and coal-fired units in CAISO and ERCOT, we observe consistent increases in emissions intensity at lower capacity factors. Supplementary Figs. 3 through 11 present analogous plots for all relevant generating units. To account for this systematic variation in operating emissions, we construct alternative emissions scenarios as described below.

As the generation from RES increases, more thermal plants will be required to operate at low capacity factors or will remain online as spinning reserves given ramping and startup constraints (also shown in Supplementary Fig. 12). Low utilization will in turn result in higher hourly heat rates as a direct consequence of which system-level emissions will also increase. To model these effects, we start by considering two simplified emissions intensity scenarios that represent different operational regimes of thermal plants: (i) a “low emissions” scenario where we select, for each plant, the 10th percentile of emissions intensity, (ii) and a “high emissions” scenario where we consider the emissions intensity of the plant at the 90th percentile of their observed emissions intensity in CEMS. These low and high emissions intensity scenarios are related to how the plants are operated, and thus, in the next results sections, we will address this issue using regression-based models. Figure 2 presents annual emissions under three scenarios: low, high, and observed emissions intensity. Figure 2b, d and f additionally show the distribution of plant-level emissions intensities, highlighting the variability among units with the same fuel type within each Independent System Operator (ISO) region.

These simplified scenarios provide important bounding results: if power plants were to be operating far from their optimal operation limits, i.e., with low capacity factor and high emissions intensity, the overall CO2 emissions from natural gas and coal power plants in CAISO and ERCOT would be 12 and 26% higher than the observed emissions (depending on the year). Although the emissions intensity at low capacity factor operation is several factors higher than the baseline emissions intensity, plants are operated infrequently at very low capacity factors (<0.05). Hence, the 90th percentile of emissions intensity is lower than the extreme values observed in Fig. 1.

Marginal impacts of wind and solar on plant-level generation, emissions and emissions intensity

Now, we turn our attention to providing more systematic estimates on the effect of renewables on thermal power plant operations, using entity and time fixed-effects panel regression model with a logarithmic specification. This model describes the change in the dependent variable (generation, emissions, or emissions intensity) as a function of the generation from wind and solar, residual thermal demand, individual power-plant entity effects, time effects, and other effects from control variables. The logarithmic specification used is given by Eq. (1). The control variables include the total wind and solar generation and electricity demand from the ISO’s trading partners, as well as a measure of wind generation intermittency. Wind intermittency is defined as the intra-day variability in output and is calculated by taking the absolute value of the differences in hourly wind generation and summing them over the day. This captures short-term fluctuations in wind availability, which may influence the dispatch of thermal resources. Rather than aggregating renewable generation, we model wind and solar as separate independent variables to reflect their distinct temporal profiles and differing penetration levels in CAISO and ERCOT. Time fixed effects are included at the month and year level to account for temporal trends, while plant fixed effects control for time-invariant characteristics of each generating unit. These controls allow us to isolate the relationship between renewable generation and thermal plant operation across both systems. Under the logarithmic specification, the estimated coefficients can be interpreted as the percent change in the dependent variable—generation, emissions, or emissions intensity—associated with a 1% change in wind or solar generation.

In Table 2, we show the coefficients of the panel regression model for CAISO and ERCOT. In this way, we are able to quantify the percent change in emissions intensity, total emissions, and generation for thermal power plants attributable to a marginal increase in generation from solar and wind. Here, the term “marginal” implies an additional unit (or unit percent) increase in generation from renewables and its resulting impact. This, in turn, can be used to determine the expected versus actual emissions displacement from renewables.

From Table 2, an increase in wind and solar generation is associated with lower thermal generation and emissions. That said, if this displacement was 100% efficient (or 1:1), both generation and emissions would reduce by an equivalent amount, and thus should have identical coefficients in the fixed-effects model. In CAISO, the displacement from wind and solar is unequal. Our regression estimates indicate that a 1% increase in solar generation is associated with a 0.27% decrease in thermal generation and a 0.25% decrease in total emissions. By comparing the coefficients for solar generation with emissions and emissions intensity as the exogenous variables, we can compute the share of expected emissions displacement due to the logarithmic specification of the panel regression (see “Methods”). Based on these coefficients, the observed emissions reduction associated with solar generation represents 92.6% of the theoretically expected emissions displacement. Similarly, the observed reduction associated with wind generation represents 95.6% of the theoretically expected emissions displacement. In ERCOT, on the other hand, displacement from wind is an order of magnitude more pronounced than the displacement from solar, which may be attributable to the difference in the installed utility-scale capacity of the two resources in the ISO. Examining the relationship between wind generation and displacement, our analysis shows that a 1% increase in wind generation is associated with a 0.34% decrease in thermal generation and a 0.31% decrease in total emissions. Based on these coefficients, the observed emissions reduction associated with wind generation in ERCOT represents 91.1% of the theoretically expected emissions displacement.

While the expected vs actual emissions displacement helps us understand the system-level impact of renewables, it still does not associate the effect of renewables on plant-level emissions intensity. Looking closely at the coefficients of the model with emissions intensity as the dependent variable, we find that a 1% increased generation from wind and solar does indeed impact plant-level emissions intensity for existing thermal generators. For CAISO, thermal power plant intensities are more susceptible to increased generation from solar as compared to wind (0.02% for solar, 0.01% for wind). In ERCOT, generation from wind results in a 0.02% increase in the emissions intensity of plants. While these coefficients may initially appear small, the hourly ramp in solar generation in CAISO during the day can reach 50%, which corresponds to an estimated 1% increase in the emissions intensity of power plants for that hour, according to our model. If we consider CAISO’s 2022 system-level emissions averaged uniformly across all hours, a 1% increase in intensity across all power plants is equivalent to 53 tons of additional CO2. As the ramp becomes more pronounced with increasing intermittent renewable capacity, this marginal increase should not be ignored. Meeting 2030 and 2045 clean energy targets in both CAISO and ERCOT will require the installation of more installed renewable capacity, resulting in an even higher percent change in generation from renewables across all days of the year. Supplementary Figure 14 demonstrates the change in CO2 emissions intensity for a 0-100% increase in generation from solar and wind in CAISO and ERCOT.

Intermittency in generation from wind is measured by the daily wind ramp variable, represented by \({\overline{W}}_{t}\) in Eq. (1). In contrast to the coefficients for wind and solar generation, higher wind variability is associated with higher generation from thermal plants in both regions. The magnitude of the positive displacement from wind ramping relative to wind generation is also quite significant—52% for CAISO, and 35% for ERCOT. Clearly, wind and solar generation play a key role in determining the generation and emissions in thermal plants, however, variability and intermittency in the generation from renewables has a significant impact as well.

Individual plant response in CAISO and ERCOT is heterogeneous by fuel type and nameplate capacity

The panel regression formulation helps us understand how thermal plants across the fleet respond to changes in generation from wind and solar. Plant fixed-effects further control for heterogeneity across plant types and fuel inputs, however, this formulation does not yield any insights into how heterogeneous these plants are, and what the impact of increased generation from wind and solar results in on a per-plant basis. To further understand plant-specific response, we develop a fixed-effects ordinary least squares (OLS) regression formulation with the same specification as the panel regression above, except for every individual plant (no panel is considered) and using hourly instead of daily data points. The ramp variable in the formulation is determined as a difference in wind generation at the intra-hourly level. While the panel regression provided a single coefficient for a dependent variable in response to solar and wind, here, we consider a distribution of coefficients across all plants to model their response.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of coefficients for plant generation, emissions, and emissions intensity in response to solar in CAISO (Fig. 3a) and wind in ERCOT (Fig. 3b). A positive coefficient indicates a positive correlation between the dependent variable and renewable generation, and vice versa. We find that natural gas plants in CAISO show highly heterogeneous relationships with solar generation, and the associated change in generation, emissions, and emissions intensity. In contrast, all but two plants in ERCOT demonstrate lower generation and emissions with higher wind generation. However, the emissions intensity of all coal plants and most gas plants shows a positive correlation with marginal increases in wind generation.

The heterogeneous relationship between natural gas plants in CAISO compared to ERCOT may be related to shifting generation patterns accompanying increased utility-scale solar capacity. Fast-ramping peaker plants replace base load combined cycle plants during peak production hours. In CAISO, four out of seven plants with a coefficient greater than 1.0 account for 28% of generation and also exhibit the highest emissions intensity of all plants in the balancing region. In ERCOT, plant behavior is very different from that of CAISO. The mean coefficient for generation is −0.41, which is close to our fleet-level coefficient of −0.34 from the panel regression. Coal plants with a relatively smaller nameplate capacity are characterized by a higher emissions intensity, even though the capacity factor of these plants is comparable to that of larger plants. The two smallest coal plants in ERCOT show the largest deviation in response to wind (−2.25%, −2.07%) and also have a NOx emissions intensity 60% higher than the mean of all coal plants indicating more frequent ramping and startup.

Figure 4 shows the regression coefficients for plant generation, further characterized by nameplate capacity and capacity factor. Each data point represents a power plant. The x axis is annual capacity factor, and the y axis is the OLS coefficient in response to solar generation in CAISO and wind generation in ERCOT. The size of the data point indicates the nameplate capacity of the plant and the color indicates the annual emissions intensity. All plants are natural gas-fired in CAISO, and a mix of natural gas and coal in ERCOT. In CAISO, larger plants exhibit negative correlations with solar generation, although the magnitude of this correlation is smaller compared to plants with lower nameplate capacity. Smaller plants are also characterized by a significantly lower annual capacity factor, high emissions intensity, and a wider distribution in coefficient magnitude. In ERCOT, the markers in Fig. 4 show a mix of coal and natural gas-fired plants. All coal plants are characterized by a higher emissions intensity and operate at an annual capacity factor consistently greater than 0.3. The coefficients associated with wind generation show less variation for larger plants, with values not falling below −0.2. Similarly to CAISO, natural gas plants with a lower nameplate capacity show the highest emissions intensity and operate at lower annual capacity factors.

Supplementary Fig. 13 shows a comparison between the distrubution of coefficients obtained from the plant-level OLS with emissions displacement estimates from Katzenstein and Apt14 and Graf et al.32.

We perform our analysis for the years 2018 through 2023 for the CAISO and ERCOT. We start by describing the data used, followed by the methods.

Data

We develop a dataset with thermal power plants in CAISO and ERCOT that includes hourly unit-level emissions, gross generation, heat rate, and fuel consumption from the EPA’s Air Markets Program Data35. The EPA requires all combustion power plants with a nameplate capacity greater than 25 MW to install and maintain a CEMS that records key unit-level operational parameters36.

We obtain plant nameplate capacity, total annual generation, primary fuel information, and total annual emissions from the EPA’s Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID)12. eGRID is a comprehensive source of data on the environmental characteristics of electric power plants and their associated unit stacks. Each data file contains key indicators at different levels of aggregation—unit, generator, plant, state, balancing area, NERC region and eGRID subregion. A manual inspection of the plant-level nameplate capacity indicates that the capacity indicated is not accurate in all cases, whereas the same is not true for aggregated generator-level information. Hence, instead of obtaining the plant nameplate capacity directly, we compute the sum of the generator nameplate capacity (in MW) of all generators associated with a particular plant, as identified by their unique Office of Regulatory Information Systems Plant Code. Hourly data from CEMS is collated with plant nameplate capacity to determine hourly capacity factor values and the associated fuel stack.

Hourly generation from wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal energy is obtained from US Energy Information Administration Form 930 (EIA-930) data. We use processed publicly available data obtained from a physics-informed data reconciliation framework for real-time electricity and emissions tracking developed by Chalendar and Benson28,37. Using this dataset, rather than raw EIA-930 data, has two key advantages. First, the reconciled data sets are devoid of unrealistic generation values and contain estimates within reasonable confidence intervals for time intervals where data is missing or erroneous. Second, this method includes an optimization-based data reconciliation to impose physical relations that guarantee energy conservation between key variables. Thus, this dataset provides electric system operating data on generation, consumption, and exchanges of electricity for every hour and at the level of the balancing area.

Model specification

We use a fixed-effects panel regression formulation to quantify the marginal effect of wind and solar generation on the generation, emissions, and emissions intensity of thermal plants. Similar to Bushnell and Wolfram38, Graf et al.32 and Fell and Johnson29, we use an entity and time fixed-effects logarithmic specification for all plants within an ISO using daily observations in Eq. (1).

$${\ln}\,{y}_{i,t}= {\alpha }_{i}+{\beta }_{1}{\ln}\,{D}_{t}^{{\prime} }+{\beta }_{2}{\ln}\,{S}_{t}+{\beta }_{3}{\ln}\,{W}_{t} \\ +{\beta }_{4}{\ln}\,{\overline{W}}_{t}+\gamma \,{\ln}\,{{{{\bf{X}}}}}_{t}+{\eta }_{t,m}+{\eta }_{t,y}+{\alpha }_{i}\times {\eta }_{t,m}+{\epsilon }_{i}$$

(1)

where yi,t is the dependent variable of interest, which is daily generation in MWh, emissions in tonnes or emissions intensity in tonnes/MWh for power plant i at timestep t. Dt, St and Wt represent the daily net thermal generation, generation from solar, and generation from wind in MWh for the ISO to which i belongs. The daily net thermal generation is the total ISO thermal generation minus generation from hydro and imports, i.e., \({D}_{t}^{{\prime} }={D}_{t}-{H}_{t}-{I}_{t}\), where Dt, Ht and It represent the daily thermal generation, generation from hydro and net imports in MWh for the ISO. \({\overline{W}}_{t}\) is a parameter that estimates the intermittency of net generation from wind at the hourly level and is calculated by taking the sum of the absolute value of hourly differences in wind output over the course of the day. Mathematically, this is expressed as \({\overline{W}}_{t}=\mathop{\sum }_{h=0}^{23}\left\vert {W}_{t \!,\!h \!+\! 1}-{W}_{t\!,\!h}\right\vert\). The intermittency parameter \({\overline{W}}_{t}\) captures the cumulative hourly fluctuations in wind generation throughout the day, rather than using a simpler measure like daily variance. This specification focuses on short-term variations between consecutive hours that may require rapid adjustments in thermal generation to maintain grid stability. While variance would measure overall daily deviations from mean wind generation, our intermittency measure specifically quantifies the magnitude of hour-to-hour changes that operators must balance. This is particularly relevant as frequent short-term fluctuations in wind generation may necessitate different operational responses from thermal plants compared to more gradual changes over the course of a day.

Xt is a set of control variables that includes the sum of wind generation, solar generation, and demand for trading partners of the ISO to which i belongs. For instance, CAISO trades with the other balancing authorities in the Northwest and Southwest NERC subregions. For every hour, these external control variables would consider the sum of wind generation, solar generation, and demand for these two regions. For ERCOT, the only trading partner is the Southwest Power Pool. ηt,m and ηt,y are the time fixed-effects parameters controlling for the month and year, respectively. We interact the monthly fixed-effects variable with the indicator variable for the plant ID to account for heterogeneity in fuel prices across different technology categories, regions and plant types. ϵ represents the error term.

The model specifications employed by Graf et al.32 and Fell and Johnson29 may not be able to fully explain the deviation caused due to intermittency in renewable generation due to gaps in granularity and panel formulation. Graf et al.32 do not include granular regional generation from trading partners, and also conduct the analysis on annual data and hence miss intra-day operational parameters such as resource ramping. Fell and Johnson29 do not construct a plant-level panel regression but rather run a time fixed-effects model for the balancing authority that does not account for location-based heterogeneity.

In our formulation, the parameters that are of interest are the coefficients for solar, β2 and wind, β3. These coefficients represent the percent change in the dependent variable per 1% increase in generation from solar and wind, respectively. For example, if the dependent variable yi,t represents the net generation from thermal plants for an ISO, then β2 and β3 will represent the percent change in generation for thermal plants per unit percent increase in generation from solar and wind. These coefficients thus measure the associated change in the dependent variable under the assumption that daily wind and solar production (represented by W and S) are uncorrelated with the error term ϵ after controlling for net demand, entity, and time fixed effects. As suggested by Qiu et al.39, this assumption is valid for wind at the hourly level and thus can be extrapolated to daily observations. Solar output is likely to be correlated with the error term and time fixed effects parameter when considering hourly data, which is why we aggregate hourly observations to daily intervals in the statistical model above. To test for correlation between thermal power plant generation and other exogenous variables, in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, we present the Pearson’s correlation coefficient, along with the Durbin–Watson test to check for autocorrelation in the panel regression model for each entity. We also present alternate specifications of the statistical model in Supplementary Note 1.

Displacement effectiveness

Modeling the response of individual plants outside a panel regression formulation helps us understand whether plants are individually load-following, solar-following, and wind-following, and the extent of their response. In contrast to the fixed effects ISO-level formulation considering daily time steps, the plant-level model uses hourly data and is given by Eq. (2).

$${\ln}\,{y}_{t}=\alpha+{\beta }_{1}{\ln}\,{D}_{t}^{{\prime} }+{\beta }_{2}{\ln}\,{S}_{t}+{\beta }_{3}{\ln}\,{W}_{t}+{\beta }_{4}{\ln}\,{\overline{W}}_{t}+\gamma \,{\ln}\,{{{{\bf{X}}}}}_{t}+{\eta }_{t,m}+{\eta }_{t,y}+\epsilon$$

(2)

where the variables are the same as those in the panel regression formulation above. In the plant-level OLS, \({\overline{W}}_{t}\) measures the deviation in wind generation from the previous hour.

To determine the share of emissions displaced due to renewables, we use the panel regression formulations where emissions and emissions intensity are the dependent variables, similar to Graf et al.32

$${\ln}\,{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2}{{{{\rm{EI}}}}}_{p,t}= {\alpha }_{i}+{\beta }_{1}{\ln}\,{D}_{t}^{{\prime} }+{\beta }_{2}{\ln}\,{S}_{t}+{\beta }_{3}{\ln}\,{W}_{t} \\ +{\beta }_{4}{\ln}\,{\overline{W}}_{t}+\gamma \,{\ln}\,{{{{\bf{X}}}}}_{t}+{\eta }_{t,m}+{\eta }_{t,y}+{\alpha }_{i}\times {\eta }_{t,m}+{\epsilon }_{i}$$

(3)

$${\ln}\,{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2,p,t}= {\alpha }_{i}^{{\prime} }+{\beta }_{1}^{{\prime} }{\ln}\,{D}_{t}^{{\prime} }+{\beta }_{2}^{\prime}\,{\ln}\,{S}_{t}+{\beta }_{3}^{{\prime} }{\ln}\,{W}_{t} \\ +{\beta }_{4}^{{\prime} }{\ln}\,{\overline{W}}_{t}+{\gamma }^{{\prime} }{\ln}\,{{{{\bf{X}}}}}_{t}+{\eta }_{t,m}^{{\prime} }+{\eta }_{t,y}^{{\prime} }+{\alpha }_{i}^{{\prime} }\times {\eta }_{t,m}^{{\prime} }+{\epsilon }_{i}^{{\prime} }$$

(4)

In Eq. (3), the marginal effect due to increased generation from solar can be represented by α2.

$${\alpha }_{2}=\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2}{{{{\rm{EI}}}}}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}$$

(5)

$${\alpha }_{2}=\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,\frac{{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2,p,t}}{{G}_{p,t}})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}$$

(6)

$${\alpha }_{2}=\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2,p,t}-{\ln}\,{G}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}$$

(7)

$${\alpha }_{2}=\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2,p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}-\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{G}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}$$

(8)

$${\alpha }_{2}={\alpha }_{2}^{{\prime} }-\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{G}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}$$

(9)

Rearranging, gives:

$$\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{G}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}={\alpha }_{2}-{\alpha }_{2}^{{\prime} }$$

(10)

Equation (10) represents the change in thermal generation if generation from solar replaces the generation from fossil-fueled plants on a 1:1 basis. Thus, the fraction of expected emissions reductions for solar is represented by:

$${{{\rm{Fraction}}}}\,{{{\rm{of}}}}\,{{{\rm{expected}}}}\,{{{\rm{emissions}}}}\,{{{\rm{reduction}}}}\,({{{\rm{solar}}}})=\frac{{\alpha }_{2}^{{\prime} }}{{\alpha }_{2}^{{\prime} }-{\alpha }_{2}}$$

(11)

Similarly, for wind, the expected emissions reductions and the corresponding fraction are given by:

$$\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{G}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{wind}}}}}_{t})}={\alpha }_{3}-{\alpha }_{3}^{{\prime} }$$

(12)

$${{{\rm{Fraction}}}}\,{{{\rm{of}}}}\,{{{\rm{expected}}}}\,{{{\rm{emissions}}}}\,{{{\rm{reduction}}}}\,({{{\rm{wind}}}})=\frac{{\alpha }_{3}^{{\prime} }}{{\alpha }_{3}^{{\prime} }-{\alpha }_{3}}$$

Background

The first Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) was launched at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, with a US$8.5 billion financing agreement between South Africa and the International Partners Group (IPG), a group of donor countries. The goal was to accelerate South Africa’s transition away from coal through a mix of financial instruments and technical assistance.

Following South Africa’s lead, a second group of countries, this time in Southeast Asia, established similar agreements, including Indonesia and Vietnam. Indonesia’s JETP, announced in 2022, pledged US$20 billion over three to five years from public and private sources. IPG members, including the US, Germany, and the EU, along with the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), committed to providing financing for Indonesia’s transition, aiming to peak power emissions at 290 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO₂e) by 2030, increase the share of renewable energy to 34 percent, and achieve net-zero in the power sector by 2050.

That same year, Vietnam signed a US$15.5 billion JETP agreement with similar actors. Half of the funds would come from IPG governments, and the other half from GFANZ. Vietnam’s goals are to reduce electricity-sector emissions from a projected 240 MtCO₂e in 2035 to 170 MtCO₂e by 2030, increase the share of renewable energy to 47 percent of electricity output, limit coal power capacity to 30.2 gigawatt (GW), and begin phasing out coal-fired power plants.

In 2023, a third set of countries began JETP negotiations. Senegal signed a US$2.5 billion JETP agreement. Though often hailed as innovative tools for mobilising climate finance, the JETPs are unlikely to deliver on the “just” in just energy transitions.

Recent Developments: Indonesia and Vietnam

In November 2023, Indonesia released its Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP), outlining investment priorities, policy reforms, and a just transition framework. Vietnam followed with its Resource Mobilisation Plan (RMP), detailing its goals and priority projects.

In line with its retreat from international cooperation and responsibility in March 2025, the Trump administration withdrew the US from the JETPs, relinquishing Washington’s co-leadership role in Indonesia’s partnership. In its place, Germany assumed leadership alongside Japan. The US had pledged US$3 billion, just a fraction of the total.

JETPs fail to address the historical inequalities underlying climate responsibility. Countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam have contributed a tiny fraction of cumulative global emissions, yet they are offered transition packages dominated by debt.

As of March 2025, Indonesia had received just US$1.1 billion of the promised funding. In Vietnam, three projects have secured funding, and a further four are under negotiation.

Falling Short on Justice

As a relatively new financial cooperation model, JETPs face several challenges. While it is undoubtedly true that countries, including Indonesia and Vietnam, require significant capital for climate mitigation and adaptation, JETPs will not be the route to a just transition.

First, JETPs fail to address the historical inequalities underlying climate responsibility. Countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam have contributed a tiny fraction of cumulative global emissions, yet they are offered transition packages dominated by debt. In Indonesia, 97 percent of JETP financing is comprised of loans, with only 3 percent provided as grants. Overall, just 60 percent of the financing is offered as concessional loans. In Vietnam, 96 percent of the funding is in the form of loans, with just 34 percent of the total being offered at concessional rates. This financial structure effectively shifts the burden of decarbonisation onto countries that bear limited responsibility for the climate crisis. Indonesia is responsible for an estimated 4 percent of all historical emissions, and currently accounts for less than 2 percent of the annual global total. In contrast, the United States, which is responsible for 20 percent of historical emissions, today emits 16 percent of the global total, despite comprising just four percent of the global population. From the standpoint of international climate justice and equitable financing, the JETPs in Indonesia and Vietnam are hardly pathways to a just transition. In order to be truly just, these financial instruments should mainly be comprised of grants, with a moderate reliance on concessional loans.

Second, a just transition will require significantly more capital. Currently, there are persistent gaps between the capital requirements of developing countries, the commitments made by high-income countries, and the actual disbursement of funds. The scale of finance committed through JETPs is drastically inadequate. Indonesia needs an estimated US$285 billion by 2030 to meet its conditional climate targets; JETP covers just 7 percent. Similarly, Vietnam needs US$368 billion by 2040 to achieve net-zero; JETP offers about 4 percent of that. Not only are the current commitments far short of what is required, but the actual disbursement has also been lacking. Concerns regarding climate justice extend beyond the composition of financial instruments and the scale of funding. Civil society organisations and communities affected by climate change have raised alarms about their limited participation in and the transparency of these agreements. A just transition requires input and involvement from the communities affected. While Indonesia’s JETP CIPP included a three-week public consultation period, the overall process has been criticised for a lack of engagement and transparency. Similarly, Vietnam has been criticised for not meeting commitments to conduct regular consultations.

A just transition will require significantly more capital. Currently, there are persistent gaps between the capital requirements of developing countries, the commitments made by high-income countries, and the actual disbursement of funds.

Moreover, the focus on centralised, large-scale energy infrastructure will likely displace local communities, harm ecosystems, and undermine equitable energy access. Distributed renewable energy systems, not megaprojects, offer a more straightforward path to inclusive energy access. However, the investment strategy in Indonesia, for instance, focuses solely on on-grid power. It only references the need for a study on community-based renewable energy systems, which are likely to prove critical to ensure energy justice in a country with over 17,000 islands.

Key Takeaways

Significant climate finance is urgently needed to support mitigation and adaptation efforts in countries like Indonesia and Vietnam. While JETPs present a new model for international cooperation, they fall short of enabling a truly just transition. Their heavy reliance on debt shifts responsibility away from historically high-emitting countries and onto those least responsible for the climate crisis. The overall scale of financing is inadequate, and disbursements have been limited, mirroring the broader failures of global climate finance. Meanwhile, the processes for identifying priorities and projects have excluded affected communities, with the lack of transparency and local participation undermining the principles of justice these partnerships claim to advance. Mobilising and deploying climate finance is essential, but the design of financial instruments, investment strategies, and implementation processes must align with the goals of a just transition.

The U.S. LNG sector is no longer a speculative bet—it is a cornerstone of global energy security.","The U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector is at a pivotal inflection point in 2025, driven by a confluence of geopolitical realignments, strategic trade agreements, and a historic surge in infrastructure expansion. As global demand for energy security intensifies and traditional suppliers face scrutiny, U.S. LNG producers are uniquely positioned to capitalize on a $750 billion EU-South Korea energy procurement pipeline, a 70 bcm/yr surge in global LNG capacity additions, and a favorable arbitrage environment. This article examines how these factors are creating a ""perfect storm"" for sustained outperformance in the sector, urging investors to act decisively before market dynamics shift.

Infrastructure Expansion: The Backbone of U.S. LNG's Global Dominance

The U.S. is undergoing its largest wave of LNG capacity additions in history, with nearly 295 bcm/yr of new export infrastructure coming online by 2030. Projects like Plaquemines LNG (Louisiana) and Corpus Christi Stage 3 (Texas) are emblematic of this transformation. The Plaquemines project alone, which reached full capacity by mid-2025, added 10 mtpa of export capability, while Corpus Christi's midscale trains are projected to contribute an additional 3 mtpa by late 2026.

These projects are not just incremental—they are reshaping global supply chains. For instance, the Haynesville and Permian basins, which supply 60% of U.S. LNG feedstock, are now 40% more cost-competitive than their Middle Eastern counterparts due to proximity to Gulf Coast terminals and lower production costs. This arbitrage advantage is amplified by the U.S.'s flexible ""destination-independent"" contract model, which allows buyers to redirect cargo, creating liquidity and pricing resilience.

Geopolitical Tailwinds: From Commodity to Strategic Asset

U.S. LNG is no longer just a commodity—it is a geopolitical tool. The EU's RePowerEU initiative and South Korea's $100 billion LNG procurement plan are explicitly designed to reduce reliance on adversarial suppliers like Russia and China. The EU has pledged $250 billion annually in U.S. energy imports from 2026 to 2028, while South Korea is diversifying its imports to counter Chinese influence.

This strategic pivot is creating a ""demand floor"" for U.S. LNG. Even if global demand for natural gas peaks by 2030, the EU's methane monitoring and verification (MRV) framework—set to enforce maximum methane intensity limits by 2030—will further entrench U.S. producers in climate-conscious markets. The Inflation Reduction Act's methane fee and abatement measures, though still lagging behind Australia and Norway, are closing the gap and could unlock a premium for U.S. LNG in the long term.

Financial Metrics: A Sector in Motion

The financial health of leading U.S. LNG producers underscores the sector's long-term viability. Cheniere Energy, for example, reported $1.9 billion in Q1 2025 Adjusted EBITDA and reaffirmed full-year guidance of $6.5–$7.0 billion. Its Corpus Christi Stage 3 project is now 82.5% complete, with first production expected by mid-2025. Similarly, Sempra Energy (SRE) is investing $1.241 billion in Q1 2025 CAPEX, with its Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 and Energía Costa Azul Phase 1 projects on track for 2026 commercialization.

These companies are also prioritizing shareholder returns. Cheniere allocated $1.3 billion in Q1 2025 to growth, debt reduction, and share repurchases, while Sempra's adjusted EPS guidance of $4.30–$4.70 for 2025 reflects confidence in its infrastructure pipeline.

Risks and Mitigants: Navigating a Complex Landscape

While the outlook is bullish, investors must remain vigilant. The EU's MRV framework could penalize U.S. LNG if methane intensity improvements fall short. Additionally, overcapacity risks loom as Qatar and Australia expand their export capabilities. However, the U.S. is countering these challenges through:

- Strategic Partnerships: The EU-South Korea agreements lock in long-term demand.

- Operational Efficiency: Shale gas producers are consolidating to reduce costs and enhance resilience.

- Infrastructure Diversification: Projects like the Permian Basin Reliability Plan (costing $35 billion) ensure supply chain robustness.

Investment Implications: Capitalizing on the Inflection Point

The U.S. LNG sector is at a crossroads. For investors, the key is to balance optimism with prudence. Companies with strong project pipelines (e.g., Cheniere's Stage 3, Sempra's Costa Azul) and proactive methane abatement strategies are best positioned to outperform. The sector's 28% revenue growth in Q1 2025 and projected 7–9% long-term EPS CAGR through 2029 suggest a compelling risk-reward profile.

Actionable Advice:

1. Prioritize Infrastructure Leaders: Cheniere and Sempra offer a blend of near-term project execution and long-term strategic alignment with global energy transitions.

2. Monitor Methane Metrics: Track progress on the Inflation Reduction Act's abatement goals and EU MRV benchmarks.

3. Diversify Exposure: Consider midstream players (e.g., Oncor Electric) and upstream shale producers (e.g., Encana) to hedge against commodity price volatility.

The U.S. LNG sector is no longer a speculative bet—it is a cornerstone of global energy security. As 2025 unfolds, the window to invest in this inflection point is narrowing.

Minister for the Environment and Water, Murray Watt said Marinus Link will strengthen Australia’s energy future, making it cleaner, more reliable and more affordable.","The Albanese Government has given environmental approval to a transformative, nation-building project which will generate jobs and investment for Tasmania and Victoria, while unlocking clean and reliable energy through an undersea cable to the mainland.

The Marinus Link project will construct, operate and decommission a 1,500 MW subsea and underground electricity and fibre optics interconnector and related infrastructure between Tasmania and Victoria. The project will be delivered in two 750MW stages, with this approval covering both.

The full (two cable, 1,500MW) project is expected to create up to 3,300 direct and indirect jobs across Tasmania and Victoria during its development and construction phase.

By unlocking Tasmania’s renewable energy resources, this project will help power homes and businesses across the eastern seaboard. The 750MW capacity of Marinus Link Stage 1 alone is roughly equal to the power supply for 750,000 Australian homes.

The project will enable the flow of electricity in both directions, providing energy security benefits for both Tasmanian and Victorian homes.

“By unlocking Tasmania’s world-class renewable energy resources, this project will help power homes and businesses across the eastern seaboard and accelerate our transition to net zero,” Minister Watt said.

“It will also strengthen energy security for Tasmania and Victoria by providing National Electricity Market (NEM) customers with greater access to a diverse and abundant supply of renewable energy and storage capacity.

“The project will support the creation of hundreds of jobs in both Victoria and Tasmania and will create future opportunities for investment opportunities for business in construction, engineering, telecommunications, and renewable energy sectors.”

The Albanese Government worked closely with the Victorian and Tasmanian Governments, and relevant offshore regulatory agencies to ensure a rigorous assessment of the project under Australia’s national environmental law.

This partnership with state governments has helped safeguard our nationally protected matters, with the Australian Government’s decision under the national environment law being made ahead of the Tasmanian and Victorian government.

“This project is a good example of the Albanese Government’s commitment to facilitate important economic development, while protecting our unique natural environment,” Minister Watt said.

“The decision includes a comprehensive set of strict conditions designed to safeguard Australia’s iconic animals, plants, and ecosystems, both on land and in marine environments.”",https://minister.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/minister/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-03 03:00:31.646636

A number of major corporations, including PepsiCo, Amazon, Netflix, Meta, and Mastercard, are leading the charge on a shift in carbon credits. How are they doing this? By teaming up with Kinetic Coalition, a global alliance of major corporations seeking to make change by unlocking clean energy investment in emerging economies.

Rather than utilizing technology offsets or tree-planting, as is the norm, these corporations are backing an early retirement for power plants run on coal. According to Carbon Credits, this is a significant step in alleviating damage to the climate and local environments.

These companies are using transition credits, rather than traditional carbon credits, meaning they're paying the owners of coal plants to retire them early, Carbon Credits reported. Typically, companies are offsetting damage already done by paying for every metric ton of carbon produced, but this method allows for the avoidance of future damage while also making way for cleaner energy.

Not only do transition credits ensure that there are no future emissions from these coal plants — which would otherwise cause the planet to heat even more — but this method can also support workers leaving closed coal plants and help create new jobs in clean energy, benefiting both communities and the environment.

Best of all, estimates suggest that if transition credits become the norm, hundreds of billions of dollars could be allocated toward clean energy. In fact, Carbon Credits reported that the Kinetic Coalition may be able to provide between $72 billion and $207 billion by 2035, all on its own.

As the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions President Nat Keohane explained to Carbon Credits, ""Energy transition credits can accelerate the transition to clean energy systems for emerging economies, help companies reduce their supply chain emissions – and, most importantly, bring economic, health, and environmental gains to local communities. They offer an opportunity to achieve emission reductions at scale while benefiting companies and people – and Kinetic is excited to seize it.""

While we can't predict the future of transition credits, the fact that these major corporations are utilizing them now is a significant step toward the continued transition from dirty energy to clean energy and could mark a substantial boost for the economies of cities and towns where these coal plants reside.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/transition-creditsimage-recqcVs5c5GVkwE2g.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:00:59.172348

Sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.
However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.","President Donald Trump's plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the United States could speed up a building boom that already was expected to strain the nation's ability to power it.

The White House released its AI Action Plan on July 23, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others pour billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat ""radical climate dogma,"" a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump's ""American energy dominance"" agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

Environmental concerns

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are increasingly severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

Big Tech moves

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most power plants in the U.S. still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

Tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often that's not from renewables. Sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

In recent days, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world's largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means ""relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,"" Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear, power generation.

What's ahead

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for.

""In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,"" said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

""They're planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that's projected, which is what we want them to do,"" she added.

The country's 2025 strategy, marked by deliberate interventions in critical sectors, is not just about survival but about positioning for long-term growth. For investors, this represents a rare confluence of policy-driven stability and innovation-led opportunity.

The Automotive Sector: Tariffs as a Catalyst for Domestic Innovation

The U.S. administration's 25% tariffs on Canadian automobiles and parts in 2025 initially seemed like a seismic threat. Yet, the Canadian government turned this challenge into a strategic pivot. By imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. vehicles and introducing a quota-based relief framework for automakers that maintain production in Canada, the government has created a buffer against trade shocks. This framework, which includes support for General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, ensures that domestic manufacturers remain competitive while incentivizing capital reinvestment.

The proposed modernized Auto Pact—reminiscent of the 1965 Canada-U.S. agreement—adds another layer of foresight. By linking import rights to domestic production, it aims to preserve North American supply chains while deterring trade diversion. For investors, this signals a sector where policy acts as a stabilizer, reducing exposure to cross-border risks. The automotive industry's pivot toward electrification and digital integration (with government-backed incentives for battery and software R&D) further amplifies its appeal.

AI: A Sovereign Compute Strategy to Outpace the Global Race

Canada's AI Compute Access Fund—a $300 million initiative under the $2 billion Sovereign AI Compute Strategy—is a masterstroke in the race for artificial intelligence dominance. By democratizing access to high-performance computing for SMEs, the government is fostering a generation of innovators who might otherwise be starved of resources. The fund's focus on sectors like life sciences, energy, and advanced manufacturing aligns with Canada's comparative strengths, ensuring that AI development is not just theoretical but applied.

The government's emphasis on “sovereign compute” infrastructure—building domestic data centers and a new AI supercomputing system—addresses a critical vulnerability: overreliance on foreign cloud providers. This move not only enhances data security but also creates a scalable ecosystem for AI startups. For investors, the AI sector in Canada is no longer just about tech giants. It's about a pipeline of SMEs and academia-driven projects that could yield high-growth equities.

Clean Energy: Decarbonizing the Grid as a Growth Engine

Canada's Clean Electricity Regulations (CER), finalized in late 2024, are the cornerstone of its net-zero ambitions. By setting annual emissions limits for fossil fuel-based power plants and offering compliance flexibility through offset credits, the government is balancing environmental goals with grid reliability. The $60 billion in federal funding for clean infrastructure—ranging from Indigenous-led solar projects to battery storage initiatives—signals a decade-long commitment to decarbonization.

The economic ripple effects are profound. Electrification is projected to slash household energy bills and create 600,000 jobs by 2050. For investors, the clean energy sector offers a dual opportunity: infrastructure plays (wind, solar, grid modernization) and technology plays (battery storage, smart grid software). The Oneida Energy Storage Project, a joint venture between Northland Power and Indigenous partners, exemplifies how policy and capital can align to deliver both ESG and financial returns.

The Investment Thesis: Policy-Driven Resilience as a Risk Mitigator

Canada's 2025 interventions are not just sector-specific—they are part of a broader narrative of economic sovereignty. By shielding industries from external shocks (via retaliatory tariffs and trade agreements), empowering innovation (via compute and R&D funding), and future-proofing energy systems (via decarbonization), the government is creating a risk-averse environment for capital.

For investors, this translates to three key opportunities:

1. Automotive and Advanced Manufacturing: Bet on companies benefiting from the Auto Pact and electrification incentives.

2. AI and Compute Infrastructure: Target SMEs and data center operators supported by the Sovereign AI Compute Strategy.

3. Clean Energy and Grid Modernization: Prioritize firms involved in renewable infrastructure and energy storage.

Conclusion: Resilience as a Strategic Asset

Canada's approach to economic resilience is neither reactive nor timid. It is a calculated, multi-sector strategy that leverages policy to amplify private-sector potential. For investors, the lesson is clear: in a world of uncertainty, the most compelling opportunities often lie where government and innovation converge.

What pressures are threatening the power grid?

Extreme weather, including high temperatures and thunderstorms, resulted in power outages across the country, and it highlighted a growing problem.

The North American Electric Reliability Corp. said that power grids in the Midwest, New England, Texas, and Southern California would be unable to operate in ""above-normal conditions,"" Al Jazeera reported.

There's also the matter of artificial intelligence. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, creating one AI-generated image uses the energy equivalent of fully charging a smartphone. The increased use of AI has led to energy demands that the grid is struggling to meet.

Why does the state of the power grid matter?

Power systems are outdated and cannot adapt to such dramatic changes.

For example, a 2021 Texas cold snap led to 4.5 million people losing power and more than 200 deaths, many of which were attributed to hypothermia, per the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The cold also affected gas lines and other equipment. A typically warm state, Texas lacked the infrastructure to respond to such weather.

As the planet continues to warm and extreme weather events become more prevalent, power outages are expected to rise, leading to price spikes and leaving people vulnerable to the elements. It's crucial to assess and address the grid's weak points before it's too late.

""The power grid is one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure,"" Kyri Baker, an associate professor in the University of Colorado Boulder's Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering, told CU Boulder Today. ""Keeping that system safe, secure, and reliable is not only convenient but also life-saving.""

How renewable energy can help save the grid

Incorporating renewable energy into the grid won't be a simple feat, but its meteoric rise shows that people are ready for it. In fact, in 2024, renewable energy accounted for over 30% of the world's electricity.

One way to make this transition smoother is to utilize battery storage systems, which store excess energy from solar power, among other clean forms of energy. On days when sunlight is scarce, the stored energy is released. According to the United Nations, this can be cheaper and more reliable than electricity in certain locations.

Bottom line: If overreliance on dirty fuels is harming people, then finding alternative forms of energy to strengthen the grid is a must.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/power-gridimage-recwgvVMXRQ6cy3Ac-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 23:59:54.648905

Since the president has returned to office, his goons have ordered the following: 

• Announced it would lay off all of the health research scientists at the EPA, laying off investigators who try to understand how toxic pollution affects the human body

• Seek to repeal its recognition of climate change as a threat to human health, potentially limiting the government’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases. 

• Relaxed existing standards for mercury and lead pollution—two toxins that can lead to developmental problems in children. 

• Postponed its implementation of new Biden-era regulations that were supposed to reduce the amount of dangerous chemicals Americans are exposed to

Meanwhile, House Republicans are attempting to grant widespread liability relief to pesticide companies and restrict EPA regulation of PFAS “forever chemicals” through provisions that have been tucked into the spending bills currently moving through Congress. (Democrats, for their part, have offered opposing legislation that would protect an individual’s right to sue over any harm from pesticides.)

This collective assault upon America’s environmental regulations targets not just the environment, but human health as well. Which means it sits oddly with the work of another Trump official whose office at the Department of Health and Human Services is just a 15-minute walk from EPA headquarters: Robert F. Kennedy Jr, whose Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement seeks to, obviously, make Americans healthier.

But Kennedy hasn’t spoken up about these contradictions—and his supporters are beginning to notice.

Investors who navigate the tension between energy security and decarbonization—by balancing LNG, green hydrogen, and RNG—will be well-positioned for the long-term.","The global energy landscape in 2025 is defined by a tectonic shift in natural gas supply chains, driven by geopolitical tensions and the collapse of traditional pipeline routes. The end of Russian gas transit through Ukraine in January 2025, the operational constraints of Nord Stream 1 and 2, and the EU's March 2025 ban on Russian LNG transshipments have forced a rapid reallocation of energy infrastructure and investment priorities. These disruptions are not merely short-term volatility—they represent a fundamental restructuring of global energy markets, with profound implications for investors.

The Pipeline Collapse and Its Aftermath

The closure of Ukraine's transit corridor—the primary route for Russian gas to Europe—has reduced Russian exports to the continent by nearly 50% year-on-year. The TurkStream pipeline, now the sole functioning conduit, has seen a 4.7% increase in flows post-maintenance, but its capacity remains a fraction of what Europe once relied upon. This vacuum has triggered a surge in LNG demand, with the U.S. emerging as a dominant supplier. However, the long-term risks of overreliance on LNG—volatile pricing, infrastructure bottlenecks, and the carbon footprint of liquefaction—loom large.

For investors, the key question is: How do we balance the urgency of securing energy security with the need to decarbonize? The answer lies in a dual strategy: short-term infrastructure adaptation and long-term investment in alternative gas sources.

The Rise of Alternative Gas Sources

Natural gas is no longer a monolith. The post-pipeline era has accelerated the rise of alternatives, from green hydrogen to biogas, each with distinct investment profiles.

Green Hydrogen: The High-Potential Gamble

Green hydrogen, produced via electrolysis powered by renewable energy, is gaining traction as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. The U.S. has pledged $570 billion in hydrogen projects through 2030, though only $39 billion has reached final investment decision (FID). The “green premium”—the higher cost of green hydrogen compared to grey hydrogen—remains a barrier. At €3–8/kg versus €1–2/kg for grey hydrogen, the economic viability of green hydrogen hinges on subsidies and demand creation.

Government support is critical. The Inflation Reduction Act's Section 45V Credit (up to $3/kg) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act's $8 billion for hydrogen hubs are game-changers. California's ARCHES project, for example, aims to produce hydrogen from renewables while cutting emissions by 2 million metric tons annually. However, delays in regulatory clarity and the absence of demand-side incentives (e.g., mandates for industrial use) risk stalling progress.

Biogas and Renewable Natural Gas (RNG): The Near-Term Fix

Biogas, derived from organic waste, offers a transitional solution. Upgraded to RNG, it can be injected into existing gas infrastructure, reducing reliance on imports. The U.S. is leveraging tax credits and state-level renewable portfolio standards to scale RNG production, but feedstock limitations and processing costs remain challenges.

LNG: The Unstable Bridge

While LNG has filled the void left by Russian pipelines, its role is precarious. The U.S. has expanded export capacity, but infrastructure bottlenecks—such as the Permian Basin's 90% pipeline utilization—threaten to undermine supply stability. The Matterhorn Express Pipeline's October 2024 launch (2.5 Bcf/d capacity) is a step forward, but investors must weigh the risks of stranded assets as demand shifts toward cleaner alternatives.

Infrastructure Rebalancing: Risks and Opportunities

The energy transition is reshaping infrastructure investment. The Infrastructure Quarterly: Q2 2025 reports that renewable energy accounted for one-third of total infrastructure deal volume, with battery storage projected to make up 29% of new power generation capacity in 2025. Data centers, driven by AI demand, are another hotspot, with supply in primary markets expanding 34% year-over-year.

Yet, the path is fraught with challenges. The U.S. aims to produce $100 billion in domestic batteries by 2030, but manufacturers face a 30%–40% gap in meeting domestic demand due to supply chain constraints. Similarly, greenfield hydrogen projects often stall without offtake agreements, as seen with Dirostahl's abandoned green hydrogen plans and Iberdrola's delayed expansions.

Strategic Investment Advice

For investors, the post-pipeline disruption era demands a nuanced approach:

Diversify Across Gas Alternatives: Allocate capital to a mix of green hydrogen, RNG, and LNG infrastructure. Prioritize projects with government-backed offtake agreements (e.g., California's ARCHES) and tax incentives.

Leverage Data and Digital Infrastructure: The energy transition is inseparable from AI-driven demand. Target data centers and battery storage projects in regions with abundant renewables.

Hedge Against Geopolitical Shocks: Invest in midstream infrastructure (e.g., Permian Basin pipelines) while hedging against regulatory shifts via ESG-aligned portfolios.

Monitor Policy Signals: The Inflation Reduction Act's 45V Credit and the EU's hydrogen strategy will shape market dynamics. Stay agile to pivot as subsidies evolve.

Conclusion: The New Energy Equation

The collapse of traditional gas pipelines has exposed the fragility of global energy systems but also unlocked new opportunities. Investors who navigate the tension between energy security and decarbonization—by balancing LNG, green hydrogen, and RNG—will be well-positioned for the long-term. The next decade will be defined not by the fuel itself, but by the infrastructure and policies that enable its transformation.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Resilience Subaru's July 2025 sales demonstrate a company in transition.","In a market increasingly defined by electric vehicle (EV) transitions and shifting consumer preferences, Subaru of America's July 2025 sales performance offers a compelling case study. The company reported 54,035 vehicles sold in July 2025, a 4.5% increase compared to the same period in 2024. While this growth rate appears modest, the underlying trends—particularly in the premium SUV segment—reveal a strategic alignment with evolving industry dynamics. For investors, the question is whether Subaru's current trajectory positions it as a long-term winner in a segment poised for disruption.

July 2025 Sales: Resilience in a Fragmented Market

Subaru's July 2025 sales highlight a mix of resilience and vulnerability. The Crosstrek, its top-selling model, achieved a record 17,628 units sold—a 15.1% year-over-year increase—cementing its dominance in the compact SUV category. The Forester and Outback also delivered strong performances, with 11,886 and 14,982 units sold, respectively, driven by their reputation for durability and family-friendly utility. Most notably, the Solterra, Subaru's first all-electric SUV, reached its best monthly sales ever with 1,562 units, a 23.9% increase. These figures underscore Subaru's ability to maintain relevance in a segment where EV adoption is accelerating.

However, challenges persist. The Ascent (down 28.7%), BRZ (down 18.1%), and WRX (down 66.6%) struggled to attract buyers, reflecting a broader industry trend of declining interest in performance-oriented and larger SUVs. These declines signal a need for innovation in product differentiation, particularly as competitors like Tesla and Rivian gain traction.

Contextualizing the EV Transition

The premium SUV segment is undergoing a seismic shift. In 2025, EVs accounted for over 7.5% of U.S. new vehicle sales, with automakers like Ford, GM, and Tesla expanding their high-end offerings. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has further accelerated this shift by incentivizing EV purchases through tax credits, though eligibility criteria tied to local manufacturing complicate the landscape.

Subaru's Solterra stands out in this context. Unlike most EVs, the Solterra features Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive, a hallmark of Subaru's engineering, and 8.3 inches of ground clearance—critical for buyers seeking off-road capability in an electric vehicle. This differentiation is a strategic coup in a segment where EVs have traditionally lacked ruggedness. The 2025 Solterra's price reductions (down $6,500 for the base model) and the introduction of the Touring Onyx Edition (priced at $45,495) also signal a commitment to affordability and premium positioning.

Product Development: Aligning with Consumer Preferences

Subaru's 2025–2026 product roadmap further strengthens its investment case. The 2026 Outback, reimagined as a midsized SUV, will emphasize ruggedness with a taller profile, plastic body cladding, and a Wilderness trim featuring 9.5 inches of ground clearance. This redesign caters to the growing demand for adventure-ready vehicles, a trend amplified by the rise of outdoor lifestyles.

Additionally, the introduction of a hybrid Forester (leveraging Toyota's hybrid technology) underscores Subaru's pivot toward fuel efficiency. With an estimated 35 mpg in the city, the hybrid version addresses cost-conscious buyers hesitant to adopt full EVs. These moves reflect a balanced approach: embracing electrification while retaining the practicality and reliability that define Subaru's brand.

Risk and Reward: A Long-Term Investment Perspective

For investors, Subaru's long-term potential hinges on its ability to navigate three key challenges:

1. EV Competition: Tesla's price cuts and Rivian's focus on premium SUVs pose risks. However, Subaru's AWD differentiation and affordability pricing mitigate this threat.

2. Inventory and Supply Chains: The industry's ongoing supply chain issues could delay production of the 2026 Outback and hybrid Forester. Subaru's reliance on a 640-dealer network, however, provides a buffer against such disruptions.

3. Brand Perception: Subaru's reputation for reliability (96% of its 10-year-old vehicles remain on the road) is a major asset. The company's community initiatives, such as Subaru Loves Learning, further reinforce brand loyalty.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Resilience

Subaru's July 2025 sales demonstrate a company in transition. While its EV and hybrid offerings are still nascent compared to Tesla's dominance, the Solterra's unique capabilities and the 2026 Outback's rugged repositioning position Subaru to capture a niche but growing segment of the premium SUV market. For investors, the key is to balance optimism with caution: Subaru's long-term potential is promising, but its success will depend on sustained innovation and the ability to scale its EV and hybrid lineups.

In a market where EV transitions and shifting consumer preferences are the norm, Subaru's blend of heritage, practicality, and incremental innovation makes it a compelling, if not yet dominant, player. Those willing to bet on a company that prioritizes reliability and adaptability may find Subaru's stock a strategic addition to their portfolio.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 05:59:41.413467

According to the head of the agency charged with protecting the nation’s environment, it appears to be the latter. So, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin exulted last week in a proposal to rescind a 2009 declaration that greenhouse gases are endangering public health and welfare.

The EPA’s “Endangerment Finding” strengthened the agency’s hand to establish under the Clean Air Act climate regulations for motor vehicles, power plants and other sources of pollution. Repealing it, Zeldin rejoiced, “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.”

“There are people,” he said, “who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country. They created this endangerment finding, and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence, in many cases, a lot of segments of our economy. And it cost Americans a lot of money.”

Let’s first acknowledge that American car companies, airplane manufacturers and airlines, power companies and more seem nowhere near the point of going out of business. Then, let’s remember that, in any case, it’s not Zeldin’s job to worry about them. It is, or ought to be, his job to ensure that the best science is used to identify environmental hazards to public health and promote guidelines to eliminate or control them.

Instead, antithetically to his agency’s mission, he proposed rollback or repeal of 31 environmental rules — including the 2009 finding — for managing clean air, clean water and climate change.

For Chicagoans, Zeldin’s announcement preceded experiences with almost karmic undertones.

Using data from the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Washington Post reported this week that 18 Eastern and Midwestern states, Illinois among them, endured the highest July humidity on record, contributing in some cases to heat indexes as high as 128 degrees in Missouri. In another eight states, July humidity this year was the second or third highest they had ever felt.

And, for a while on Thursday, an international monitoring company found the Chicago area wheezing through the worst air quality in the world, a distinction the region has held before.

“The air quality is officially dangerous in Chicago,” said Brian Urbaszewski, director of environmental health programs at the Chicago-based Respiratory Health Association.

Granted, the distinction was temporary and exacerbated by wildfires raging in Canada. But the situation, the wildfires and the humidity records all reflect conditions scientists have long predicted would become more commonplace as climate change intensifies across the planet.

So, it is more than a little discouraging to hear the person chiefly responsible for protecting us from “officially dangerous” circumstances cheering the removal of potential safeguards.

Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said as much in response to Zeldin’s announcement.

“As Americans reel from deadly floods and heat waves, the Trump administration is trying to argue that the emissions turbocharging these disasters are not a threat. It boggles the mind and endangers the nation’s safety and welfare,” she complained.

If America is indeed on the path to bankruptcy, economic repercussions from environmental regulations could not be ruled out as a factor, of course. But neither could such repercussions from military spending, tax cuts, aid to schools or any other expense. Using that arguable connection to a questionable conclusion in order to justify making our nation and our world less livable is something to condemn, not celebrate.

Fortunately, Zeldin’s proposal must go through a lengthy process of review and public hearings. Let’s hope that somewhere during this period, individuals with more interest in the conditions under which we and our children and grandchildren live will emerge to protect the nation’s environmental policy from the people currently overseeing it.",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=2b4451cb-9e11-5048-b09b-59eccc974435&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-08-03 00:59:26.159965

India is becoming a major hub for climate investments. Clean energy demand and zero-emission technologies are rising. Over $2 bn in climate-focused capital has been invested in the past year. Major investors are making strategic investments in India's energy and clean tech sectors.

Mumbai: India is rapidly emerging as a key destination for climate capital, driven by rising demand for clean electric alternatives and a growing push from heavy industries towards zero-emission technologies.

The country has attracted more than $2 billion in climate-focused capital over the past year alone, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) data.

Over the past 8-12 months, major climate investors such as TPG Rise Climate, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, LeapFrog Investments, Lowercarbon Capital, and Fullerton Fund Management have moved beyond cautious pilot projects to make strategic bets in India’s energy and clean tech sectors.

This influx of climate funding is fuelled not only by environmental urgency, but also by a confluence of favourable factors: cost parity with traditional energy sources, inflection in consumer demand and supportive policy frameworks. India’s clean energy demand is increasingly being powered by essential services — including logistics, cooling and distributed power — rather than discretionary consumption.

Long-term scalability

This shift provides investors with confidence in both long-term scalability and durable margins, say industry experts.

“There’s been a marked uptick in growth and infrastructure capital doubling down on platform plays across circularity, e-mobility, OEMs, battery lifecycle management and energy storage,” said Nakul Zaveri, partner and co-head of Climate Investment Strategy at LeapFrog Investments, which plans to commit over $500 million to climate solutions.

A key part of this strategy includes a $60 million investment by the European Investment Bank (EIB), with additional backing from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Temasek.

Globally, climate finance surpassed $2 trillion in 2024, with a significant portion of private capital flowing into electric mobility, battery storage and green infrastructure.

Singapore-based Fullerton Fund Management recently made its first investment under the Fullerton Carbon Action Fund, acquiring an equity stake in Routematic, an AI-driven corporate transport company in India.

“Climate finance in India is poised for a surge, increasingly driven by market economics,” reckons Akhil Jain, investment lead at Fullerton Carbon Action Fund. “Clean energy and key segments of electric transport are now at or beyond cost parity with conventional options.”

This shift is reshaping investment patterns. Funds are increasingly focused on companies with strong revenue models and proprietary technology. “There’s surging demand for low-emission, resource-efficient technologies, especially in sectors like transport and energy,” said Shailesh Vickram Singh, founder of Climate Angels, which has backed 22 startups in the EV, clean air and climate tech space over the past two to three years.

Rather than backing isolated innovations, investors are now prioritising integrated operators who can build full value chains and deliver resilient, scalable infrastructure solutions. “What was once seen as high-risk is now attracting a premium, especially for operators executing climate strategies at scale,” said Zaveri.

This evolution also reflects a broader recognition of the importance of embedding adaptation into climate solutions. “Capital is now flowing towards companies that reduce emissions and also build resilience—across sectors like waste, cooling and mobility,” noted Vasudha Madhavan, founder & CEO of Ostara Advisors, an investment bank focused on electric mobility.

Industry leaders see this as an inflection point.

Over the next 2-3 years, climate finance in India is expected to deepen its focus on scalable technologies with the potential to transform high-emission sectors. “This is a pivotal moment,” Madhavan added. “Climate finance is shifting from small, fragmented bets to strategic, high-value investments that can accelerate the clean transition at scale.”

State utility regulators are fast-tracking plans for projects that will bring more renewable energy because they need to get the projects started before Inflation Reduction Act incentives disappear under a new federal law.

Using renewable energy results in cost savings and reduces pollution that contributes to the warming of the planet.

Some of the state's clean-energy developments were put on hold because of the pandemic, so utility regulators are hoping to make progress toward their mandated target of utilizing 100% clean energy by 2040, according to Canary Media.

A bill passed by the Maine Legislature in 2023 requires the state to install renewable energy projects on PFAS-contaminated land. PFAS are a group of highly toxic chemicals that are found in many everyday products such as clothing, nonstick cookware, and food packaging. Since the contaminated land has been deemed unsuitable for agriculture, Maine is giving preferential treatment to renewable energy developments that can make use of the land, per Canary Media.

Francesca Gundrum, director of advocacy for Maine Audubon, believes that using the land this way is positive news for renewable energy, wildlife, and farmers who cannot use the land as they originally intended.

""This work to help deploy solar and other renewable technologies is exactly the kind of siting we need to see more of in Maine,"" she stated, per Canary Media. ""Whatever we can do to minimize the turnover of habitat is something we're going to be supportive of.""

These projects to bring low-cost, clean energy to Maine have bipartisan support from legislators.

Maine's commitment to ramp up renewable energy usage has already saved residents money, and studies show that reaching 100% clean energy by 2040 would save the average Maine household about $1,300 per year.

Diversification across electrolyzers (e.g., Bloom Energy), hydrogen infrastructure (e.g., Linde), and renewables (e.g., NextEra Energy) can mitigate sector-specific risks.
Short-term risks—geopolitical shocks, regulatory uncertainty, and economic slowdowns—will continue to test investor patience.","The energy sector in 2025 is a theater of paradoxes. On one hand, it grapples with acute volatility driven by geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic fragility, and regulatory uncertainty. On the other, it harbors robust long-term growth potential, particularly in renewable energy and hydrogen technologies. For investors, the challenge lies in discerning which headwinds are temporary and which tailwinds are structural.

Short-Term Risks: A Fragile Equilibrium

The immediate risks to energy equities are stark. The global economy, now growing at 2.3% according to the IMF, is a fragile backdrop for capital-intensive energy projects. Elevated real yields—spurred by central banks' inflation-fighting policies—have tightened credit conditions, raising the cost of financing for both fossil fuel and clean energy ventures. Meanwhile, geopolitical conflicts, from U.S.-China trade disputes to the Israel-Iran standoff, have triggered sharp price swings in crude oil and natural gas.

Consider West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude: it dipped below $60 per barrel in May 2025 but rebounded sharply after the June 13 Israel-Iran clash. Such volatility underscores the sector's exposure to geopolitical shocks. Natural gas markets, meanwhile, face near-term softness due to oversupplied storage, though futures suggest a potential winter rebound. These short-term corrections are compounded by regulatory shifts, such as the U.S. enforcement of a 10% universal tariff and elevated “reciprocal” tariffs on 57 countries, which are reshaping supply chains and increasing corporate capital expenditure (CapEx) costs.

Long-Term Opportunities: The Energy Transition's Inevitability

While the near-term outlook is clouded, the long-term trajectory of the energy sector is clear: decarbonization is accelerating, and hydrogen and renewables are central to this transition. The cleantech, artificial intelligence (AI), and carbon industries are driving demand for 24/7 clean energy, with projected needs exceeding 57 gigawatts by 2030. Renewables, with their low costs and technological maturity, are poised to dominate this demand.

Green hydrogen, in particular, is emerging as a linchpin of the energy transition. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has allocated $7 billion to develop hydrogen hubs, with five of seven projects securing phase 1 funding. Federal incentives, such as the $3/kg green hydrogen tax credits, remain pending final guidance, but the sector's momentum is undeniable. Companies like Plug Power (PLUG) and Bloom Energy (BE) are leading the charge. Plug Power, for instance, raised $280 million in equity and secured a $525 million credit facility in early 2025, while Bloom Energy's solid oxide electrolyzers offer 15–45% higher efficiency than competitors.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) further amplifies these opportunities. By allocating $27 billion to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and supporting state-level green banks, the IRA is creating a robust pipeline for renewables and hydrogen. For example, the Solar for All initiative and Empowering Rural America program are projected to drive 36 gigawatts of renewables and storage by 2030. These programs are not just policy abstractions; they are translating into real projects, such as green hydrogen from Superfund site wastewater providing 16 hours of solar power storage.

Strategic Positioning for Investors

The key for investors lies in balancing exposure to short-term volatility with long-term structural trends. While fossil fuel equities may face near-term headwinds from policy shifts and geopolitical risks, the renewable and hydrogen sectors offer compelling upside.

Prioritize Resilient Sub-Sectors: The commercial solar segment, despite a 28% quarter-over-quarter decline in Q1 2025, outperformed peers due to California's NEM 2.0 rollout. Similarly, green hydrogen and long-duration energy storage (LDES) are gaining traction as solutions for 24/7 clean energy.

Leverage Policy Tailwinds: The IRA and permitting reforms are critical catalysts. Investors should favor companies with strong IRA-aligned projects, such as Air Products (APD) and Linde (LIN), which are scaling blue hydrogen and carbon capture infrastructure.

Diversify Across Technologies: While solar remains dominant, hydrogen's role as a LDES solution is expanding. Diversification across electrolyzers (e.g., Bloom Energy), hydrogen infrastructure (e.g., Linde), and renewables (e.g., NextEra Energy) can mitigate sector-specific risks.

The Road Ahead

The energy sector in 2025 is a mosaic of turbulence and transformation. Short-term risks—geopolitical shocks, regulatory uncertainty, and economic slowdowns—will continue to test investor patience. Yet, the long-term story is one of resilience: renewables are scaling, hydrogen is maturing, and policy frameworks are aligning with decarbonization goals.

For those with a multi-decade horizon, the current volatility may present an opportunity to acquire undervalued equities in the energy transition. However, caution is warranted. As the adage goes, “The trend is your friend, but it is a poor guide.” Investors must navigate the present chaos with both discipline and vision, recognizing that the energy sector's future lies not in resisting change but in embracing it.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 12:04:46.513913

The question is no longer “When is humanity going to detect an alternative means of generating energy?” It is now a matter of mass adoption.","Just like every aspect of human endeavor, advancement is bound to occur, and this sector is no different. Our world has been run by coal for the longest time; the impact on the environment has been overlooked, even though its effect has been cataclysmic. Our scientists have found a breakthrough for humanity. An alternative that could also offer the benefits of coal power, but without the environmental hazards that come with it.

The most challenging part of the new discovery

The bottleneck in searching for alternatives to coal power lies in the drilling through our planet’s geosphere. 20 km is not a regular distance, especially when it comes to drilling. On the path to discovering sustainable, reliable geothermal sources of energy, sophisticated equipment and machinery have to be present to make it a success. Humanity didn’t fail in this regard, making the advancement seamless and easy.

A conventional geothermal well’s maximum depth is 5 km. Reaching for something extra requires a professional level of resilience and patience. This new discovery is called “hot rock” by most scientists.

Unveiling of coal’s alternative

This name “superock” might seem alien to a lot of enthusiasts, but this is the frontier of advanced energy alternation. Its system behaves inertly and carries far more energy than normal steam. With proper research and implementation, this “superrock” can generate up to ten times the power of regular geothermal sources as we know it.

Another advantage this new alternative possesses, just like the new advancements that are being made in the energy sector, is efficiency, reliability, and maximum automation in the entire energy generation process.

The great restructuring: transforming our coal plants into cleaner energy generators

The financial burden that would be imminent for an entire overhaul of our current coal energy generating systems would be quite enormous, which is why a simpler alternative, which is repurposing our current infrastructure, is the best bet going forward for energy generation.

We could take advantage of some of the existing infrastructure, like powerful high-capacity turbines, transmission lines, cooling systems, and grid access.

The shift from black to ordinary steam

Humanity is prepared for the immense relief this initiative is going to have on our environment. The idea is quite simple: utilize geothermal systems while generating energy from the earth’s core, phasing out the activity of burning coal at super high temperatures to produce dangerous levels of greenhouse gases in our ozone layer.

If this simple but effective plan can be carried out carefully, our coal plants can be transformed into clean energy systems capable of operating in a symbiotic relationship with our environment

A new era or a colossal myth for energy generation?

Many giant nations of the world are pouring a chunk of their resources into developing this technology at scale. The benefits for humanity and our environment are just too immense for researchers to pass up. The emerging leader of the silent geothermal race will control the technology in the future.

If scaled globally, this technology could dramatically reduce carbon emissions, stabilize energy prices, and provide sustainable jobs for former coal regions. It could also help nations meet their climate targets without sacrificing energy reliability.

However, the road ahead isn’t without obstacles. Deep drilling is expensive and energy-intensive. Risks like induced seismicity and equipment failure at extreme depths must be managed. Most importantly, governments must create supportive policy frameworks and invest in early-stage projects to push this innovation forward.

The new beginning is upon humanity. After several years of iterating and testing, we have once again, as a species, unlocked a cleaner and more efficient way of generating energy. All of this was made possible by tapping into our planet’s core reserves after all these years.

Minnesotans are already seeing higher prices on electronics, groceries and a host of other product categories due to the Trump administration's sweeping import tariffs. Industry experts say electricity prices could follow.

""We believe that this is going to raise costs for all electricity consumers,"" said Michael Allen, co-founder and CEO of St. Paul-based All Energy Solar, which installs solar, battery and EV charging systems for residential and commercial customers.

On April 2, President Donald Trump announced tariffs on goods imported from nearly every country, including manufacturing powerhouses China, Vietnam and Mexico, with exemptions for hundreds of raw materials, manufacturing inputs and finished goods.

About a week later, following a stock market crash and blowback from the international business community, he dialed back duties on most countries to 10% while preserving the option to increase them again in 90 days and boosting tariffs above 100% on a range of goods produced in China.

Trump's broad tariffs added to preexisting duties on key materials and finished products used across the energy sector. In February, for example, Trump set a 25% levy on imported steel and aluminum in an executive order that name-checked Minnesota's iron ore industry. A similar tariff on copper -- a critical input for electrical equipment -- could follow soon. And U.S. tariffs on imported solar cells and lithium-ion batteries date back as far as the Obama administration.

""This is not the first road show we've seen come to town,"" Allen said. What's different about this go-round, he said, is the deep uncertainty of an on-again, off-again tariff framework where levies seem to change by the day.

""I have no idea what's going to happen, and no one else does either. We're all in limbo right now,"" Allen said, adding that pricing throughout the supply chain is much more volatile than usual.

It's not just local executives like Allen warning about a possible increase in energy costs -- and business uncertainty -- induced by the administration's unpredictable trade policy. So are energy supply chain experts.

""[T]he tariffs could lead to significant cost increases in the power industry supply chain. Uncertainty over tariff liabilities in complex supply chains, and over possible future changes in tariff rates, can also be a deterrent to investment,"" wrote Ed Crooks, vice chair of Americas for global consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which focuses on the energy industry, in an April 8 note that called the U.S. power industry ""one of the sectors that is most exposed to tariff impacts.""

The average final tariff on electrical equipment is now 38%, Crooks said. And suppliers face similar rates on other key power inputs, like the glass used in solar panels and steel used in piping.

Solar panel installers and other energy equipment buyers in Minnesota and across the United States are actively seeking U.S.-made alternatives to imported products, said Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of solar equipment manufacturer Heliene. Canada-based Heliene has two solar module factories in Minnesota and is considering opening a third production facility here.

Although suppliers don't have to pay tariffs on the products they make in the U.S., higher demand is combining with still-limited U.S. supplies to push prices higher across the board, Pochtaruk said.

""The price is going up whether the product is imported or local, due to the higher demand for local,"" he said.

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission sets rates charged by public electric and natural gas utilities like Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy. A utility can ask for permission to raise rates in a process known as a rate case, which the PUC says involves ""a comprehensive review of [its] investments and expenses"" to determine whether the proposed increase is ""necessary and reasonable.""

As a rate case proceeds, the utility can bill customers at a higher interim rate, subject to a refund of the difference if the case resolves at a rate lower than requested.

Minnesota law allows utilities to charge rates to recover costs needed ""to provide adequate, efficient, and reasonable service to ratepayers, including an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return"" on investment, the PUC says.

Utility rates apply not only to residential consumers but also to commercial and industrial consumers that may consume many times more power than a typical household. So if U.S. trade policy chills investment in energy-intensive industries, such as data centers, utilities may have fewer new customers to support planned or already-underway investments in new and existing infrastructure, said Brian Ross, vice president of renewable energy at the Great Plains Institute, a Minneapolis nonprofit focused on decarbonizing power, industry and transportation.

In an April earnings call, an executive with California utility PG&E said the company could actually reduce customer rates amid an influx of data center proposals, making explicit the connection between data center development and residential customers' bills.

Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and a lesser-known Colorado developer have announced plans to build massive data centers in the Twin Cities' exurbs, each expected to eventually consume enough power for tens or hundreds of thousands of homes.

That said, utility planning is a slow process, so Minnesota customers won't see immediate bill impacts due to data center demand or lack thereof, Ross said.

Tariffs could also raise prices -- and the risk of shortages -- by worsening preexisting supply constraints for transformers, gas turbines and other critical electrical equipment, Ross said. The average wait time for a new transformer increased from about one year in 2021 to more than two years in 2024, and orders for some larger transformers now take as long as four years to fill, Wood Mackenzie said last year.

Higher equipment prices and longer lead times will make it more difficult and expensive to build new power generation to serve growing demand for electricity from transportation, buildings and the new industrial facilities the Trump administration wants to attract to the U.S., All Energy Solar's Allen said. If you're a homeowner or business who believes energy will become more expensive amid future scarcity, it could make sense to lock in relatively low costs -- and reduce reliance on the electric grid -- by installing solar panels and perhaps batteries for onsite energy storage now, before the tariff impacts fully hit, he added.

""Our customers who already have solar are telling us, ""Whew, I'm really glad I made this decision,"""" Allen said.

With the administration unlikely to rethink its protectionist stance anytime soon, businesses across the energy supply chain may try to locate more production in the United States, especially if Congress preserves the clean energy manufacturing tax credits enacted during the Biden administration, Pochtaruk said.

But for more complicated factories, that could take years. Pochtaruk contrasted the eight-to-nine-month build time for a new solar module plant like the ones Heliene runs in Rogers and Mountain Iron with the roughly two-year development window for a new solar cell factory, which he said involves a ""wet chemical process"" in a super-clean manufacturing environment.

In December, Heliene paused plans to build what would be one of the United States' only solar cell plants, citing uncertainty around federal tax credits for clean energy manufacturing. The company has done a significant amount of early work on the project and could get the new facility up and running 18 months after deciding to move forward, Pochtaruk said.

Heliene is weighing two possible locations for the cell factory, one in North Carolina and the other in the Twin Cities metro. Heliene today employs about 340 people in Mountain Iron and about 220 in Rogers, he said.

Even for seemingly basic components like solar cells, tariffs play havoc with complex global supply chains. Though solar cell manufacturing involves a mix of imported and U.S.-made inputs, most are more expensive now in part because even domestic inputs may themselves require imported precursors, Pochtaruk said.

Likewise, All Energy Solar sources solar panel racks, power inverters and other types of equipment from U.S. manufacturers, but the complexities of global supply chains for energy equipment mean it's unlikely that the local industry will ever be able to source everything it needs within the United States, let alone Minnesota, Allen said. Even if trade barriers persist, it may cost less to make some low-margin inputs in lower-cost southeast Asian countries that already make them cheaply, he said.

While Minnesota's energy industry faces the same tariff-related uncertainty as other states for the moment, the state could protect itself in the longer run by leaning into emerging energy sectors like sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, produced from crops and other biomass, Ross said.

Minnesota lawmakers and business boosters seem to agree. A SAF producers' and buyers' consortium convened by the GREATER MSP Partnership in 2023 now includes heavyweights like Delta Air Lines and Airbus, and state lawmakers authorized a $1.50-per-gallon tax credit for Minnesota-made sustainable jet fuel last year. A few months later, DG Fuels announced plans to produce more than 190 million gallons of SAF annually in Moorhead by 2030.

However, one of the significant hurdles for widespread EV adoption is range anxiety, primarily driven by the time-consuming charging processes of traditional lithium-ion batteries. Recent breakthroughs in lithium-sulfur battery technology offer a promising solution, potentially revolutionizing the EV industry. These advancements could lead to faster charging times and longer vehicle ranges, paving the way for a more sustainable future.

Revolutionizing Battery Technology with Lithium-Sulfur

Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) represent a significant leap forward in energy storage technology. Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, LSBs utilize a sulfur cathode and a metallic lithium anode, promising a theoretical capacity up to ten times greater. This innovation comes with the potential to extend the range of electric vehicles significantly, thereby addressing the prevalent issue of range anxiety among consumers.

One of the standout features of LSBs is their ability to charge much faster than existing technologies. According to an international study led by researchers from Germany, India, and Taiwan, these batteries could potentially achieve full charges in as little as 12 minutes. This capability would not only enhance the convenience of owning an electric vehicle but also make EVs more appealing to a broader range of consumers.

Despite the promise of LSBs, their development faces several technical challenges. Sulfur’s poor conductivity requires innovative solutions to enhance performance, including mixing it with carbon-based materials to facilitate electron transport. Additionally, overcoming the shuttle effect, where lithium polysulfides migrate between electrodes, is crucial for maintaining battery stability over time.

Addressing Technical Challenges in Battery Design

The path to commercializing lithium-sulfur batteries is fraught with technical obstacles that researchers are keen to overcome. A significant challenge lies in preventing dendrite formation on the lithium metal anode, which can lead to short circuits and pose safety risks. To address this issue, researchers are experimenting with protective coatings and engineered lithium structures designed to inhibit dendrite growth.

Advancements in cathode design are also underway to enhance the performance of LSBs. By incorporating advanced carbon-based materials such as graphene, researchers aim to improve the transport of electrons and ions, which is critical for efficient battery operation. The use of catalytic materials, including metal oxides, is being explored to accelerate sulfur conversion reactions and mitigate the effects of the shuttle phenomenon.

Furthermore, innovations in battery components, such as improved separators and highly concentrated electrolytes, are essential for rapid ion exchange and polysulfide containment. These developments are integral to increasing the energy density and lifespan of lithium-sulfur batteries, bringing them closer to practical application in electric vehicles.

Harnessing Artificial Intelligence in Battery Development

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in the optimization of battery materials, significantly accelerating the development of lithium-sulfur technology. By leveraging AI, researchers can predict the most effective combinations of materials that balance energy density, stability, and charging speed. This approach has already yielded prototypes demonstrating promising energy densities at practical charging rates.

Dr. Mozaffar Abdollahifar, a lead researcher in the field, highlights the importance of AI in advancing battery technology. “Our analysis indicates that charging times under 30 minutes, and in some cases under 15 minutes, are realistic,” he notes. This optimism is backed by a collaborative research effort involving institutions from Germany, India, and Taiwan, supported by several international funding bodies.

The integration of AI in battery development not only expedites the research process but also enhances the precision of material selection, leading to more reliable and efficient batteries. As AI continues to evolve, its role in energy storage solutions is likely to expand, driving further innovations in the field.

Implications for the Future of Electric Vehicles

The potential impact of lithium-sulfur batteries on the electric vehicle market is profound. With the capability to charge rapidly and provide extended driving ranges, these batteries could significantly boost the adoption of EVs. This shift would not only contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also lessen the world’s reliance on fossil fuels.

As researchers continue to refine lithium-sulfur battery technology, the vision of a fully electrified transportation system becomes increasingly tangible. The advancements in battery technology could lead to a future where electric vehicles are the norm, supported by infrastructure that accommodates quick and efficient charging.

The future of electric mobility is bright, with lithium-sulfur batteries at the forefront of this transformation. Will these technological advancements be the catalyst that finally propels us into a sustainable, electrified future?

On a visit to Lossiemouth on the North Sea coast in Moray, the Chancellor described oil and gas as “incredibly important for the UK and our energy security”.

Her appearance in Scotland followed a five-day visit from the US president, who called on the UK Government to “incentivise the drillers, fast”.

Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social: “North Sea oil is a treasure chest for the United Kingdom.

“The taxes are so high, however, that it makes no sense.”

‘Unlock’

Asked whether she would “unlock” the “treasure chest”, Ms Reeves told the PA news agency: “Oil and gas are incredibly important for the UK and our energy security.

“And oil and gas is going to play an important role in our energy mix for decades to come.

“It’s why, alongside the private sector, we’re investing in carbon capture and storage, which is absolutely essential for supporting energy intensive industries.

“But it’s not either-or.

“At the same time, we’re investing in clean homegrown energy, including at Berwick Bank in Scotland, which will create thousands of new jobs and power millions of homes.

“And that’s what we need to do to make sure that our economy has this energy security that we need, that we bring down bills and bring more good jobs to Scotland.”

Berwick Bank in the North Sea has this week received a green light from the Scottish Government.

The proposed wind farm, off the coast of East Lothian, could add more than 4.1 gigawatts of capacity, which according to developer SSE Renewables is enough electricity to power more than six million homes annually.

‘Windmills’

But Mr Trump criticised existing wind farms during his visit, when he said: “When we go to Aberdeen, you’ll see some of the ugliest windmills you’ve ever seen, the height of a 50-storey building.”

Gesturing with his hands, he added: “You can take 1,000 times more energy out of a hole in the ground this big.”

Conservative shadow Scottish secretary Andrew Bowie has written to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calling for a review of policies affecting the oil and gas industry.

“As President Trump has said, the UK’s ‘very high’ tax on oil and gas companies is a deterrent to investment,” he wrote.

“The extension of the energy profits levy (EPL), coupled with uncertainty around future licensing and investment signals, has created a climate of instability that threatens jobs, innovation and the region’s economic resilience.

“President Donald Trump’s remarks during your visit – calling Aberdeen the ‘oil capital of Europe’ and urging the UK to ‘bring it back’ – reflect a sentiment shared by many in the region.

“May I urge you to consider the president’s call to ‘incentivise’ domestic production of hydrocarbons?

“Oil and gas still have a vital role to play in our energy mix and economic future; British people would rather see the UK benefit from domestic exploration and drilling than import more from Norway and Qatar.”

• Announced it would lay off all of the health research scientists at the EPA, laying off investigators who try to understand how toxic pollution affects the human body

• Seek to repeal its recognition of climate change as a threat to human health, potentially limiting the government’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases.

• Relaxed existing standards for mercury and lead pollution—two toxins that can lead to developmental problems in children.

• Postponed its implementation of new Biden-era regulations that were supposed to reduce the amount of dangerous chemicals Americans are exposed to

Meanwhile, House Republicans are attempting to grant widespread liability relief to pesticide companies and restrict EPA regulation of PFAS “forever chemicals” through provisions that have been tucked into the spending bills currently moving through Congress. (Democrats, for their part, have offered opposing legislation that would protect an individual’s right to sue over any harm from pesticides.)

This collective assault upon America’s environmental regulations targets not just the environment, but human health as well. Which means it sits oddly with the work of another Trump official whose office at the Department of Health and Human Services is just a 15-minute walk from EPA headquarters: Robert F. Kennedy Jr, whose Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement seeks to, obviously, make Americans healthier.

It’s fourth-generation innovation, the Superfluidized Inorganic Solid-State Electrolyte, reportedly promises functionality, applicability, and mass scalability, which could potentially shape the global energy sector.

Game-Changing Solid-State Technology

Uniquely, the groundbreaking electrolyte technology combines high ion concentrations in solids with interfacial contact properties found in liquids. Researchers say this combination addresses ionic conductivity, interfacial stability, and manufacturing efficiency, three hurdles that traditionally afflict solid-state batteries.

As a result, the new electrolyte delivers crucial advantages, including high conductivity, enhanced safety, fast charging, reliable low-temperature operation, and elimination of pressurized modules.

According to the scientists, the electrolyte system boasts a world-record ionic conductivity. SGS, a third-party testing firm, verified that the room-temperature ion conductivity reaches 57 mS/cm. Researchers say this figure is about five to six times higher than conventional numbers.

The “superior” conductivity produces fast-charging capabilities, boosting energy-dense batteries from 5% to 60-80% charge in about 4-6 minutes. Potentially, this technology could enhance electric vehicles and heavy electric transportation.

Furthermore, the technology withstands extremely cold environments. Even at -20°C, the system retains more conductivity than lithium-ion batteries, reportedly delivering 90-95% discharge efficiency for automotive purposes. Researchers say it “eliminates range anxiety for EV users in cold climates.”

The company says it is focusing on technological innovation and widespread adoption. It is advancing collaborative efforts that encompass technology licensing, strategic alliances, and regional manufacturing. The company wants to foster an end-to-end industrial deployment to hopefully accelerate the global transition to next-generation clean energy.",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/solid-state-temp-test.png,N,,2025-08-03 03:01:59.689816

“Balancing energy security and political realities will determine the pace and success of the EU's energy policies in the coming years,” Reuters energy columnist Ron Bousso points out.
This would be more than tripling the $76 billion worth of American energy imports into the EU in 2024.
The US is also the EU's top oil supplier (17% of all EU imports in 2024), and a key supplier of nuclear fuel and fuel services.
Cheap Chinese panels are helping with the solar capacity rollout, but they have put many European solar manufacturers out of business.","The European Union’s drive to replace Russian energy imports within two years, boost renewable energy rollout, and meet net-zero goals has put it in a position to become even more dependent on the two antagonistic global powers, the United States and China.

The EU trade deal with the U.S. and the EU's reliance on China-made solar PV panels, wafers, and critical battery metals are likely to keep shaping the pace of energy transition in the European Union, which remains firmly committed to decarbonizing economies and becoming a carbon-neutral bloc by 2050.

The new geopolitical realities in an increasingly protectionist world make the EU’s energy transition more dependent on trade and tariff policies by the U.S. and China.

In the goal to ditch all Russian energy by 2027, the EU is now more dependent on the United States than ever, while the target to accelerate renewable energy installations hinges on Chinese export policies for solar panel components and critical and rare earth elements.

“Balancing energy security and political realities will determine the pace and success of the EU's energy policies in the coming years,” Reuters energy columnist Ron Bousso points out.

The reality under U.S. President Donald Trump is that Europe pledged to buy a total of $750 billion of American energy in three years, or about $250 billion per year. This would be more than tripling the $76 billion worth of American energy imports into the EU in 2024.

A large part of the planned increase is expected to come from additional purchases of LNG from the United States.

“Purchases of US energy products will diversify our sources of supply and contribute to Europe's energy security,” the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said last week, commenting on the trade deal with the U.S., under which the American tariffs on most EU goods would be at 15%, half compared to the initially proposed 30%.

“We will replace Russian gas and oil with significant purchases of US LNG, oil and nuclear fuels.”

So far, so good.

But Europe is set to boost its reliance on U.S. LNG and pay higher prices for it, as soaring U.S. exports would drive U.S. benchmark prices higher, while competition for LNG supply with Asia will intensify.

Significantly higher EU purchases will need a significant increase in U.S. export capacity.

Even if all other planned or announced projects were approved today, they won’t make it on time for a significant rise in LNG exports to drastically boost EU imports within three years.

U.S. LNG exports are booming, but they won’t be anywhere close to helping the EU triple its imports of American energy, per the trade deal.

Europe, however, will become even more dependent on U.S. LNG.

Related: Trump Administration Expands Rare Earth Price Support Policy

The U.S. is already the EU’s top supplier of LNG, with 55% of LNG supply to the bloc from the U.S. so far in 2025, according to estimates by the European Commission.

The US is also the EU's top oil supplier (17% of all EU imports in 2024), and a key supplier of nuclear fuel and fuel services.

The Commission insists that the EU-U.S. trade deal “does not undermine EU’s determination to decarbonise” as a jump in LNG imports over the next three years “is fully compatible with our medium- and long-term policy to diversify our energy sources and to implement the REPowerEU Roadmap so that we fully phase out Russian energy imports as soon as possible.”

The pillar of the REPowerEU plan and net-zero goals is the acceleration of solar and wind energy capacity installations.

And here comes the Chinese dominance in solar power panels and other equipment. In 2023, China was the EU’s largest supplier of solar panels, accounting for a whopping 98% of all imports, per the latest Eurostat data.

Cheap Chinese panels are helping with the solar capacity rollout, but they have put many European solar manufacturers out of business.

China’s stronghold in critical minerals and rare earths is also a serious concern for Europe’s automotive and renewable energy sectors. Stephane Sejourne, European Commissioner for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy, has even called for the creation of a strategic EU rare earths reserve.

The goal was to help the wind and solar industry. They also dropped a surprise tax on parts from China. Lawmakers say this change will bring stability. It will keep investors and developers confident.

Overview

Subsidy Delay: Pushes back the end date of clean energy tax breaks.

Tax Removal: Scraps the excise tax on equipment from China.

Investor Boost: Offers more time for projects to start and finish.

Market Impact: Keeps supply chains moving and prices steady.

Delaying Subsidy Phase-Out

The original plan cut wind and solar credits in stages. It set strict deadlines. The amendment softens that pace. Now, developers get extra years of support. This gives them room to secure loans and sign contracts. It means fewer delays on big farms and panels. In turn, jobs stay steady and growth stays strong.

Project Type Original End Date New End Date Wind Dec 31, 2026 Dec 31, 2028 Solar Dec 31, 2025 Dec 31, 2027

Removing the China Excise Tax

The initial draft added a 10% excise tax on solar panels and turbines from China. It aimed to protect U.S. factories. But it would have raised costs for every project. Many developers warned it could slow new builds. So Republicans chose to drop that tax. They said the market should decide which parts to buy. This helps keep prices low and projects on track.

The Surprise Tax Mystery

No one claimed they wrote the excise tax rule. Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) said he first heard of it at lunch. “Leadership had not heard about it,” he noted. Other senators were just as shocked. The rule appeared in a late June draft. Then it vanished days later. This sudden move left many asking how and why it got there.

Political Reactions and Finger-Pointing

The tax caused a real stir. Renewable energy groups called it a “kill shot.” Senators raced to remove it. They blamed each other and outside voices. Here are some key theories:

A fossil fuel advocate pushed it to curb clean energy.

A China critic wanted to punish low-cost imports.

White House aides sought leverage in trade talks.

Yet none of these claims stuck. Groups like the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America said they did not write it. Fossil fuel backers denied it too. The real source remains unknown.

Behind the Scenes: Committee Staff

Staff on the Senate Finance Committee met for over a year. They worked with the Joint Committee on Taxation and legal counsel. They wanted a way to help U.S. factories. But with a tight July 4 deadline, they did not explain every change. That rush let the excise tax sneak in. Then, sensing the uproar, leaders yanked it out.

Industry Impact and Next Steps

These moves will affect many players. Developers will adjust timelines and budgets. Investors will recalculate returns and risks. Suppliers here and abroad will watch orders closely. Next, the Senate will debate the amendment. If it passes, the House must agree. Then projects can move forward with clear rules and stable costs.

Key Takeaways

Extended Support: Wind and solar get more time on tax credits.

Open Supply Chains: No extra tax on foreign parts keeps costs steady.

Staff-Driven Change: Committee aides shaped policy under time pressure.

Unknown Origin: The excise tax idea still has no clear author.

Future Votes: Both chambers must pass the amendment to lock it in.

Conclusion

By slowing subsidy cuts and dropping the China tax, Senate Republicans aim to keep clean energy on track. They want to balance growth, jobs, and budgets. Still, the mystery of who wrote that excise tax lingers. In Washington, the answers may come slowly. But for now, the wind and sun get a brighter path forward.",https://microgridmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shutterstock_2543144643-1-scaled-e1747125118244.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 20:00:11.762318

The waivers were also the basis for California’s nation-leading plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and transition to electric vehicles.
According to the EPA, that $1-trillion savings would come from rescinding vehicle regulations built upon the endangerment finding.
With California’s rules repealed, “you end up with fewer EVs, more gasoline cars, more demand for gas and higher gas prices,” he said.
But major U.S. automakers such as GM and Ford have already committed to an electric future — as have international competitors such as China, which is investing heavily in electric vehicles.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s recent proposal to repeal its own 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health marks a major U-turn for the nation’s climate progress. While it’s impact will be felt nationwide, the plan takes direct aim at California.

In supporting documents released in the wake of Tuesday’s proposal, the nation’s top environmental agency outlined the justifications for its plan to rescind the so-called endangerment finding and roll back its longstanding regulations for planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from all motor vehicles, including cars and trucks.

“As a result of these proposed changes, engine and vehicle manufacturers would no longer have any future obligations for the measurement, control, and reporting of (greenhouse gas) emissions for any highway engine and vehicle,” the agency wrote in its rule summary.

But the documents, including an 80-page notice of proposed rulemaking and 60-page draft regulatory impact analysis, also contain several nods to California policies, referencing the state by name 27 times — by far more than any other state.

That’s largely because for more than 50 years, California has been granted unique authority from the EPA to set stricter tailpipe emissions than those mandated by the federal government.

This authority, obtained through waivers issued by the EPA, has been critical to the state’s efforts to address its notorious smog and air quality issues, which are driven partly by transportation emissions and by California’s unique topography that traps pollutants in its interior basins. The waivers were also the basis for California’s nation-leading plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and transition to electric vehicles.

The EPA’s documents repeatedly state that California’s waivers have officially been repealed. As of publication, however, the Trump administration’s unprecedented effort to do so in June is still winding its way through the court system following a lawsuit from the state.

Notably, the EPA’s own analysis of the possible outcomes of its proposal indicate that without California’s leadership — and without the tax credits created under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act — national adoption of electric vehicles will decline. At the same time, gasoline prices will increase because of the higher demand from more gas-powered vehicles on the road.

“They don’t seem to have put together that strong of a case,” said Chris Busch, director of transportation and a senior economist with Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, who reviewed the analysis. “What this shows is that the net impact is less favorable when you reduce the California (Advanced Clean Trucks rule), when you take away the California waivers and remove the IRA credits.”

In a statement this week, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said repealing the endangerment finding would have economic benefits for the American people. “If finalized, rescinding the Endangerment Finding and resulting regulations would end $1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families,” Zeldin said.

According to the EPA, that $1-trillion savings would come from rescinding vehicle regulations built upon the endangerment finding. That includes the Biden administration’s electric vehicles sales target, which the agency refers to as an “EV mandate.”

The EPA also said removing the endangerment finding would save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of greenhouse gas standards.

Busch said he could not readily see how the agency arrived at that figure based on the analysis provided. With California’s rules repealed, “you end up with fewer EVs, more gasoline cars, more demand for gas and higher gas prices,” he said.

The EPA also argues that electric vehicles are sucking up energy that could be better used elsewhere — “from factories to data-center servers to air-conditioning.” It uses California as an example of this perceived misappropriation of electricity, pointing to a 2022 memo from the California Independent System operator that urged people to reduce energy use, including EV charging, during a record-breaking heat wave.

The EPA’s announcement stunned many members of the environmental community who condemned it as a dangerous abdication of the agency’s mission to protect human health and the environment. Among the agency’s many claims are that no technology currently exists to reduce greenhouse gases enough to measurably affect global climate change concerns without risking greater harm to public health and welfare, such as increased vehicle prices.

But major U.S. automakers such as GM and Ford have already committed to an electric future — as have international competitors such as China, which is investing heavily in electric vehicles. According to the California Energy Commission, about 22% of new vehicles sales in the state in the second quarter of this year were zero-emission vehicles.

“Despite Trump’s full-on attack, Californians are choosing the clean simplicity of ZEVs,” read a statement from CEC Commissioner Nancy Skinner. “Make no mistake: California is not backing down from its ZEV goals. We will continue to heavily invest in accessible and reliable ZEV infrastructure, making the ZEV driving experience better each day.”

Busch said California has several tools at its disposal to defend itself and preserve its clean vehicle progress.

In the heavy-duty space, the California Air Resources Board already has the Clean Truck Partnership— an agreement with nearly all truck manufacturers in the state to meet advanced emissions reduction targets. The state’s heavy vehicle incentive program also provides funding opportunities for fleet owners to replace older heavy-duty diesel vehicles with zero-emission ones.

There are also legislative possibilities, such as Assembly Bill 914, which would give CARB more authority to regulate indirect sources of pollution such as warehouses. One way those warehouses could meet those rules would be by increasing their electric truck fleets, Busch said.

CARB also employs a clean-mile standard for transportation companies such as Uber and Lyft, which will see them gradually increase their zero-emission miles, and a similar tactic could be employed for the freight sector, he said.

“States have a lot of options still,” Busch said. “There is a lot of momentum.”

In a statement this week, CARB chair Liane Randolph described the EPA’s proposals as “the latest moves from this feckless federal government that choose polluter fantasyland over proven science.”

“Meanwhile, back on Earth, the planet continues to suffer from the consequences of unchecked carbon pollution as heatwaves, floods and wildfires threaten increasingly uninsurable communities everywhere,” Randolph said. “Unlike this negligent administration, California won’t turn our backs on what is happening right before our eyes. We choose reality, science and innovation — and we know we are not the only ones.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/MSaJlqNVKYqSsEniCVkl54uXSXY=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/08/02/682f7d2a80e3a.hires.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 20:59:04.889242

Successfully repealing the endangerment finding is a gamble for Trump, but Americans — including everyone in Hampton Roads — will pay the price if he’s successful.","The Trump administration stuck its head firmly in the sand this week about the scientific reality of climate change, dragging every American face-first into the dirt with them. Negating the federal government’s legal basis for regulating greenhouse emissions, as the White House said it would seek to do, is to ignore the reality plainly evident in every corner of this nation.

The United States recorded 27 billion-dollar natural disasters last year and the thread that connects them is a climate destabilized by the byproducts of fossil fuel consumption. Addressing climate change is a fight for the very existence of coastal communities such as Hampton Roads. President Donald Trump would have us wage it with both hands tied behind our back.

In 2007, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts v Environmental Protection Agency concluded the EPA had a legal requirement under the Clean Air Act to address greenhouse emissions since they, as air pollutants, harm public health. Two years later, the agency issued what is known as its “endangerment finding,” which allowed the EPA to impose regulations on “motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet,” according to the Associated Press.

The regulatory framework has been a constant target by industry groups and anti-climate activists, who have filed more than 100 lawsuits in a futile effort to overturn it. The Supreme Court declined to review its 2007 ruling when given the opportunity in 2023, and legal experts speaking to The New York Times earlier this year cast doubt on efforts to overturn the EPA’s finding.

That hasn’t stopped the Trump White House from trying. This week, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to withdraw the finding, akin to pulling out the agency’s teeth. He crowed on a podcast that “repealing (the endangerment finding) will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America” and lamented it “cost Americans a lot of money.”

As Zeldin spoke Tuesday about the decision on Fox News, a small graphic in the corner of the screen noted that some 161 million Americans, or nearly half the country, were at risk that day due to extreme heat. Zeldin made his announcement only weeks after an unprecedented rainstorm caused flash flooding in Texas that killed at least 138 people, and months after wildfires in Los Angeles killed 30 people. Those fires inflicted damage that could reach $250 billion, if Zeldin is worried about things that cost Americans a lot of money.

In fact, the proliferation of extreme weather events is our reality now, and it’s one that Hampton Roads residents know all too well.

We see coastal flooding becoming more frequent, more invasive and more destructive with each passing year, even on sunny days. We watch the tropics during hurricane season, and cannot help but notice the storms’ rapid intensification in recent years. We know that sea levels are rising and understand the danger they pose to the region’s future.

None of that means squat to the president and his administration of climate change deniers. Trump has claimed this is all a Chinese hoax rather than a scientific reality and, in his first term, withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Accord. But that pales in comparison to the all-out assault on climate regulations — and the overwhelming evidence and data that underpins them — he’s undertaken upon returning to the White House.

Since taking office in January, Trump has radically and recklessly downsized the EPA; made cuts to other agencies working on climate issues, including the National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and NASA; and canceled the National Climate Assessment (which is mandated by Congress).

All of these hamstring efforts to curb greenhouse emissions and guard against a future of extreme weather that will cause more death and destruction to our communities.

Renewable Energy: Clear Fork Solar and the Future of Power Demand Enbridge's diversification into renewables is another key component of its strategy.
For instance, the Flanagan South pipeline's oversubscribed open season—connecting Illinois to Cushing—demonstrates the robust demand for Enbridge's infrastructure.
By leveraging surging power and gas demand through optimized infrastructure, strategic expansions, and a balanced approach to decarbonization, the company is delivering consistent, high-margin returns.
For investors seeking exposure to North America's evolving energy landscape, Enbridge offers a rare combination of stability, growth potential, and strategic foresight.","In an energy landscape marked by volatility, shifting regulatory priorities, and surging demand for both fossil fuels and renewables, Enbridge (ENB) stands out as a masterclass in strategic infrastructure development. With North America's energy systems at a crossroads—balancing decarbonization goals with the realities of a still-oil-dependent economy—the Canadian energy giant is uniquely positioned to capitalize on its dual expertise in traditional hydrocarbon transportation and emerging clean energy projects. This article explores how Enbridge is leveraging surging power and gas demand to deliver consistent, high-margin returns while navigating the evolving energy transition.

The Backbone of Oil Sands Transportation: Mainline Optimization

Enbridge's crown jewel, the Mainline system, remains the largest crude oil pipeline in North America, currently operating at 3 million barrels per day (bpd). By 2027, the company plans to add 150,000 bpd of capacity through a $1.5 billion optimization project. Two-thirds of this new capacity will flow the full path from Edmonton to the Houston refining complex—a critical link for oil sands producers who have long struggled with transportation bottlenecks.

This expansion is not just about volume but also about margin resilience. With oil sands production expected to grow by 1 million bpd by 2035, Enbridge's ability to secure long-term contracts with producers ensures stable cash flows. The project's high return profile—supported by cost-competitive infrastructure and low incremental capital expenditures—positions it as a cornerstone of Enbridge's growth strategy.

Gas Storage and LNG: A Dual-Track Strategy for Energy Transition

While oil sands transportation remains a pillar of Enbridge's business, the company is also doubling down on gas infrastructure to meet the growing demand for cleaner-burning fuels. In British Columbia, the 40 Bcf expansion of the Aitken Creek gas storage facility is a strategic move to support the LNG value chain. This project, paired with the Aspen Point Program's 535 MMcf/d capacity boost, ensures Enbridge can meet the needs of both domestic and international LNG markets.

The Woodfibre LNG project in BC further underscores Enbridge's commitment to this segment. By providing a sustainable source of Canadian natural gas to global markets, the company is aligning with global decarbonization trends while maintaining profitability. Gas storage and LNG infrastructure are inherently high-margin, with long-term contracts and minimal operational variability, making them ideal for generating stable returns in a volatile energy environment.

Renewable Energy: Clear Fork Solar and the Future of Power Demand

Enbridge's diversification into renewables is another key component of its strategy. The Clear Fork Solar project, a 600 MW, $900 million development, is a prime example. This project, backed by a long-term offtake agreement with Meta, taps into the surging demand for clean energy from data centers and industrial clients. With corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) growing rapidly, Enbridge is leveraging its infrastructure expertise to enter the renewable energy market without overextending its balance sheet.

The Traverse Pipeline's upsizing from 1.75 to 2.5 Bcf/d is another strategic move, driven by strong market demand for natural gas in power generation. This bidirectional pipeline between Katy and Agua Dulce in the Gulf Coast allows Enbridge to respond dynamically to price differentials, enhancing margins through optimized throughput.

Financial Strength and Growth Backlog: A Foundation for Resilience

Enbridge's financial discipline is the linchpin of its success. As of Q2 2025, the company reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 billion, a 7% year-over-year increase, and a Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.7x, leaving ample room for further investment. Its $32 billion growth backlog, including projects like the Flanagan South pipeline and Texas Eastern Transmission expansion, ensures a steady pipeline of returns.

The company's ability to outmaneuver competitors like TC Energy and Pembina Pipeline lies in its focus on high-impact, low-risk projects. For instance, the Flanagan South pipeline's oversubscribed open season—connecting Illinois to Cushing—demonstrates the robust demand for Enbridge's infrastructure. By reconfiguring existing assets (e.g., the Southern Illinois Connector in partnership with Energy Transfer LP), the company is minimizing capital outlays while maximizing capacity.

Investment Implications and Strategic Outlook

For investors, Enbridge's current trajectory presents a compelling case. The company's diversified portfolio—spanning oil sands transportation, gas storage, LNG, and renewables—provides a buffer against sector-specific volatility. Its financial strength, coupled with a growth backlog that spans both traditional and emerging energy markets, ensures long-term cash flow visibility.

Key risks include regulatory headwinds, particularly for LNG projects, and potential delays in renewable energy permitting. However, Enbridge's track record of navigating complex regulatory environments and its strategic partnerships (e.g., the Calvados Offshore Wind Project in France) mitigate these concerns.

Conclusion: A High-Margin Infrastructure Play for the Energy Transition Era

Enbridge is not just adapting to the energy transition—it is shaping it. By leveraging surging power and gas demand through optimized infrastructure, strategic expansions, and a balanced approach to decarbonization, the company is delivering consistent, high-margin returns. For investors seeking exposure to North America's evolving energy landscape, Enbridge offers a rare combination of stability, growth potential, and strategic foresight.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 19:02:20.904137

The Novokuibyshevsk plant in the Samara region and the Ryazan refinery were hit, the Ukrainian General Staff said in a Saturday Facebook post. Ukrainian drones also struck a fuel depot in Russia’s Voronezh region and an electronics facility in Penza, it said. All the targets were part of Russia’s war apparatus, the military said.

The Ukrainian state security service said its long-range drones also attacked a military airbase in the Krasnodar region in Russia’s southwest, where storage and launch sites of Shahed drones were hit.

It wasn’t possible to independently verify the claims. Rosneft PJSC, owner of the Ryazan and Novokuibyshevsk refineries, didn’t immediately reply to a WhatsApp message seeking comment on Saturday.

Ukrainian authorities said that at least 31 people were killed in a combined drone and missile barrage on Kyiv on Thursday that lasted for several hours. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said another 159 people were injured, including 16 children, in one of the deadliest strikes on Kyiv for the war to date.

Samara regional Governor Vyacheslav Fedorischev said in social media posts that an industrial facility had been attacked and that one man had been killed by falling drone fragments. Ryazan regional Governor Pavel Malkov said on Telegram that debris from a unmanned aerial vehicle had fallen on the premises of an enterprise, without providing more detail. Three people were killed in the various incidents, Russian officials said.

With the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine almost halfway through its fourth year, Kyiv’s forces have repeatedly targeted energy infrastructure, including some Rosneft facilities, in a move to curtail Russia’s ability to send fuel to the front line and limit Moscow’s revenue from oil sales.

The Ryazan refinery, about 120 miles (193 km) southeast of Moscow, is one of the largest in Russia and has a design processing capacity of about 340,000 barrels of crude a day. The Novokuibyshevsk plant has a design processing capacity of over 177,000 barrels a day and the two facilities account for less than a tenth of Russia’s total refinery capacity.

Separately, explosions damaged a gas pipeline that carries fuel from Turkmenistan in Central Asia to Russia’s Volgograd region, said a Ukrainian military official who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive issues. The damaged segment carries fuel to Russian military plants, the official said. Bloomberg cannot independently verify the claim.

What’s in the New Legislation?

As with any large piece of legislation, there’s a bit of complexity attached to the elimination of wind and solar subsidies in the OBBB. Thanks to negotiation from some Republican senators, tax incentives will remain for companies that start construction on projects by July 4, 2026, and that place them in service by the end of 2027.

However, as Norton Rose Fulbright points out, even this provision has been muddied by proclamations from the Trump administration. An executive order issued by President Trump just three days after the legislation was signed directs the Treasury Department to issue “new and revised guidance” within 45 days “restricting the use of broad safe harbors [to treat projects as under construction] unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

This confusion prompted Ryan Sweezey, director of North America power and renewables at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, to say, “I would characterize this as a high degree of volatility expected over the next year. I mean, the policy situation is still not clear.”

For renewable energy companies, this means they are being prompted to rush new projects while at the same time being uncertain if they will actually receive the tax incentives they seek. This type of stalemate puts renewables in a state of limbo for the time being, which isn’t good for business.

It seems unlikely that Trump will backpedal on his campaign against renewables, as he called wind and solar energy “a blight” on the country during a Cabinet meeting, according to NPR. “They hurt our country very badly,” he said. “And smart countries don’t use it.”

How Will the Legislation Affect Energy Prices?

The bottom line is that even a reduction in subsidies and incentives for the renewable energy market — let alone an elimination — will drive up energy prices across the country. According to NPR, energy demand is likely to increase significantly over the next few years, and renewable energy plants were being counted on to produce relatively cheap energy for new data centers and factories.

Energy Innovation predicts that national energy rates will increase for consumers by an average of 9% to 18% by 2035. On a wholesale basis, prices are expected to rise 25% by 2030 and a whopping 74% by 2035. Additionally, it will cost the U.S. economy thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in planned investment.

Which States Are Most Vulnerable, and Why?

The states hardest-hit by the new legislation may dream of a 10-year increase of “only” 9% to 18% in energy costs. This is because some states rely completely on the federal government for renewable energy development. According to Dan O’Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, the firm anticipates that costs will rise the most in these four states:

Oklahoma

Kentucky

Missouri

Kansas

In Oklahoma, rates are expected to skyrocket by between 60% and 350% by 2035. Kentucky, Missouri and Kansas are projected to see rate increases of at least 48%, 39% and 30% over the next decade, respectively.

When factoring in job losses in addition to energy price increases, Energy Innovation sees these five states as the biggest losers:

South Carolina

Florida

Texas

Kentucky

North Carolina

All of these states in both lists are predominantly Republican-led, from a Congressional standpoint. Energy Innovation says that costs will rise the most in these “red” states because they have no state-led renewable programs. This means they will have to rely on more expensive forms of energy as wind and solar industries shrink and subsidies vanish.

Investing.com - August could prove to be a critical month for renewable energy companies, as the industry awaits revised guidance from the Treasury Department on tax credit eligibility.

President Donald Trump has directed the department to enforce the phasing out of tax breaks for wind and solar projects -- a key provision of his sprawling fiscal policy bill signed into law on July 4.

In particular, the Treasury Department was told in an executive order from Trump to submit a report detailing the actions it has taken. The update is due to be submitted by August 18.

Trump has argued that renewable energy resources are expensive, unreliable and displace more ""dispatchable"" energy sources. He has also claimed that many were threatening national security by being heavily reliant on foreign supply chains.

Power industry representatives, on the other hand, have argued that new generation projects are needed to help meet rising U.S. demand. Citing consulting firm ICF, Reuters has reported that U.S. electricity demand is anticipated to grow by 25% by 2030, due largely to an ongoing artificial intelligence boom and cloud computing.

The tax-cuts and spending package, which was passed by Congressional Republicans earlier this summer after weeks of internal wrangling, would gradually slash tax incentives for renewable projects that begin construction after 2026. Previously, developers would have been able to claim a tax credit of 30% through 2032.

In effect, it requires projects to start construction within a year or begin service by the end of 2027 in order to qualify for the credits. New developers have, in response, started racing to get projects off the ground.

But the Treasury Department’s review could change that, especially because Trump ordered it to assess the definition of ""beginning of construction."" A revision could see the end of a rule granting developers four years to claim tax credits after spending 5% of the project’s costs, analysts at Bernstein warned.

""If Treasury materially increases the minimum construction amount or decreases the safe harbor window, it could negatively impact the massive pull forward of projects over the next 12 months,"" they wore in a note.

With these worries in mind, Bernstein downgraded its rating of Houston-based Quanta Services (NYSE:PWR), a provider of infrastructure services for the power industry, to ""market perform"" from ""outperform.""

The ruling — which is almost certain to add further delays to the remediation effort — came just days after officials in New Haven announced ambitious plans to tear down the dilapidated plant and develop the site into a waterfront park complete with walking trails and a public pool.

“While this is not the only dispute that has interfered with the remediation of the English Station site, originally contemplated to have been completed years ago, the parties’ dispute over the applicable cleanup standard inside the buildings is a significant impediment to completing that project,” Superior Court Judge John B. Farley wrote in his decision.

United Illuminating operated the plant for more than a half century, burning coal and later oil to produce electricity for its customers, before the plant was finally powered down in 1992. During its run, the site became heavily contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, resulting in a complex and costly remediation effort.

Over the years, the plant fell into disrepair and was subject to vandalism and thefts of leftover metal. As part of a deal with regulators to approve UI’s merger with Spanish utility giant Iberdrola in 2015, the company agreed to spend $30 million to clean up the site.

That agreement, however, quickly became subject to a dispute over the standard to which the property should be cleared of contaminants and made ready for development.

The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, led by Commissioner Katie Dykes, argued that the consent decree signed by both parties required UI to remediate PCB levels in the plant building to below 1 part per million, which would allow for a wider range of future uses, such as housing, businesses or recreation. Utility officials balked, arguing that doing so would require the complete demolition of the building — something they had not agreed to do during negotiations over the agreement.

Last year, Dykes issued a ruling requiring UI to abide by the higher remediation standard. UI promptly sued, arguing that Dykes had overstepped her authority and misconstrued the language in the consent decree to suit the state’s desire for a more robust cleanup.

In his decision on Thursday, however, Judge Farley opted not to side with either party’s interpretation of the consent decree, which he said was ambiguous as to the required level of cleanup.

Instead, Farley remanded the case back to DEEP for further proceedings. At the same time, he found that Dykes had not abused her authority by issuing a declaratory ruling, thus allowing her to make further decisions regarding the consent decree.

In a statement Friday, United Illuminating spokesperson Sarah Wall Fliotsos said the company appreciated the decision to sustain their appeal and send the case back to DEEP.

“In this case, DEEP wrongfully changed the standard for clean-up that was agreed upon nearly a decade ago,” Fliotsos said. “It is clear DEEP was wrong to try to enforce a standard that was not part of the original agreement, and they are wrong to continue to blame UI for delays.”

“Ultimately, clean-up of this site cannot be achieved without clarity on the standard we are working towards,” she added. “As this issue is remanded for further proceedings, we hope to be able to work in good faith with state officials to chart a clear path forward for UI’s role in the future of English Station.”

DEEP officials referred comment to Attorney General William Tong’s office, which represented the agency in the lawsuit. Tong told the CT Mirror on Friday that his office is still reviewing the judge’s decision and its impact on the cleanup process.

“We’re gonna keep fighting,” Tong said. “UI owes whatever it takes to remediate English Station, and I’m never going to come off that position.”

A spokesman for New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker said Thursday that the ruling would not impact the city’s plans to move ahead with the proposed redevelopment of English Station.

“As the City advances its proposal for Mill River Park, it’s critical that UI stop dragging its feet and complete the remediation of English Station so that this land can finally be put to good public use, and we’re confident the Attorney General and CT DEEP will continue to hold UI accountable for its longstanding failure to clean up this site,” the spokesman, Lenny Speiller, said in a statement.

“We hope the City’s proposal and intended use of the site brings a new focus and urgency on what needs to be done to help make this vision a reality,” he added.

The city’s proposal is part of a larger plan to redevelop former industrial areas along the Mill River, which surrounds the small island on which the power plant sits.

In order to make the land safe for walking, playing and swimming, the site would have to be cleaned to the 1 ppm level being sought by DEEP, Speiller said. Even then, the city has estimated it will cost at least another $25 million to develop its park proposal.

“After bearing the costs of industrial pollution and blight from the English Station power plant for decades, our community deserves a true treasure in its place,” Elicker said in his announcement of the city’s plans on Monday. “By replacing it with a new waterfront public park and recreation area, we will transform this site into an amazing public asset that will benefit our residents, improve our environment and strengthen our community for generations to come.”

Beyond the initial cleanup, however, other hurdles exist that could complicate the city’s plans.

New Haven still has to acquire the English Station property, which has changed hands several times over the last two decades. On Monday, city officials sent letters to the current owners of the island expressing their desire to “negotiate a fair purchase price” for the property. If the owners do not respond, Speiller said, the city will consider using eminent domain to acquire the property.

The owners are a pair of limited liability corporations tied to three people — George Goldstein, Esther Schiller and David Tropper — with business addresses listed in Brooklyn, Queens and Israel.

When reached for comment earlier this week, Goldstein at first denied being one of the owners of English Station before saying he had received the city’s letter and was reviewing it. “I have to get back to you on that,” Goldstein said when asked if he was interested in selling the property.

Schiller and Tropper could not be reached for comment. Goldstein hung up after being reached for comment a second time on Friday.

Local advocates have also questioned the need to tear down the hulking, brick-clad structure of English Station, which many argue carries historic and aesthetic significance to the city.

Anstress Farwell, the president of the New Haven Urban Design League, said this week that she supported the city’s efforts to take control of the power plant property, though she called its plans to raze the remaining buildings “premature” until further studies can be done to determine whether they are salvageable.

“In all of my talks with the city, it’s been about ‘the building is an asset,'” Farwell said. “It’s 110,000 square feet that city officials have said that they could never rebuild on the site but could use if it could be renovated.”

Nor did Thursday’s ruling put an end to the state’s ongoing legal battle against UI over English Station.

Tong filed a separate lawsuit last year, accusing the utility of failing to uphold its agreement to spend $30 million on the remediation effort. In response, UI officials have argued that the company has already spent millions toward the remediation of the site, including removal of asbestos, but that its efforts have been hampered by the ongoing dispute with DEEP.

That case is also assigned to Judge Farley, who issued a separate ruling on Thursday dismissing four out of the five defenses that the utility had raised. That case is currently set for trial in October 2026.

Lastly, there is the case involving the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s decision in 2023 to begin fining United Illuminating $2 million a year over what regulators called a failure to abide by the utility’s agreement to remediate English Station. Earlier this year, a judge upheld the legality of that penalty — a decision that the utility is appealing.

But a quieter, more strategic revolution is unfolding in Florida—a state that has quietly become the third-largest solar market in the nation. With 20,065 megawatts (MW) of installed solar capacity as of 2025, Florida is powering over 2.35 million homes while creating 14,108 solar-related jobs and attracting $28.2 billion in investment since the solar boom began. This surge positions Florida as a critical under-the-radar opportunity in the Sun Belt's renewable energy renaissance, driven by policy tailwinds, utility innovation, and a growing appetite for energy independence.

The Policy-Driven Catalyst: IRA Tax Credits and Utility Ambition

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been the linchpin of Florida's solar ascent. By extending a 30% tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through 2025, the federal legislation has slashed upfront costs for developers and homeowners alike. For Florida, a state with high electricity bills and abundant sunshine, the IRA's incentives have been transformative. Solar panel prices have fallen 42% over the past decade, and the 30% credit now makes installations cost-competitive with traditional energy in many regions.

Meanwhile, Florida Power and Light (FPL), the state's largest utility, has emerged as a key player. Its 10-year site plan includes expanding energy storage capacity to 4 gigawatts by 2033—nearly 90% of Florida's current total storage capacity. FPL's investments in solar-plus-storage systems are not just about growth; they're about resilience. With hurricane season a constant threat, battery storage ensures grid reliability during outages, a value proposition that's hard to ignore.

NextEra Energy (NEE), the parent company of FPL, has seen its stock reflect the utility's aggressive clean energy strategy. Since 2022, NEE has gained over 40% as solar and storage investments outperformed expectations. For investors, this underscores the importance of aligning with utilities that are doubling down on renewables in high-growth markets.

Market Dynamics: A Solar Ecosystem in Motion

Florida's solar ecosystem is robust and diverse. The state hosts 447 solar companies, including 57 manufacturers and 225 installers/developers. This infrastructure, combined with falling equipment costs, has made solar accessible to a broader demographic. The Florida Solar Energy Center and the Public Service Commission have further supported this momentum through rebates and streamlined permitting processes.

Yet Florida's success is not without its quirks. Unlike states such as California or New York, Florida lacks a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) or power purchase agreement (PPA) authorization. Instead, its growth has been fueled by market demand and federal incentives. This creates both opportunities and risks. The absence of state-level mandates means Florida's solar industry is more vulnerable to federal policy shifts, such as the recent House budget reconciliation bill, which threatens to eliminate residential tax credits by 2026.

Challenges on the Horizon: Policy Uncertainty and Trade Pressures

The May 2025 House budget reconciliation bill has cast a shadow over Florida's solar future. If the proposed phaseout of residential tax credits takes effect, it could stifle demand for rooftop solar installations, a segment that has driven much of the state's recent growth. Similarly, restrictions on commercial incentives could slow utility-scale projects. The bill has already caused $1.4 billion in clean energy projects to be canceled this year, with solar stock values dipping in response.

Compounding these challenges are rising trade tariffs on solar equipment from Canada, Mexico, and other countries. These tariffs have increased production costs by 8-12% for developers, squeezing margins at a time when falling panel prices were supposed to make solar the cheapest energy source. For Florida, where 90% of solar components are imported, this is a critical vulnerability.

Investment Thesis: Positioning for Resilience and Growth

Despite these headwinds, Florida remains a compelling long-term bet for investors. The state is projected to add 13,261 MW of solar capacity over the next five years, ranking fifth in the U.S. for future growth. Here's how to position for it:

Utility Stocks with Solar Exposure: NextEra Energy (NEE) and Duke Energy (DUK) are well-positioned to benefit from Florida's grid modernization and storage expansion. Both have strong balance sheets and clear solar growth trajectories.

Solar Equipment Manufacturers: Companies like Enphase Energy (ENPH) and SunPower (SPWR) could see increased demand for residential and commercial solar systems in Florida, provided tax credits remain intact.

Storage Focused Firms: As Florida prioritizes grid resilience, investments in battery technology (e.g., Tesla's Megapack, SimpliSafe Solar) will become increasingly valuable.

Policy Advocacy Plays: The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and state-level lobbying groups are key to maintaining favorable conditions. Supporting their efforts could mitigate policy risks.

The Road Ahead: A Test of Policy and Vision

Florida's solar story is a microcosm of the broader U.S. energy transition. It demonstrates how federal incentives, utility innovation, and market demand can converge to create a thriving renewable energy sector—even in the absence of state-level mandates. However, the coming months will test whether policymakers can protect this progress from short-sighted budget cuts.

For investors, the lesson is clear: Florida's solar surge is not a flash in the pan. It's a calculated, policy-driven growth story that reflects the Sun Belt's broader potential. The risks are real, but so are the rewards. In a world increasingly defined by energy independence and climate resilience, Florida's quiet revolution may well become the blueprint for America's next energy frontier.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 20:59:45.238929

Conclusion IDACORP's Q2 2025 results may lack the fireworks of a tech breakout, but they reflect the hallmarks of a utility company executing its long-term strategy with precision.","IDACORP (IDA) has long been a bellwether for utility sector resilience, and its Q2 2025 earnings report reaffirms its position as a disciplined operator navigating the dual pressures of rising costs and decarbonization. While the stock's muted post-earnings reaction reflects the utility's stable but unexciting performance, a closer look at its strategic capital allocation, regulatory agility, and long-term energy transition plans suggests the company is well-positioned to deliver consistent returns in a sector increasingly defined by infrastructure investment and climate-driven innovation.

Stable Earnings Amid Rising Costs

IDACORP's Q2 2025 results were a mixed bag. GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.76 fell short of the $1.78 Street target, dragged down by a 2.9% year-over-year decline in revenue. However, net income rose 7% to $95.8 million, driven by a 2.5% customer growth rate, higher electricity usage (particularly for irrigation), and the implementation of 2025 base rate increases. The company's ability to maintain a 21% profit margin—up from 20% in Q2 2024—despite inflationary pressures on labor, wildfire mitigation, and depreciation costs underscores its operational discipline.

The use of accumulated deferred investment tax credits (ADITC) and regulatory mechanisms like power cost adjustments allowed IDACORP to smooth earnings volatility. For instance, leveraging $17.2 million in ADITC in Q2 2025 (versus $7.5 million in 2024) provided a buffer against rising interest expenses. This strategic use of regulatory tools, combined with a debt-to-equity capital structure (50:50 target), positions the company to manage its $1.0–$1.1 billion annual capital expenditure plan without overleveraging.

Capital Allocation: A Bridge to 2045

IDACORP's long-term value proposition lies in its clean energy transition. The company's Boardman-to-Hemingway 500 kV transmission line project, along with its new battery storage facility, exemplifies its commitment to modernizing infrastructure for renewable integration. These initiatives align with its 2045 net-zero target and 88% carbon reduction goal by 2030. While such projects require upfront capital, they also create recurring revenue streams through rate-based cost recovery, a critical advantage for regulated utilities.

The firm's capital spending roadmap—$1.0–$1.1 billion annually—signals confidence in its regulatory filings and cost recovery timelines. Investors should monitor the success of its upcoming rate cases, which could unlock additional earnings headroom. Meanwhile, the 50:50 debt-to-equity mix ensures financial flexibility, particularly as the company's credit profile remains strong despite rising interest costs.

Risks and Opportunities

IDACORP's flat revenue growth and modest EPS guidance ($5.70–$5.85 for 2025) highlight the challenges of operating in a mature utility market. However, its reliance on regulatory mechanisms and tax incentives mitigates downside risk. For example, the projected use of $60–$77 million in tax credits for 2025 suggests management is proactive in leveraging policy tailwinds.

The key risk lies in regulatory uncertainty and the cost of wildfire mitigation, which could pressure margins. Yet, IDACORP's proactive wildfire mitigation plans—approved by regulators—provide a degree of cost recovery certainty. Additionally, Idaho's growing population and energy demand (driven by industrial expansion and residential growth) offer a structural tailwind for customer acquisition and usage growth.

Investment Implications

From a long-term perspective, IDACORP's stock appears fairly valued, trading in line with its intrinsic value. Its stable cash flows, coupled with a diversified capital plan focused on clean energy, make it an attractive “defensive” play in a sector increasingly influenced by ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria. While the company may not deliver high-growth returns, its disciplined approach to capital allocation and regulatory engagement should support steady earnings growth and dividend stability.

For investors seeking exposure to the energy transition, IDACORP's portfolio of transmission and storage projects offers a tangible link to the decarbonization of the U.S. grid. However, those prioritizing top-line growth may find the utility's revenue trajectory underwhelming. The stock's muted volatility and low beta further reinforce its role as a portfolio stabilizer rather than a high-conviction growth pick.

Conclusion

IDACORP's Q2 2025 results may lack the fireworks of a tech breakout, but they reflect the hallmarks of a utility company executing its long-term strategy with precision. By balancing capital expenditures with regulatory cost recovery, leveraging tax incentives, and investing in infrastructure that aligns with decarbonization goals, IDA is positioning itself as a reliable partner in the transition to a cleaner energy future. For investors with a multi-year horizon, IDACORP remains a compelling case study in how a utility can transform from a cost-driven entity into a growth-oriented, climate-conscious enterprise.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 15:02:21.015683

A major health insurer uses AI to indiscriminately deny claims, a national bank creates fake accounts and orders unwanted credit cards for real customers, an airplane manufacturer’s corner cutting on safety causes crashes that kill hundreds, are but three examples from recent years.

Too often, overworked and underfunded government regulators fail to discover the wrongdoing in time to prevent harm. Or, companies have used armies of lobbyists to rewrite laws in their favor, allowing them to “self-police” themselves with little to no independent oversight. And, if they do get caught, they’ve also changed the rules such that they’ll receive trivial fines amounting to no more than a slap on the wrist and something built into their cost of doing business. The results when there are no real consequences for corporate malfeasance can be tragic.

Legislation that passed the Illinois General Assembly with supermajority support and is now sitting on Gov. JB Pritzker’s desk represents an opportunity for Illinois to add additional teeth to our laws that will deter big businesses from behaving badly by putting profits before people.

Senate Bill 328 concerns injuries and illnesses caused by the improper use of substances defined as toxic under the state’s Uniform Hazardous Substances Act. Examples include asbestos, benzene and vinyl chloride – all common, but dangerous, industrial materials that require people who are exposed to them be informed and provided with proper safety equipment, such as goggles, chemical-resistant gloves, breathing masks, and protective clothing.

The bill is needed because too often businesses have sought to evade accountability for harms they have caused workers or consumers exposed unprotected to hazardous substances. Those companies claim that though they are registered or make money by selling products in Illinois, because they are not legally incorporated (many choose Delaware) or do not have their physical headquarters here, our state’s courts are not the proper venue to hear claims against them.

Instead, they demand that people who have been injured or sickened, some of whom are in the process of dying, travel to other states to pursue their cases – an onerous burden that sometimes isn’t physically or financially possible.

The reason that you can be assured this is a good bill and much needed is because of the way its opponents resort to outright lies about what it permits and why. Chief among the fabrications is that it will allow “attorneys to file lawsuits in Illinois state courts that have nothing to do with our state.”

But, the truth and letter of the law explicitly say that there must be an Illinois connection for the case to be brought here. Once that is established, the legislation would allow other companies to be added as defendants in the case, regardless of where they may have their headquarters or be incorporated, for harm they have caused to an Illinois connected person.

The reason that’s important is because in some instances a person who has been harmed was exposed to hazardous substances not just in Illinois, but in other states or from products manufactured by companies not incorporated or headquartered here.

A good example of this is asbestos, which for decades was used in building materials and automobile parts due to its fire-suppression properties. In time, however, we learned that very fine asbestos fibers were easily inhaled and caused debilitating, painful and ultimately fatal lung diseases like mesothelioma. While nearly all forms of asbestos have been banned, its toxic legacy lives on and time is running out for those seeking justice and fair compensation for the suffering they have endured because of it.

As part of their scare-mongering, those demanding a gubernatorial veto also falsely claim that Senate Bill 328 pertains to “lifesaving medications, food and baby formula” and are trying to raise the specter that such essential items would no longer be available in Illinois. It should go without saying that such products by definition are not made with hazardous substances, which are defined as those that cause harm through ingestion, inhalation or absorption through the skin.

To listen to the cries of the extremely well-funded Chicken Little front groups and trade associations, businesses will leave the state in droves and the sky will fall if the governor signs Senate Bill 328 into law.

These are the same organizations that are cheering the loudest at the national level for President Donald Trump’s gutting of the Environmental Protection Agency, Food & Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration – government bodies that have historically played essential roles in policing the worst kinds of corporate predation and disregard for human lives.

At a time of incredible national turmoil when society is being rigged even more in favor of the billionaire class, by signing Senate Bill 3238 into law Gov. Pritzker has an opportunity to show, once again, that in a sea of darkness Illinois is a beacon of light and hope for those who are being trampled by the selfish interests of a wealthy and powerful elite. The governor can demonstrate that while D.C. is abandoning its responsibilities to protect its citizens, Illinois will not.

Interestingly, a willingness to buy an EV was the most politically polarized choice someone could make to help the environment.
The big change, though, was in liberal Americans' desire to purchase any EV at all.
As the report points out, Musk appears to have reduced liberal support for electric cars quite a bit but hasn't been able to increase conservative interest at all.","A new study indicates that Americans are growing less willing to purchase electric cars. While that's not exactly breaking news, what the research team at Williams College found was that the collapse in purchase intention came almost entirely from liberal-identifying Americans, and in particular, those with unfavorable views of the Tesla's mascot, CEO Elon Musk. In fact, antipathy to Musk is running so hot on the left that it's dragging down desires to buy any EV, not just a Tesla. The man who popularized the battery-powered car in America is now unpopularizing it again.

The report, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, breaks down five surveys that Williams College ran from August 2023 through March 2025, a period in which Musk at first seemed to be drifting rightward with his Twitter takeover, then formally endorsed Donald Trump, then brought his chainsaw to Washington. The team measured a variety of factors for each respondent, including political leanings, personal support for Musk, income, and willingness to engage in a variety of eco-friendly activities.

Interestingly, a willingness to buy an EV was the most politically polarized choice someone could make to help the environment. Versus liberals, conservatives were more likely to say they would get an electric heat pump, get solar panels for their home, and even eat less red meat than get a car that didn't need fossil fuels. Yes, they'd rather give up steak than gas stations.

During this period, an American's desire to buy a Tesla hasn't changed much; for the most part, it's highly correlated with how much that American personally likes Musk. It's gotten a little bit worse lately with moderates and conservatives, where this relationship grew more correlated over time.

The big change, though, was in liberal Americans' desire to purchase any EV at all. This used to track modestly with whether or not they liked Musk, but that correlation has veered sharply and is much starker today than it was just a year ago. In other words, liberals who like Musk (unicorns do exist) are about as likely to want an EV now as before, but liberals who don't are radically less willing to buy any EV from any brand than they were last year.

As the report points out, Musk appears to have reduced liberal support for electric cars quite a bit but hasn't been able to increase conservative interest at all. The latter are just about as likely to buy an EV now as they were before. Combined, that would predict for a decline in EV sales across the board, and, well, here we are.

In case you were curious, the research team did account for other factors, such as the respondent's income. Could the drop in interest be due to the cost of the cars? However, they found that while a higher income does make someone generally more open to an EV, that didn't explain for the pronounced partisan split between liberals, moderates, and conservatives. It also doesn't explain why a like or dislike of Elon Musk would have such a strong correlation.

Apparently, the Tesla CEO has successfully tied his own personal brand to an entire category of vehicle. He's torched that brand with the category's biggest market. Ah well, at least Tesla itself is in great financial shape — oh.

What to watch at 2025 climate talks The Paris Agreement isn’t going anywhere.","When President Donald Trump announced in early 2025 he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement for the second time, it triggered fears that the move would undermine global efforts to slow climate change and diminish America’s global influence.

A big question hung in the air: Who would step into the leadership vacuum?

While it’s still too early to fully assess the long-term impact of the United States’ political shift when it comes to global cooperation on climate change, there are signs that a new set of leaders is rising to the occasion.

World responds to another U.S. withdrawal

The U.S. first committed to the Paris Agreement in a joint announcement by President Barack Obama and China’s Xi Jinping in 2015. At the time, the U.S. agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 and pledged financial support to help developing countries adapt to climate risks and embrace renewable energy.

Some people praised the U.S. engagement, while others criticized the original commitment as too weak. Since then, the U.S. has cut emissions by 17.2% below 2005 levels — missing the goal, in part because its efforts have been stymied along the way.

Just two years after the landmark Paris Agreement, Trump stood in the Rose Garden in 2017 and announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the treaty, citing concerns that jobs would be lost, that meeting the goals would be an economic burden, and that it wouldn’t be fair because China, the world’s largest emitter today, wasn’t projected to start reducing its emissions for several years.

Scientists and some politicians and business leaders were quick to criticize the decision, calling it “shortsighted” and “reckless.” Some feared the Paris Agreement, signed by almost every country, would fall apart.

But it did not.

In the United States, businesses such as Apple, Google, Microsoft and Tesla made their own pledges to meet the Paris agreement goals.

Hawaii passed legislation to become the first state to align with the agreement. A coalition of U.S. cities and states banded together to form the United States Climate Alliance to keep working to slow climate change.

Globally, leaders from Italy, Germany and France rebutted Trump’s assertion that the Paris Agreement could be renegotiated. Others from Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand doubled down on their own support of the global climate accord. In 2020, President Joe Biden brought the U.S. back into the agreement.

Now, with Trump pulling the U.S. out again — and taking steps to eliminate U.S. climate policies, boost fossil fuels and slow the growth of clean energy at home — other countries are stepping up.

On July 24, China and the European Union issued a joint statement vowing to strengthen their climate targets and meet them. They alluded to the U.S., referring to “the fluid and turbulent international situation today” in saying that “the major economies … must step up efforts to address climate change.”

In some respects, this is a strength of the Paris Agreement — it is a legally nonbinding agreement based on what each country decides to commit to. Its flexibility keeps it alive, as the withdrawal of a single member does not trigger immediate sanctions, nor does it render the actions of others obsolete.

The agreement survived the first U.S. withdrawal, and so far, all signs point to it surviving the second one.

Who’s filling leadership vacuum?

From what I’ve seen in international climate meetings and my team’s research, it appears that most countries are moving forward.

One bloc emerging as a powerful voice in negotiations is the Like-Minded Group of Developing Countries, a group of low- and middle-income countries that includes China, India, Bolivia and Venezuela. Driven by economic development concerns, these countries are pressuring the developed world to meet its commitments to both cut emissions and provide financial aid to poorer countries.

China, motivated by economic and political factors, seems to be happily filling the climate power vacuum created by the U.S. exit.

In 2017, China voiced disappointment over the first U.S. withdrawal. It maintained its climate commitments and pledged to contribute more in climate finance to other developing countries than the U.S. had committed to — $3.1 billion compared with $3 billion.

This time around, China is using leadership on climate change in ways that fit its broader strategy of gaining influence and economic power by supporting economic growth and cooperation in developing countries. Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China has scaled up renewable energy exports and development in other countries, such as investing in solar power in Egypt and wind energy development in Ethiopia.

While China is still the world’s largest coal consumer, it has aggressively pursued investments in renewable energy at home, including solar, wind and electrification. In 2024, about half the renewable energy capacity built worldwide was in China.

While it missed the deadline to submit its climate pledge due this year, China has a goal of peaking its emissions before 2030 and then dropping to net-zero emissions by 2060. It is continuing major investments in renewable energy, both for its own use and for export. The U.S. government, in contrast, is cutting its support for wind and solar power. China also just expanded its carbon market to encourage emissions cuts in the cement, steel and aluminum sectors.

The British government has also ratcheted up its climate commitments as it seeks to become a clean energy superpower. In 2025, it pledged to cut emissions 77% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. Its new pledge is also more transparent and specific than in the past, with details on how specific sectors, such as power, transportation, construction and agriculture, will cut emissions. And it contains stronger commitments to provide funding to help developing countries grow more sustainably.

In terms of corporate leadership, while many American businesses are being quieter about their efforts, in order to avoid sparking the ire of the Trump administration, most appear to be continuing on a green path — despite the lack of federal support and diminished rules.

USA Today and Statista’s “America’s Climate Leader List” includes about 500 large companies that have reduced their carbon intensity — carbon emissions divided by revenue — by 3% from the previous year. The data shows that the list is growing, up from about 400 in 2023.

What to watch at 2025 climate talks

The Paris Agreement isn’t going anywhere. Given the agreement’s design, with each country voluntarily setting its own goals, the U.S. never had the power to drive it into obsolescence.

The question is if developed and developing country leaders alike can navigate two pressing needs — economic growth and ecological sustainability — without compromising their leadership on climate change.

“It’s picking up steam,” Florida GOP Chair Evan Power told The Hill. “We were probably heading there with the court decision, but Texas made it top news.”

Florida has seen an uptick in population growth following the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.

The state has also become solidly Republican over the past decade, with Republicans growing their representation in Congress and once-Democratic strongholds like Miami-Dade and Osceola counties flipping from blue to red.

A number of Democratic-held congressional seats could be impacted if redistricting were to take place, including those held in south Florida by Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Jared Moskowitz and Lois Frankel. Rep. Kathy Castor (D) in the Tampa area and Rep. Darren Soto (D) outside of Orlando have also been floated as possible targets.

Florida Republicans already hold a 20 to 8 advantage over Democrats in the congressional delegation.

Republicans were boosted last month when the state’s Supreme Court ruled to uphold a congressional map that blocked a challenge to the elimination of a majority-Black congressional district in the north of the state that previously was represented by former Rep. Al Lawson (D). The area that comprised the former congressional district is now divided among three Republican lawmakers.

But DeSantis is not stopping there.

The governor has argued that Florida got a “raw deal” in the 2020 census when the state only gained one congressional seat. The governor said last month he had relayed his concerns to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after he was sworn in earlier this year and that the Trump administration could be pursuing redoing the census.

Additionally, the governor said he believes Florida’s Fair District amendments, which a majority of voters approved of in 2010, could conflict with the U.S. Constitution. The amendments say that districts cannot be drawn in a way that hinders minorities voting for their choice of elected representatives.

“There’s a lot of people who believe that the Fair District Amendments is unconstitutional, because what it does is, it mandates having race predominate,” DeSantis said this week. “Whereas, neutrality should really be the constitutional standard.”

Patronis also said in his X post that he believes the Fair District Amendments are unconstitutional “because it violates freedom of speech AND elections are a states rights issue.”

“Time to add more conservatives to Congress, so we can better deliver on President Trump’s agenda, finally win the war against woke, cut government waste, and create an economy that moves our country into a new age of prosperity,” Patronis said.

Republicans argue that DeSantis and the state’s Republicans could be setting an example for other red states to follow.

“DeSantis here sees an opportunity to be a trailblazer for the Republican Party in this sense in that he could be setting up a pilot program that Texas and some of the other states can actually follow,” a Florida Republican strategist said.

“Let’s not disillusion ourselves, if he pulls this off, he will be a fan favorite of one person who sits at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,” the strategist added, referring to Trump.

So far, Republicans in the Florida state Legislature have remained publicly quiet about the prospect of pursuing redistricting. This year’s state legislative session was extended from 60 days to 105 days and saw tensions emerge between DeSantis and members of his own party.

State Rep. Alex Andrade, a vocal Republican critic of DeSantis, said he has not spoken to his colleagues about redistricting. The state lawmaker noted he would support the effort only if the census was redone.

“I get the partisan argument,” Andrade told The Hill. “I understand we could make hay right now and benefit Republicans but at some point do I care more about my party or the Constitution?”

“If the census were redone, I’d jump all over it,” he said.

Florida Democrats warn that a move by DeSantis and the state’s Republicans would set a negative precedent.

“It would mean that the governor and the state legislative branch would completely capitulate under Donald Trump,” state House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell (D) said. “It’s not supposed to be that the president gets to act like a king and say ‘do this on my behalf.’”

In a Facebook video posted by Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), Soto accused Republicans of wanting to cheat in the election.

“They want to pick their voters rather than voters picking their representatives,” he said. “You’ll see us do whatever we can in the courts to make sure that the Fair Districts Amendments are enforced.”

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Madison Andrus dismissed the effort from Florida Republicans as “a bold-faced attempt to save their flailing midterm performance by rigging the game.”

The effort comes as the nationwide redistricting war heats up and both parties seek to gain seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

In addition to Republicans in Texas and potentially Florida taking a look at redistricting, Democrats in states like California and New Jersey are also exploring their options.

“There’s an opportunity and if it better reflects the makeup of a state whether that’s Texas or Florida, or to Gavin Newsom’s point even California, then you should do it,” a national Republican strategist said.

“These redistricting efforts, if they comply with the law and meet all of the various federal thresholds to get mapped through, if you do that and do it quickly, you’re going to increase the likelihood that the president and Republicans in Washington and going to be able to keep pushing things forward,” the strategist continued.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/FloridaRepublicans_Manchester_AP-OrlandoSentinel_JoeBurbank_855518.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-02 18:03:07.671917

The first-of-its-kind celebration brought together Michigan elected officials, EV industry leaders and climate advocates from across the state to promote sustainable transportation, joined by sponsors Moms Clean Air Force, Environmental Defense Fund Action, Sierra Club and Tesla Owners Club.

""The overarching theme is that EVs are here to stay, and we want to educate the public that they are not going by the wayside,"" said Amy Rogghe, executive director and founder of the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance. ""The transportation sector in Michigan is the largest contributor of greenhouse gasses out of every sector. So in our state, it's ultimately important that we decrease the greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.""

The event featured a wide range of activities centered around the environmental and health benefits of electric transportation and highlighting electric vehicles from various manufacturers. A Ride 'n Drive experience allowed those interested to test out the vehicles and drive them up and down Woodward Avenue.

As EV technology improves year over year and sales increase, Rogghe said, Detroit needs to stay one step ahead.

“If we don't buy in, we're going to be left in the dust,"" Rogghe said. ""So we really need to buy in, not only for our state's economy, but just to be in the global economy, to be a big piece of that market. ... I mean, in Michigan, we have the Detroit Motor City, right? We need to stay at the cutting edge of auto technology, and that is what an EV is.""

""This is going to be the evolution,"" said Terry Richards, who displayed his Chevy Bolt EV at the event. Richards, 67, called himself the ""oldest EV owner around"" and said he hopes the event reaches younger generations.

""It's not about us, it's about the kids,"" Richards said.

Erin DeMoss, who was sitting beside Richards and owned a Tesla Model S, agreed with him. Her Tesla has been to the Grand Canyon, Pikes Peak, Mount Washington and ""all around Michigan,"" she said.

""When we first bought our Tesla, wherever we would go, the kids are so amazed. They'd be like, 'Oh my God, it's a Tesla,'"" DeMoss said. ""So we have all these boomers who will say, 'No, no, it's gas all the way.' But you know, they're not going to be around forever, and when you look to the kids, they're just so excited.""

""I've had a lot of discussions with people that are like 'Gasoline forever,'"" Richards said. ""You can't change everyone. All you can do is change enough people to switch over to get to what you call critical mass.""

Rie Yamakawa of Novi brought along her 4-year-old son to test out several mini battery-powered children's motorcycles and cars. His stamp of approval, she said, made all the difference.

""I just think it's awesome that they brought all these vendors, that they're showing all these alternatives here,"" Yamakawa said. ""It's great that they're making people aware of these new models, there are so many for someone to choose from.""

When asked if she'll be buying one for her son, Yamakawa laughed: ""I think I need to now, he won't get off. He finished the battery on the last one, the car, and now he's riding the motorcycle.""

Also at the event, attendees could listen in on presentations and discussions on the benefits of transitioning to electric transportation, which experts said help in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving overall air quality.

Nora Naughton, communications director of the Sierra Club's Michigan chapter, said EVs are going to be ""super key"" in fighting the climate crisis.

""As soon as someone interacts with an electric vehicle, they're so much more likely to actually consider them,"" Naughton said. ""There's so many different things that we can do for climate action, and this is just one leg of the stool for us. This is an individual action that you can take today. You can turn in your gas powered car for an electric one, and I would argue that it would improve your life.""

Manufacturers demonstrated advancements in EV technology, giving attendees the opportunity to explore the vehicles up close through a showcase featuring over 60 different cars. The display even included an electric school bus and a solar vehicle designed by University of Michigan students.

Junior Julia Glasco and sophomore Evan Winters, both part of the university's student-run UM Solar Car Team, presented their student-made and designed solar vehicle called Astrum. The car finished fourth in the 2023 Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, an 1,800-mile race across the Australian Outback, and first in the 2024 American Solar Challenge.

""I always watch the green cruise growing up and it's the best way to display what our car does for sustainability, because it kind of gets overlooked when people think it's just a racing team,"" Winters said. ""But I mean, what we're doing is moving the future of renewability forward in a way no one else really is.""

Glasco added that the group wanted younger generations to get involved in ""the future of sustainability,"" saying, ""it gives the younger kids a chance to be a part of something that's for the future of sustainability, a better future for all.""

The festival was closed out with an EV cruise down Woodward Avenue, with over 60 EV owners who represented more than a dozen brands driving their cars and honking for passerby.

""I'm an EV and environment advocate, I've always been an advocate, and I'm still an advocate,"" Richards said before taking his car out for the cruise. ""This is the future, it really is. It's the evolution of the Motor City.""","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/02/PDTN/85492139007-screenshot-20250802-at-41437-pm.png?crop=2380,1340,x0,y229&width=2380&height=1340&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-02 17:02:18.997164

BRASÍLIA (DF) – The Federal Prosecution Office (MPF) has increased pressure on President Lula to veto the General Bill on Environmental Licensing (Bill 2159/2021), known as the “Devastation Bill,” which was passed by the National Congress on the 17th of this month. The institution sent a technical note to the Presidential Palace last Tuesday, the 29th, recommending the veto of more than 30 provisions of the bill, citing violations of the Constitution, threats to environmental protection, and breaches of international treaties.

Also on Tuesday, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, stated that the Ministry’s technical team is finalizing its analysis of the bill to support the president’s decision to either sanction or veto the measure, which consists of 60 articles and over 300 provisions. Lula has until August 8 to decide.

According to Marina, it’s not only the amendments introduced by the Senate that need to be assessed, but the bill as a whole, which environmentalists argue was already flawed when it left the House of Representatives, as it initiated the dismantling of the licensing process, considered a key tool for environmental protection in the country.

Within the federal government, while Marina’s ministry supports the veto, the Ministries of Mines and Energy and of Transportation have already expressed interest in the bill’s sanctioning, as many of the proposed changes would exempt strategic projects from environmental licensing. In Marina’s view, vetoing the bill is not enough: an alternative must be presented to restore the rules, which could mean submitting a new bill or a Provisional Measure to Congress.

The MPF’s technical note was prepared by the Chamber on the Environment and Cultural Heritage (4CCR), the Chamber on Indigenous Peoples and Traditional Communities (6CCR), and the Federal Prosecutor’s Office for Citizens’ Rights (PFDC), all upper bodies within the Prosecutor General’s Office (PGR).

The 13-page document states that the contested provisions “violate the Federal Constitution and contravene fundamental principles such as the right to an ecologically balanced environment and the rights of Indigenous Peoples over their lands, as well as the principles of public administration, the prohibition of environmental regression, effective protection, and federalism. The measure also goes against established Supreme Federal Court (STF) precedents in several specific rulings.”

The bill introduced new types of licensing, such as the Special Environmental License (LEA) and the License by Commitment and Adhesion (LAC), a kind of self-licensing, while exempting various sectors from licensing or extending licensing deadlines. According to the MPF, the STF has already ruled against such measures, as in the Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADI) 6.618, stating that “the simplification of procedures is only acceptable in cases of low environmental impact.”

More permissive licensing

The MPF also objects to the creation of more permissive licensing models, such as the exemption of licensing for sectors like agribusiness and infrastructure works; automatic license renewals; and the exclusion of institutions such as the National Foundation for Indigenous Peoples (Funai) from projects affecting unratified traditional territories.

The prosecutors who signed the document recall that the Supreme Federal Court (STF) has already ruled that “the territorial rights of Indigenous and quilombola peoples are original and do not depend on the formal conclusion of administrative processes.” In addition to hindering the evaluation of indirect impacts of large projects on these communities, the MPF argues that the approved bill violates the precautionary principle and the right to free, prior, and informed consultation, as established by Convention 169 of the International Labour Organization (ILO).

Another criticism is the removal of the requirement for registration in the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) and the loosening of rules under the Atlantic Forest Law. “Although presented under the pretense of modernizing and speeding up the environmental licensing process, the approved text contains provisions that, in practice, dismantle one of the most important instruments of Brazilian environmental policy and the defense of human rights,” the MPF states in the document.

Violations and socio-environmental rollback

In concluding the technical note, the prosecutors further state that “the set of analyzed provisions constitutes a systematic violation of the principle prohibiting socio-environmental regression, recognized by the STF as stemming from Article 225 of the Federal Constitution.”

“Through self-licensing, the exemption of entire sectors, the elimination of technical analysis, and the weakening of requirements, the bill promotes a generalized dismantling of the licensing system, representing an unjustified rollback that jeopardizes the core of the right to the environment,” emphasize the prosecutors.

In addition to ILO Convention 169, the Paris Agreement—signed in 2015 to combat climate change—is also considered violated. According to the MPF, all this generates “a high risk of the country being held accountable by international courts, such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR).”

The MPF stated that it had already warned the National Congress several times about the risks of regression posed by the Licensing Bill, including in May 2024, when it submitted a document to the Senate detailing the environmental and social damage the rule changes would cause. This year, the MPF met again with the Federal Senate’s Environment Committee to discuss the measure and participated in public hearings on the subject.

Impact on unratified Indigenous Territories

A report published this Thursday, the 31st, by the InfoAmazônia portal shows that the Licensing Bill excludes 121 Indigenous Territories (ITs) in the Legal Amazon from protection zones surrounding major projects. This is because projects such as ports, railways, highways, mining ventures, wind farms, thermal plants, hydroelectric plants, and power lines may now be established around unratified ITs without consulting the National Foundation for Indigenous Peoples (Funai).

According to InfoAmazônia, of the 792 territories recognized by Funai in Brazil, 289 (36%) have not yet been ratified, with 121 of those located in the Legal Amazon—equivalent to 26% of the region’s ITs.

“The text also reduces the direct impact zone of projects, in the case of ratified Indigenous lands and those with restricted use for isolated communities in the Amazon biome. And it significantly reduces this buffer zone in other Legal Amazon biomes, such as the Cerrado and Pantanal, equating them to other regions of the country,” the report states.

Since the bill changes the term “Legal Amazon” to “Amazon Biome,” InfoAmazônia notes that, if fully sanctioned, the proposal will also reduce the protection radius for ratified ITs in the Amazon biome from 40 to 15 kilometers for highways; from 10 to 8 kilometers for railways, ports, thermal plants, and mining projects that require environmental impact assessments; from 40 to 30 kilometers for hydroelectric plants with reservoirs; and from 8 to 5 kilometers for transmission lines.

By aligning with hyperscalers like Meta, which has committed to 100% clean energy, AES gains access to a sector with insatiable demand and a willingness to pay premium prices for reliability.
The company's status as a top-ranked clean energy provider by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) further solidifies its competitive edge in a market where ESG credentials are increasingly tied to corporate value.
The data center-driven energy boom is not a fad but a structural shift, and AES's PPA backlog and project pipeline provide a clear runway.
Conclusion: A Clean Energy Leader in the AI Age AES's Q2 2025 results are more than a quarterly beat—they are a masterclass in strategic foresight.","The AES Corporation (AES) has emerged as a linchpin in the global transition to clean energy, and its Q2 2025 results underscore its deft strategic positioning in a rapidly evolving market. With a 56% surge in Adjusted EBITDA for its Renewables Strategic Business Unit (SBU) year-over-year, AES is not just riding the wave of decarbonization—it is shaping it. The company's aggressive expansion of 3.2 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable capacity in 2025, coupled with a 12 GW Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) backlog, positions it to capitalize on the surging energy demands of the data center industry, a sector poised to redefine global electricity consumption. For investors, this represents a compelling case of alignment between macroeconomic trends, operational execution, and long-term value creation.

A Renewable Powerhouse in the AI Era

The data center industry's energy needs are escalating at an unprecedented pace. By 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that data centers will drive over 20% of the U.S. electricity demand surge, with global demand from data centers expected to more than double by 2030. Artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency operations are the primary culprits, with AI-optimized centers alone projected to consume quadruple their current energy by 2030. AES has positioned itself at the intersection of these trends through a dual strategy: scaling renewable energy infrastructure and securing long-term PPAs with tech giants.

In Q2 2025, AES signed or was awarded 1.6 GW of new solar and wind projects, all directed toward data center clients like Microsoft and Meta. These agreements, part of a 12 GW PPA backlog (with 5.2 GW under construction), provide a stable revenue stream and insulate the company from short-term volatility. Notably, the 650 MW of solar power allocated to Meta's Texas and Kansas data centers exemplifies AES's ability to deliver “time-to-power” solutions—projects that can be deployed rapidly to meet the urgent needs of high-growth industries.

Financial Resilience Amid Transition Risks

AES's Q2 results highlight its financial discipline despite headwinds. While the company reported a GAAP net loss of $150 million, driven by non-cash charges and Colombia's regulatory challenges, its Adjusted EBITDA of $681 million and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes of $1,057 million reaffirmed its operational strength. The company's ability to maintain a $0.17595 quarterly dividend—despite sector-wide uncertainties—signals confidence in its cash flow resilience.

AES's 2025 guidance of $2,650–$2,850 million in Adjusted EBITDA and $2.10–$2.26 in Adjusted EPS is underpinned by three pillars:

1. Renewables Growth: The 3.2 GW expansion in 2025, with 1.9 GW already completed, will add recurring revenue.

2. U.S. Utility Rate Base Growth: AES Indiana's regulatory rate review aims to unlock $400 million in annualized earnings by 2027.

3. Geographic Diversification: Normalized performance in Colombia and Mexico, along with green hydrogen partnerships (e.g., Air Products in North Texas), diversifies risk and taps into emerging decarbonization markets.

Strategic Partnerships as a Growth Engine

AES's collaboration with data center operators is not merely transactional—it is strategic. By aligning with hyperscalers like Meta, which has committed to 100% clean energy, AES gains access to a sector with insatiable demand and a willingness to pay premium prices for reliability. The 650 MW Texas-Kansas project, for instance, is expected to generate $150 million annually in revenue while creating 500+ construction jobs and boosting local tax revenues. Such projects enhance AES's reputation as a “utility as a service” provider, a model gaining traction as data centers seek partners that can manage both energy and infrastructure complexity.

Moreover, AES's pipeline of 65 GW—far exceeding its 12 GW backlog—ensures a multi-year growth trajectory. The company's status as a top-ranked clean energy provider by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) further solidifies its competitive edge in a market where ESG credentials are increasingly tied to corporate value.

Investment Implications: A “Buy” in the Long Game

For long-term investors, AES offers a rare combination of near-term visibility and structural growth. The data center-driven energy boom is not a fad but a structural shift, and AES's PPA backlog and project pipeline provide a clear runway. With renewables accounting for 25% of U.S. electricity generation in 2025 (per EIA), and AES's renewables SBU growing at 56% annually, the company is well-positioned to outperform peers in both earnings and ESG metrics.

However, risks remain. Regulatory delays in rate cases, supply chain bottlenecks, and the intermittency of solar/wind could pressure margins. Yet, AES's advanced construction capabilities and diversified portfolio mitigate these risks. The company's joint venture in green hydrogen also positions it to benefit from the next phase of decarbonization, where hydrogen could replace fossil fuels in heavy industry and transport.

Conclusion: A Clean Energy Leader in the AI Age

AES's Q2 2025 results are more than a quarterly beat—they are a masterclass in strategic foresight. By aligning its renewable expansion with the data center industry's energy demands, the company is not only securing its financial future but also contributing to a global energy transition. For shareholders, this translates to a durable moat: recurring revenue from high-credit-quality clients, a disciplined capital structure, and a leadership position in a sector expected to grow at 5–7% annually through 2027.

As AI reshapes the economy, AES's ability to power the digital future with clean, reliable energy makes it a compelling long-term investment. Investors who recognize the intersection of technology, energy, and sustainability will find AES to be a cornerstone of their portfolios.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 19:02:29.215345

Graham County once had more than 1,100 manufacturing jobs across four factories and a sawmill.
Many of the manufacturing jobs that left Graham County — and Western North Carolina more broadly — went to China as companies chased cheaper labor.","When Shaun Adams was laid off by Stanley Furniture in 2014, he was beyond frustrated. Not only was he losing his job at the furniture manufacturing plant, but Graham County was losing its largest employer and last major manufacturer.

In the year after Stanley left, the unemployment rate in Graham County rose to the highest across North Carolina. Adams’ frustration grew as he saw the Robbinsville facility lay almost entirely vacant for more than a decade. Why weren’t town and county officials courting another company to use the factory space and create more jobs?

Adams ran for mayor, determined to bring manufacturing jobs back to Robbinsville. He won the office in 2021.

Last week, he got his wish: the Chinese biodegradable paperware company EcoKing announced an $80 million investment to reopen the same shuttered facility, promising 515 jobs in one of North Carolina's most economically distressed counties.

“We have lost so much population over the years because of factories closing and our low median income,” Adams told Carolina Public Press. “This means a lot of people will get to come home.”

EcoKing manufactures for fast food restaurants like Chipotle, Chick-Fil-A, and Panda Express. When the Robbinsville facility comes online in 2026, it will be the biggest employer in Graham County, providing an average wage of $46,700, nearly double the median individual income in the county.

Picking Graham County

But first, the abandoned Stanley plant needs major renovations — to the tune of $21 million.

“If you walked through the plant with me, you would say they ought to do a series of The Walking Dead here, because it just looked abandoned and neglected,” Robin Sargent, owner of Old Town Brokers, a firm that helped orchestrate the sale of the plant.

“At one time, it was a vibrant place, but holy cow, someone just let it go to hell. Taking the pictures was like getting it ready for a dating site. It takes a special person to be able to have a vision for a space like that.”

The facility needs major HVAC, plumbing and electrical work. But EcoKing wasn’t scared off by the state of the plant.

Partially they were wowed by Graham County’s natural beauty. Partially they were swayed because of the cheap, abundant power supply in the area.

The deciding factor, however, was incentives: between the town, the county and the state, EcoKing was offered $12 million over five years to pick Graham County instead of a site in the other Southern states they were eyeing.

EcoKing’s customers — those big name fast food restaurants — wanted paperware products made domestically. With the tariffs coming down from Washington, the company had to act quickly.

“The tariff is high,” John Lin, EcoKing’s representative for this project, told CPP. “And 80% of our customers are here in the United States. So is most of our raw material. That taught us to make a decision: we’re going to land right here, and be Made in the USA.”

Economic lifeline

The EcoKing investment is a lifeline for this Western corner of the state. Graham County once had more than 1,100 manufacturing jobs across four factories and a sawmill. Now all of that is gone.

After Stanley Furniture was the last to leave, a company called Oak Valley Hardwood occupied a small corner of the same building starting in 2016, but left when COVID hit. Other than that blip, hardly any economic investment has come to the area.

“For decades we struggled with the closing of textile plants and furniture plants and the tobacco industry being more or less sunset,” Sargent said.

“This area has just been hammered in a way that is not well understood — 500 jobs is a big deal here. This is a really great story of how we were able to capture the interest of an Asian company to launch a big investment in their industry here.”

There's a certain economic irony to EcoKing's investment. Many of the manufacturing jobs that left Graham County — and Western North Carolina more broadly — went to China as companies chased cheaper labor. Now, a Chinese company is bringing manufacturing back to the exact same building where American workers once made furniture.

EcoKing will use the same pulp supplier that served the Pactiv paper plant in Canton, whose 2023 closure resulted in the loss of 1,200 jobs and a lawsuit from former attorney general and current governor Josh Stein.

Bringing back Graham County workforce

The one downside of US manufacturing is the cost of labor, Lin said. In China, the company can get away with much lower wages. EcoKing plans to use some automated manufacturing to offset this inflated cost.

But still, the plant will need 515 workers. In one of the state’s smallest counties, that won’t happen overnight — it will require coordinated workforce development.

Hiring is projected to happen in two phases. The first phase will take place over the next three to five years, and create about 300 jobs. The second, on a longer timeline, will bring on 215 more. The company is partnering with Tri-County Community College and Western Carolina University for workforce development.

“We’re going to take a slow-burn approach,” Josh Carpenter, director of economic development group Mountain West Partnership, told CPP. “That’s what we did with Harrah’s Cherokee Casino: built a workforce of 900 to 1,200 over the years.”

Construction crews are already at work on the $21 million restoration.

However, unlocking this potential depends not only on technology and resources, but on overcoming structural investment and regulatory barriers.

This column outlines the key legal and financial risks that hinder hydrogen deployment in Ukraine — from high capital costs and geopolitical uncertainty to the lack of dedicated hydrogen legislation. It also explores scalable solutions: international guarantees, green PPA frameworks, strategic zones and legal recognition of hydrogen as a national priority for energy security and export.

Following the 2024 energy crisis, triggered by targeted attacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, hydrogen has shifted from a long-term ambition to an immediate strategic necessity. Amid Europe’s accelerated decarbonisation, Ukraine now has a window of opportunity to position itself as a key hydrogen supplier to the EU — if it can overcome its legal, financial, and institutional barriers.

Enormous technical potential

Ukraine holds one of the largest technical potentials for green hydrogen production in Europe. According to various estimates, renewable energy potential reaches 1,300–2,300 terawatt-hour (TWh)/year — enough to produce up to 38 million tonnes of hydrogen. The country’s gas transmission network could carry up to 33 million tonnes of hydrogen, with export routes through Slovakia into Germany.

Projects with a combined production of over 600,000 tonnes/year are already in development, including 100 megawatts (MW) pilot plants in Reni and Zakarpattia. By 2030, the plan is to install up to 10 gigawatts (GW) of electrolysers — requiring 85–90 billion euros in investment and creating up to 100,000 jobs. The domestic hydrogen economy could generate up to 22 billion dollars in annual revenue.

Legal and investment barriers

Despite this promise, Ukraine’s hydrogen market faces five major challenges that stall investment and industrial-scale deployment. These barriers are legal as much as economic, and must be addressed to make hydrogen financeable and scalable.

1. High Cost of Capital (WACC)

In 2024, Ukraine’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) reached 15–20 per cent, double that of most EU countries. This results in a levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) between 5.1 and 8 dollars per kilogram — well above the 4 dollars per kilogram threshold expected by EU off-takers. Without state subsidies or concessional financing, Ukrainian hydrogen remains uncompetitive. Legal mechanisms for capital expenditures (CAPEX) recovery and investment guarantees are urgently needed.

2. Geopolitical and security risk

War-related instability remains a major deterrent to capital, particularly in southern and eastern regions. Political risk insurance, military force majeure clauses, and de-risking instruments from institutions like MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency) or KfW (German state development bank) are essential to make Ukrainian projects viable in high-risk zones.

3. Legal vacuum

As of mid-2025, Ukraine still lacks a dedicated Hydrogen Law. Key regulatory gaps include:

Certification of hydrogen origin;

Buyer and supplier obligations;

Grid access and tariff methodology;

Export and import conditions.

This legal uncertainty prevents long-term offtake agreements (PPAs), delays project bankability and increases transaction risks.

4. Institutional fragmentation

Ukraine has yet to develop a state procurement system for hydrogen, align with EU certification systems (such as RED II or CertifHy), or establish balancing mechanisms for hydrogen demand and supply. The absence of a dedicated hydrogen regulator contributes to administrative fragmentation and policy unpredictability — further deterring investment.

5. Macro pressure and talent shortages

With inflation exceeding 26 per cent and the country operating under martial law, macroeconomic risks complicate project planning. Moreover, Ukraine faces a shortage of qualified energy lawyers, engineers and policy specialists — even in safer regions. Effective project delivery will depend on targeted support for capacity building and legal-financial architecture.

Solutions: What will reduce investor risk?

Several mechanisms could help lower entry barriers and unlock hydrogen investment in Ukraine: support from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) such as KfW, EBRD, and EIB will be decisive.

Key instruments include:

Concessional lending (lower rates, longer tenors);

Partial risk guarantees;

Political risk insurance;

R&D and feasibility-study grants.

These tools can significantly lower WACC and improve project bankability from the pre-development stage.

Competitive tendered PPAs

Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) awarded through state or municipal tenders can:

Ensure minimum investor returns over 10–15 years;

Guarantee offtake volumes and tariffs;

Include foreign exchange protection and force majeure clauses.

Such frameworks can anchor project finance and attract cross-border developers.

Hydrogen Investment Zones

Special Economic Zones (SEZs) or hydrogen investment parks could:

Offer tax exemptions (VAT, profit tax, customs duties);

Simplify permitting and customs procedures;

Establish dedicated rules for hydrogen certification and trade.

These zones could align with regional recovery plans and build on successful SEZ (Special Economic Zone) models in Poland and Romania.

Legal recognition of hydrogen as a strategic resource

Officially designating hydrogen as a “strategic energy resource” in national law could:

Enable fast-track permitting;

Guarantee network access;

Unlock sovereign support tools;

Allow concessional loans from national development banks.

This measure should be included in the forthcoming Hydrogen Law, currently under review.

War risk insurance via MIGA

For projects in risk-prone areas like Odesa, political risk insurance from MIGA — the World Bank’s investment guarantee agency — could protect against:

Expropriation;

Currency inconvertibility;

Contract interference;

War-related disruptions.

MIGA is already supporting renewable projects in Ukraine, offering a proven model that can extend to hydrogen.

Regional investment cases

Strategic hydrogen projects are already forming in key regions:

Odesa Hydrogen Hub (Reni): 100 MW plant with port access and Black Sea export potential.

Zakarpattia Cluster: Secure region close to EU networks, ideal for integration and scale-up.

Ivano-Frankivsk, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi: High solar potential and proactive local governance.

Lviv Region: Geological potential for underground hydrogen storage — critical for seasonal balancing.

Conclusion: The Case for Early Movers

Hydrogen is more than an emergency response — it is Ukraine’s opportunity to lead in Europe’s next energy market. To seize this chance, businesses must begin preparing now: by understanding fiscal incentives, forming consortia with municipalities and EU partners, and engaging in legislative advocacy.

Ukraine’s hydrogen economy is not yet ready — but the groundwork is being laid. Those who move early will shape the rules and reap the long-term returns.",https://ceenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hydrogen-6362274_1280.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 18:01:58.680459
,Detroit and Evs,2025-08-02 19:11:35+00:00,Detroit Free Press,Want to charge your EV at Tesla stations? Get a good adapter. - Detroit Free Press,Mark Phelan,,,,,https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/mark-phelan/2025/08/02/charge-ev-tesla-stations-adapter/85380421007/,"A melted adapter could essentially weld your vehicle’s inlet port to the charging cable, rendering both inoperative.

An EV adapter isn’t an overpriced extension cord.","Certified adapters often cost $200-$250.

Using the wrong adapter could damage your vehicle and the charger.

Electric vehicle owners, beware: Buying a cheap, unapproved converter to connect your EV to a Tesla DC fast charger — or connect your Tesla to the more common CCS charger — could damage your vehicle.

Experts agree the best course is to use the adapter your vehicle’s manufacture recommends. They typically cost $200 or more. You can find adapters for under $100 on Amazon, but cheap, off-brand devices could be less efficient and not as reliable.

Worst case, it might damage your vehicle and void the warranty.

“If an adapter overheats, it can melt and damage the inlet on your vehicle and the charger,” said Ted Bohn, the engineer at Argonne National Laboratory who chaired the public-private committee that created the safety standard for adapters you can rely on.

A melted adapter could essentially weld your vehicle’s inlet port to the charging cable, rendering both inoperative.

High voltage, high stakes

DC fast chargers are complicated devices that carry high electric voltages. They connect a big expensive vehicle to a charging kiosk that almost certainly costs more than the vehicle.

What could go wrong?

Plenty, and a faulty adapter could leave you on the hook for damage to both. The tab can easily run into thousands of dollars

A bad adapter might even expose vehicles and chargers — conceivably, even your home — to cybersecurity threats.

Automaker-approved adapters are available from new car dealers and automakers’ websites and apps.

“It’s important to stick to the adapter your vehicle manufacturer specifies,” Consumer Reports Associate Director of Automotive Testing Gabe Shenhar said. “People who bought cheaper alternatives had problems, including voiding their warranty and the adapter overheating.

“It’s not worth saving a few bucks on something that could damage your vehicle.”

Why do I need an adapter to charge my EV?

EV owners typically use DC fast chargers when they drive long distances or don’t have access to a Level 2 (240 volt) charger to fill their battery overnight or at work. Run by companies like Electrify America, EVgo, Ionna and Charge Point, DC fast chargers — as the name suggests — deliver high levels of power to charge the battery quickly, so the vehicle can get back on the road.

Most EVs use what’s called a CCS, or combined charging system, plug. Teslas have a different plug, called NACS, or North American charging system.

The two are incompatible because Tesla built its DC fast chargers first. It kept the design proprietary, so only Tesla vehicles could charge at its kiosks, which the company calls Super Chargers.

The network of fast, convenient chargers gave Tesla a major sales advantage. Imagine what it would’ve been like in 1910 if Ford owned most of the gas stations in America, and only Fords could fill up at them.

Getting back to the present, it took other automakers a while to catch on, but they eventually agreed on the CCS design. They and independent charging companies built thousands of them around the country.

Now anybody can use Tesla's chargers

Result: A VW or Chevy EV owner couldn’t charge at a Tesla station, and vice versa. On top of that, NACS chargers earned a reputation for being faster and more reliable than CCS.

They were seen as the gold standard.

Today, there are about 17,000 NACS charging stations and something over 18,000 CCS stations in the United States. The numbers are continually increasing, due to EV sales and rising demand. That compares with 145,000 gas stations nationwide. Concern about access to chargers held EV sales back.

Automakers negotiated to get their vehicles access to Tesla’s network.

To solve that, engineers from automakers, charging companies, the U.S. Department of Energy and others created a standard for adapters to connect CCS vehicles to NACS chargers. Doubling the number of places to fast-charge was a boon to automakers, but, initially, owners couldn’t buy an adapter. It still was like trying to plug an English appliance into an American outlet: The plugs didn’t match.

Why did my adapter cost $225?

SAE International, the engineering group that created standards for everything from lubricating oil to how heavy a trailer a vehicle can safely tow, oversaw standards for reliable adapters that work with all vehicles and chargers.

Called J3400/1, the standard specifies performance for charging, durability, use in all kinds of weather and more. They also shut down before damage occurs if something goes wrong and the adapter starts to overheat.

Any adapter stamped UL 2252 has been certified to meet those standards by UL Solutions, the long-standing independent testing group once known as Underwriters Laboratories.

“The requirements outlined in the standard are designed to ensure that an adapter meets safety standards not only when it’s first used but continues to meet them over time — even after typical wear and tear from everyday use,” said UL Solutions engineer Joe Bablo.

An EV adapter isn’t an overpriced extension cord. It’s a sophisticated safety device.

G'head, run a pickup over it

Adapters that meet the standards have been certified to work for years in all weather conditions, endure repeatedly being dropped to the ground and more. A Ford video shows the automaker’s adapter surviving being driven over by an F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup.

Adapters that don’t meet SAE standard can even present cybersecurity concerns.

Some early adapters had USB ports so they could be updated. The ports left them open to hacking. The standard bans that: Adapters are now like an air-gapped computer, with no data link to the outside world.

“GM designed our adapter to meet the same standards as our vehicles,” GM Energy Chief Operating Officer and Head of Public Charging Bill Hotchkiss said. “We tested it in fleets of vehicles.

“Our chargers are good in all conditions: hot, cold, heavy rain, through thousands of use cycles These are high-voltage connections. We want to make sure our customers are secure.”","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/25/PDTF/85380733007-g-mbrand-app-controls-super-charger-session-2.jpg?crop=9503,5346,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-02 17:02:27.965146

“We now have the authority to determine beneficial uses of water based on our cultural values, environmental priorities, and community needs,” said Yurok Tribe Environmental Department Director Louisa McCovey.

“Treatment as a state significantly increases our capacity to protect and restore the lower Klamath River, which serves as the spiritual, cultural, and ecological foundation of our existence. We extend our sincere gratitude to the US EPA for its formal recognition of our sovereign authority and demonstrated ability to effectively regulate water quality within our homeland,” said Joseph L. James, the Chairman of the Yurok Tribe. “I also want to acknowledge our highly professional environmental and legal teams for completing the rigorous application process.” Based on a 1987 amendment to the Clean Water Act, TAS empowers the Yurok Tribe Environmental Department to assume the same authority as state governments in setting and enforcing environmental standards that apply to tribal lands and waters. The TAS designation enables the department to enforce the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act as well as other federal environmental laws. It strengthens the Tribe’s ability to improve the health of 44 miles of the Klamath River and several tributaries that flow through the Yurok Reservation. “We now have the authority to determine beneficial uses of water based on our cultural values, environmental priorities, and community needs,” said Yurok Tribe Environmental Department Director Louisa McCovey. “This achievement is the result of a multigenerational effort to regain our sovereign right to govern the natural resources of our homelands.”

The EPA’s approval follows a rigorous review process of the Tribe’s capacity to manage environmental programs at a level equivalent to or better than states.

The Yurok Tribe Environmental Department’s Water Quality Program has continuously conducted water quality monitoring on the Klamath River and its tributaries since 2002. Additionally, the Water Quality Program conducts research on a wide variety of topics related to the Klamath River and its

tributaries, such as nutrient pollution, pathogenic bacteria and macroinvertebrate abundance. The program also performs Tribal Water Quality Certification for federally and state-funded projects that are subject to National Environmental Policy Act or California Environmental Quality Act compliance and have the potential to impact water quality of surface waters within the Yurok Reservation.

The Yurok Tribe Environmental Department is responsible for protecting tribal lands, air and water resources for the benefit of current and future generations of Yurok people. Led by tribal scientists, the department’s three programs include Water, Community and Ecosystems and Pollution Prevention. An expression of tribal sovereignty, the Environmental team employs science, traditional knowledge and thoughtful regulation to protect and enhance fragile ecosystems within Yurok ancestral territory.

[July 30], U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the approval of the Yurok Tribe’s application for “treatment in a similar manner as a state” under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA). With this authority, the Yurok Tribe in Northern California can develop water quality standards for waters within their reservation, similar to states exercising this authority under Sections 303 and 401 of the CWA. EPA’s approval of this application advances the cooperative federalism pillar of EPA’s Great American Comeback initiative by supporting tribal self-governance to protect water quality.

Josh F.W. Cook, EPA’s Pacific Southwest Region Administrator, presented the signed certificate reflecting this authority to the Yurok Tribe at the Regional Tribal Operations Committee meeting in San Francisco.

“We are pleased to recognize – and formalize – the Yurok Tribe’s authority to protect rivers and streams on their tribal lands,” said Cook. “The Yurok will now be able to more directly safeguard their tribal communities and natural resources. The goal of EPA is Indian Self Determination, self-governance, and returning regulatory responsibilities back to the tribes.”

“Treatment as a state significantly increases our capacity to protect and restore the lower Klamath River, which serves as the spiritual, cultural, and ecological foundation of our existence. We extend our sincere gratitude to the U.S. EPA for its formal recognition of our sovereign authority and demonstrated ability to effectively regulate water quality within our homeland,” said Joseph L. James, the Chairman of the Yurok Tribe.

After tribes seeking this “treatment as a state” authority develop water quality standards and gain EPA approval, they directly administer surface water quality standards. EPA’s decision promotes tribal self-government, empowering tribes to issue water quality certifications for actions on their lands requiring federal permits.

There are now 32 tribes in EPA’s Pacific Southwest Region with this authority. With this approval for the Yurok, all Klamath River Basin tribes in the Pacific Southwest, including the Hoopa Valley Tribe, Karuk Tribe, Quartz Valley Indian Reservation, and Pulikla Tribe of Yurok People, have achieved this status.

“The endangerment finding has been the basis for our work at the federal level, and limiting pollution and climate emissions.

“It just fuels my passion,” said Susan Theberge, co-founder of Climate Action Now Western Massachusetts. “We have to work at the state level and at the municipal level, which is where we have power right now. We are holding the line.”

On Tuesday, the EPA published a proposal that revokes the “endangerment finding,” a 2009 decision that defined carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as harmful to human health. The 16-year-old determination officially classified these gases as air pollution that the agency could regulate under the Clean Air Act. Now, the agency walked back its definition, claiming that air pollution is best defined as “local or regional exposure to dangerous air pollution.”

“It’s really a criminal act in the big picture,” said Andra Rose, president of Local Energy Advocates of Western Mass. “The endangerment finding has been the basis for our work at the federal level, and limiting pollution and climate emissions. It discourages being able to do anything at the federal level.”

Local activists like Theberge interpret the proposal as “gaslighting” their daily experiences with climate change and as part of the Trump administration’s attempts to deny global warming. With the federal government’s stance on climate action clearly communicated, they’re setting their sights on advocating for state climate legislation and combating new fossil fuel projects in Springfield.

“For them to be making these decisions right now when we are in the middle of the heat wave and we see huge amounts of smoke wafting from wildfires in the north, when many people are feeling the climate changes in their homes, when people who have asthma have to go to the hospital emergency room, when people with chronic illness like myself are having complications due to the heat, it’s an insult to us and to humanity itself,” said Naia Tenerowicz, lead organizer of the Springfield Climate Justice Coalition.

The EPA proposal also claims that even if the agency could regulate these emissions, greenhouse gases do not have as large an impact on climate change or human health as previously believed. The statement is based on a non peer-reviewed study published by the Department of Energy’s 2025 Climate Working Group, which finds that U.S. policy has relatively small impacts on combating climate change.

In mid-March, EPA rolled back 31 environmental rules that preserve air and water quality and reduce emissions in what Administrator Lee Zeldin called the “greatest day of deregulation in our nation.” Zeldin wrote that he drove “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion” by weakening regulations on power plants, fossil fuel companies and automobiles.

“I’m appalled, but not surprised, that the Environmental Protection Agency is now declaring that it’s not going to protect the environment,” Greening Greenfield leader Peg Hall said. “Greening Greenfield and other such entities are working on making sure that locally — whether that be Greenfield or Massachusetts — we continue to make progress wherever we can, which is a little more under our control.”

An Associated Press examination, which also used data from the EPA itself, found the rollback of these rules would come with a high cost. These regulations, including setting limits for air pollutants, would have saved at least $275 billion a year and more than 30,000 lives annually in the U.S. At least 10,000 of those deaths were related to air pollution and toxic particulate matter such as lead and mercury.

Springfield, the city with the fourth-highest asthma rates in the country, knows that state climate policy can improve quality of life for residents. In an effort to prevent further smog and smoke in the city, the Springfield Climate Justice Coalition is fighting two projects that would expand greenhouse gas emissions in the city: a wood-burning power plant that will burn up to 1,200 tons of wood a day, and an Eversource natural gas pipeline that extends from Longmeadow into Springfield.

Tenerowicz and Rose said they decided to focus on these two projects because the permitting and approvals are at the state and local levels. The elimination of the endangerment finding sent Tenerowicz a clear message that the federal government is “writing off people’s lives as acceptable sacrifice for the economy,” but she said Gov. Maura Healey’s administration continues to move forward with the green transition.

“Right now, we have to do everything we possibly can, and even more than we think we can do, at the municipal and state levels to move swiftly and rapidly to a just energy transition,” Theberge said.

Just before an Eversource open house and listening session on Aug. 7, Climate Action Now Western Massachusetts and the Springfield Climate Justice Coalition will hold a demonstration and letter-writing campaign at 5:15 p.m. in Stearns Square. The organizations are also focusing on state bills H.3547/S.2290 to block further large-scale natural gas infrastructure in environmental justice areas and accelerate the transition to clean, non-combusting heating systems.

In a column in the Daily Hampshire Gazette last week, Darcy Dumont, a former Amherst town councilor and sponsor of legislation creating the town’s Energy and Climate Action Committee, urges residents to support two other pieces of climate action legislation. The Climate Bank Bill would establish an independent bank that finances decarbonization efforts, renewable energy infrastructure and green manufacturing development. The Make Polluters Pay Bill would fine fossil fuel companies for the environmental and health impacts of emissions and leverage the funds into climate adaptation and mitigation projects.

“The one thing that we have on our side is the enormous power of people coming together. This country cannot operate unless we are all cooperative with it,” Theberge said. “The escalation of the climate disaster should give us more energy and passion to stand together. Life on this planet is at stake.”

The quest for more power to meet rising demand from electric vehicles and data centres running artificial intelligence technology has led to an apparent “renaissance” of nuclear energy.

The White House recently posted an op-ed piece exalting U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive orders for reinvigorating America’s nuclear power generation using that just that term, while effusively lauding his agenda to increase the nation’s output by 300 gigawatts by 2050.

That’s enough to power about 300 million homes or, more likely, thousands of data centres for AI, as well as millions of EVs.

Climate change commitments may not be high on the U.S. president’s mind, but it is on China’s list, as it seeks to add as much as 400 GW more from atomic energy by 2050 while aiming to decarbonize its economy.

It’s arguably off a faster start with 119 GW of nuclear power generation in construction or development. India is next in activity with 32 GW potentially under development. The United States is much further behind at eight GW, even trailing nations like France and Poland.

Actual activity and planned growth suggests trillions of dollars being invested in nuclear energy over the coming decades — and investors are intrigued.

“The ducks are coming in a row, finally,” says Scott Clayton, Toronto-based senior analyst for the Canadian Wealth Advisor with the TSI Network in Toronto.

The last time nuclear energy was on an upswing with investors was in the 2000s as oil prices surged. Then, the Fukushima plant disaster in Japan in 2011 put the brakes on nuclear power.

Companies like Cameco Corp. — based in Saskatoon and the world’s largest uranium producer — saw growth put on ice.

That is until recently. Today, Cameco’s share price, fuelled largely by all the talk of plans for new reactors, is at all-time highs.

Although Canada may be an oil and gas powerhouse, its potential as a supplier of the fuel for nuclear energy has arguably more upside. It has the third largest discovered reserves in the world. It is also the second-largest producer behind Kazakhstan and potentially much more production is coming, as exploration companies like NexGen Energy and Paladin Energy look to develop mines in the Athabasca Basin (home to the highest-grade deposits of uranium in the world).

Yet before jumping into a surging industry, driven by the future promise of much more nuclear power (not to mention the unnerving revival of the nuclear arms race), let’s splash a bit of cold water on the overheating rods of speculation.

“It still faces challenges,” Clayton says.

Among them are regulatory concerns. Mining projects in Canada take a notoriously long time to be approved and uranium is particularly tricky, given its environmental impact.

Power plants are equally complicated. The public might appreciate the cheap, abundant power, just don’t generate it close to where they live.

“The other problem is that the costs (of construction) are just astronomical,” Clayton says.

The newest nuclear power generating station in the U.S, for example — two reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia — cost US$35 billion and were behind schedule and over budget.

“We definitely think it’s (nuclear energy) going to be needed,” says Andrew Bischof, senior equity analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.

Yet many projects are far from construction, let alone completion, and a history exists of projects being cancelled, especially in the U.S.

Bischof says many major utility companies are talking about amping up nuclear power, but those are far-away ambitions, part of five- and 10-year plans to build capacity, which could take several more years before that power is added to the grid.

There does seem to be more buzz around small modular reactors, he adds. These are scaled-down power plants that take less time to build, but it’s an emerging technology.

To that end, Canada is a leader with a project underway in Darlington, Ont.

“Duke Energy has also mildly stated that it’s exploring SMRs, but again, that is 2030 to 2035 for a time frame,” Bischof says about the U.S. power provider, which presently has six nuclear power plants in the U.S..

Notably, big tech — Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet (Google) — are considering or currently entering into contracts with power providers, providing cash up front to restart or build new nuclear capacity, often involving small reactors, to meet climate change goals and growing energy-hungry AI capabilities.

The need is substantial. AI is forecast to eat up 20 per cent of new energy growth through 2030. EV expansion is expected to increase demand by 15 per cent.

Whether all this growth translates into future profits remains to be seen.

In the meantime, investors might consider risk-adjusted exposure.

“If you’re looking to invest in more speculative areas, it’s best to get exposure through stocks that already have a solid business,” Clayton says. He points to U.S.-based Constellation Energy Corp. as one viable choice. Nearly 70 per cent of its output is nuclear and it pays a small dividend (0.47 per cent yield).

Another way to invest in this theme is exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investors have close to a handful of choices. One of the longest running is VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF, launched in 2007. It has seen renewed popularity, after peaking in price around 2011.

“(Its) recent asset growth mirrors a broader nuclear renaissance fueled by surging electricity demand, the global pursuit of dependable low carbon power and fresh policy support extending plant life and financing next generation reactors,” says Brandon Rakszawski, director of product management, VanEck in New York.

Its portfolio also holds the aforementioned stocks with Constellation and Cameco among the largest positions.

While the stars might be aligning for nuclear, conditions quickly change — i.e. battery power for renewables — that could make a long-term investment in nuclear suddenly less ideal.

Still, for investors with an appetite for risk and a long time horizon, the nuclear option could power long-term profitability.

E-Cite Motors Group (OTCID:VAPR), an emerging electric vehicle manufacturer, today announced that its stock has dramatically outperformed major electric automakers over the past week and year-to-date. E-Cite's share price closed at $0.0112 on Friday, August 1, up roughly 12% from Monday's $0.0100 opening price. This weekly gain stands in stark contrast to declines in leading EV stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) during the same period. Tesla's stock fell from about $325 on July 28 to $303 by Aug. 1 (approximately, 7% change), while Rivian slipped roughly, 8% (from $13.78 to $12.60), and Lucid dropped roughly, 12% (from $2.79 to $2.46) over the week.

Year-to-date, E-Cite's momentum is even more pronounced. Since January 1, 2025, VAPR shares have nearly doubled in value, rising from around $0.0057 at the start of the year to $0.0112 today (an increase on the order of +96%). In comparison, many EV peers have struggled: Tesla stock is down about 24% for 2025 (opening the year near $379 and recently trading around $308), Lucid has declined roughly 18% YTD, and Rivian remains roughly flat with a modest ~3% dip year-to-date These figures underscore that E-Cite (VAPR) has delivered industry-leading returns for investors so far this year, outpacing even the largest EV manufacturers in percentage gains.

""This exceptional stock performance reflects the unique advantages and progress E-Cite has achieved,"" said Barry Henthorn, CEO of E-Cite Motors. ""We benefit from a special low-volume manufacturing exemption that lets us bring vehicles to market faster and more efficiently than traditional automakers, and our recent technological and strategic milestones are resonating with investors.""

E-Cite operates under the U.S. Low Volume Manufacturers Act, giving it a government exemption from certain costly certification requirements that burden traditional OEMs. Notably, E-Cite's vehicles are produced under a low-volume manufacturing exemption, allowing the company to bypass extensive crash-testing delays and expenses while still meeting all safety and regulatory standards. This streamlines development and approval, enabling E-Cite to deploy new models faster and more efficiently than any traditional OEM, a significant competitive edge that investors recognize. By accelerating time-to-market for its electric vehicles, E-Cite can capitalize on market opportunities more quickly than legacy manufacturers encumbered by bureaucracy.

Recent product breakthroughs and strategic initiatives from E-Cite Motors have further bolstered market confidence. Earlier this month, the company unleashed a next-generation electric driveline for its upcoming American sports cars, doubling performance metrics and setting new benchmarks. The newly unveiled Zero Emissions electric motor spins up to 26,000 RPM (in performance trim), an astonishing leap from the previous 12,000 RPM, and delivers a face-melting 4,000 Nm of torque. This advanced powertrain, paired with dual high-density 90 kWh battery packs, will power E-Cite's EV-GT, EV-C3, and EV-DT models, all built on a common modular aluminum chassis.

""The new motor's RPM increase from 12k to 26k is a game-changer,"" CEO Henthorn noted, emphasizing that it enables blistering acceleration and higher top speeds in a compact, lightweight package.""

Legendary designer Gene Langmesser, E-Cite's COO, added that ""the company's revolutionary chassis was engineered for adaptability, allowing rapid integration of such upgrades across models and giving E-Cite agility that legacy OEMs can't match.""

In addition to cutting-edge technology, E-Cite is leveraging iconic designs to capture the imagination of enthusiasts. This July, the company announced it has secured the design and production rights to the famed 1954 Kaiser-Darrin sports car, an American classic renowned for its elegant lines and distinctive ""pocket"" doors that slide into the fenders. E-Cite will resurrect this legend as the all-electric EV-DT ""Dutch Touch"" model, preserving the Kaiser-Darrin's timeless styling (including the signature sliding doors) while infusing it with state-of-the-art electric performance.

""The Kaiser-Darrin is not just a car, it's rolling sculpture,"" said Gene Langmesser, the vehicle's revival designer and E-Cite's COO, calling the opportunity to modernize it with electric power ""a dream come true"". The EV-DT will share E-Cite's proprietary chassis and driveline with the brand's other models, ensuring that beneath the retro bodywork lies the full might of E-Cite's latest EV technology.

E-Cite's ambition extends to redefining the electric pickup truck segment as well. In June, the company revealed details of its upcoming RJ9 electric pickup, which boasts an unprecedented 900+ mile total range - the highest of any production pickup in the world, whether electric or gasoline. This extraordinary range is achieved via an extended-range EV (EREV) system pairing a 40-kWh battery with a small onboard generator, giving approximately 140 miles of pure electric driving plus hundreds more on generator power. The RJ9's specs are game-changing: 0-60 mph in under 5 seconds, dual-motor AWD, and rapid DC fast-charging (20% to 80% in just 26 minutes). Equally impressive are its luxury features, from zero-gravity massage seats to panoramic displays, which elevate it to an unrivaled level of comfort and tech in the truck category. E-Cite openly touts that the RJ9 will surpass Tesla's Cybertruck, Rivian's R1T, and Ford's F-150 Lightning not only in driving range but in premium appointments, ""raising the bar for the entire truck industry"". Crucially, the RJ9 will also take advantage of E-Cite's low-volume exemption, allowing the company to bring this advanced truck to market swiftly while meeting all safety requirements.

Beyond vehicle development, E-Cite Motors has made strong commitments to American manufacturing that position it favorably amid shifting economic winds. The company recently announced a strategic initiative to dramatically increase its U.S.-based production and sourcing. Key components for E-Cite's vehicles, including body panels, lighting systems, wheels, battery enclosures, chassis assemblies, and even advanced glass, will be sourced from domestic suppliers going forward. This reshoring effort, driven by rising import tariffs and growing consumer demand for American-made EVs, is expected to optimize E-Cite's supply chain, shorten delivery timelines, and enhance production flexibility. E-Cite is currently in the final stages of site selection for expanded U.S. assembly plants, narrowing down locations and finalizing plans for new assembly operations to be announced later this quarter. ""As the economic environment in the U.S. becomes more conducive to advanced manufacturing, E-Cite is proud to bring more of our production home,"" Henthorn said, underscoring that investing in American jobs and infrastructure is a win-win for the company and its customers. ""By expanding domestic manufacturing, E-Cite aims to further differentiate itself from competitors while ensuring capacity to meet the anticipated demand for its vehicles.""

It confirmed that increasing solar generation by 15% in the northern country could lead to an annual reduction of 8.54 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).

More solar energy in the United States, less CO2 in the air

The research team demonstrated that the climate benefits of solar energy vary by region, clearly indicating where investments in clean energy generate greater environmental dividends.

“This study is exciting because it uses the power of data science to provide useful information to public policy makers and stakeholders on how to advance CO₂ reduction goals,” explained Francesca Dominici, director of the Harvard Data Science Initiative and lead author of the study.

The advantages of solar energy.

The study was based on the analysis of five years of hourly data (since July 2018) on electric generation, demand, and emissions, covering 13 energy regions in the country: California, Texas, Florida, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Carolinas, New York, New England, Southeast, Southwest, Tennessee, Central region, and the Northwest.

Through an advanced statistical model, it was possible to quantify for the first time the reduction in both immediate and deferred emissions resulting from the increase in solar generation:

In California, a 15% increase in solar energy at noon resulted in a reduction of 147.18 metric tons of CO2 in the first hour; and 16.08 metric tons eight hours later.

This type of impact also benefits neighboring regions. For example, the same capacity increase in California generated daily reductions of 913 tons in the Northwest and 1942 metric tons in the Southwest.

Solar energy is still a minority compared to fossil fuels

According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, 60% of the electricity generated in the country came from fossil fuels, while only 3.9% came from solar energy.

Solar energy is still a minority.

This reality positions the expansion of renewable sources as a key tool not only to reduce CO2 emissions but also to improve public health. It reduces exposure to atmospheric pollutants such as fine particles (PM2.5), associated with diseases, hospitalizations, and premature deaths.

Where solar energy performs best

The results indicate that areas like California, Florida, Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southwest, and the Midwest would achieve significant climate benefits, even with modest increases in solar generation.",https://noticiasambientales.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/energia-solar-1024x681.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 18:03:18.316501

Strategic Opportunities for Investors Despite these challenges, Florida's solar market presents a unique set of opportunities for investors who can navigate its complexities.
Investors should prioritize diversification: pairing Florida solar projects with storage or grid infrastructure in states with stable policies (e.g., Texas or Georgia).
The Bigger Picture Florida's solar story is emblematic of a broader shift in U.S. energy markets.
For investors, the key takeaway is clear: Florida's solar surge is not a flash in the pan but a strategic inflection point.","In the shadow of Texas's sprawling wind farms and California's solar sprawl, Florida has quietly emerged as a critical player in the U.S. renewable energy transition. By Q1 2025, the state added over 3 gigawatts of new utility-scale solar capacity, with Florida Power & Light (FPL) accounting for 70% of these installations. This growth has positioned Florida as the second-largest utility-scale solar market in the U.S., trailing only Texas, and third in total solar installations, with 20,065 megawatts of capacity now powering over 2.35 million homes. The state's solar boom is not just a story of scale—it's a masterclass in policy alignment, corporate demand, and economic pragmatism.

The Drivers of Florida's Solar Momentum

Florida's solar surge is fueled by three pillars: abundant natural resources, streamlined policy, and corporate demand. The state's average of 5.5 peak sun hours daily makes it one of the sunniest in the nation, while its levelized cost of utility-scale solar ($25/MWh) now outcompetes fossil fuels even without subsidies. Meanwhile, tech giants like Meta, Amazon, and Verizon have secured large-scale solar contracts, driven by ESG mandates and rising grid electricity costs. These corporations are not just passive buyers—they are reshaping the energy landscape by demanding long-term reliability and price stability.

Policy, however, remains a double-edged sword. The recent One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA), enacted in July 2025, has introduced a “use-it-or-lose-it” scenario for developers. The bill phases out the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) from 30% to 80% by 2029 and eliminates it by 2032, forcing developers to accelerate permitting and construction. While this creates short-term urgency, it also risks destabilizing the market for smaller firms lacking capital to meet aggressive deadlines.

Strategic Opportunities for Investors

Despite these challenges, Florida's solar market presents a unique set of opportunities for investors who can navigate its complexities.

Tax Credit Arbitrage: Developers with projects in pre-construction phases can still lock in the 30% ITC by starting construction by July 2026. This creates a narrow but lucrative window for investors to capitalize on tax equity financing before incentives erode.

Grid Infrastructure and Storage: As solar penetration grows, grid modernization becomes critical. FPL's $300 million investment in battery storage by 2026 underscores the need for resilient infrastructure. Investors in smart inverters, grid software, and battery systems stand to benefit from this trend.

Microgrid Partnerships: Advanced Green Technologies (AGT) is pioneering microgrid projects across Florida, integrating solar, storage, and AI-driven energy management for industrial clients. These systems offer energy independence and are projected to grow at a 18.2% CAGR through 2030.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies

The primary risks—policy volatility and supply chain constraints—require careful hedging. The OBBBA's rapid ITC phase-out could stifle long-term growth if not amended, while tariffs on Chinese solar modules (30%) have inflated equipment costs by 15–20%. Smaller projects with thin margins are particularly vulnerable.

Investors should prioritize diversification: pairing Florida solar projects with storage or grid infrastructure in states with stable policies (e.g., Texas or Georgia). Timing is also critical—focusing on projects that can secure the 2026 ITC deadline while building buffers for potential regulatory shifts.

The Bigger Picture

Florida's solar story is emblematic of a broader shift in U.S. energy markets. Unlike states with renewable portfolio standards, Florida's growth has been driven by utility innovation and corporate demand. This model—where private sector needs align with economic incentives—offers a blueprint for scaling renewables in markets resistant to top-down mandates.

For investors, the key takeaway is clear: Florida's solar surge is not a flash in the pan but a strategic inflection point. The state's abundant sunlight, corporate partnerships, and utility investments create a compelling case for clean energy infrastructure. However, the window for tax-advantaged projects is closing rapidly. Those who act now—while hedging against policy risks—will be well-positioned to capitalize on a market that is reshaping the future of American energy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 17:02:43.465110

WEAs were initially established to identify offshore locations suitable for wind energy development.
Offshore wind means energy production without the carbon emissions that make storms stronger, flooding worse, and economic disruptions to local economies more severe.
“A great move by the Trump administration which will protect coastal communities and taxpayers from risky, foreign-controlled projects,” said Maryland Rep. Andy Harris.","WASHINGTON—The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced this week that it is rescinding all designated Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), an action that will de-designate over 3.5 million acres of federal waters previously targeted for offshore wind development.

The decision was made in accordance with a Secretarial Order and a Presidential Memorandum, which aim to end what the Trump administration calls “preferential treatment for unreliable, foreign controlled energy sources.”

The de-designated areas span the Gulf of America, Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, California, Oregon and the Central Atlantic.

WEAs were initially established to identify offshore locations suitable for wind energy development. The rescission effectively ends the federal practice of designating large swaths of the OCS for speculative wind development.

The move follows Secretary’s Order 3437, titled “Ending Preferential Treatment for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources in Department Decision-Making,” and a Presidential Memorandum from Jan. 20, 2025, which called for a “Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the OCS from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects.”

Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul G. Pinsky on Friday issued the following statement in response to BOEM’s announcement:

“The Trump administration’s latest attack on renewable energy is an insult to America’s economy, energy independence, and the public’s common sense. Offshore wind means good jobs in places that need them. Offshore wind means energy production without the carbon emissions that make storms stronger, flooding worse, and economic disruptions to local economies more severe. And offshore wind means expanded clean energy production for a state, regional grid and country that all need more reliable energy in a bad way.

“More disappointing than its failure of leadership toward more responsible energy is this administration’s tendency to try to use energy policy to change the narrative away from less-then-desirable headlines. The people of Maryland – and beyond – simply deserve a better national energy policy than one based on needless distraction when the news cycle suits. I look forward to continuing to work to move forward the thoroughly studied, much needed, and economically beneficial offshore wind projects slated for Maryland.”

Other local elected officials, however, are applauding the decision.

Community solar power is one of my favorite cleantech solutions. It’s helpful in multiple ways, and can often play that “Goldilocks” role of being “just right” — not too big, and not too small. It enables more solar power for more individuals, and benefits from certain economies of scale to bring down costs — maybe not as much as gigawatt-level utility-scale solar projects, but more than home rooftop solar projects.

What you don’t often see is community solar projects and corporate commercial solar projects. However, that seems to be what giant global logistics real estate company Prologis is working on. The company is getting a series of large rooftop solar installations and deploying them as community solar projects.

The first community solar rooftop project was launched this week in Franklin Park, Illinois. It is the first of what are expected to be 45 such solar projects totaling 82 megawatts (MW). For some more perspective, while community solar is getting quite big in Illinois (and some other states), there are currently just around 200 community solar projects in the Land of Lincoln. Adding 45 more is a huge increase for the sector.

“More than half of the energy credits will be directed to income-qualified households, expanding access to clean energy in underserved communities in the Chicago area and beyond,” a press release states.

The project was launched by Prologis alongside ComEd, the region’s utility company. “We’re proud to join ComEd to officially launch this project, the first of many community solar projects that our energy team is deploying across our Illinois rooftops,” said Carter Andrus, Prologis’ Chief Operating Officer. “Illinois is one of the fastest-growing solar markets in the country, and we’re excited to help lead its momentum. For us, this is about more than solar panels—it’s about using our scale to make a real difference in the communities where we operate and bring the benefits of clean energy to more people across Illinois.”

Indeed. We love cleantech because it cuts CO2 emissions and other pollution, but when it is also used to help socioeconomic issues and inequity, it’s extra heartwarming.

“As we continue to support the expansion of solar across northern Illinois, new and planned Prologis rooftop solar sites promise to provide northern Illinois customers additional options for lowering their energy costs via renewable energy connected to the grid,” said Gil Quiniones, President and CEO of ComEd. “With dozens of additional projects in the pipeline, we are seeing the effect of the pro-solar incentives put in place by Gov. JB Pritzker’s administration and how they support a cleaner, more equitable energy future in our state.”

“Illinois policymakers have worked hard on policy that encourages businesses like Prologis to grow and our energy sector to expand, especially in renewable energy,” said Illinois House Majority Leader Robyn Gabel, 18th District. “It’s exciting to see the fruits of CEJA, one of the most expansive energy bills in the country come to fruition with vital initiatives like this one, reinforcing Illinois’ leadership in community solar.”

“I’m happy to stand with ComEd and Prologis as we celebrate the launch of this community solar project right here in Franklin Park,” said State Representative Norma Hernandez, 77th District. “By leveraging underutilized industrial rooftops, we’re not only expanding access to clean, renewable energy—we’re ensuring that working families in our communities can directly benefit from lower utility costs and a more resilient energy grid. This is a smart, community-centered model for how we decarbonize equitably and sustainably. Thank you for your leadership and bringing this to the 77th District.”

Here are some more details on this first rooftop community solar project from Prologis: “SunVest Solar, a national developer and independent power producer, designed the Franklin Park 3 rooftop community solar installation atop a 195,000-square-foot Prologis logistics center. Prologis will own and operate the 1.56 MW community solar project, which will serve mostly residential customers, with the remaining community solar credits benefiting local businesses.”

Lastly, here’s a bit more on community solar in Illinois and why this is becoming a bigger and bigger sector of the Illinois solar market: “The 2016 Future Energy Jobs Act created Illinois’ community solar program, and the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) made it stronger. Since the passage of CEJA, there has been a 400% increase in connected community solar — 4x the capacity of Community Solar that was installed in 2024 vs. 2023. ComEd expects to have 240 community solar sites on its system by the end of 2025, producing 520MW and powering about 71,000 homes.” I love it! This is the way to go. Kudos to Illinois for taking a lead on this, and now also Prologis for jumping right in. I know it helps Prologis’ bottom line, but it still deserves a pat on the back for the insight, vision, and care.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Prologis-community-solar-roof-Illinois.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 17:01:47.221395

Many have announced new affordable models, with the latest being the upcoming Chevrolet Bolt. The electric crossover will slot beneath the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which is already one of the most affordable battery-powered cars in the US.

Chevrolet is only one of the carmakers trying to fill the void Tesla left in the market when it canceled plans to build the next-generation compact EV. Ford also enters the fray with several compact EVs based on an all-new EV architecture. Unlike other carmakers, Ford outsourced the development to a ""skunkworks team,"" and promised to showcase the results on August 11. Ford is also present on the market with the Mustang Mach-E, which has a very attractive price these days.

Even though it abandoned plans for a compact EV, Tesla still works on a stripped-down variant of the Model Y. By eliminating all the unnecessary features, Tesla promises a much lower price point for its best-selling EV. Whether this will be enough to compensate for the loss of the federal tax credits or will just be a mildly popular trim of the Model Y, we'll find out soon enough. Until then, it's worth remembering that Tesla's cheapest models are also some of the longest-range EVs on the market.

As you can see, carmakers are concerned that customers might shy away from buying an electric vehicle because of the higher price. Their concerns are a boon for buyers of electric vehicles. Many electric cars sold now in the US are quite affordable, and some still have two months of $7,500 tax credit ahead to lure customers. If you're in the market for a new EV, we've compiled a list of the most affordable EVs sold today in the US market.

1. Nissan Leaf S

Price: $28,140

Power: 147 horsepower

Battery capacity: 40 kWh

Range: 149 miles The second-generation Nissan Leaf is in its final model year, with a replacement expected to launch later this year. Until then, Nissan is trying its best to keep sales alive. Not many people want an already obsolete EV, especially when they know something better is just around the corner. This explains why the Nissan Leaf is the most affordable EV in our roundup.

The Nissan Leaf S 40 kWh is probably not the best EV for road trips, considering its 149 miles (240 km) of range, but it could be a decent solution for a short commute. Although the range is unimpressive, the Leaf has an ace up its sleeve: Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) support, making it a smart choice for remote homes.

The Nissan Leaf SV Plus 60 kWh can take you further, up to 212 miles (341 km) on a charge, but the price starts at $36,190, dangerously close to the vastly superior Ariya. It's probably not wise to buy it when much better alternatives exist for less money.

2. Fiat 500e

Price: $32,595

Power: 117 horsepower

Battery capacity: 42 kWh

Range: 162 miles This subcompact car might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a fashionable EV that can appeal to those looking for a city-friendly vehicle. The price is reasonable, and the 162-mile range is enough for the short trips around town. If this sounds underwhelming, well, the Fiat 500e is not suitable for longer trips anyway.

The Fiat 500e is small, barely providing space for two adults, and you're unlikely to feel safe next to a full-size truck or SUV. The 117-horsepower motor would not impress anyone: the 500e needs 8.5 seconds to reach 60 mph (97 kph) from a standstill.

What it lacks in space and performance, the Fiat 500e tries to compensate for with technology and creature comforts. It has a 10.25-inch center screen with Uconnect 5 services and a 7-inch full digital cluster. The former features Android Automotive OS, the Alexa virtual assistant, as well as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

3. Chevrolet Equinox EV FWD LT1

Price: $31,995 (with $3,000 discount)

Power: 220 horsepower

Battery capacity: 85 kWh

Range: 319 miles The Chevrolet Equinox EV is probably the best buy in the EV market right now, thanks to its reasonable price and 319-mile range. On top of that, Chevrolet offers a $3,000 discount on the already low $34,995 starting price. The LT2 trim is more expensive, at $43,295, but since it's offered with the same $3,000 discount, it can still make it to this ranking.

Despite the low price, the Equinox EV has an attractive design and practical features. This explains why it has become GM's best-selling EV in recent months. Even the LT1 trim comes equipped with 19-inch aluminum wheels and Google Built-in for the 17.7-inch touchscreen infotainment system. The feature list also includes an 11-inch digital instrument cluster.

The FWD variant is the most affordable and has the highest range, at 319 miles (513 km). An optional AWD variant with a range of 307 miles (494 km) is also offered, starting at $37,295 with the $3,000 discount mentioned above.

4. Ford Mustang Mach-E RWD Select

Price: $34,435 (with $6,250 discount)

Power: 264 horsepower

Battery capacity: 73 kWh

Range: 260 miles Once touted as a Tesla Model Y killer, the Ford Mustang Mach-E has since become the poor man's electric crossover. Thousands lie around at Ford dealerships across the country, which is why you might get a sweet deal if you buy one.

Ford lures customers with a whopping $6,250 discount, turning the Mustang Mach-E into an opportunity. Even at MSRP, the Mustang Mach-E provides plenty of reasons to choose it, although buyers might be better served by other models in that price bracket.

The best quality of the Mustang Mach-E is that it lives up to its name and can be very agile despite weighing more than 4,500 lbs./2,000 kg. Even in the base trim, the electric pony is pretty agile and can do 0-60 in 5.8 seconds. The downside is a more rigid suspension, which affects comfort.

5. Hyundai Kona EV SE

Price: starting at $34,470

Power: 133 horsepower

Battery capacity: 49 kWh

Range: 200 miles Unlike the fancier Hyundai Ioniq 5, the Kona Electric doesn't use the E-GMP architecture. This makes it less efficient and less technologically advanced. The upside is the more affordable price, which puts it in the Top 5 of this roundup. The $32,675 SE trim is rather limited in range, considering you can't go more than 200 miles (322 km) on a charge.

Hyundai claims it developed the Kona as an EV-first and squeezed the combustion engine inside the ICE and hybrid variants of the crossover. However, the design doesn't look optimized for aerodynamic efficiency. On the other hand, the cabin space is great, and Hyundai offers a modern dashboard with plenty of features.

The charging is not its strong point, though, as the Kona Electric needs 45 minutes to charge from 10% to 80% when hooked to a 100-kW DC charging station. That's also the maximum power it supports, so it's not great for road trips. Unlike the E-GMP electric vehicles, the Kona Electric doesn't support bi-directional charging and doesn't have an 800-volt electrical system.

6. Toyota bZ4X XLE

Price: $38,520

Power: 201 horsepower

Battery capacity: 71 kWh

Range: 252 miles Toyota has long been reluctant to embrace electric vehicles. Its first model, the bZ4X crossover, was plagued with issues, although the Japanese carmaker has solved most of them and improved the bZ4X tremendously. For the 2025 model year, Toyota enhanced the charging experience, one of the issues many people complained about.

The 2025 Toyota bZ4X also has an improved thermal management system, offering a better ownership experience in cold climates. Not only that, but the standard equipment has also been upgraded, with the base version XLE getting an 8-way power-adjustable driver's seat and power liftgate for easy access.

Although the bZ4X is spacious and comfortable, it's not particularly practical, missing a glove compartment and a frunk. Charging it at a DC charger also takes longer than many modern EVs. Toyota claims about 30 minutes for a typical 10%-80% charge when charged at a 150-kW+ DC fast charger.

7. Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE SR

Price: starting at $39,095

Power: 149 horsepower

Battery capacity: 53 kWh

Range: 240 miles Hyundai Ioniq 6's design looks bizarre to many people, but it's a direct result of aerodynamic optimizations. The electric sedan boasts an impressive 0.22 drag coefficient, resulting from painstaking fine-tuning in the wind tunnel. This makes it the longest-range EV in Hyundai's lineup, but only when fitted with the extended range battery.

The standard range model, which is also the most affordable, has a smaller battery pack, at 53 kWh. Coupled with the 149-horsepower motor, it can power the Ioniq 6 for up to 240 miles on a charge. It doesn't sound like much, but it's more than most people need during their daily commutes.

The Korean electric sedan offers exciting features like bi-directional charging and an impressive driver-assistance package. Thanks to its 800-volt architecture, the Hyundai Ioniq 6 is one of the fastest-charging EVs on the planet, needing only 18 minutes to go from 10% to 80% when hooked to a 350-kW+ charger.

8. Nissan Ariya FWD Engage

Price: $39,770

Power: 214 horsepower

Battery capacity: 63 kWh

Range: 216 miles Despite being one of the first to launch an electric vehicle (Leaf, in 2010), Nissan has lost steam in the EV market. The second-generation Leaf has not been very successful, and the Ariya crossover seems to share its fate. Nissan Ariya has decent specs, but availability has been an issue due to production constraints.

The Nissan Ariya is roomy and comfortable, making it a decent proposition. Connectivity features and safety assist systems abound, and it doesn't lack comfort features either. Still, the pricing is rather bold, especially when pitted against the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which offers better specs at a lower price.

The affordable trim Engage has an FWD configuration and is powered by a 214-hp electric motor. The battery pack has 63 kWh, which is only enough for 216 miles of range. Charging is limited to 130 kW, which leads to long charging times. Nissan claims 35 minutes are needed to charge the battery from 10% to 80%.

9. Subaru Solterra Premium

Price: starting at $40,390

Power: 215 horsepower

Battery capacity: 73 kWh

Range: 227 miles If the Solterra looks familiar, it's because it's a Toyota bZ4X in disguise. However, unlike the Toyota, it's only available in a dual-motor configuration. Toyota has made some upgrades with the 2025 model year, but Subaru will only offer them with the 2026 model year, which arrives later this year.

The Solterra charges from 10% to 80% in 35 minutes, which is still slower than most EVs. The Japanese EV only supports DC fast charging at up to 100 kW. The AC charging is also limited to 6.6 kW, which means a full charge can take up to 11 hours.

Subaru packs Eye-Sight with supervised hands-free driving up to 25 mph (40 kph) as standard. The Solterra also comes standard with roof rails with a static load capacity rated up to 700 pounds (318 kg). However, the base Premium trim lacks some fancier driver assistance and convenience features in the higher trims.

10. Kia Niro EV Wind

Price: starting at $41,045

Power: 201 horsepower

Battery capacity: 65 kWh

Range: 253 miles Kia Niro EV is closely related to the Hyundai Kona Electric, sharing the same vehicle architecture. However, it sports a larger, 65-kWh battery pack, allowing it to travel up to 253 miles on a charge, significantly more than the Kona EV.

As Kia's entry-level EV, the Niro EV doesn't have a heat pump fitted as standard, so make sure you buy it with the Preserve Package if you're living in a colder region. On the plus side, the equipment is rich, even in the Wind base trim. Goodies include dual 10.25-inch screens for the instrument cluster and infotainment system, an eight-speaker audio system from Harman Kardon, and a bi-tone interior theme for the Wave top trim.

A comprehensive driver-assist package is also standard, making the Niro EV a compelling proposition. Those looking for even more options and an arguably better EV experience should consider the Kia EV6, which starts at $44,395 and is also available as an AWD electric crossover.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/top-10-most-affordable-electric-vehicles-in-the-us-right-before-the-ev-credit-goes-away-255310_1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-02 15:00:04.215466

In fact, thanks to Trump and Republicans’ attacks on clean energy, utilities have requested $29 billion in electricity rate hikes in the first half of 2025 alone.
According to CNN and Energy Innovation, Republican states, including Missouri, Kentucky and South Carolina, could see 13% to 14% increase in energy costs over the next decade.
Our bill would stop these energy hikes in their tracks and lower costs for working families across the country.
We need more energy in America, not higher prices—and the fastest, cheapest way to get there is clean energy, like solar and wind.","Washington, D.C. – Today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR) led Senate Democrats in introducing legislation to reverse the tax hikes on clean energy Republicans passed in their “Big, Ugly Betrayal,” which would raise energy costs for Americans by hundreds of dollars, kill almost a million jobs, and shrink GPD by $1.1 trillion.

Today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, Ron Wyden (D-OR), led Senate Democrats in introducing the Lowering Electric Bills Act, which would repeal the Trump and Senate Republicans’ extreme energy tax and restore the domestic energy incentives that were on track to keep electricity affordable, create millions of good-paying jobs, and position America as a global leader in fast-growing industries.

Energy Innovation estimates that the Republicans’ tax hikes will cost American families and small businesses over $33 billion over the next ten years. Trump’s extreme budget stripped away support for wind and solar, the most affordable energy sources – which will drive up electricity bills for American small businesses and families by as much as 18% over the next decade. This is not theoretical – it is already happening. In fact, thanks to Trump and Republicans’ attacks on clean energy, utilities have requested $29 billion in electricity rate hikes in the first half of 2025 alone. According to CNN and Energy Innovation, Republican states, including Missouri, Kentucky and South Carolina, could see 13% to 14% increase in energy costs over the next decade. In Missouri and Kentucky, energy costs could increase by $640 and $630 a year, respectively. Additionally, by increasing taxes on solar and wind projects, the Republicans’ “Big, Ugly Betrayal” increased taxes on more than 90% of new electricity projects set to come online in the next five years. Experts predict this will result in the U.S. losing out on 340 gigawatts of power, equivalent to more than 3 times the current U.S. nuclear power fleet, at a time when we need more power not less.

For months, Senate Democrats have been sounding the alarm on Republicans’ new taxes on clean energy, which will do nothing more than raise prices on families, cede American energy dominance to China, and ship American jobs overseas. Now, they are taking action and working to reverse the harm that Senate Republicans are placing on American families.

“Americans are already struggling to pay to power their homes and businesses every month. But instead of helping, Republicans handed a massive tax break to the wealthy and Big Oil—then paid for it by jacking up your energy bills,” said Leader Schumer. “Senate Democrats are fighting back. Our bill would stop these energy hikes in their tracks and lower costs for working families across the country. We need more energy in America, not higher prices—and the fastest, cheapest way to get there is clean energy, like solar and wind. But instead of investing in our future, Senate Republicans bowed to Big Oil and slapped a tax on nearly every new power project in the country. That’s bad for families, bad for jobs, and a gift to China. Senate Democrats are here to fix it.”

“Donald Trump doesn’t like the sight of wind turbines near his resorts and he’s sold out the federal government to Big Oil lobbyists and executives, so maybe it shouldn’t come as a surprise that he and Republicans are nuking the wind and solar industries in America and forcing Americans to pay higher energy bills,” said Senator Wyden. “ At a time when data centers are gobbling up huge amounts of energy, we need every electron we can get on the grid, and the cheapest and fastest way to produce energy is solar. What Trump and Republicans are doing to clean energy in America is a level of economic self-sabotage we’ve never seen in modern times, and American families and small businesses will suffer for it.”

The legislation is co-sponsored by Patty Murray (D-WA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Jack Reed (D-RI), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Ed Markey (D-MA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Coons (D-DE), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Angus King (I-ME), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Tina Smith (D-MN), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).

Ford’s decision echoes a similar $3 billion credit line it opened in 2023 during the height of pandemic-related uncertainties, as reported by Ford Authority.
Industry insiders suggest this loan might also preempt any credit rating downgrades, preserving access to favorable borrowing terms.
Analysts from Moody’s have indicated that while Ford’s liquidity remains strong at over $45 billion total, persistent external pressures like recession fears could test this buffer.
Ultimately, this $3 billion commitment positions Ford to weather short-term storms, but its success hinges on broader economic recovery and policy stability.","Ford Motor Co. has secured a $3 billion term loan commitment from a syndicate of lenders led by JPMorgan Chase & Co., a move disclosed in a recent SEC Form 8-K filing that underscores the automaker’s strategy to bolster liquidity amid mounting economic pressures. The agreement, effective July 28, 2025, provides Ford with a one-year drawdown period, requiring the company to maintain at least $4 billion in cash reserves during that time. This financial maneuver comes as Ford navigates a challenging environment marked by potential tariff hikes, slowing demand for electric vehicles, and broader recession fears.

Details from the filing reveal that the loan is unsecured, signaling a vote of confidence from lenders despite Ford’s BBB- credit rating from S&P Global Ratings, which places it at the lower end of investment-grade status. Analysts note that this rating reflects vulnerabilities to adverse economic conditions, including supply-chain disruptions and fluctuating raw material costs. Ford’s decision echoes a similar $3 billion credit line it opened in 2023 during the height of pandemic-related uncertainties, as reported by Ford Authority.

Tariffs and Policy Shifts Amplify Financial Strain

The timing of this loan aligns closely with escalating trade tensions, particularly under the specter of renewed tariffs on imported goods. President Donald Trump’s administration has signaled potential increases that could add up to $2 billion in headwinds for Ford this year alone, according to the company’s recent earnings call. Posts on X from industry watchers, including those from CBT News, highlight how these tariffs are exacerbating cash flow issues, with Ford projecting “rocky times ahead” as costs for steel and aluminum rise.

In a detailed report, Automotive Dive emphasizes that while the loan enhances Ford’s financial flexibility, it also points to proactive risk management in an industry grappling with slowing EV adoption. Ford’s second-quarter 2025 results showed adjusted EBIT of $2.1 billion, beating expectations, but the company revised its full-year guidance downward, citing a net tariff impact of approximately $2 billion—higher than the previously estimated $1.5 billion.

Strategic Implications for Ford’s Operations

Beyond immediate liquidity, this credit facility could support Ford’s ongoing investments in electrification and autonomous technologies, areas where the company has committed billions despite market headwinds. For instance, recent X posts from SEC Filings Digest confirm the loan’s structure as a term loan for operational financing, with covenants tied to liquidity maintenance. This setup allows Ford to draw funds as needed without immediate repayment pressure, a critical buffer as auto sales soften globally.

Comparisons to peers like General Motors, which has maintained stronger cash positions, underscore Ford’s relative caution. As noted in coverage from Detroit Free Press, Ford ended the first quarter of 2025 with about $35 billion in cash, but ongoing expenditures on EV battery plants and software development are straining resources. Industry insiders suggest this loan might also preempt any credit rating downgrades, preserving access to favorable borrowing terms.

Broader Industry Context and Lender Confidence

JPMorgan’s role as administrative agent isn’t coincidental; the bank has a history of facilitating large-scale financing for automakers, including a 2024 risk transfer deal linked to a $3 billion loan portfolio, per BNN Bloomberg. For Ford, this partnership reflects lender optimism in the company’s turnaround plan, which includes cost-cutting measures and a pivot toward profitable truck and SUV segments amid EV market volatility.

However, not all signals are positive. Sentiment on X, including from Traders Community, points to Ford’s Q2 2025 warnings on elevated costs and a revised adjusted free cash flow outlook of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion—down from prior estimates. This loan, while unsecured, carries interest rates tied to SOFR plus a margin, potentially adding to Ford’s debt burden if drawn upon extensively.

Looking Ahead: Risks and Opportunities

Ford’s executives, in statements accompanying the filing, framed the loan as a “prudent step” to ensure resilience, especially with another tariff deadline looming. As detailed in The Detroit News, the automaker is also contending with shifting emissions regulations, which could necessitate further capital outlays. Analysts from Moody’s have indicated that while Ford’s liquidity remains strong at over $45 billion total, persistent external pressures like recession fears could test this buffer.

Ultimately, this $3 billion commitment positions Ford to weather short-term storms, but its success hinges on broader economic recovery and policy stability. For industry observers, it serves as a barometer of the auto sector’s fragility, where even legacy giants like Ford must continually fortify their finances against unpredictable global forces.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-fc515677-8dbd-4689-8520-53b2b55c6e39.jpeg,N,,2025-08-02 17:02:35.819701

Trump has changed their agenda,Ashley Miznazi,,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/climate-change/article311521136.html,"Agencies that previously supported the youth-led effort, including the White House Climate Policy Office and the State Department’s climate negotiation team, have been dissolved.
The statement crafted at this year’s conference will still be presented on national and international stages, including the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) in Brazil this year.
At a beach cleanup Friday morning ahead of the event, many delegates told the Herald they remain determined to push for local change, even as federal climate policy backslides.
De Marneffe said they chose Miami as the conference’s location to show students what ground zero for climate change looks like.
“South Florida is no stranger to a hostile political climate, and Floridians are on the front lines,” de Marneffe said.","Young climate activists from across the U.S. are gathering in Miami for a major conference this weekend to learn how to draft and advocate for policies that could shape the world they’ll soon inherit.

“This is our future, and a lot of times we don’t even have a say,” said Parishay Azer, a 17-year-old from California. “But with conferences like these, our opinions are heard and it gives us the confidence to go to other places and speak out.”

For the past three years, the Local Conference of Youth (LCOY) has collaborated with the federal government to produce a national youth climate statement outlining recommendations for the how the U.S. should deal with spiraling concerns, from rising temperatures to more extreme weather events.

This year, things look different.

Under the Trump administration, federal engagement has dried up. Agencies that previously supported the youth-led effort, including the White House Climate Policy Office and the State Department’s climate negotiation team, have been dissolved. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has also pulled back support. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, wants to largely end regulation of greenhouse gases driving much of the global climate problems

Despite the setbacks, organizers say the youth movement is looking for ways to adapt as they meet at the University of Miami’s alumni center and law school this weekend after a beach cleanup early Friday.

Coco de Marneffe, LCOY’s lead coordinator, said the federal pullout was discouraging but they were shifting focus from federal authorities to local and state representatives. South Florida counties have lead the way in acknowledging the mounting problems and already have spent billions to reduce the risks of sea-rise and other climate-driven concerns.

The statement crafted at this year’s conference will still be presented on national and international stages, including the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) in Brazil this year.

“Our federal government isn’t showing up and if civil society doesn’t show up we could be left out of the international discussion,” Marneffe said.

The LCOY conference will bring together students and young adults from 40 different states. The youngest delegate is a 12-year-old from New Jersey and the oldest is a 35-year-old from Florida.

At a beach cleanup Friday morning ahead of the event, many delegates told the Herald they remain determined to push for local change, even as federal climate policy backslides.

Morgan Brown, a 25-year-old from Denver, Colorado said the news surrounding the White House pull back on research and regulation is overwhelming, “but we can still create change in our local governments.”

Nitya Nekkauti, a university student from Ohio, said the conference offers a rare chance to share strategies across state lines.

“Since we are focusing on the state level, it’s a good chance to compare issues in different states and take ideas from each other,” she said.

De Marneffe said they chose Miami as the conference’s location to show students what ground zero for climate change looks like. Throughout the weekend, delegates will attend workshops on policy writing, speaking to politicians and grassroots organizing. They’ll also hear from local leaders, including State Rep. Anna Eskamani, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, and Miccosukee environmentalist Betty Osceola.

“South Florida is no stranger to a hostile political climate, and Floridians are on the front lines,” de Marneffe said. “The youth who will inherit this messy, messy world represent the best of us.”

Energy services and small business growth Representatives from Repsol, Seneca Resources, Costy’s Energy, and others shared real-world perspectives on operating in Pennsylvania’s natural gas fields.","A federal lawmaker serving Williamsport viewed a high-level roundtable discussion this week on energy, manufacturing and expanding opportunity in Pennsylvania’s rural communities as a step to chart a path forward for regional growth.

The two-and-a-half hour roundtable, held at the Pennsylvania College of Technology’s Thompson Professional Development Center, was co-sponsored by the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, Pennsylvania College of Technology and Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce.

The event marked a continued effort by U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Dallas, and his colleagues to bring federal policymakers into direct conversation with those creating jobs, training the next generation, and building energy capacity across Pennsylvania.

The discussion — on a round table — served as a platform to discuss how federal policy can better align with regional success models – focusing on workforce development, energy infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing. It was introduced by state Rep. Jamie Flick, R-South Williamsport, a college alum. Flick is among the House members working on projects mentioned at the conference along with future economic development in the region in Union and Lycoming counties in the 83rd House district.

“This roundtable underscored the incredible opportunity we have to grow Pennsylvania’s energy economy, support small businesses, and invest in workforce development programs that deliver results,” Meuser said.

“We heard directly from job creators, educators, and innovators who are driving progress in our region,” he said. “Whether it’s strengthening technical education pipelines, modernizing permitting to meet 21st-century demands, or scaling homegrown energy solutions, the discussion was about action — focused, practical, and rooted in what’s working right here in Pennsylvania.”

Meuser added, “Pennsylvania has the resources, the talent, and the entrepreneurial spirit to lead the next chapter of America’s energy and manufacturing renaissance. From the classroom to the jobsite to the boardroom, our Commonwealth is positioned to lead. Today’s dialogue is part of ensuring that federal policy helps — rather than hinders — that momentum by reinforcing local strengths, removing bureaucratic barriers, and supporting the industries that power our economy.”

The conversation focused on several priorities that will be essential to sustaining Pennsylvania’s competitive edge.

These included expanding federal support for career and technical education through corporate tax credit models inspired by Pennsylvania’s EITC program; modernizing infrastructure and permitting processes to attract data centers and meet surging energy demands driven by AI and manufacturing reshoring; unlocking critical mineral recovery from produced water through targeted tax incentives and streamlined federal regulation; and strengthening coordination between federal, state, and local partners to scale successful workforce pipelines and rural economic development strategies.

Prior to the roundtable, Meuser toured the college campus to see firsthand how the institution is “Inspiring and Preparing Tomorrow Makers” with a world-class, hands-on education.

He met with college President Dr. Michael J. Reed and Dr. Bradley Webb, Dean of Engineering Technologies, to discuss how Penn College blends real-world experience, innovation, and strong industry partnerships to prepare students for the jobs of tomorrow. Meuser emphasized the importance of supporting institutions like Penn College that are building a more skilled and resilient workforce in Pennsylvania.

Training, education and initiatives provided by the partners of Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce are resulting in economic successes for this region.

Jason Fink, president and CEO of the chamber, discussed the recent expansion and increase in jobs at Prysmian Group, which is making aluminum cable for the Midwest Grain Belt Express electricity grid.

He also discussed how AA Metal Specialities bought Chance Aluminum and restarted the plant and has purchased about 200 acres of industrial land where it plans to open in either late 2026 or early 2027, expecting to employ 350 to 400 people.

Fink related success for West Pharmaceuticals at the Williamsport and Jersey Shore facilities, where the city facility is planning to hire hundreds of people, and he touched on the recent announcement by Verne Inc. to — in nine months — open a production Muncy area plant that will build storage tanks that store compressed hydrogen for use in tanks for over-the-road trucks. The plant will employ 61 people. Moreover, the Verne plant will network with businesses such as PMF Inc. which designs the storage containers that store hydrogen gas.

Fink observed the grand opening of Chick-fil-A on Maynard Street and the expected opening of the Bass Pro in Muncy Township in 2027.

Larry Allison Jr., owner of Allison Crane & Rigging, discussed his business relationship to oil and gas fields, moving heavy machines and establishing a presence here and in western Texas.

He also said he branched out by purchasing a 100-year-old commercial bakery and the former Country Store Brand Meats. He said his wife oversees a third business.

“We’d love to see our employees paid more,” he said, looking forward to the no-tax on overtime policy, which he said would give the employees a couple more dollars in their paychecks when they perform overtime for the businesses.

He said he also was pleased to see the national interest rates going down, and a drive to deploy more capital investments but he cautioned those at the table to “keep the pressure on.”

In terms of controlling business expenses, he was not positive, asking why a trailer cost $30,000 and is now $50,000 for the same product.

Additionally, he said, a tractor trailer runs an average of $100,000 on up. “Why?” he asked.

More pressure for the businesses include rising health insurance and general liability, he said.

While there have been positive trends, such as the price of eggs dropping, other groceries are not, Allison observed.

“How do we keep absorbing this?” he asked the panel.

Allison said he was in attendance at the recent Energy Summit in Pittsburgh, where $92 billion of energy sector projects were announced. He listened to speakers, including Mike Rowe, the television celebrity and narrator for the show Dirty Jobs, who promotes and advocates for students learning trades.

He said Rowe “stole the entire show,” while asking those at the summit where the next group of skilled workers was going to come from, and then answering, “eighth grade.”

He suggested displaying career information at the school districts and showing the students the average amount of income they could earn in various career fields — including jobs that begin at $30 to $40 per hour on up.

“Overall, the roundtable featured three major focus areas:

Workforce development

Panelists from Penn College, the Susquehanna County Career & Technology Center, and Coterra highlighted how regional models are effectively preparing students for high-skill, high-demand energy and technical careers. Participants explored ways the federal government can replicate Pennsylvania’s Education Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) program at the national level — leveraging private-sector investment to expand career and technical education.

Manufacturing and technology infrastructure

Industry innovators emphasized the urgency of upgrading permitting systems and expanding access to reliable energy infrastructure. As energy demand surges — especially with the rise of AI and data centers — speakers stressed the need for regulatory certainty and policies that support domestic production, including new investments in power transmission, siting reforms, and localized supply chains.

Energy services and small business growth

Representatives from Repsol, Seneca Resources, Costy’s Energy, and others shared real-world perspectives on operating in Pennsylvania’s natural gas fields.

Discussions focused on opportunities to extract rare earth elements from brine water, lower emissions, and grow small service companies. Participants also emphasized the importance of stable tax policy, streamlined oversight, and federal support for community investment and workforce partnerships.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.sungazette.com/images/2025/08/02034509/30RoundtableA-800x351.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 14:03:53.952001

China realized early in the 21st century that electric vehicles were the future.
Current administration policy, including eliminating clean energy incentives and increasing subsidies for fossil fuels, will essentially halt that progress, according to a Princeton University study.
Over $200 billion in clean energy and vehicle investments have already been plowed into U.S. manufacturing projects since 2022.
The politics of electric vehicles and alternative energy in general is complex, sometimes verging on tribal.","Americans interested in taking advantage of current tax incentives to purchase an electric vehicle or improve the energy efficiency of their homes had better get a move on. Many of these subsidies, originally scheduled to last through 2032, are instead running out of gas over the next few months.

President Donald Trump's recently enacted ""one big beautiful bill"" includes the early demise of federal support for adoption of alternative fuel vehicles and home improvements. Refundable credits for electric cars will evaporate on Sept. 30, and several home tax credits will expire on Dec. 31. Households will end up with higher energy bills as a result. But the true beneficiary of the policy shift is China.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended and enhanced several tax credits to promote and accelerate the move to more sustainable sources of energy. Purchasers of electric vehicles can claim a refundable credit of up to $7,500 that may be applied to the down payment or purchase price of the car, subject to some restrictions. Qualifying vehicles include passenger cars with prices of $55,000 or less and SUVs or trucks less than $80,000. The credit also phases out for couples with adjusted gross incomes above $300,000. The rebate also applies to leased vehicles, and a credit of up to $4,000 is available for used cars. Under the new law, purchasers must take possession prior to Oct. 1 to qualify for the discount.

Home improvement credits for solar panels, efficient heating and air conditioning equipment, insulation and other upgrades will disappear on Dec. 31.

In addition to axing clean energy incentives, the administration is killing off the successful Energy Star program, a government initiative to improve energy efficiency that has saved consumers and businesses over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented the emission of 4 billion tons of greenhouse gases since its inception in 1992.

The elimination of support for clean energy and electric vehicles been framed in terms of supporting American petroleum and coal producers, many of whom were generous contributors to Trump's campaign. But the abandonment of support for alternatives plays directly into Chinese hands and endangers the future of American auto manufacturers.

China realized early in the 21st century that electric vehicles were the future. Since then, the Chinese Communist Party has invested huge sums into the development of its indigenous auto industry with startling results.

China now produces three times as many total cars and light trucks as the U.S., more than America, Japan, Germany and South Korea combined. And its bet on electric vehicles has paid off big time. The Asian colossus now builds 70% of all the world's EVs, while the U.S. makes just 5% (and shrinking). There are over 100 separate Chinese EV manufacturers the largest of which, BYD, sells twice as many cars as Tesla at half the price and offers an entry level model for under $10,000.

And unlike in the U.S., electric cars in China are already cheaper to buy and less expensive to operate than internal combustion vehicles, thanks to economies of scale and the country's massive investment in charging infrastructure.

The story is similar in batteries. China dominates global production, claiming over 70% of all EV battery output and 80% of some minerals necessary for their production.

Given China's aggressive state support of EVs, wind and solar power components, American manufacturers must rely on supportive policy and tax incentives to level the field until they become competitive. Instead, the U.S. has shifted into reverse.

American imports of Chinese cars were essentially prohibited by Biden era embargoes, so U.S. consumers have been shielded from exposure to these advanced vehicles while domestic manufacturers have largely avoided direct competition with them here at home. But America's growing deficit in the EV space poses an existential crisis for U.S. carmakers, a fact known only too well by Detroit auto executives.

Jim Farley, CEO at Ford Motor Co., spoke of the urgency for U.S. automakers to become more competitive in electric vehicles.

""We're in a global competition with China ... and if we lose this, we do not have a future at Ford,"" he said.

Farley bought five Chinese vehicles for his engineers to study. ""It's the most humbling thing I've ever seen ... They are far superior in vehicle technology.""

For its part, General Motors once jockeyed with Volkswagen for the pole position as top-selling nameplate in China and once sold more cars there than in America. Today, GM is number 16 in China.

America's withdrawal from engagement in clean technology is already reaping both environmental and economic consequences.

The U.S. had been on a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 40% below 2005 levels over the next five years, shy of the 50% reduction target under the Paris accords but significant, nonetheless. Current administration policy, including eliminating clean energy incentives and increasing subsidies for fossil fuels, will essentially halt that progress, according to a Princeton University study.

Retreat from global competition will also cost American jobs. Over $200 billion in clean energy and vehicle investments have already been plowed into U.S. manufacturing projects since 2022. According to research from the Rhodium Group, an additional $522 billion in private capital investment is at risk thanks to the elimination of federal support. Already this year, over $22 billion in project cancellations have been announced and billions more are on hold, with the potential to eliminate as many as 400,000 high-paying American jobs including 15,000 jobs in Tennessee. Ford's massive Blue Oval City in west Tennessee, which planned to employ nearly 6,000, has delayed the completion of its battery project and reduced output targets for electric F150 trucks.

The politics of electric vehicles and alternative energy in general is complex, sometimes verging on tribal. But the national defense and economic security implications of surrendering American industrial leadership in these areas presents an existential threat, one that grows daily and is being celebrated in Beijing.

They claim that climate change activists are alarmists, part of a “religion.” Where does this rejection of clean energy come from?","Dear Editor,

There have been a number of decisions made by the Trump administration that make me scratch my head. Closing Voice of America, firing all the Inspector Generals whose job it is to ferret out “waste, fraud, and abuse,” pardoning the 1500 January 6 rioters, attacking any opposition voices in the media as “enemies of the people,” cutting off funding for public media, large reductions in food aid at home and abroad, claiming the “government” is replete with “deep state” radical leftists to justify cutting many agencies including USAID, FDA, EPA, FEMA, IRS, VA, Consumer Financing Protection Bureau, (what did I miss?), weaponizing the Department of Justice, attacking colleges as “Woke” and anti-semitic, cancelling the subsidies in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act which encouraged green energy transition, while expanding the subsidies for fossil fuel extraction, and so on.

Drill, baby, drill, and bring back “clean coal” … an oxymoron for sure. The US is the world’s largest producer of oil and gas, nearly double the closest 2nd, Saudi Arabia. And do we really want waxy crude trains from Utah travelling the Colorado River corridor through Glenwood Canyon? I say No!

The laws of physics still apply. We are told that today’s price of gas at the pump is the rationale for the rollback of science-based climate change investigation, and the decimation of the agencies established by Congress to assess this slow-moving train wreck. Never mind what kind of planet we will be leaving for our children and grandchildren.

But there are other voices in the debate as well. The Secretary General of the United Nations recently called our world today “A Moment of Opportunity: Supercharging the Clean Energy Age.” Here is part of his comments:

“The headlines are dominated by a world in trouble. By conflict and climate chaos. By rising human suffering. By growing geo-political divides. But amidst the turmoil, another story is being written. And its implications will be profound.

“Throughout history, energy has shaped the destiny of humankind – from mastering fire, to harnessing steam, to splitting the atom. Now, we are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age. Just follow the money.

“$2 trillion went into clean energy last year – that’s $800 billion more than fossil fuels, and up almost 70% in ten years. And new data released today from the International Renewable Energy Agency shows that solar – not so long ago four times the cost of fossil fuels – is now 41% cheaper. Offshore wind – 53%. And over 90% of new renewables worldwide produced electricity for less than the cheapest new fossil fuel alternative.

“This is not just a shift in power. This is a shift in possibility. Yes, in repairing our relationship with the climate. Already, the carbon emissions saved by solar and wind globally are almost equivalent to what the whole European Union produces in a year. But this transformation is fundamentally about energy security and people’s security. It’s about smart economics. Decent jobs, public health, advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. And delivering clean and affordable energy to everyone, everywhere.”

And just this past week, the International Court of Justice issued a unanimous decision (14 to 0) that high emitting countries are responsible for the damage they are doing to the environment and to the millions of people affected by their emissions. The US, the largest historical emitter, and China, the largest current emitter, are in the cross hairs. The US is only 4% of the world’s population but has put up a large percentage of the CO2 in the atmosphere today.

We have a moral obligation to clean up after ourselves. Common sense would dictate that we do “all of the above” in keeping people warm and / or cooled, and able to move around their world. That includes the remarkably economic solutions of wind, solar and, yes, nuclear.

But the administration is doubling down on denial. They claim that climate change activists are alarmists, part of a “religion.” Where does this rejection of clean energy come from?

Money talks. The fossil fuel lobby paid Trump a billion dollars for rescinding many Biden era regulations. In 10 years, people will be asking, what did you do when there was still time to change this outcome? Trump and his sycophants are on the wrong side of history, prejudiced by the corrupting influence of big money in our politics.

The 10 hottest years on record have been the last 10 years. 2024 was the hottest year on record. There is an increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather such as hurricanes, heat domes, wildfires, droughts, floods, melting sea ice and sea level rise, warmer oceans leading to rapid intensification of hurricanes.

According to Audubon, two thirds of all birds are in danger of extinction. The changes to our planet that normally would take hundreds of thousands of years, are happening in decades. We are at an inflection point and must act to turn this around.

Dissent is patriotic, and our current spineless Republican Congress is complicit. “America First” ignores our responsibility to the rest of the world for creating the mess the environment is in. Throw the bums out and let’s move toward sane public policy.

This all-cash C$12 million deal, offering a 28% premium to Synex shareholders, underscores Sitka's aggressive strategy to consolidate assets in British Columbia's booming renewable market. For investors, the transaction raises critical questions: Does this acquisition create long-term value? How does it position Sitka to navigate Canada's evolving energy landscape? And what does it signal about the sector's growth trajectory?

Strategic Alignment with National and Provincial Clean Energy Goals

Canada's Clean Electricity Strategy, launched in 2024, aims to decarbonize the grid by 2050, with British Columbia (BC) playing a central role. The province's existing 85% reliance on non-emitting energy sources, coupled with its ambitious 10-year Clean Electricity Regulations, creates a regulatory environment ripe for renewable developers. Synex's portfolio—11 MW of operational hydro projects, 9.4 MW of construction-ready run-of-river assets, and 16 wind sites with 4,700 MW potential—directly aligns with BC's focus on expanding clean generation. By integrating these assets, Sitka gains access to high-quality, low-cost resources in a jurisdiction with streamlined permitting and strong community partnerships, particularly through Indigenous-led projects.

The acquisition also taps into BC's policy-driven demand for renewable infrastructure. The province's recent award of nine Indigenous-majority wind projects, adding nearly 5,000 GWh annually, highlights a shift toward inclusive development. Synex's existing relationships with First Nations communities, combined with Sitka's post-merger governance structure (featuring Indigenous representatives on its board), position the company to navigate social license challenges that often derail renewable projects elsewhere.

Market Positioning in a Competitive but Fragmented Sector

British Columbia's renewable energy market is highly competitive but fragmented, with key players like BC Hydro, Brookfield Renewable Partners, and Innergex Renewable Energy dominating hydro and wind assets. However, the rise of Indigenous equity partnerships is reshaping the landscape. Sitka's acquisition of Synex, which already operates in tandem with Indigenous stakeholders, provides a unique edge. For instance, Synex's Kyuquot Power Ltd. grid connection utility and its 24 hydro sites with 150+ MW potential offer a scalable platform for vertical integration into green hydrogen and long-duration storage—sectors poised for explosive growth as the IRA incentivizes clean tech innovation.

Moreover, the deal's C$2.40/share premium suggests undervaluation relative to Synex's pre-announcement trading price. This premium reflects investor confidence in Sitka's ability to leverage Synex's assets for higher-margin revenue streams, such as securing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with data centers and hydrogen producers. With BC's electricity rates among the lowest in the OECD, Sitka is well-positioned to attract these industries, which require both affordability and carbon neutrality.

Growth Potential and Emerging Opportunities

The acquisition's most compelling aspect is its alignment with Canada's 2035–2050 clean energy roadmap. The Clean Electricity Regulations, which impose annual emissions limits on fossil fuel plants and incentivize non-emitting sources, will drive demand for hydro, wind, and solar. Synex's 16 wind sites alone could generate 4,700 MW of capacity—enough to power over 1.5 million homes—while its hydro assets provide baseload stability. This diversification reduces exposure to intermittency risks, a critical factor as the grid integrates more variable renewables.

Furthermore, the IRA's 10-year tax credit structure (which includes incentives for hydrogen and long-duration storage) creates a buffer against policy shifts and interest rate volatility. Sitka's access to favorable debt markets—with bond yields near multi-decade lows—enables it to finance these projects at historically low costs. The company's CEO, Trevor White, has emphasized plans to scale into green hydrogen, a sector projected to grow to C$100 billion by 2040 in Canada. Synex's grid connection via Kyuquot Power could serve as a hub for hydrogen production, linking renewable generation to industrial demand.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies

While the acquisition is strategically sound, risks remain. Regulatory delays, particularly for large hydro projects, could derail timelines. Additionally, the IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing may pressure developers to source equipment from Canadian suppliers, increasing costs. However, Sitka's emphasis on Indigenous partnerships and its existing infrastructure (including transmission assets) mitigate these risks. The company's post-merger governance, with a board comprising former Synex executives and Sitka's leadership, ensures continuity in project execution.

Investment Outlook

For investors, Sitka's acquisition of Synex represents a high-conviction opportunity in a sector set for structural growth. The deal's immediate value creation is evident in the 28% premium and the enhanced asset base, while long-term upside lies in green hydrogen and storage synergies. With Canada's clean energy transition projected to attract over C$60 billion in federal and private investment by 2035, Sitka's expanded portfolio positions it to capture a significant share of this market.

However, caution is warranted. The company's success hinges on its ability to integrate Synex's operations efficiently and secure PPAs in a competitive bidding environment. Investors should monitor the company's Q3 2025 earnings report, which will provide insights into post-merger cost synergies and project timelines.

By utilizing glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) tubes, this facility can now store heat 1.2 miles underground, effectively reshaping energy storage and waste heat recovery. The collaboration between the Lounavoima plant, Exel Composites, and QHeat aims to not only capture and preserve surplus heat but also reduce reliance on fossil fuels during colder months. This advancement represents a significant step forward in addressing global energy challenges through innovative engineering.

Storing Heat Underground

Traditionally, the Lounavoima waste-to-energy plant released its excess heat into the atmosphere during warmer months. This was an inefficient practice, especially given the harsh Finnish winters where temperatures can drop to -4 degrees Fahrenheit. In such conditions, the plant had to resort to oil burners to supplement heating needs, increasing both costs and emissions. With the new GFRP tube system, the plant can now store and utilize this previously wasted energy to heat approximately 700 homes annually. This not only reduces emissions but also enhances the plant’s efficiency.

Erika Salmenvaara, CEO of QHeat, emphasized the potential environmental benefits of electrifying heating. While she acknowledged the challenges posed by the strain on the aging power transmission infrastructure, she highlighted the rapid advancement of grid-enhancing technologies. Salmenvaara pointed out that heat pumps can offer up to 600 percent more energy efficiency compared to direct electricity use, underscoring the potential of such innovations in the broader energy landscape.

True Engineering in Action

The success of this project is rooted in the advanced engineering of the GFRP tubes, which are designed to withstand the extreme conditions of underground storage. Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, and thermally efficient, these tubes are a product of rigorous collaboration between Exel Composites and QHeat. The teams meticulously optimized various aspects, including sizing, connection methods, and the balance between thermal insulation and mechanical strength.

Tiina Uotila, technical sales manager at Exel Composites, highlighted the importance of achieving the right mechanical performance while maintaining heat preservation. Additionally, the sustainability of these tubes extends beyond their immediate function. Once their operational life concludes, they are repurposed into cement, where composite materials can replace fossil fuels and raw materials. This sustainable approach ensures that the tubes do not end up in landfills, further contributing to the project’s environmental benefits.

Environmental Implications and Future Prospects

The broader implications of this project extend beyond the immediate benefits of heat storage. As Salmenvaara noted, 60 percent of the European Union’s heat production still relies on fossil fuels. Innovations like the GFRP tube system could play a pivotal role in reducing this dependency. By capturing and storing excess heat, facilities can significantly cut down on fossil fuel use, particularly during peak heating seasons.

Moreover, the project sets a precedent for other waste-to-energy plants worldwide. By demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of such systems, it encourages similar initiatives in regions facing similar energy challenges. The collaboration between different sectors—engineering, composites manufacturing, and geothermal technology—highlights the importance of interdisciplinary solutions in tackling complex environmental issues.

Challenges and Opportunities

While the Lounavoima project represents a significant advancement, it is not without challenges. The initial investment costs and the complexity of implementing such systems on a larger scale can be daunting. Furthermore, the reliance on advanced technology necessitates skilled personnel for maintenance and operation. However, the opportunities presented by such innovations are compelling. They offer a pathway to reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency, and promote sustainable practices. As grid-enhancing technologies continue to evolve, the potential for widespread adoption of similar systems grows, paving the way for a more sustainable energy future.

As the world grapples with the dual challenges of energy demand and environmental sustainability, projects like the one in Salo offer a glimpse into potential solutions. The question remains: How can other regions and countries adapt and implement similar technologies to address their unique energy challenges?

Itasca Mantrap and its power supplier, Great River Energy, will purchase the excess solar energy at the minimum mandated PURPA rate.","This winter promises to be a cold one in northern Minnesota. Federal cutbacks in energy assistance and additional power production will hit us hard. That “big, beautiful bill” will hurt Republicans and Democrats alike. Add some extreme storms, an aging grid, and we are really going to be hurting, especially if you need power in a rural area.

Take Bemidji, for example: that storm of the century with 106-mile-an-hour winds knocked out power for 27,000 people. More will come.

Here’s what’s up: The “big, beautiful bill” will cost us money. The Energy Innovation think tank, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, projects electric rates for Minnesotans will increase anywhere from 25% to 42%, costing ratepayers $2.6 billion over the next decade. The average Minnesota household could see its annual energy bill increase by more than $400 by 2035.

The bill guts Energy Assistance. According to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, about $125 million comes annually to the state for Energy Assistance, serving an estimated 125,000 families. Becker, Hubbard and Clearwater counties, and Tribes like Red Lake and White Earth will be hit hard, where approximately 50% of the people are on Energy Assistance. That money is gone.

That’s not just a hardship for Native families, it’s a hardship for all of us, even Ferrell Gas and Itasca-Mantrap Electric Cooperative, which received major payments from Energy Assistance vouchers. That gravy train will be gone. And, in the end, it means tougher winters. Some Pine Point households pay over $500 a month for power.

Heat is even more on top of that.

Now is the time to think ahead, work together and solve these challenges. Power consumption is expected to increase fourfold over the next 20 or so years. Pine Point Village has a solution. Pine Point School is building a resilience hub with solar plus battery storage. It is approximately 500 kilowatts (kW) solar and 2.75 megawatt-hours (MWh) battery storage. Local power, in times of rising outages and grid failures, is the answer.

That’s why the Pine Point Resilience hub is a good idea. The project plans an August groundbreaking and operations by winter.

A group of hardworking people from 10Power, 8th Fire Solar and the Pine Point School raised all the money for this project. The solar panels are manufactured in Minnesota by a local company, Heliene, with Build America, Buy America (BABA) solar panels. This is a win-win situation for all of us.

Across the country, this type of project is increasingly common, as local communities, schools, and even small industries are working to bring more electricity to the grid. A few years ago, Beltrami Electric joined Red Lake Nation and brought online 275 kW of power to serve the community. More is coming.

Not every rural cooperative wants to work with tribes. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission recently scolded Minnesota Valley Cooperative for threatening to cut power to the Upper Sioux Community’s casino if the tribe turns on the 2.5 MW solar array.

On July 26, the PUC voted 4-0 to investigate a complaint from Upper Sioux arguing that the threat by the Minnesota Valley Cooperative Light and Power Association is illegal and discriminatory. The commission said it might resort to the extraordinary step of taking away Minnesota Valley’s right to serve the tribe with power and giving it to another provider, such as nearby Xcel Energy. The commissioners then asked state attorneys to take legal action if necessary to prevent a shutoff.

At 500 kW, the Pine Point Solar Project will be the largest solar project on the grid for Itasca-Mantrap and the first with energy storage. The project is intended to support the Pine Point Elementary School, which pays a considerable bill because the school is 100% electric. Itasca Mantrap and its power supplier, Great River Energy, will purchase the excess solar energy at the minimum mandated PURPA rate.

They have not yet designed a program for batteries, so the 2.76 MWh energy storage capacity at the Pine Point School cannot be fully utilized today to provide resilience and cost-saving benefits to the grid and other customers within their territory. It is our hope that the battery can be included in an upcoming pilot program, although Great River Energy has indicated they are designing the pilot for smaller batteries. Itasca Mantrap recently sponsored a workshop on solar, with Wolf Creek Solar.

Having locally generated, clean power is good for everyone. Now is the time.

Let’s review the challenge: Most of us are energy addicts. Pine Point got power in 1961 because of our cooperation. Since we got those power lines, we’ve been lapping it up here in the north, and today, most of our households use a good chunk of power, not just for lights, but also for all sorts of appliances. And, increasingly, many of our people need power for some medical devices. When a blackout happens in the middle of winter, it’s going to be deadly.

So, what’s wrong with bringing more renewable energy online, power to the people, so to speak? Bob Blake, aka Solar Bear, a Red Lake Tribal member, and one of the largest solar installers in Minnesota, is positive: “Renewables are the future. And to invest in renewable energy is to invest in the future …”

Let’s all step forward together; it’s time for energy security and cooperation — the same cooperation that built the rural cooperatives and our communities.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/7923638/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1500+0+0/resize/1706x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffcc-cue-exports-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Finforum%2Fbinary%2F1zun3VhhBcZL_ljsncMrUFio9y9BKs_GJ_binary_906833.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 17:02:24.263761

Tesla registrations in California have dropped 18.3% so far this year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.","Sales of new electric vehicles in California remained sluggish in the second quarter of this year and the road ahead appears bumpy, as federal tax credits will expire at the end of next month.

The number of EVs registered between April and June in the Golden State came to 100,671, according to figures released by the California Energy Commission. That’s ever so slightly higher than the first-quarter figure of 100,326 but noticeably lower than the 116,813 registrations seen in the second quarter of 2024.

What’s more, the market share for sales of zero-emission vehicles dropped to 21.6% from April through June, down from 23% in the first quarter and 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The California New Car Dealers Association released its own second-quarter figures that largely paralleled the energy commission’s numbers and percentages.

Ivan Drury, senior manager of auto insights at Edmunds, said a number of factors came into play, including concerns by potential buyers that tariffs on cars and trucks from the Trump administration would go into effect in April or May.

“It’s not surprising to see that EVs tapered off,” Drury said. “It makes sense because (the California market) is the place that has the most receptivity” to zero-emission purchases.

The second-quarter numbers came just days before what was dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” led by Republicans on Capitol Hill, was signed into law July 4 by President Donald Trump. The 940-page budget bill affects taxes and spending on multiple elements of the nation’s economy, including the auto industry.

Under the new legislation, federal tax incentives for buying an electric vehicle will expire Sept. 30. That includes a credit of up to $7,500 on a new EV, or $4,000 for a used one. The credit for buying and installing a home charging station will end June 30, 2026.

The ending of the federal tax credit for EVs figures to have major implications for California because Gov. Gavin Newsom five years ago issued an executive order that mandates the elimination of sales of all new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles throughout the state by 2035.

Under standards passed by the California Air Resources Board, at least 35% of model year 2026 passenger cars and trucks sold in the state must be EVs, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The numbers ramp up each year, going to 68% in 2030 and 100% by 2035.

In a separate move, Trump in June signed three Congressional Review Act resolutions rescinding those California EV mandates — as well as rules related to diesel engines.

Newsom responded by filing a lawsuit, arguing that Trump’s actions are unconstitutional and beyond the authority of Congress. Ten other states joined in the litigation.

While the court battle proceeds, California policymakers insist the state’s goals to transition to EVs will continue and say the recent quarterly numbers amount to a blip.

“This quarter’s modest decline in zero-emission vehicle sales is no surprise given the federal government’s misguided and ongoing assault on clean transportation,” Liane Randolph, chair of the air resources board, said in a statement. “While they may slow progress, they can’t change the fact that zero-emission vehicles are here to stay — in California and around the world.”

A big reason for the drop in EV sales is a slump in Tesla registrations.

The company had a rough second quarter, with automotive revenue falling 16% compared to a year ago — the second straight quarter of lower sales. Tesla registrations in California have dropped 18.3% so far this year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk campaigned for Trump in the run-up to the November presidential election. Musk’s posts on political topics on X, the social media company he owns, and his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sparked protests, boycotts, vandalism and even arson at some Tesla locations.

Musk stepped down from DOGE in late May to focus on Tesla and then had a falling out with the Trump administration. More than a few Wall Street and auto analysts said his zig-zags have damaged the company’s image with potential customers.

However, Tesla’s sales growth had been slowing even before Musk jumped into the 2024 political campaign, signaling that EV adoption rates may have more long-term issues to address.

“It’s clear many consumers still face barriers to going fully electric,” said Robb Hernandez, chairman of the new car dealers association, “whether that’s due to affordability, lack of infrastructure (public charging stations), or range anxiety” — the fear of an EV conking out before a driver gets to a charging station.

Sales are anticipated to ramp up in the third quarter because customers considering an EV purchase are expected to race to dealerships before the federal tax credit goes away.

“Why wait?” Drury said. “The selection’s going to get worse” as the Sept. 30 deadline looms.

Despite Tesla’s woes, the automaker still had the top-selling vehicle in California in the second quarter — the Tesla Model Y, with 44,112 registrations, according to the new car dealers association. The Toyota RAV4 came in second with 33,960, and the Tesla Model 3 finished third with 31,394.

And there’s some good news for EVs in the used-car market.

According a study released in June by iSeeCars.com, a search engine that analyzes car listings, the average price for a 1- to 5-year-old used electric vehicle in the U.S. has dropped 8.8% over the past year to $31,110.

That’s lower than the average price of $32,317 for a gasoline-powered car in the same age range.",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SUT-L-TESLA-CHARGING-0625-01.jpg?w=1024&h=778,N,,2025-08-02 13:05:41.122777

That regulatory finding is the essential predicate for federal regulation of motor vehicle and engine GHG emissions. Based on rescission of the Endangerment Finding, the proposal would repeal all GHG emission standards for new light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines sold in the US.

Resetting US climate and transportation policy

Announcing the proposed rule, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin criticized existing GHG emissions regulations as ineffective in addressing climate change, and focused on the cost of compliance with EPA’s GHG tailpipe standards, describing them as “hidden taxes on American businesses and families” costing them “$1 trillion or more.”

EPA’s proposal responds to a directive of President Donald Trump’s Executive Order “Unleashing American Energy” (issued the day he took office), ordering the agency to submit recommendations to the White House regarding the “legality and continuing applicability” of the Endangerment Finding.

In March 2025, EPA recommended reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding and all regulations and actions grounded in that Finding. The new proposed rule formally initiates the process of rescinding the foundational Endangerment Finding.

EPA’s action is part of a broader effort by the Trump Administration and congressional Republicans to change US climate policy by eliminating programs or regulations they consider too costly or ineffective, particularly policies affecting the transportation and energy sectors.

In May 2025, Congress passed – and President Trump signed – Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions revoking waivers issued by EPA that authorized California’s separate GHG standards for light- and heavy-duty vehicles and nonroad engines. However, use of the CRA to revoke the waivers is subject to a pending court challenge.

In addition, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, 2025, eliminated monetary penalties for noncompliance with federal corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and terminated tax credits for electric vehicles. The common rationale for these and related Trump Administration actions is that eliminating GHG vehicle emission standards will reduce energy and transportation costs while increasing choice for consumers and businesses.

Background on the Endangerment Finding

The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires EPA to regulate tailpipe emissions from new motor vehicles and engines. Specifically, Section 202(a)(1) of the CAA requires EPA to prescribe by regulation “standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in [EPA’s] judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”

In 2007, the US Supreme Court issued Massachusetts v. EPA, a 5–4 decision concluding that the CAA’s broad definition of “air pollutant” includes GHGs. Therefore, the Court ruled, Section 202(a)(1) of the CAA grants EPA the statutory authority to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines. The high court decision left to EPA’s judgment the determination of whether GHG emissions from vehicles cause or contribute to conditions (eg, climate change) that endanger public health or welfare.

Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by two other justices who still serve on the Court (Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito) dissented in Massachusetts v. EPA. While that dissent focused on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ standing to bring the lawsuit, it also suggested that the majority (none of whom serve on the Court today) “ignores the complexities of global warming” and opined that there is an “evident mismatch” between “catastrophic global warming – and the narrow subject matter of the Clean Air Act provision [for motor vehicles].”

Following the Supreme Court’s decision, EPA issued the Endangerment Finding, concluding that six GHGs – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) – emitted from motor vehicles and engines contribute to air pollution at concentrations projected to threaten public health and welfare.

Based on that finding, EPA promulgated vehicle GHG emissions standards, which took effect in model years 2012 (light-duty vehicles) and 2014 (medium- and heavy-duty vehicles). Those standards have generally increased in stringency for each successive model year. Current EPA GHG tailpipe emissions standards extend through model year 2032.

EPA has also relied on the Endangerment Finding, in part, to support other GHG emissions regulations under other CAA provisions, including standards for stationary sources (eg, power plants) and aircraft engines. The Endangerment Finding thus forms a significant part of the foundation for various GHG and climate change mitigation regulations and policies that EPA has implemented over the past decade.

Proposal to rescind the Endangerment Finding

EPA’s new proposal proffers legal and factual rationales for rescinding the Endangerment Finding and repealing federal GHG emission standards for vehicles and engines.

Legal bases for proposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding

Some of the key components of EPA’s revised legal analysis and interpretation of its authority under the CAA include:

Air pollution subject to regulation: EPA proposes to interpret the term “air pollution” as exclusively referring to local or regional exposure to air pollutants, not global risks associated with global emissions of air pollutants such as GHGs.

Procedural requirements for the Endangerment Finding: EPA also proposes to find that the CAA does not grant it power or discretion to issue a general endangerment finding in isolation, based on GHGs with elevated concentrations in the upper atmosphere (not all of the GHGs covered by the Endangerment Finding are contained in vehicle tailpipe emissions). Instead, EPA asserts, the statute only authorizes such a finding based on a narrower set of GHGs that EPA determines are associated with vehicle tailpipe emissions. Thus, EPA concludes, the agency previously acted outside its authority when issuing the broader Endangerment Finding.

Regulated emissions must cause or contribute to endangerment: EPA’s proposal would further find that the CAA requires EPA to establish a causal connection between new motor vehicle GHG emissions and endangerment to public health or welfare caused by climate change. Thus, the proposed rule would conclude, the Endangerment Finding erroneously relied on global GHG emissions and stationary sources of GHG emissions regulated by other sections of the CAA to justify its finding regarding motor vehicle emissions.

EPA finds further legal support for its proposed withdrawal of the Endangerment Finding in the Supreme Court’s recent decisions in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (eliminating Chevron deference to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes) and West Virginia v. EPA (the “major question” doctrine).

Citing Loper Bright and the absence of specific statutory authorization to regulate GHG emissions, the proposed rule contends that EPA may not rely on statutory silence or ambiguity to justify the agency’s interpretation of CAA Section 202(a).

Relying on the major question doctrine adopted in West Virginia, EPA would further find that regulating motor vehicle GHG emissions is an economically and politically significant issue requiring a clear directive from Congress, which the agency suggests is lacking in Section 202(a).

Factual and evidentiary bases for proposed rescission

Supplementing EPA’s legal rationale for rescinding the Endangerment Finding, the proposed rule also criticizes the prior factual and scientific analysis and concludes that the Endangerment Finding was unreasonable, not adequately supported by contemporaneous empirical data or evidence, and contradicted by more recent data and climate trends.

Key components of EPA’s determination that the Endangerment Finding is not supported by the facts and evidence include:

New evidence and data: EPA’s proposal would find that the scientific record, including recent data and studies, cast doubt on the prior analysis, including its assessment of uncertainties as well as forecasts and predictions underlying the Endangerment Finding.

No “requisite technology” to control GHG emissions from vehicles: EPA’s proposal would also find that even reducing US GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines to zero “would not have a scientifically measurable impact on global GHG concentrations and climate trends.” Based on that determination, EPA would conclude there is no “requisite technology” (as required by CAA Section 202) to mitigate any endangerment to public health and welfare caused by global climate change.

Restoring consumer choice: EPA proposes to conclude that existing GHG emission standards for new vehicles and engines would harm public health and welfare by increasing prices, decreasing consumer choice, and delaying replacement of older vehicles that are less safe and generate greater emissions of air pollutants.

EPA estimates that the proposed rule would save consumers and industry approximately $54 billion annually. The agency will accept public comments on the proposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding and repeal of vehicle and engine GHG emissions standards through September 15, 2025.

EPA has also scheduled a public hearing on the proposal for August 19–20, 2025. We anticipate this major regulatory action will be controversial and generate significant comments in support and opposition.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16336_0535.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 13:07:17.101368

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool.
Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant.
Sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.
However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.","President Donald Trump's plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the United States could speed up a building boom that already was expected to strain the nation's ability to power it.

The White House released its AI Action Plan on July 23, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others pour billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat ""radical climate dogma,"" a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump's ""American energy dominance"" agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

Environmental concerns

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are increasingly severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

Big Tech moves

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most power plants in the U.S. still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

Tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

What's at stake

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often that's not from renewables. Sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

In recent days, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world's largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means ""relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,"" Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear, power generation.

What's ahead

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for.

""In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,"" said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

E-Cite Motors Group (OTCID:VAPR), an emerging electric vehicle manufacturer, today announced that its stock has dramatically outperformed major electric automakers over the past week and year-to-date. E-Cite's share price closed at $0.0112 on Friday, August 1, up roughly 12% from Monday's $0.0100 opening price. This weekly gain stands in stark contrast to declines in leading EV stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) during the same period. Tesla's stock fell from about $325 on July 28 to $303 by Aug. 1 (approximately, 7% change), while Rivian slipped roughly, 8% (from $13.78 to $12.60), and Lucid dropped roughly, 12% (from $2.79 to $2.46) over the week.

Year-to-date, E-Cite's momentum is even more pronounced. Since January 1, 2025, VAPR shares have nearly doubled in value, rising from around $0.0057 at the start of the year to $0.0112 today (an increase on the order of +96%). In comparison, many EV peers have struggled: Tesla stock is down about 24% for 2025 (opening the year near $379 and recently trading around $308), Lucid has declined roughly 18% YTD, and Rivian remains roughly flat with a modest ~3% dip year-to-date These figures underscore that E-Cite (VAPR) has delivered industry-leading returns for investors so far this year, outpacing even the largest EV manufacturers in percentage gains.

""This exceptional stock performance reflects the unique advantages and progress E-Cite has achieved,"" said Barry Henthorn, CEO of E-Cite Motors. ""We benefit from a special low-volume manufacturing exemption that lets us bring vehicles to market faster and more efficiently than traditional automakers, and our recent technological and strategic milestones are resonating with investors.""

E-Cite operates under the U.S. Low Volume Manufacturers Act, giving it a government exemption from certain costly certification requirements that burden traditional OEMs. Notably, E-Cite's vehicles are produced under a low-volume manufacturing exemption, allowing the company to bypass extensive crash-testing delays and expenses while still meeting all safety and regulatory standards. This streamlines development and approval, enabling E-Cite to deploy new models faster and more efficiently than any traditional OEM, a significant competitive edge that investors recognize. By accelerating time-to-market for its electric vehicles, E-Cite can capitalize on market opportunities more quickly than legacy manufacturers encumbered by bureaucracy.

Recent product breakthroughs and strategic initiatives from E-Cite Motors have further bolstered market confidence. Earlier this month, the company unleashed a next-generation electric driveline for its upcoming American sports cars, doubling performance metrics and setting new benchmarks. The newly unveiled Zero Emissions electric motor spins up to 26,000 RPM (in performance trim), an astonishing leap from the previous 12,000 RPM, and delivers a face-melting 4,000 Nm of torque. This advanced powertrain, paired with dual high-density 90 kWh battery packs, will power E-Cite's EV-GT, EV-C3, and EV-DT models, all built on a common modular aluminum chassis.

""The new motor's RPM increase from 12k to 26k is a game-changer,"" CEO Henthorn noted, emphasizing that it enables blistering acceleration and higher top speeds in a compact, lightweight package.""

Legendary designer Gene Langmesser, E-Cite's COO, added that ""the company's revolutionary chassis was engineered for adaptability, allowing rapid integration of such upgrades across models and giving E-Cite agility that legacy OEMs can't match.""

In addition to cutting-edge technology, E-Cite is leveraging iconic designs to capture the imagination of enthusiasts. This July, the company announced it has secured the design and production rights to the famed 1954 Kaiser-Darrin sports car, an American classic renowned for its elegant lines and distinctive ""pocket"" doors that slide into the fenders. E-Cite will resurrect this legend as the all-electric EV-DT ""Dutch Touch"" model, preserving the Kaiser-Darrin's timeless styling (including the signature sliding doors) while infusing it with state-of-the-art electric performance.

""The Kaiser-Darrin is not just a car, it's rolling sculpture,"" said Gene Langmesser, the vehicle's revival designer and E-Cite's COO, calling the opportunity to modernize it with electric power ""a dream come true"". The EV-DT will share E-Cite's proprietary chassis and driveline with the brand's other models, ensuring that beneath the retro bodywork lies the full might of E-Cite's latest EV technology.

E-Cite's ambition extends to redefining the electric pickup truck segment as well. In June, the company revealed details of its upcoming RJ9 electric pickup, which boasts an unprecedented 900+ mile total range - the highest of any production pickup in the world, whether electric or gasoline. This extraordinary range is achieved via an extended-range EV (EREV) system pairing a 40-kWh battery with a small onboard generator, giving approximately 140 miles of pure electric driving plus hundreds more on generator power. The RJ9's specs are game-changing: 0-60 mph in under 5 seconds, dual-motor AWD, and rapid DC fast-charging (20% to 80% in just 26 minutes). Equally impressive are its luxury features, from zero-gravity massage seats to panoramic displays, which elevate it to an unrivaled level of comfort and tech in the truck category. E-Cite openly touts that the RJ9 will surpass Tesla's Cybertruck, Rivian's R1T, and Ford's F-150 Lightning not only in driving range but in premium appointments, ""raising the bar for the entire truck industry"". Crucially, the RJ9 will also take advantage of E-Cite's low-volume exemption, allowing the company to bring this advanced truck to market swiftly while meeting all safety requirements.

Beyond vehicle development, E-Cite Motors has made strong commitments to American manufacturing that position it favorably amid shifting economic winds. The company recently announced a strategic initiative to dramatically increase its U.S.-based production and sourcing. Key components for E-Cite's vehicles, including body panels, lighting systems, wheels, battery enclosures, chassis assemblies, and even advanced glass, will be sourced from domestic suppliers going forward. This reshoring effort, driven by rising import tariffs and growing consumer demand for American-made EVs, is expected to optimize E-Cite's supply chain, shorten delivery timelines, and enhance production flexibility. E-Cite is currently in the final stages of site selection for expanded U.S. assembly plants, narrowing down locations and finalizing plans for new assembly operations to be announced later this quarter. ""As the economic environment in the U.S. becomes more conducive to advanced manufacturing, E-Cite is proud to bring more of our production home,"" Henthorn said, underscoring that investing in American jobs and infrastructure is a win-win for the company and its customers. ""By expanding domestic manufacturing, E-Cite aims to further differentiate itself from competitors while ensuring capacity to meet the anticipated demand for its vehicles.""

The White House released its AI Action Plan on July 23, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others pour billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat ""radical climate dogma,"" a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump's ""American energy dominance"" agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

Environmental concerns

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are increasingly severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

Big Tech moves

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most power plants in the U.S. still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

Tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Those carbon savings are sold as voluntary credits to companies and are verified by third-party auditing.
Landowners earn credit royalties while still being able to harvest some of their timber, NativState officials said.
Louisiana landowners have already started earning royalty payments from earlier deals, company officials said.
Corporate officials from Indonesia, Japan and other countries have visited Arkansas and Louisiana prospecting for carbon deals, he said.","More than 63,000 acres of north Louisiana forestland are part of a new 10-year deal to sell carbon credits to a French petrochemical and natural gas exporter with operations in the Baton Rouge area and southwest Louisiana.

And the chief executive officer of the carbon credit company that was part of the deal says he expects continued interest from big industrial companies in voluntary credit sales involving Louisiana forests, though U.S. environmental policy is beginning to shift away from climate regulation.

TotalEnergies has inked the deal with the Arkansas-based NativState to enroll in 13 long-term forest management plans across 247,000 acres in Louisiana and three other states, officials with both companies said.

TotalEnergies says it is trying to avoid or cut greenhouse gas emissions where it can — including with permanent underground carbon storage — and offset the rest by investing $100 million annually in projects that will be able to generate at least 5 million metric tons of carbon credits per year by 2030.

The NativState deal, the value of which was not disclosed, is part of TotalEnergies' buildout of that carbon offset portfolio, which is also expected to include agriculture and wetlands protection projects, company officials said in a statement.

""We are working to build a high-quality portfolio and are paying close attention to the integrity and permanence of the emissions reductions and sequestration achieved by the activities financed in this way,"" said Gabin Poizat, a TotalEnergies spokesperson.

'Some give and take'

The company, which has the world's largest combined styrene and polystyrene manufacturing plant in Carville, says it already has 1 gigawatt of renewable energy under development to supply electricity to U.S. petrochemical sites, including in Carville, a Port Arthur, Texas, oil refinery, and plastics manufacturing in LaPorte, Texas.

NativState aggregates smaller timber properties to create economies of scale and, in long-term deals reached with landowners, sets up reduced harvesting practices to create a net savings in carbon emissions.

The deal with TotalEnergies involved more than 280 landowners in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee in a portion of the nation where there is aggressive timber harvesting, NativState officials said.

Landowners agreed to 40-year sustainable management programs with help from NativState's foresters and wildlife biologists that will reduce but not eliminate harvests.

Those carbon savings are sold as voluntary credits to companies and are verified by third-party auditing. Landowners earn credit royalties while still being able to harvest some of their timber, NativState officials said.

""So, there's some give and take there, but, in the end, in most cases, that landowner is getting as much, if not more, between the carbon credits and timber revenues on these properties,"" said Stuart Allen, founder and chief executive officer of NativState.

'Political pressures'

The TotalEnergies agreement is NativStat's fourth large credit deal. Louisiana landowners have already started earning royalty payments from earlier deals, company officials said.

The companies announced the latest deal late last month shortly before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was planning to rescind the so-called endangerment finding for greenhouse gases known to contribute to climate change.

The finding is a key underpinning for the climate regulations that have followed in the 16 years since it was reached in 2009. The proposed change is part of a wider deregulatory effort by the Trump administration to spur energy and industrial production and cut consumer prices.

Allen, the NativState CEO, said Thursday that while shifting U.S. regulations may affect interest in carbon credits from smaller, domestic companies, it's not affecting the large international companies with which he is dealing.

They have 25-year planning horizons, he said, that extend past any single administration and face different business pressures than in the United States. Corporate officials from Indonesia, Japan and other countries have visited Arkansas and Louisiana prospecting for carbon deals, he said.

""And we bring groups in and their view on carbon and climate change and the political pressures on them or corporate investor pressures are considerably different than what we've seen here in the U.S., in some cases. And so I think the majority, we're not seeing any lack of demand from global players,"" Allen said.

Cape Cod towns at the center of transmission debates Many Barnstable residents have raised concerns about the same issues.
On July 29, Xiarhos also backed Diggs' bill (H. 3479) that calls for more local input and smarter siting of onshore wind infrastructure.
This project is more than enough risk for one town on Cape Cod,"" she said.","Two Cape Cod state representatives are advocating for increased state oversight of offshore wind development to protect communities.

Two bills are under consideration: one to examine the local impact of onshore wind infrastructure and another to prioritize community involvement in siting decisions.

Concerns include potential risks to water supplies, recreational areas, and historic neighborhoods, as well as the need for coordinated strategies in case of emergencies.

State Rep. Steven Xiarhos, R-Barnstable, and State Rep. Kip Diggs, D-Barnstable, have filed the bills.

As Massachusetts looks to expand its clean energy footprint, state Rep. Steven Xiarhos is sounding the alarm: offshore wind may be the future, but without stronger state oversight, that future could come at a steep cost to Cape Cod communities.

The Republican lawmaker from West Barnstable gave testimony on July 29 in front of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, pushing for new laws that would require developers to work more closely with local communities when deciding where onshore wind infrastructure should go — and make sure those communities have a real voice before shovels hit the ground.

The commission is accepting public comments about the bills through Aug. 5.

Xiarhos said his Barnstable constituents are already feeling ""the real and growing consequences"" of high-voltage infrastructure planned through densely developed and historic neighborhoods, and close to water supplies, recreational areas and places of business.

While he supports expanding the state's clean energy capacity, he stressed that it must be done with transparency, safety, and respect for local input. His bill and others like it, he insisted, are not “anti-renewable energy,"" but rather ""they are pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.""

“These are the principles that must guide any serious effort to grow our clean energy capacity without sacrificing the health, safety, or stability of our communities,"" he said.

Legislation aims to address community risks and concerns

Xiarhos pointed to two key bills — one that he filed to examine the local impact of onshore wind infrastructure, and another from fellow Cape Cod legislator, Rep. Kip Diggs, D-Barnstable, which he supports for prioritizing community involvement.

“These bills are not speculative. They are responsive,” Xiarhos said. “These concerns are important and well-founded. The time for action to protect our communities is now, before it is too late.”

Talking about his bill (H. 3585), he said he is ""deeply concerned about the potential risks these projects pose."" These include routing power transmission cables under local beaches and through historic villages, siting ""massive substations"" directly on top of the Cape's sole source aquifer, ""unknown long-term effects on marine life, public health, and the environment,"" and ""a clear lack of coordination and readiness in the event of a catastrophic failure, cyberattack, or environmental hazard.""

Comprised of experts in public health, safety, environment and energy, his proposed panel would examine and prepare for all of these potential risks, and ""would ensure that the voices of host communities — those being asked to shoulder the burden — are heard, respected and protected,” he said.

Cape Cod towns at the center of transmission debates

Many Barnstable residents have raised concerns about the same issues. The town is already hosting onshore infrastructure connected with Vineyard Wind 1 — which now has 17 turbines online — and is also the proposed landing site for Avangrid's New England Wind 1 (formerly Park City Wind) and New England Wind 2 (formerly Commonwealth Wind).

The proposed landing spot for the latter project is on Dowses Beach, which resident activists say is environmentally sensitive. And not far away, Falmouth is eyed as a potential landing place for the second phase of the proposed SouthCoast Wind project.

On July 29, Xiarhos also backed Diggs' bill (H. 3479) that calls for more local input and smarter siting of onshore wind infrastructure. The bill pushes developers to place infrastructure in industrial zones or at existing power generation sites.

“No one community can be expected to shoulder the burdens of meeting an entire region’s needs,” Diggs said. “From wastewater, broadband, and housing to energy, workforce shortages, and the unique demands of our seasonal economy, it’s about making sure we plan wisely and share responsibility as Cape Cod tackles its biggest infrastructure challenges.”

Xiarhos said Cape Cod towns ""should not be chosen as energy corridors simply for the convenience of developers.""

The bill also ""calls for coordinated offshore transmission strategies to reduce cost and disruption — offering a smarter path forward for both ratepayers and host communities.""

Resident advocate: Bills are 'a step in the right direction'

Barnstable resident Stacey Guenther, who is on the steering committe for the local, non-partisan advocacy group Save Greater Dowses Beach (www.SaveDowes.org), said in spite of ""the thousands of signatures on petitions opposing the landing of these industrial-scale offshore wind projects in the Barnstable community, the very real on-shore risks often go unrecognized or ignored.""

Xiarhos' and Diggs' bills, she said, ""are a step in the right direction."" Members of the grassroots organization are pleased to see that two of their state legislators, a Republican and a Democrat, have both put forward legislation ""shedding light on some of the public’s concerns,"" she said.

Vineyard Wind 1, if completed, will mean 800 megawatts of power at Covell’s Beach, Guenther said.

""This power will run through residential and tourist areas of Hyannis to a massive wind substation adjacent to a moderate-income apartment complex. This project is more than enough risk for one town on Cape Cod,"" she said.

The other two projects eyed for landing in Barnstable — New England Wind 1 and 2 — would also land at other ""pristine residential beaches,"" she said.

""Extra high voltage/high heat cables — 800 megawatts and 1200 megawatts respectively — will be run through tourism-dependent residential areas, adjacent to natural gas lines and fresh water pipes,"" she said, ending at ""two newly-constructed, massive substations containing hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic coolant and located directly above the Cape’s sole source aquifer, which supplies drinking water to all of Cape Cod.""

Ultimately, Guenther said, ""it is our hope that Massachusetts and adjacent New England states will stand up to offshore wind developers and protect our natural resources and our people.""

Beijing has doubled down on wind, solar and next‑generation batteries, installing more wind and solar power in 2024 than the rest of the world combined.
It is generally cheaper nowadays to build and operate renewable energy facilities than gas or coal power stations.","During the Cold War, the US and Soviet Union were locked in a desperate race to develop cutting‑edge technologies like long-range missiles and satellites. Fast forward to today and the frontiers of global technology have pivoted to AI and next‑generation energy.

In one domain, AI, the US has far outpaced any other nation – though China looks to be closing the gap. In the other, energy, it has just tied its shoelaces together. The reason isn’t technology, economics or, despite the government’s official line, even national security. Rather, it is politics.

Since returning to the White House in January, Donald Trump has handed out huge wins to the coal and oil and gas industries. This is no great surprise. Trump has long been supportive of the US fossil fuel industry and, since his reelection, has appointed several former industry lobbyists to top political positions.

According to the Trump administration, national security requires gutting support for renewable energy while performing political CPR on the dying coal industry.

The reality is that, since 2019, the US has produced more oil, gas and coal annually than Americans want to use, with the rest exported and sold overseas. It is currently one of the most prolific exporters of fossil fuels in the world.

In short, the US does not have an energy security problem. It does, however, have an energy cost problem combined with a growing climate change crisis. These issues will only be made worse by Trump’s enthusiasm for fossil fuels.

Over the past six months, the Trump administration has upended half a decade of green industrial policy. It has clawed back billions of US dollars in tax credits and grants that were supercharging American energy innovation.

Meanwhile, China has roared forward. Beijing has doubled down on wind, solar and next‑generation batteries, installing more wind and solar power in 2024 than the rest of the world combined. To China’s delight, the US has simply stopped competing to be the world’s clean energy powerhouse.

Roughly one-in-five lithium‑ion batteries, a key component in clean energy products, are made in China. Many of the newest high‑tech batteries are also being developed and patented there. While Trump repeats the tired mantra of “drill, baby, drill”, China is building factories, cornering the market for critical minerals such as lithium and nickel, and locking in export partners.

At the same time, household energy spending in the US is expected to increase by $170 each year between now and 2035 as a result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The bill, which includes sweeping changes to taxes, social security and more, will raise energy costs mainly because it strips away support for cheap and abundant renewables like wind and solar.

Household energy costs could go up even more as Trump threatens to make large‑scale clean energy development much more onerous by putting up bureaucratic hurdles. The administration recently issued a directive requiring the Secretary of the Interior to approve even routine activities for wind and solar projects connected to federal lands.

Meanwhile, climate change is hitting American communities harder with each passing year. As recent flooding in Texas and urban fires in California and Hawaii have shown, fewer Americans still have the luxury of ignoring climate change.

As the cost of these disasters mount – $183 billion in 2024 – the grifting of the oil and gas industry will become an increasingly bitter pill for the nation to swallow.

China’s foresight

China, with its authoritarian government, is less susceptible to the petroleum-obsessed dogma fueling the Republican party. It does not have prominent leaders like US politician Marjorie Taylor Greene, who previously warned that Democrats are trying to “emasculate the way we drive” by advocating for electric vehicles. Rather, China’s leaders are seeing green – not in the environmental sense, but in a monetary one.

It is generally cheaper nowadays to build and operate renewable energy facilities than gas or coal power stations. According to a June 2025 report by Lazard, an asset management company, electricity from new large-scale solar farms costs up to $78 per megawatt hour – and often much less. The same electricity from a newly built natural gas plants, by comparison, can cost as much as $107 per megawatt hour.

Across the world, utilities are embracing clean energy, choosing lower costs for their customers while reducing pollution. China saw the writing on the wall decades ago, and its early investments are bearing a rich harvest. It now produces more than half of the world’s electric vehicles and the vast majority of its solar panels.

The US can still compete at the leading edge of the energy sector. American companies are developing innovative new approaches to geothermal, battery recycling and many other energy technologies.

But in the battle to become the world’s 21st-century energy manufacturing powerhouse, the US seems to have walked off the playing field. In Trump’s telling, the US may have simply exited one race and reentered another. But the fossil fuel industry – financially, environmentally and ethically – is obviously a dead end.

In this episode of Inside Automotive, Jim Fitzpatrick checks in with Tim Hovik, dealer principal of San Tan Ford, to discuss how these changes are already affecting his operations and what strategies his team is using to maintain momentum in EV sales. Hovik, who previously set a national EV sales record at his store, shares practical insights on consumer behavior, inventory challenges, and future demand expectations.

The rollback of EV tax credits is already influencing the car-buying process, with the $7,500 federal incentive playing a role in nearly every electric vehicle purchase, even if it wasn’t the primary motivator. With the credit set to expire at the end of September, dealerships face the dual challenge of encouraging buyers to act now without discouraging those who may miss the deadline.

San Tan Ford currently has a few hundred EVs on the ground. Recent customer inquiries, including a local pool company planning to buy three Ford Lightnings, reflect growing awareness of the deadline. As the word continues to spread, more customers are expected to act quickly to avoid losing the financial benefit.

""We're always adjusting to something. We adjusted to the microchips and to COVID. We're going to adjust to different tax credits and different incentives, and we'll move forward.""

Used EV inventory remains low, mainly because most early EV buyers are trading in internal combustion vehicles. Many EVs are still on short-term leases, and a surge in off-lease volume is expected over the next two years. That influx will significantly impact the used EV market as these vehicles hit auctions and dealership lots.

EV leasing at San Tan Ford is running at 65%—well above the store’s overall 15% lease penetration. For the Mustang Mach-E, 80% of transactions are leases. Until now, lenders factored in the commercial-use EV tax credit to lower lease costs. Without that contribution, monthly payments could rise substantially unless manufacturers introduce new incentives. The credit itself amounts to several hundred dollars in savings per month when spread across a typical 36-month lease.

EVs account for 20% of San Tan’s new vehicle sales, a rate higher than many non-ZEV state dealers. That success stems from positioning EVs as quality vehicles with a different propulsion system, rather than marketing them solely on their electric powertrain. Matching customers to the right vehicle based on lifestyle and driving habits remains central to the store’s approach.

Roughly 10% of the dealership’s salespeople drive EVs, compared to 50% of the management team. To improve EV selling confidence, Hovik hired an EV specialist from the electric power industry. That specialist supports the sales team and helps close knowledge gaps when engaging with highly informed EV shoppers.

Hovik expects EV sales to continue growing year over year, though at a more moderate pace than many predicted several years ago. Current trends show gradual adoption, often through “split garages,” where households own both an EV and a gas-powered vehicle. Early lease returns have been positive, with all recent EV customers at lease-end choosing to stay with electric.

San Tan Ford continues to market EV inventory aggressively, while also preparing for a new environment where tax credits no longer drive demand. Future growth will rely more on competitive pricing, targeted incentives, and accurate customer alignment than on government support.

This marks a slight decrease in overall sales year-over-year compared to the second quarter of 2024. Despite numerous setbacks, including tariff whiplash, the dismantling of ZEV incentives, and illegal clawbacks of federal funding for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, over 100,000 ZEVs were purchased in California in Q2 of 2025, surpassing 2.3 million sales to date. Californians are making it clear: ZEVs are here to stay.

The U.S. EV sales through the first two quarters of 2025 set a record at 607,089, representing a 1.5% year-over-year increase. Over 30% of new ZEVs sold in the U.S. are sold in California, according to the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Worldwide this year, 25% of vehicle sales are projected to be EVs. Consumers want to drive EVs, and the global move to transition to ZEVs is well underway.

The dip in sales, compared with a year ago, continues to be driven by lower Tesla sales, while non-Tesla ZEVs sales remain strong and stable.

Federal Incentives End on September 30, 2025

With federal incentives ending on September 30, 2025, the time to buy a ZEV is now. Tax credits up to $7,500 are available for eligible new ZEVs purchase or lease and up to $4,000 for eligible used ZEVs. Federal incentives for at-home charging and associated energy storage are also available, up to $1,000.

There are currently 150 ZEV models available in California — a 35% increase compared to Q2 of 2024. There’s never been a better time to buy a ZEV. Not only do ZEVs clean the air, but they’re also fun and powerful to drive and cost less to maintain compared to traditional vehicles.

California is the National Leader in Zero-Emission Vehicles and Infrastructure

California’s support for clean cars is unmatched. Despite federal headwinds, California has doubled down on improving the state’s charging network and making it easier than ever to own a ZEV:

– Over 178,000 public or shared private electric vehicle charging ports have been installed throughout California, plus over 700,000 at-home charging ports.

– California has nearly 50% more EV charging ports— public and shared private— than the number of gasoline nozzles.

– 94% of Californians live within 10 minutes of an EV charger.

– Grants and rebates for thousands of dollars are available for low-income Californians to purchase ZEVs.

Here’s some of what California is doing to make ZEV fueling accessible to all Californians. State agencies are working to speed up EV charger deployment, cut through red tape, plan for the expected increased grid demand, and efficiently electrify charging stations through local utilities. This includes:

– Providing grant funds that support publicly accessible and at-home charging installations, including in multi-family complexes, in communities throughout the state.

– Prioritizing shovel-ready EV charging installations for both state and federal incentives.

– Developing the Zero-Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Plan, a comprehensive plan that lays out the overall infrastructure strategy to meet California’s ZEV goals.

– Establishing charger reliability standards.

This is the prospect held up by Mr Guterres, who hopes it will galvanise much-needed action.
To keep UK public support strong for green policies, energy ministers – notably Mr Miliband – must ensure a well-planned green transition to bring down prices.","With net zero policies under attack from elected far-right populists as well as autocratic petrostates, and another summer of record-breaking temperatures in Europe, the failure to decarbonise the world’s power supply is as gravely concerning as ever. But the UN secretary general, António Guterres, struck an optimistic note in a recent speech in New York. The world, he said, “is on the cusp of a new era … The sun is rising on a clean energy age.” Pointing to falls in the cost of onshore wind and solar, and the risk of further gas-price shocks in future, he called on big technology companies – whose datacentres are one reason for soaring energy use – to adopt a target of 100% low-carbon electricity by 2030.

Given US president Donald Trump’s personal hostility to renewable energy, Mr Guterres may be right that it makes more sense to demand action from US businesses at this point. In Scotland earlier this week, Mr Trump launched his latest misleading tirade, urging European leaders to “stop the windmills”.

His repeated attacks on wind power, as well as the recent cancellation of billions of dollars of green energy investment, make Mr Trump a destructive outlier. But populist parties in other countries are also ramping up their opposition to climate goals. In the UK, such positions were once confined to the political fringe. Now, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, is a net zero sceptic who has floated the possibility of a future government quitting the Paris agreement, while her acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie, accused the UN’s most senior climate scientists of bias.

This disturbing shift rightly provoked a strong response from the government. In July Ed Miliband called out Ms Badenoch’s party for its irresponsible and anti-science stance. With the UN’s deadline for countries to present their climate plans (known as nationally determined contributions) coming up, Mr Miliband deserves praise for his commitment. Climate diplomacy depends on politicians having the courage to face down opponents – and convince the public that a safe and secure energy future is within reach.

This is the prospect held up by Mr Guterres, who hopes it will galvanise much-needed action. The goal, agreed two years ago, of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030, is nowhere near being reached. With the UN climate summit nearing, all eyes are on China – the key player in the global renewables boom and the fight to stay within climate limits.

Internationally, and domestically, renewables are the right choice. Colonial rule saw Carbon Brief rank the UK as the world’s fourth-largest historical emitter, behind only the US, China and Russia. To keep UK public support strong for green policies, energy ministers – notably Mr Miliband – must ensure a well-planned green transition to bring down prices. Grids need upgrades to handle wind turbine growth. Supply chain bottlenecks and concerns about human rights in critical minerals mining must be addressed.

In Britain, proposals from Labour MPs to reform energy billing – cutting costs for low-income households that use less power – aren’t just about lowering inflation. They raise a deeper question of fairness, and deserve serious attention as a step toward a more equal energy system, potentially through a social tariff. Ultimately, reforms should cut gas’s sway over electricity prices and couple optimism on renewables with honesty about the challenges.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27525c583ea4385e57503af74841580715aa553b/619_0_4640_3712/master/4640.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=300bed32e55615d6056ae9d51ebef460",N,,2025-08-02 14:02:57.750416

Lexington, Kentucky, has emerged as a prime example of this trend, with its proposed solar farm on the decommissioned Haley Pike Landfill. This project, which aims to convert 400 acres of the 618-acre site into a 100,000-megawatt-hour-per-year solar facility, offers a compelling case study for investors and policymakers alike. By analyzing the financial structure, regulatory context, and comparative performance of similar projects, this article assesses the viability of brownfield solar development as a long-term investment.

The Lexington Model: Lease Revenue and Tax Incentives

The Haley Pike Landfill project, spearheaded by Edelen Renewables, is structured to minimize upfront costs for the city while maximizing long-term returns. The Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government (LFUCG) will lease the land for 30–40 years, generating annual revenue between $171,000 and $265,000. This model avoids direct city investment, relying instead on the developer to finance construction and operations. Crucially, the project aligns with the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)'s tax incentives, which offer up to 10% additional credits for renewable energy developed on brownfields. To qualify, construction must begin by July 2026 or operations must start by December 2027—deadlines Edelen aims to meet.

The project's financial appeal is further bolstered by its projected energy output. Once operational, the facility will supply clean power to Kentucky Utilities, generating revenue through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and renewable energy certificates (RECs). With solar's average ROI at 13.52% for commercial installations (per 2024 data), and the IRA's tax credits reducing capital costs by up to 30%, the project's internal rate of return (IRR) could reach 8–10%, rivaling traditional infrastructure investments.

Comparative Case Studies: Proving the Model's Scalability

Lexington's approach mirrors successful brownfield solar projects in other mid-sized cities. For instance, Vermont's Elizabeth Mine Solar Project (2016), developed on a former copper mine site, generates 5 MW of electricity—enough to power 1,000 homes—while avoiding greenfield development. Similarly, Illinois has incentivized solar on over 40,000 acres of brownfields, with projects like those supported by the Great Plains Institute demonstrating 15–20% ROI through state and federal grants.

These examples highlight a key advantage of brownfield sites: pre-existing infrastructure. Unlike greenfield projects, which require costly site preparation, brownfields often have grid access, flat terrain, and existing roads. For example, the 2021 feasibility study for the Haley Pike Landfill noted its 312 acres of suitable land, with no need for agricultural land conversion—a critical factor in states like Indiana, where 150,000 acres of mine land are being evaluated for solar.

Risk Mitigation and Regulatory Navigation

While brownfield projects face unique challenges—such as environmental remediation and zoning disputes—Lexington's strategy mitigates these risks. The city has already allocated $250,000 for a second feasibility study, ensuring technical and regulatory hurdles are addressed before construction. Additionally, the project's lease structure transfers operational and financial risks to the developer, shielding the city from liability.

Regulatory alignment is another strength. The project complies with Kentucky's Public Service Commission guidelines and avoids conflicts with local zoning laws, which prohibit solar on agricultural land. This contrasts with the city's legal battle over a 384-acre solar farm on Hisle Road, underscoring the importance of jurisdictional clarity. For investors, this regulatory predictability reduces uncertainty, a critical factor in long-term ROI calculations.

Financial Metrics and Long-Term Viability

The Haley Pike project's financials align with industry benchmarks. Solar farms typically achieve payback periods of 10–15 years, with revenue streams lasting 20–30 years post-construction. Given Lexington's projected lease revenue and the developer's access to tax credits, the project's net present value (NPV) is likely positive, even at conservative discount rates.

A reveals that brownfield projects outperform their greenfield counterparts by 2–3 percentage points, driven by lower site preparation costs and tax incentives. For example, Pennsylvania's commercial solar installations averaged a 14.45% ROI in 2024, while Delaware's lagged at 10.88%, illustrating the impact of state-level incentives.

Investment Implications and Strategic Recommendations

For investors, brownfield solar projects like Lexington's represent a dual opportunity: financial returns and environmental impact. The sector's resilience—solar costs have fallen 82% since 2010—further strengthens its appeal. To capitalize on this, investors should prioritize projects with:

1. Strong lease agreements ensuring steady revenue for 30+ years.

2. Access to federal and state incentives (e.g., IRA tax credits, state grants).

3. Proximity to transmission infrastructure to reduce interconnection costs.

4. Robust feasibility studies mitigating technical and regulatory risks.

Mid-sized cities with brownfield sites, like Lexington, offer a unique sweet spot: sufficient land for utility-scale projects without the high costs of urban development. As the sector matures, early movers in this niche—such as developers targeting the 43 million acres of EPA-identified brownfields—stand to benefit from both market growth and policy tailwinds.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for Sustainable Urban Development

The Haley Pike Landfill project exemplifies how post-industrial cities can leverage underutilized assets for clean energy. By combining lease revenue, tax incentives, and environmental remediation, Lexington's model offers a replicable framework for other mid-sized cities. For investors, the key takeaway is clear: brownfield solar projects are not just a sustainability play—they're a financially viable, long-term investment in the energy transition. As the IRA and similar policies expand, the ROI on these projects will only grow, making them a cornerstone of the renewable energy economy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 15:00:35.295205

The Trump administration recently released an “AI Action Plan,” which vowed to expedite permitting for the construction of energy-intensive data centers. During the unveiling of the plan, President Donald Trump acknowledged the growing need for power to run these data centers, which are being built across the country by companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft.

New reporting by the Washington Post suggests consumers are seeing a spike in their energy bills because of these data centers. According to the report, customers in the areas serviced by PJM Interconnection have seen their electricity bills increase. In Ohio, prices are up between 10% and 15%, while in New Jersey, prices have increased 20%.

Experts have told NewsNation that a 5-gigawatt data center could use more energy a year than many states — but they insist Big Tech growth isn’t solely to blame for the recent price increases.

They are not necessarily affecting electricity bills,” said Tricia Pridemore, president of the National Association of Regulatory Commissioners. “These large AI data centers that you keep hearing about on the news, they are in the planning and construction phase at this point.”

Supply and demand are believed to be behind cost increases in the PJM territory. PJM is a reorganized market; they have a capacity auction in which power industries bid to supply enough electricity in the future. Right now, there is a greater demand because more supply will be needed for these data centers. At PJM’s recent auction, prices went up a record 22%, according to Reuters.

“Within reorganized markets such as PJM, MISO, SPP, they go out and use independent power producers to generate electricity. Based upon the electricity that is available, those market prices drive the cost of the electricity to anyone in the system, whether it’s a residential customer or a commercial or a business customer,” Pridemore said.

According to Pridemore, data centers can reduce their power usage and cost by using renewable energy, and some are already tapping into solar energy.",https://www.counton2.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/08/AP21050650262509-e1754146560897.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-02 14:04:13.024654

If the recent nuclear energy summit is any indication, there is demand for new nuclear energy and new investment in the Show-Me State.","On July 17, Gov. Mike Kehoe convened Missouri’s first nuclear energy summit — a wide-ranging discussion of nuclear power in the Show-Me State. The gathering featured engaging speakers, thoughtful discussion, an excellent venue, and, unexpectedly, some top-notch cinnamon rolls. However, what stood out to me was the sense of momentum, as the event was charged (no pun intended) with hope and ambition. Throughout the approximately seven-hour summit, a few key themes repeatedly emerged:

The urgent need for new nuclear power to meet soaring electricity demand, especially among businesses;

Progress on regulatory reform in Washington, D.C.;

The opportunity for Missouri to attract investment with abundant, reliable nuclear energy.

But even with all the great ideas discussed at the summit, I think one promising solution was missing: consumer-regulated electricity (CRE).

Bringing 'business speed' to nuclear energy

CRE is a policy concept that would allow private investors to create new, independent electric power systems (encompassing both generation and transmission) using their own capital. In theory, to operate outside of Missouri Public Service Commission (MPSC) oversight, CRE systems would need to be unconnected from the main grid and only serve new, large commercial and industrial customers such as AI data centers or energy-intensive manufacturers (which are driving much of the growth in demand).

These entities would still be subject to federal regulation, including safety and licensing oversight by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for nuclear projects. Essentially, CRE would reduce some state-level red tape without compromising safety standards. In the sea of regulations that nuclear power developers must navigate, this streamlining could make a noticeable difference.

The concept came to my mind early in the summit, when Governor Kehoe spoke of the need for new nuclear development to progress at “business speed,” not “bureaucratic speed.”

Bureaucratic speed, sadly, has been the pace of American nuclear power development for the past few decades. With growing electricity demand and bipartisan support, federal reform is taking place in the sector. These reforms should be beneficial, and public utilities will play a key role in bringing advanced nuclear power onto the grid. However, CRE could also allow private developers to help meet state and national needs.

As demonstrated by Microsoft, Meta, and Google, many big businesses are looking for available, consistent nuclear energy to power their endeavors — and they need it quickly. CRE could allow private developers to construct nuclear power plants closer to “business speed” and free from as much red tape as possible.

During a discussion on economic development, one panelist noted that a key driver in site selection is how quickly a power plant can be ready for a prospective company. CRE could position Missouri to deliver quickly, not just with nuclear energy, but with natural gas, solar power, newly built or reactivated coal, or hybrid systems as well. The key is letting private developers respond rapidly and efficiently to the needs of large customers.

However, CRE is not only about speed. It could also relieve strain on the primary grid without burdening ratepayers. Rather than relying on ratepayers to fund new power plants to accommodate rising electricity demand driven by large consumers, CRE could provide a targeted, private-sector solution. New Hampshire moved forward with CRE this past session, and Missouri may benefit from evaluating how its statutes could be amended to allow for such innovation.

If the recent nuclear energy summit is any indication, there is demand for new nuclear energy and new investment in the Show-Me State. To move toward these goals while taking advantage of ongoing federal reform, Missouri should allow private developers to help meet this demand and bring new energy online at business speed.

From 2022 to 2024, the popularity of battery EVs (BEVs), plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) and hybrid EVs (HEVs) in Thailand surged.
To qualify for a 2% excise tax rate, manufacturers must use domestically produced parts as specified.
If they do not use the required locally produced components, the excise tax rate will be 10%, said the source.
By 2030, automakers must use inverters manufactured domestically to qualify for the lower excise tax rate.","Former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra said during a recent conference that the government should impose a high excise tax on imported electric vehicles (EVs) that use a low proportion of local content.

Thailand's free trade agreements (FTAs) with some countries have resulted in a 0% import tariff on EVs, which hampers the domestic auto industry.

Thaksin said imported EVs should be required to use a minimum level of local content, such as car seats, to protect the domestic industry.

Thailand signed an FTA with China primarily using the Asean-China FTA framework around 20 years ago, setting zero tariffs on imports, including EVs.

Following the speech, the Excise Department is preparing to adjust the excise tax structure for vehicles, linking it to the use of local content.

Imported EVs with a high proportion of domestically manufactured components will, in principle, be eligible for a lower excise tax rate than those with a smaller proportion of local content.

Fully imported vehicles or completely built-up units would be subject to higher excise taxes.

According to Deputy Finance Minister Paopoom Rojanasakul, the goal is to support the domestic auto parts industry by encouraging the automotive sector to increase the use of domestically manufactured parts via tax incentives.

However, pundits say it is likely such attempts partially stem from ongoing US tariff threats.

Will lower import tariffs give American cars a competitive edge?

Thailand's automotive industry is unlikely to be affected by the reduction of import tariffs as American vehicles do not have any advantages over cars produced in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand, in terms of parts prices, quality, or the speed of model updates, said Sompop Manarungsan, an analyst on the Chinese and American economies.

Chinese and Japanese automakers tend to update models faster, responding to consumer demand more effectively than US automakers, he said.

Mr Sompop said American cars have always struggled to penetrate foreign markets, even when import tariffs were low. For example, in Japan American cars have a limited market share due to these reasons. The global automotive industry is also transitioning towards EVs.

In the US, Tesla is the only major EV manufacturer as the first administration of US President Donald Trump ended policies promoting EVs, hindering the development of the country's EV industry.

Meanwhile, Southeast Asia's auto industry, particularly Thailand, is increasingly shifting to EVs. As well as being more affordable, there is a wider range of attractive models and they are more energy-efficient than cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE), said Mr Sompop.

From 2022 to 2024, the popularity of battery EVs (BEVs), plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) and hybrid EVs (HEVs) in Thailand surged.

EV registrations rose from 84,500 units in 2022 to 206,000 units in 2024. During that period, 644 projects applied to the Board of Investment (BoI) for investment promotion for EV production and parts, with a combined investment value exceeding 280 billion baht.

In the first half of 2025, 57,289 new BEV passenger cars were registered in Thailand, a 52% increase year-on-year, accounting for more than 15% of all new car registrations, the highest proportion in the region.

Thailand has more than 203,000 registered BEV passenger cars, 71,900 electric motorcycles, 3,800 electric buses and trucks, and 1,000 electric three-wheelers.

What is the state of the EV market in Thailand?

Many Chinese EV brands built manufacturing plants in Thailand, including battery factories. However, intense price competition forced some EV brands out of the market, requiring them to return government incentives, such as EV purchase subsidies of up to 150,000 baht per car and excise tax reductions, in addition to tax penalties.

Due to this fierce competition, the National EV Policy Committee, also known as the EV Board, was compelled to adjust the production-to-import compensation measures to prevent an EV glut in the domestic market.

The board last week eased production requirements for EV manufacturers participating in EV incentive schemes if they produce BEVs for export, in an effort to promote Thailand as an EV export base.

The two schemes -- EV3.0 and EV3.5 -- require manufacturers to produce EVs locally to compensate for imported vehicles since the start of the schemes in 2022 prior to commencing local production.

These production requirements have become an uphill task for companies as the domestic market stagnates.

Under EV3.0, companies that started producing BEVs in 2024 are committed to a 1:1 ratio target, meaning they must produce one BEV domestically for every EV they import.

If commencing production in 2025, the ratio is set at 1.5 locally produced BEV for each imported BEV. The ratios are set at 1:2 and 1:3 for manufacturers under the EV3.5 programme, which is aimed at propelling EV industry growth between 2024 and 2027.

This approach, proposed by the Federation of Thai Industries, is expected to increase the number of EV exports to roughly 12,500 units this year and 52,000 units in 2026.

What is the goal of the tax promotion measures for EVs?

Thailand clearly wants to shift from being a leading producer of ICE-powered vehicles -- ranked 10th globally in 2023 -- to production of EVs.

To support this transition, the Excise Department designed tax measures to attract automakers to establish EV production bases in here, especially for EV components, such as inverters, which convert direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC); batteries; battery management systems, which monitor and control the battery system to ensure safety, performance and lifespan; and drive control units, which manage the propulsion of electric motors by processing inputs from the accelerator, steering, and braking systems and sending commands to the inverter.

A source from the Excise Department who requested anonymity said after the EV promotion measures expire in 2025, the department plans to implement tax measures to make Thailand a production base for EVs, particularly for the manufacturing of key components.

To qualify for a 2% excise tax rate, manufacturers must use domestically produced parts as specified. If they do not use the required locally produced components, the excise tax rate will be 10%, said the source.

The requirement to use locally made components will be implemented in stages, noted the source. Starting in 2026, automakers wishing to benefit from the lower tax rate must use batteries manufactured within the country, whether at the cell, module or pack level.

All EV manufacturers with facilities in Thailand are capable of producing batteries at the pack level.

By 2030, automakers must use inverters manufactured domestically to qualify for the lower excise tax rate. However, if a car manufacturer invests in a battery cell production facility, it is not required to invest in an inverter production plant.

By 2035, manufacturers are required to invest in the production of battery management systems and drive control units.

As for fully imported vehicles from China that avoid import tariffs under the Asean-China FTA, the Excise Department plans to coordinate with the BoI for the latter to issue support measures for EVs that use local content, according to the source, meaning imported EVs meeting the specified proportion of local content will be eligible for a lower excise tax rate.

Investment promotion for EV production, key components, charging stations, and battery swapping stations tallied a cumulative value of 138 billion baht, including: 21 BEV manufacturing projects with a total investment of 41 billion baht and a combined production capacity of 386,000 units per year; 16 electric motorcycle manufacturing projects with a total investment of 990 million baht and a combined production capacity of 810,000 units per year; and three electric bus and truck manufacturing projects with a total investment of 2.20 billion baht and a combined production capacity of 4,800 units per year.

For battery manufacturing plants, there were 53 projects with a total investment of 80.1 billion baht. Production of other key components such as traction motors, battery management systems, drive control units, and on-board chargers tallied 42 projects with a total investment of 6.52 billion baht.

EV charging stations garnered 29 projects with a total investment of 5.56 billion baht to install 20,080 charging points, including 7,360 quick-charge points. There were five battery swapping station projects with a total investment of 1.28 billion baht, comprising 555 stations for motorcycles, seven stations for large commercial vehicles, and six stations for passenger cars.

As of March 2025, there were 3,720 public EV charging stations with 11,622 charging points nationwide. These consist of 6,524 DC (fast) chargers and 5,098 AC chargers, with coverage across all regions of the country.

Government support for the transition from ICE vehicles to EVs included an excise tax reduction for hybrid vehicles that emit no more than 100 grammes per kilogramme of CO2 to 6% for seven years.

Tax incentives were also revised for PHEVs, which can be developed into EVs in the future. The previous qualification for the 5% excise tax rate had two conditions: an electric range of at least 80 kilometres per full charge and a fuel tank capacity not exceeding 45 litres.

The fuel tank capacity condition was eliminated to better align with vehicle design considerations.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/08/02/5724689_700.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 18:01:53.433080

Mobile charging services are helping ensure that future is also convenient and accessible for everyone.","San Diego has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to sustainability and innovation. From the solar panels dotting rooftops in Hillcrest to the wind turbines visible from Interstate 8, the region embraces clean energy. So it's no surprise that electric vehicles have found a welcoming home here, from the beach communities of La Jolla to the suburban neighborhoods of Poway and everything in between.

But anyone who's driven an EV around San Diego County knows that our beautiful, sprawling region presents unique charging challenges. Whether you're commuting from Carlsbad to downtown, heading to Balboa Park for the weekend, or making the trek to Mission Beach, finding convenient charging can sometimes feel like a puzzle.

Enter mobile EV charging – a service that's starting to reshape how San Diegans think about powering their electric vehicles. Instead of driving to a charging station, the charging comes to you, wherever you happen to be parked across the county.

The process is elegantly simple: when your battery runs low, you request charging through an app or phone call. A trained technician arrives with portable charging equipment or a van loaded with battery packs. They handle the connection and monitoring while you go about your business – whether that's working, shopping, or enjoying one of San Diego's countless outdoor activities. Payment happens automatically through the app.

What struck me most about this concept is how perfectly it fits San Diego's lifestyle. This is a region where people are constantly on the move, often in beautiful but spread-out locations. Having charging adapt to your schedule rather than the other way around feels like a natural evolution for a tech-savvy, environmentally conscious community.

The service addresses something that goes beyond mere convenience. Range anxiety – the worry about running out of battery – often isn't about actual range limitations. It's about the mental load of constantly planning around charging stops. Mobile charging removes that cognitive burden, giving drivers confidence to explore everything San Diego has to offer without constantly checking their battery level.

San Diego's Charging Landscape

San Diego County actually has solid charging infrastructure for a region of its size. Hundreds of public charging stations dot the area, from Electrify America's fast-charging networks to ChargePoint stations at shopping centers and office buildings. Many employers now offer workplace charging, and apps help drivers navigate the growing network of options.

But San Diego's geography creates interesting challenges. The county spans from oceanfront communities to mountain towns, covering nearly 4,500 square miles. What works in compact Gaslamp Quarter doesn't necessarily translate to a day trip to Julian or a business meeting in Escondido. Charging stations aren't evenly distributed, and some of the county's most beautiful destinations remain underserved.

I've spoken with EV owners who describe the particular frustration of charging during peak tourist seasons. Popular spots near the beach or in Balboa Park can have wait times, especially on weekends when both locals and visitors are competing for the same charging infrastructure.

The housing reality also plays a role. While many San Diego residents have garages or driveways where they can install home chargers, others live in apartments, condos, or older neighborhoods where installation isn't straightforward. The region's many military families, who often live in base housing or rent short-term, particularly benefit from alternatives to permanent charging installations.

Mobile charging seems especially valuable for San Diego's outdoor-oriented lifestyle. Whether you're heading to Torrey Pines for hiking, taking the family to the Safari Park, or spending the day at Sunset Cliffs, mobile charging means you can focus on enjoying these experiences rather than worrying about finding a charger afterward.

The service also fits well with the county's significant business travel and conference activity. San Diego hosts numerous conventions and business events throughout the year. Having mobile charging available means visitors and locals alike can keep their vehicles powered while attending meetings or events without having to factor charging stops into already packed schedules.

From a regional planning perspective, mobile charging offers intriguing possibilities as San Diego continues growing and evolving. Rather than trying to predict exactly where new charging infrastructure should go, mobile units can adapt to actual demand patterns and serve different communities as needs change.

The future of transportation in San Diego is clearly electric, supported by the region's commitment to clean air and sustainable living. Mobile charging services are helping ensure that future is also convenient and accessible for everyone.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/688e1ca6e0bcca001cdf8cfe.jpg",N,,2025-08-02 14:04:51.373829

There’s an ironic literary parallel for an Environmental Protection Agency — under leadership of the Trump administration’s Lee Zeldin — that now ignores the first two words in its name: The “firemen” in Ray Bradbury’s classic “Fahrenheit 451” don’t put out fires; armed with flamethrowers, they torch libraries and piles of books.

Zeldin announced last week that the Environmental Protection Agency would seek to rescind the 2009 declaration, made during the Obama administration, known as the endangerment finding. The finding, following years of review of scientific research, concluded that six greenhouse gases, among them carbon dioxide and methane, were warming the planet and posed a threat to public health. That finding was used as the basis by the Obama and Biden administrations under the Clean Air Act to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions for vehicles, power plants and other industrial sources of pollution. Those regulations and tools are, for the moment, projected to limit billions of tons of emissions from entering the atmosphere that would continue to contribute to the rise of global temperatures, creating conditions that are raising sea levels, melting ice caps and glaciers and strengthening the intensity of climate events, including extreme heat events, flooding, droughts, storms and more.

The long-lasting danger in this latest Trump administration undoing of norms is that rescinding the finding is much easier — even though it likely faces a long court challenge — than it will be to reinstate such a standard, hobbling future administrations’ efforts to again regulate emissions and limit the worst of the climate crisis.

Zeldin and the Trump administration believe ending the endangerment finding will unfetter the U.S. economy. Zeldin told a conservative podcast this week that the deregulation he seeks will save U.S. businesses more than $1 trillion; impressive, maybe, until you take a wider view.

As Bloomberg Opinion climate columnist Mark Gongloff noted this week, that $1 trillion will come at a huge expense to Americans and the U.S. economy. A recent estimate from researchers at the Chicago Booth School of Business and the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School estimate that the carbon emissions released by Zeldin’s rescission of the endangerment finding will result in a loss of $87 trillion through 2050; globally the losses could be some $192 trillion by 2050.

And those losses will come alongside damage felt more locally.

The abdication of federal responsibility, if successful, will significantly set back efforts to reduce emissions and prepare for the effects of climate change. Yet that only increases the duty for that work to continue at the local, state and international levels.

That work is underway, notably this week with the continuation of a Snohomish County initiative to develop its Community Wide Climate Resiliency Plan, which last week gathered county residents for an open house to start review of how communities can better strengthen themselves against climate change’s impacts and respond to its effects. (A similar state plan also is in development.)

“Unfortunately, we are already experiencing climate impacts and extreme weather events,” said Alyssa Rodriguez, with Cascadia Consulting, leading Wednesday’s open house at Mariner High School. “Our communities here in Snohomish County are feeling the consequences and the effects of these events through our health, economy and environment.”

Rodriguez started with definitions for climate vulnerability and climate resilience:

“We are defining climate resilience as the ongoing process of preparing and adapting for changes in climate while minimizing negative impacts to people, natural systems and infrastructure,” she said. “Climate vulnerability means how likely will people, places, systems, animals or plants be harmed by climate change impacts?”

The effort is evaluating six key impacts for the county, drawing largely from a report on climate vulnerability completed by the county last year:

Extreme heat: Snohomish County can expect eight to 20 more days of extreme heat each year.

Storms: An increase in frequency and strength of storms.

Flooding: An increase in heavy rainfall events that will contribute to flooding.

Sea level rise: Estimated to rise by 1.5 feet by 2050.

Wildfires: An increase in wildfires and impacts on air quality from smoke.

Reduced snowpack: An expected 45 percent reduction in snowpack in the county’s watersheds by 2050.

Those concerns are then used to determine vulnerability throughout the county — down to the census block — with help of a Climate Vulnerability Tool, developed by the county, that examines population density, demographics, health factors, infrastructure and more.

Wednesday’s open house gathered discussion on areas of review for the draft resiliency plan, including strengthening collaboration among local governments, agencies and community organizations; response and recovery from climate events and disasters; investments in infrastructure; planning for climate impacts; and the protection and restoration of natural systems.

Those conversations will be included in a process involving a survey and comments on a draft that will produce a plan by this winter to outline needs, priorities and solutions for future adaptation and response in the county.

“We’re specifically hoping to coordinate and connect all the varying resiliency efforts that are happening in the county into one place, identify and address climate related challenges, inform disaster preparedness, recovery, adaptation and mitigation plans to reduce impacts, reflect community priorities, values and ensure social equity and align with state, regional and other local priorities,” Rodriguez said.

As dystopian as the ending of Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451” is, included its final scenes are a community of nomads who have committed significant works of literature to memory, preserving ideas and hope.

He also warned of possible delays in low-carbon gas for AI data centers and lithium.
But the Trump administration’s withdrawal of Biden-era subsidies threatens to reduce the profitability of such projects and halt progress.
The hydrogen project in Baytown, Texas, would produce 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day and 1 million tons of ammonia a year from natural gas.
But Trump’s tax bill narrowed the window within which companies could claim the 45V tax incentive from 2033 to 2028.","Exxon Mobil Corp. warned its project to build the world’s biggest low-carbon hydrogen plant in Texas could face delays after Congress curtailed incentives as part of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending package.

“If we can’t see an eventual path to a market-driven business, we won’t move forward with the project,” Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said in a call with analysts Friday. He also warned of possible delays in low-carbon gas for AI data centers and lithium.

Exxon announced plans for a multitude of low-carbon projects over the last few years as the company sought to be an early-mover in mitigating industrial emissions and counter criticism over climate change. But the Trump administration’s withdrawal of Biden-era subsidies threatens to reduce the profitability of such projects and halt progress.

The hydrogen project in Baytown, Texas, would produce 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day and 1 million tons of ammonia a year from natural gas. Some 98% of the associated carbon dioxide would be captured and buried underground. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. agreed to take a 35% stake in the project while JERA Co., Japan’s biggest power provider, signed a non-binding agreement to buy half of the ammonia. Air Liquide SA said the project could use its pipelines.

But Trump’s tax bill narrowed the window within which companies could claim the 45V tax incentive from 2033 to 2028. Woods has always maintained that Exxon’s participation in low-carbon will only come if the company sees a pathway to investor returns.

“While our project can meet this timeline, we’re concerned about the development of a broader market, which is critical to transition from government incentives,” he said.

Further, the cost of hydrogen appears to be putting off potential customers, a major hurdle to Exxon making a final investment decision that would commit billions of dollars of funding.

“The price of the product is a big variable with respect to buyers,” Woods said. “We haven’t FID’d it and we’re not going to until we’ve got secured offtakers so that we have a lot of confidence in the returns that we’re going to generate.”

Exxon also sees potential delays in supplying low-emission natural gas to power data centers. Big Tech initially had a preference for low-carbon electricity sources for AI, but companies now appear to be focusing on securing large power sources irrespective of their CO2 content. Exxon’s plans in this area “may end up slipping as well,” Woods said.

Likewise, lithium is proving a challenge. Exxon had planned to produce the battery-material by 2027 but is still working on bringing down costs, which has become more important as prices collapsed by nearly 90% since 2022.

“That may take longer than we had anticipated just to get our cost down,” Woods said.

Exxon still plans to spend $30 billion in low-emissions investments from 2025 to 2030, in part to be well-positioned if the world moves away from oil and gas. Woods sees “good value propositions” in low-carbon but cautioned: “These things don’t all move in a straight line.”

Conclusion Chevron and ExxonMobil's strategic alliances are redefining what it means to be an oil supermajor in the 21st century.","The energy transition has long been framed as a battle between fossil fuels and renewables. But for oil supermajors like Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM), the path to long-term resilience lies not in choosing sides, but in strategic alliances that blend traditional strengths with emerging opportunities. Over the past year, these two industry titans—once fierce rivals in the “seven sisters” era—have demonstrated a surprising willingness to collaborate, even as they compete for market share. Their joint ventures in offshore Guyana, lithium extraction, and carbon capture underscore a broader shift: oil companies are no longer just energy producers but infrastructure builders for the 21st-century energy system.

The Stabroek Block: A Model for Collaborative Growth

Chevron's $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation in July 2024, which gave it a 30% non-operating stake in the Stabroek Block, is a case study in how strategic alliances can drive shareholder value. The Stabroek Block, operated by ExxonMobil and co-developed with CNOOC, is one of the most prolific oil discoveries of the century, with over 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves. By acquiring Hess's stake, Chevron resolved a contentious dispute with ExxonMobil (which had contested the deal via arbitration) and secured access to a project projected to produce 750,000 barrels per day by 2027.

This move is not just about oil—it's about securing a low-cost, high-margin asset in a region where production costs are less than $10 per barrel. For investors, the Stabroek Block represents a rare combination of near-term cash flow and long-term growth. Chevron's production from the block is expected to reach 186,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2024, with ExxonMobil's stake contributing to Guyana's oil output of over 1.3 million barrels per day by 2027. The project also aligns with broader trends: Guyana's government will receive annual royalty payments exceeding $10 billion by 2030, creating a stable regulatory environment for operators.

Lithium and the Energy Transition: A New Frontier

While the Stabroek Block anchors Chevron and Exxon's traditional energy portfolios, their forays into lithium highlight their adaptability. Both companies have staked claims in the Smackover Formation, a lithium-rich brine resource in the U.S. South. Chevron acquired 125,000 net acres in Texas and Arkansas, while Exxon entered the region in 2023 with a 120,000-acre purchase. Using direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology, they aim to leverage their drilling expertise to become major players in the EV battery supply chain.

Exxon's goal is to supply lithium for over 1 million EVs annually by 2030, a target backed by a nonbinding agreement with LG Chem for 100,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate. Chevron, meanwhile, is allocating 10% of its $15 billion annual capital budget to lower-carbon initiatives, including lithium. These moves reflect a calculated bet on electrification: by 2030, lithium demand is projected to grow 10-fold, driven by EVs and energy storage. For investors, the key question is whether these oil giants can replicate their operational efficiency in a new sector. Early signs are promising: Exxon's first Smackover well in 2023 demonstrated the feasibility of DLE, while Chevron's acquisition of Hess's U.S. onshore assets provides a platform for scaling lithium production.

Capital Optimization and Shareholder Returns

Chevron and Exxon's strategic alliances are underpinned by a shared focus on capital discipline. Both companies have trimmed costs aggressively, with Chevron's Q1 2025 adjusted earnings at $3.8 billion despite a 10% drop in oil prices. Exxon's 2030 Corporate Plan includes $140 billion in major project investments, with a focus on high-return, low-cost-of-supply assets. These strategies have translated into robust returns for shareholders: Exxon returned $9.3 billion in dividends and buybacks in Q2 2025, while Chevron reaffirmed its $10–$20 billion annual buyback plan.

The Stabroek Block and lithium ventures are particularly accretive. Chevron's acquisition of Hess is expected to boost free cash flow by $1.5 billion annually by 2026, while Exxon's $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources is projected to generate $3 billion in annual synergies by 2030. These figures highlight a critical insight for investors: oil companies are not just defending their core businesses—they are reinventing them to capture value in the energy transition.

Strategic Risks and Opportunities

While the Stabroek Block and lithium ventures offer compelling upside, investors must also weigh risks. Regulatory scrutiny of oil majors remains intense, and the energy transition's pace could accelerate faster than these companies' timelines. Additionally, lithium extraction in the Smackover Formation is still unproven at commercial scale, with technical challenges like brine salinity and environmental impact assessments.

However, both Chevron and Exxon are mitigating these risks through collaboration. For example, Exxon's partnership with SLB in Chile diversifies its lithium exposure, while Chevron's joint ventures in the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., the Blind Faith platform) demonstrate its ability to integrate new technologies. Their investments in carbon capture and hydrogen production further insulate them from decarbonization pressures, with Exxon's $17 billion plan through 2027 and Chevron's Bayou Bend and Gorgon projects positioning them as leaders in CCUS.

Investment Implications

For investors seeking resilient energy sector opportunities, Chevron and Exxon offer a compelling mix of stability and innovation. Their strategic alliances in Guyana and the Smackover Formation provide exposure to both near-term cash flow and long-term energy transition themes. Key metrics to monitor include:

- Production growth: Chevron's target of 4.31 million boe/d by 2030 versus Exxon's 5.4 million boe/d.

- Lithium output: Exxon's 2027 commercial production timeline and Chevron's Smackover drilling results.

- Capital efficiency: Free cash flow margins and ROIC trends, particularly as oil prices fluctuate.

These companies are also well-positioned to benefit from policy tailwinds, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for carbon capture and lithium. For a diversified portfolio, investors might consider overweighting these names relative to peers, given their disciplined capital allocation and strategic foresight.

Conclusion

Chevron and ExxonMobil's strategic alliances are redefining what it means to be an oil supermajor in the 21st century. By combining their expertise in high-return oil projects with bold bets on lithium and carbon capture, they are creating a bridge between the energy of the past and the energy of the future. For investors, this dual focus offers a rare combination of resilience and growth—provided they can navigate the risks of a rapidly evolving landscape. As the energy transition accelerates, the companies that adapt fastest will be the ones that thrive.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 14:03:50.778256

The Horowitz Research survey, commissioned by clean energy company EcoFlow, found that Musk's involvement in the Trump administration has driven away customers from Tesla.

Fortunately, this hasn't swayed consumers away from solar energy. In fact, the demand is only rising because of the power grid's instability in the face of extreme weather. People are just aware of the different options that are available when choosing their solar panels.

EnergySage is a helpful resource for finding the right solar panels for your home. Solar is the ultimate home energy hack, as it can lower your monthly utilities to near $0. EnergySage's free tools can help you compare estimates and quotes for solar installation.

The survey found that Tesla had the highest brand recognition. However, 24% of consumers would not choose Tesla for their solar needs, citing their distaste for Musk and the brand.

""The 'anti-Elon' sentiment since the election has resulted in an opportunity for other brands, as homeowners who might have considered Tesla in the past are looking for alternatives,"" the report found.

This is just the latest hit to Tesla, which has seen declining sales and departing talent in recent months. Simultaneously, more electric vehicles and solar competitors have entered the market, giving consumers more choices.

EnergySage is a great way to assess your options for solar installation and get the most out of the tax incentives available to you. Not only can solar panels save you up to $1,500 in annual energy savings, but tax incentives can add up to $10,000 off the installation cost. EnergySage will support you in maximizing the value of your solar purchases.

EnergySage has a helpful mapping tool that shows the average cost and incentives for a home solar panel system in each state. With all of its features, EnergySage can help you get the best price for rooftop solar panels and put the most money back in your pocket.

If you want to save big money on solar installation, it's important to take advantage of tax credits sooner rather than later.

A new survey by EcoFlow and Horowitz Research reveals that 61% of homeowners are feeling the pinch of monthly utility costs, while 74% expect electricity rates to increase in the near future. Another 75% said they are always looking for ways to lower their bills.

These findings come at a time of heightened concern about extreme weather and an aging grid. Nearly half of homeowners in California, Texas, and Florida, the three states included in the survey, anticipate more frequent outages in the years to come.

In recent years, these states have experienced some of the country's most extreme climate events. In July, Texas experienced the second-deadliest flash flood in the state's history. Florida is expected to suffer due to the rising sea level, and California has swung between extreme floods and extreme drought.

One of the best ways to protect yourself from rising utility costs while helping the planet is by going solar. Solar panels can dramatically reduce long-term energy costs and lower the amount of planet-overheating pollution your home produces. But for many families, the upfront costs of a solar installation can be daunting.

That's where leasing options like Palmetto's LightReach program come in, which seamlessly builds a custom solar panel design plan based on your address and home energy needs.

Leasing solar panels can help you access clean energy while avoiding large out-of-pocket expenses. Some plans offer no-money-down options, so you can start saving without a hefty upfront investment.

This kind of setup is becoming increasingly appealing: The same survey found that 70% of homeowners already have solar panels or are interested in installing them, with cost savings, energy independence, and clean energy being the top motivators. But among those still unsure, cost remains the biggest hurdle.

Leasing can be a smart first step for families who want the benefits of solar without the high upfront cost. Palmetto's local leasing program can help you explore what options are available in your area.

If you're not ready to lease, EnergySage offers a free, easy way to compare quotes for purchasing and installing solar panels from vetted local providers.

And, if you're still on the fence, you can first take some time to weigh the value of leasing vs. buying solar panels for your family and specific lifestyle.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/solar-panelsimage-recuSu72M6wThvGdK.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 13:08:30.978461

Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Jim Farley has issued a stark warning to the automotive world, describing China’s electric vehicle industry as a formidable force that Western manufacturers must confront head-on. In a recent appearance at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley recounted his multiple visits to China, where he witnessed firsthand the rapid advancements in EV technology and production efficiency. “It’s the most humbling thing I’ve ever seen,” he said, highlighting how Chinese automakers now produce 70% of the world’s EVs with superior in-vehicle technology that integrates seamlessly with consumer devices.

This sentiment echoes broader industry concerns, as Farley emphasized the existential threat posed by competitors like BYD and Geely, who benefit from two decades of experience and substantial government support. According to reports from InsideEVs, Farley’s trips revealed vehicles equipped with advanced features from tech giants like Huawei and Xiaomi, where phones connect effortlessly without pairing, creating a “software-defined” experience that outpaces many Western offerings.

Ford’s Strategic Pivot Amid Cost Pressures

To counter this, Ford has launched a secretive “skunkworks” project, assembling a small, agile team to develop an affordable EV platform. This initiative, detailed in Torque News, aims to address the cost disadvantages Western firms face, including a reported $5,000 per vehicle gap compared to rivals like Toyota due to tariffs and supply chain issues. Farley has been vocal about engaging with policymakers, including the Trump administration, to mitigate these barriers and foster a more competitive environment.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) from users like Sawyer Merritt amplify Farley’s message, noting his admiration for Chinese innovations such as the Xiaomi EV, which he reportedly shipped back to the U.S. for study. These social media insights reflect growing industry sentiment that China’s integration of AI and consumer services into vehicles represents a paradigm shift, far beyond mere cost efficiencies.

A ‘Model T Moment’ on the Horizon

Looking ahead, Farley has teased a major EV reveal on August 11, 2025, dubbing it Ford’s “Model T moment” – a nod to the revolutionary affordability that transformed the auto industry a century ago. As covered in Detroit Free Press, this strategy involves unveiling a new family of electric vehicles designed to compete directly with low-cost Chinese imports, potentially reshaping Ford’s lineup and market position.

Industry insiders speculate this could include breakthroughs in battery technology and modular platforms, drawing from lessons learned in China. However, challenges remain, including regulatory hurdles and the need for rapid scaling. Farley’s repeated alarms, as reported in Carscoops, underscore the urgency: “If we lose this, we do not have a future Ford.”

Broader Implications for Global Auto Competition

The discourse extends to forums like Reddit, where threads in r/technology, such as this discussion, debate the quality and innovation edge of Chinese EVs, with users sharing anecdotes of superior build and tech integration. This online buzz aligns with Farley’s observations, fueling calls for Western automakers to innovate aggressively.

Ultimately, Farley’s insights signal a critical juncture for the industry, where adaptation to China’s advancements could determine survival.

The projected expansion underscores the country’s commitment to scaling up domestic renewable energy production and reducing its dependence on imports, particularly from China.

PLI Scheme Powers Manufacturing Momentum

The government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme drives this growth by providing financial support to set up integrated solar module manufacturing units. The scheme not only covers final module production but also incentivizes backward integration—from wafers to cells to modules—ensuring control over the entire solar value chain.

Industry Giants Lead the Way

Reducing Import Dependency, Building Export Potential

India aims to minimize reliance on Chinese imports by enhancing domestic capacity. It also seeks to position itself as a potential exporter of solar cells and modules. The government and industry players expect the anticipated 42 GW capacity to meet domestic demand. They also foresee export opportunities in global markets.

Supporting the 2030 Renewable Energy Vision

The government’s manufacturing push supports India’s broader clean energy vision, targeting 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based capacity by 2030. Solar energy will play a central role in this transition. Policymakers and industry leaders view a strong domestic manufacturing base as critical to achieving these ambitious goals.

Bright Outlook for India’s Solar Industry

India’s solar cell manufacturing sector is set for rapid and resilient growth. This is driven by policy support, private investment, and rising energy demand. As reported by knnindia.co.in, the expansion reinforces the country’s position as a key player in the global clean energy transition.

Simply put, it represented the largest investment in clean energy in American history and would have come close to the previous administration's stated goal of halving emissions by 2030. But in the blink of an eye, the pendulum has swung all the way back, and all of that potential progress is now in grave danger.

In place of the IRA now sits the Big Beautiful Bill, which is poised to undo virtually all of the environmental regulations and tax credits signed into law just three years ago.

Among the bill's many extreme implications, it doubles down on dirty energy sources despite the clean energy market's increasing cost-efficiency, and earned the ire of Tesla CEO and one-time Donald Trump ally Elon Musk for eliminating all financial incentives to purchase electric vehicles. Suffice it to say, the American environmental lobby has been dealt a major setback.

These changes are not immediate, however.

For instance, many of the IRA's tax credits expire at the end of 2025, so there is still nearly half a year left to take advantage of their offerings. For instance, one incentive that remains is a $840 rebate on induction ranges, which have rapidly become the superior option on the stove market.

They're safer than gas stoves, heat quicker, and are much more eco-friendly. Plus, for renters or people who cannot afford a major kitchen renovation, plug-in induction burners are excellent secondary options. They are relatively cheap compared to their full-stove counterparts (starting at $50).

Some of the clean appliance rebates from the IRA will remain after the passing of the BBB (including those for induction stoves, in fact). However, taking advantage of the incentives earlier rather than later could be worth thousands of dollars.

First citizen to speak was Denise Howard.

“We received a letter yesterday stating, ‘July 29, 2025, dear neighbor, this is a courtesy letter that is to inform you that the Gray County Commissioners Court meeting originally scheduled for August 1, 2025 to consider an updated tax abatement for the Meitner Project is being rescheduled. We will reach back out when a new hearing date has been confirmed. For all previous notice, Intersect Power is planning to develop an air-cooled data center instead of a hydrogen facility and will seek a new abatement to replace the existing hydrogen abatement that was executed on March 7, 2024. You are receiving the notice because you own property within the Chapter 312 Tax Abatement reinvestment zoned established on November 15, 2023. Being within the reinvestment zone does not necessarily mean your property is part of or immediately adjacent to any project facility. Our project infrastructure will be cited on private property under agreement with Intersect Power. We are still in the process of planning, including finalizing the exact locations of the project. Facilities will then share more information with the community as it becomes available. If you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposed project, we can be contacted using the information below. We welcome your feedback.’ Of course, we all know the listed information below is a dead end. My question is: if there’s supposed to be a request for consideration today from Intersect Power for a 30-day extension date for September 2, why are we already getting letters stating that they already have the extension?”

Next to speak was Justin Holman.

“First thing I want to lead off with is Intersect-Mr. Hudson knows that I’ve had trouble getting information out of them, and Mr. Haley has been concerned with that. I have yet to receive the letter they sent out. They were supposed to have sent one out after the last commissioners meeting, but I haven’t received it. They did in fact call me from an unlisted number. I did advise them it’s probably not a good idea to call from unlisted numbers, but it was just happenstance that I decided to pick it up. She didn’t answer any of my questions. She did tell me about this today, which I already knew about. I learned after the last commissioners meeting that they now have an unnamed partner. If they are going to be an applicant on this abatement, it is my understanding of the law, that should be public knowledge whoever the applicant may be. I just wanted to throw that out there in case you missed it. I’m against this, you already know that. There’s no sense in me saying anymore.”

Next to speak was Michael Pickens.

“I am out of Dike, Texas in Hopkins County, about 100 miles east of Dallas. I run one of the largest grassroots organizations in the state of Texas for the past five years, me and my mother have, out there in east Texas fighting a French company solar farm. It’s been a really bad deal. My connection up here is I have family that’s been in Dumas since the Civil War and other family that’s been rangers out of Amarillo before the Civil War, so I love the panhandle and it’s sad to see so much of this renewable energy stuff come up here that we have been fighting out there in east Texas. So one of the questions that I have about so much of the solar and wind coming in, is that the local politicians in these counties are Republicans, and the head of your party is President Trump. I didn’t vote for him, but I kind of like what he’s done with killing the money coming for solar and wind. I like the comments he’s made about solar and wind, how destructive it can be and how he doesn’t want it in this country. So I would imagine the Republicans that run all these counties would fight the solar and wind coming in and get aligned with the President of the United States. That doesn’t seem to be happening and it’s odd to me. I will tell you guys that a solar farm that was built across my mother’s fence in Dike has been a nightmare. No one ever got a job in the county at that farm. There was a crew from Minnesota and Montana that came in and built it and one guy out of Montana runs it. We sued the county on a 312 tax abatement about four years ago. It was done illegally and the county commissioners had gotten an abatement that was beneficial to the company but detrimental to the county. It’s a mess. I had testified down in Austin this year to try to keep solar and wind out of the 312s. It made it in the Senate, but died in the House, but we will try again in two years. I tell you guys that I’m teamed up with Denise’s group here in the panhandle and will do everything I can to protect this gorgeous part of the country. Thank you.”

Next to speak was Mayor Mike Borger.

“I’m here to speak in favor of this abatement. The wisdom of the commissioners court approved an abatement for this reinvestment zone previously for a hydrogen plant, which frankly had many head-winds and wasn’t as well-funded as what you’re considering now. This is well-funded, it’s cleaner, it’s quicker and adds more value to the tax base of Gray County. The last meeting when I was here, there was some concern that the tax base of Gray County as $1.5 billion, and this would add $3 billion, so it would triple the tax base and provide a lot of revenue for you gentlemen to get things done in the county. There are those who are against that, but I would challenge them to come up with a better plan in 10 years to triple the tax base in Gray County. This is a unique and rare opportunity. Who knew that out there in that flat land, parched by the sun with the wind blowing, it had so much potential? These days it does. We have naysayers that based on misinformation have all kinds of concerns about it, but I want to tell you that my sister lives in Abilene and has for a long time, and they have one of the largest data centers. I asked her how it was going, and she said, ‘Abilene is doing great and prospering like never before.’ They were a community like us tied primarily to oil and gas, but because production had dropped, so did their income and livelihoods. But she says that Abilene is doing great and there’s money there to do infrastructure projects and things they’ve needed for a long time. I said, ‘what about the trouble, is there trouble?’ She said she wasn’t seeing any trouble. These things that naysayers are bringing up are overblown and I think they have other motives. Maybe they already have land, cattle, and everything they need, so they’re not concerned with the income of others in Gray County. The fact is, the State of Texas which include a lot of impovershed areas that median income is almost $70,000, right here it is $48,000. That’s our challenge, and we have a great opportunity here to do something about. I encourage you guys, you were bold the first time and even bolder on this one. It’s a good deal. Intersect has been good community partners that give money to the important things here, and they’re going to stick around. People that haven’t done large transactions don’t understand that you have to protect yourself until the right time. I encourage you to approve this extension.”

Next to speak was Secora Belknap.

“I was born and raised, and have lived here in Pampa for 45 years. I’m against a proposed tax abatement. If it passes, me and my family will have to make decision to stay or go. I went on public record that I am against this deal. Intersect is promising Pampa a booming start, but they can’t deliver on that. Historically, businesses that come into Pampa fail. I am a product of that. I worked for a medical billing place for almost five years before they laid me off because they were losing clients. There’s too many unanswered questions by Intersect. This project has serious consequences that will be long-lasting even after Intersect leaves Gray County. Gentlemen, you make your decision and I’ll make my decision about what is best for my family.”

Next to speak was Sena Brainard.

“As I was driving here this morning, it crossed my mind: why did the Gray County commissioners put private property owners in the reinvestment zone when they had no desire to be in it? Our country was founded on the rights of the individual over the group. If you don’t know that, then you didn’t study your political science in school and I suggest you read it. Numerous people from the beginning told y’all, ‘we are not doing this, we are not participating with Intersect Power, and we want nothing to do with it,’ and then you included their private property in this line. You trampled on them, you did not listen to them. You could’ve struck your property off this line. They did not come to you and ask to be put on this. A company that preys on communities like ours came and asked you to put private property in these notes. You all say we don’t have to worry about imminent domain? Yes, you do, because you do not know that Intersect Power is known for selling their projects over and over again. They admitted it in the last meeting. They said they owned three, but you don’t know who they might sell this project to. It could be a public utility, and a public utility has imminent domain. There’s a lot that needs to be thought about and in the future, I hope when a private property owner appears before and says, ‘I don’t want this and I don’t want to be a part of this,’ you strike them off. It’s not right that you included their property into this stuff when they have no desire to be part of it. It’s not like they’re a block within the city like I am, these are individual private property owners dating back to the earliest settlers of this county and you put them in there without their permission. And they have appeared here meeting after meeting saying, ‘I don’t like this, this is what they’re doing to me.’ Their rights, individual, comes before the whole, and if you believe the whole comes before the individual, that is known as National Socialism and everyone should be against that.”

Next to speak was Rick Amerson.

“I stand firm in my opposition to a tax abatement to Intersect Power. What is this company bringing to Pampa? One million solar panels, 180 wind turbines, and three massive air-conditioned barns packed with high-powered computing equipment. What else? Jobs? Well, maybe a handful, but most Intersect employees work from home by company policy from the initiation. If a job can be done remotely, it will be. We’ve been down this road before: remember the pig farm? They promised to bring jobs in exchange for a tax abatement. How’d that work out? Where’s the pig farm today? Gone! That is, the pigs and jobs are gone, but the vacant barns remain. Their interest in Pampa expired when the tax abatement expired, leaving Pampa to deal with the detritus left behind. Will history repeat with Intersect’s barns? The AI equipment they install in the barns won’t last five years before requiring costly upgrades. Maybe they’ll upgrade once, maybe twice, but then what? AI technology is advancing so rapidly, it’s obsolete before a cowboy bucked off a bull even hits the ground. You rode the Intersect bull and it threw you before the 8 second-or rather 30-day-buzzer sounded. Intersect is offering a re-ride-don’t take it. Intersect says they’re constructing $3 billion worth of barns, plus solar panels and wind turbines. They’ll recover half that in tax credits. Billions of dollars held up waiting on a ten million dollar tax abatement from Gray County. Wow. ‘A dollar waiting on a dime,’ as my friend Wes Green says. AI is slipping through Intersect’s fingers faster than a greased pig at a dying pig farm. China’s DeepSeek changed AI, literally overnight. The Wall Street Journal says more overnight changes are on the way. That data center may be obsolete before they even paint the Pampa logo on the front door. If Intersect wants to come to Pampa, let them come as full-fledged, tax-paying citizens, just like the rest of us. No one here gets a tax abatement-I know I’m not-how about you? No need to push out the decision 30 days, because you already know the answer: just say no. What we get is a blight on our land, potential future issues with water and power, and higher utility rates. Are they helping to fund Pampa’s upkeep? Nope-you’re going to abate taxes for that. Road wear and tear? Nope. Same. You’re letting a homeless nephew move into our bedroom rent-free. He won’t mow the grass nor do the dishes, but he sure eats a lot, and drives our pickup using our gas. Does Pampa need another pig arms, this time with AI pigs? Many Pampa residents here join me in saying, ‘No way, no how, not now, not ever!’”

“I want to start off by saying that I absolutely hate wind turbines. They are an aging, soon-to-be-obsolete technology that’s been propped up by federal subsidies, as part of the Democrat’s so-called ‘green energy’ intitiatives. Plus, they are incredibly ugly-a blight on the land. Wind turbines are also horrible for the environment, using much more fossil fuel to manufacture, transport, install and operate than they ever produce. They are dangerous to migrating birds who get killed and maimed by the blades. The blades themselves wear out all too quickly and can’t be recycled, so they are buried in deep pits in the ground, staying there forever. I understand that under Texas law, Intersect will supposedly be responsible for removing the wind turbines from the land when they decide to abandon the project. However, they are only responsible for taking out the first three feet of concrete support, leaving the other 12 feet of concrete in the ground. So once wind turbines are put in place, they can never really go away. The land will never be the same. As a CPA, I’ve been studying the tax provisions of Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. As I understand it, this new law eliminates the clean electricity production credit and investment credit for projects placed in service after 2027, except for projects that begin construction within 12 months of the bill’s passage. So that tells me that Intersect only has until July 4, 2026 to begin construction of these horrible wind turbines. There are many companies out there building data center. I really hope that we did extensive due diligence in selecting Intersect Power. Intersect uses an LLC model for every different phase of their operations, which lets them easily wiggle out of any restrictions we may try to put on them. The land east of Pampa is incredibly beautiful. Open spaces, well-managed grasslands, and thriving crops. And yet, we are considering destroying this precious heritage by putting in forests of unsightly wind turbines, lured by Intersect’s promise of huge monthly payments to the landowners. But these huge payments may never materialize. As Intersect loses interest in this project, or as technology changes, we may be left with empty buildings, broken solar panels, and incredibly ugly silent wind turbines. If denying Intersect a tax abatement causes them to abandon this ill-fated project and go elsewhere, I will not shed a single tear.”

Next items on the agenda were to approve the minutes of the previous meeting, pay the bills as presented by the County Auditor, and consider any line-item transfers or budget amendments; all were approved.

Next was to consider a request from Intersect Power for a 30-day extension to September 2nd, 2025, at the Gray County Commissioners Court Regularly Scheduled Meeting, for consideration of a tax abatement for a data center.

“As everyone at this table already knows, we are in negotiations and have not negotiated a tax abatement,” Judge Porter said. “Because of that, Intersect has requested a 30-day extension for negotiations. If we do not approve the negotation 30-day extension, negotiations stop and we cannot continue unless they resubmit and application which starts the process all over again with a 30-day cooling period.”

“We have an executive session scheduled for August 18 and if we are to pass this extension, my understanding is that their partners will be here to talk to us in that executive session and all of us will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements until the abatement is resolved.”

The motion was approved for the extension.

The ITER project has successfully completed the sixth and final component of its central solenoid, a magnet so powerful it could levitate an aircraft carrier. This technological feat not only marks a significant advancement in energy production but also underscores the importance of global collaboration in addressing worldwide challenges.

Understanding the Role of the Central Solenoid

The central solenoid is a critical component of the ITER Tokamak reactor. As the pulsating core, it drives the fusion process necessary for generating energy. This superconducting magnet is essential for creating and sustaining the superheated plasma required for nuclear fusion. The ionized hydrogen gas that forms the plasma core reaches temperatures of 150 million degrees Celsius, which is ten times hotter than the sun’s core.

Inside the reactor, this extreme heat causes atomic nuclei to fuse, releasing a significant amount of energy in what is known as a fusion reaction. The solenoid itself, once fully assembled, will weigh nearly 3,000 tons, standing at 42.6 feet tall and 13.1 feet wide. It works in concert with other magnetic systems to create a magnetic “cage” that confines the plasma and allows engineers to control the fusion reaction. At its peak performance, the solenoid will endure forces equivalent to 13.5 million pounds, exemplifying the engineering marvel that makes this fusion breakthrough possible.

The Significance of a Magnet That Can Levitate an Aircraft Carrier

The extraordinary power of the central solenoid lies in its ability to produce magnetic fields strong enough to suspend plasma in mid-air, a necessity given the extreme conditions required for nuclear fusion. The temperatures inside the reactor are so high that no material container could withstand them, making magnetic fields essential for preventing contact between the plasma and reactor walls. The central solenoid plays a vital role in this process, providing the magnetic force needed to suspend the plasma for durations of 300 to 500 seconds.

This capability to levitate an aircraft carrier is not just a measure of power; it is a critical requirement for achieving effective fusion. The solenoid’s magnetic energy, quantified at 6.4 gigajoules, is a testament to its immense capacity. With this technology, the ITER project aims to produce 500 megawatts of power with an input of only 50 megawatts, highlighting the potential for a future where clean, abundant energy is a reality.

International Collaboration and Its Impact

The ITER project exemplifies the power of international cooperation. Europe has shouldered 45% of the costs, with six other countries contributing 9% each, making ITER a truly global endeavor. This collaboration demonstrates how nations can set aside differences to address pressing challenges like climate change and energy security. Pietro Barabaschi, ITER’s Director-General, notes that the technical complexity and international framework of the project are crucial to its success.

Despite varying political landscapes, this collaboration has remained strong, showing that humanity can unite for the greater good. As the project advances, the world watches with anticipation, recognizing the transformative potential that nuclear fusion holds for our future. This global effort is not only pioneering energy solutions but also setting a precedent for how international cooperation can tackle existential challenges.

Challenges Ahead and the Road to Completion

Despite its achievements, the ITER project faces significant challenges before the reactor becomes fully operational. Initiated in 2007, the team now anticipates the first operation by 2035. This timeline reflects the intricate nature of the project, requiring precise engineering and coordination among international partners. As the reactor assembly progresses, integrating complex systems and ensuring safety standards remain formidable tasks.

However, the advancements made so far inspire hope that the final goal is within reach. The successful operation of ITER could herald a new era in energy production, with far-reaching impacts on industries and societies worldwide. The completion of the central solenoid is a major milestone in harnessing fusion energy, symbolizing the power of human ingenuity and cooperation. As the ITER project moves forward, could this fusion breakthrough chart the course for a sustainable energy future, transforming how we power our lives and explore the cosmos?

On that note, you'll want to research what risks Capital Clean Energy Carriers is facing.
For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Capital Clean Energy Carriers (1 is a bit concerning) you should be aware of.","Capital Clean Energy Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:CCEC) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in couple of days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves a full business day. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Capital Clean Energy Carriers' shares before the 4th of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 8th of August.

The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.15 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.60 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Capital Clean Energy Carriers stock has a trailing yield of around 2.7% on the current share price of US$22.36. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Capital Clean Energy Carriers's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Capital Clean Energy Carriers has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Capital Clean Energy Carriers paid out a comfortable 33% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (61%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.

It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Capital Clean Energy Carriers, with earnings per share up 5.7% on average over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Capital Clean Energy Carriers has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.

Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Capital Clean Energy Carriers's dividend payments per share have declined at 21% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. Capital Clean Energy Carriers is a rare case where dividends have been decreasing at the same time as earnings per share have been improving. It's unusual to see, and could point to unstable conditions in the core business, or more rarely an intensified focus on reinvesting profits.

The Bottom Line

Should investors buy Capital Clean Energy Carriers for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have been growing at a steady rate, and Capital Clean Energy Carriers paid out less than half its profits and more than half its free cash flow as dividends over the last year. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Capital Clean Energy Carriers today.

On that note, you'll want to research what risks Capital Clean Energy Carriers is facing. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Capital Clean Energy Carriers (1 is a bit concerning) you should be aware of.

Pabineau First Nation Chief Terry Richardson supports the New Brunswick government's proposals, which include an expansion of nuclear power generation in the province.
Wind power prices in a recent U.S. bidding process were far higher than what Ontario customers are now charged on their residential power bills, Leslie says.
The province's existing nuclear power plant, Point Lepreau, has been plagued with costly problems since it began operating in 1983.
""We all get nuclear power bills of a size that no one is happy with because of the extremely expensive cost of owning a nuclear power plant.""","On a gravel road by the side of the Trans-Canada Highway, New Brunswick's natural resources minister, John Herron, gazes down a long clearing cut through the forest.

He sees poetry — national poetry, that is.

Herron hopes one of New Brunswick's proposed ""projects of national interest"" will connect to an existing natural gas pipeline running under that clearing.

""This is a nation-building project that checks every box,"" Herron says.

The plan is to extend a gas line that now ends in Quebec City into New Brunswick to link with the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline beneath the minister's feet.

The line carries Alberta gas routed through the United States, or gas extracted in the U.S., into Atlantic Canada.

But the Quebec extension would bypass American territory completely, creating an all-Canada route.

""The poetry kind of goes like this: You have Western Canada gas going into Ontario, through the province of Quebec, [by] adding additional pipe from Quebec City into Atlantic Canada,"" the minister says.

""That additional pipe, aspirationally speaking, would be made of Ontario steel.… This is a made-in-Canada solution. This is energy sovereignty.""

The proposal is on New Brunswick's list of projects submitted to Mark Carney's government for expedited regulatory approval under Bill C-5, which was adopted into law in June.

Carney underscored his own build-Canada agenda again on Friday, after the deadline passed for a trade agreement with the U.S. and U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on many Canadian exports.

""Canadians will be our own best customer,"" Carney said in a statement.

The Eastern Energy Partnership

The prime minister's call for proposals has stirred interest from provincial governments across the country, not least in Atlantic Canada, where premiers see a new opportunity to boost their economies and meet a growing demand for electricity.

Many of their proposals fall under the label of the Eastern Energy Partnership, which envisions the four Atlantic provinces generating more electricity and transmitting it to each other, to Quebec and to other buyers.

They range from upgrading the subsea cable between Prince Edward Island and the New Brunswick mainland — likely one of the quicker, simpler projects — to a Nova Scotia proposal to build enough offshore wind turbines to generate a quarter of Canada's electricity needs.

Winning the ""project of national interest"" designation gets proponents a faster regulatory review process but doesn't guarantee federal funding.

It's also not a sure thing that Ottawa will approve the Eastern Energy Partnership projects as a whole.

""I don't want the perfect to be the enemy of the good,"" says Nova Scotia Liberal MP Sean Fraser, the minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.

""I think we have an opportunity — and in fact an obligation — to move as quickly as possible on the components of the partnership that are ready,"" he says.

Many of the projects face obstacles.

Bill C-5 has provoked a skeptical reaction from some First Nations leaders concerned that accelerated reviews will compromise their right to be consulted.

In New Brunswick, however, some chiefs are open to making deals.

Pabineau First Nation Chief Terry Richardson supports the New Brunswick government's proposals, which include an expansion of nuclear power generation in the province.

""I'm OK with it, because we need a solution. We need a baseline source of energy and right now we don't have any,"" says Richardson.

""I mean, renewables are great, but what do you do when the wind don't blow, the sun don't shine, and the water don't flow?""

Assembly of First Nations regional chief Joanna Bernard says many bands are keeping an open mind but will insist on equity stakes in projects.

""Back in the day, it was 'Here's some scholarships,' or 'Here's capacity building so maybe your people can work on the pipeline.' Those days are gone,"" Bernard said.

""We're going to own part of the company. We're going to be there on the ground, making sure environmental issues are of the highest priority. And the profits will go to the First Nations.""

Wind and nuclear power

Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston's Wind West plan to develop thousands of offshore turbines and export the electricity to other provinces could be a boon for national efforts to decarbonize its power sources, if it came to fruition at that scale.

Scott Urquhart, the Cape Breton-born CEO of a Copenhagen-based wind energy company, says the project is doable, with the wind off Nova Scotia being ""pretty much best in the world.""

But it may take a decade or more to get turbines turning, and at a considerably higher cost than the $5 to 10 billion the premier is forecasting, according to Halifax energy consultant Heidi Leslie.

""The estimate is really low,"" she says.

Wind power prices in a recent U.S. bidding process were far higher than what Ontario customers are now charged on their residential power bills, Leslie says.

At that rate, ""you're losing money on every kilowatt"" from Wind West, she says.

""And the further away it is from the place that's using it, the more expensive it is, because you need to build the transmission to get it there.""

New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are doubling their transmission links, but ""that will certainly not be enough to handle what is required,"" says Larry Hughes, an energy expert at Dalhousie University in Halifax.

New Brunswick's ambition to expand nuclear generation is also provoking questions.

The province's existing nuclear power plant, Point Lepreau, has been plagued with costly problems since it began operating in 1983. It is responsible for a large part of the provincial power utility's $5-billion debt.

More nuclear power — whether that is a second large reactor at Point Lepreau or small modular reactors — will only add to the financial burden, says David Coon, leader of New Brunswick's Green Party.

""It's insane,"" Coon says.

""We all get nuclear power bills of a size that no one is happy with because of the extremely expensive cost of owning a nuclear power plant.""

Affordability top of mind

New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt says she gets it.

Holt won a big majority last year after campaigning on affordability issues, and she's already faced blowback from residents about their power bills.

She hopes neighbouring provinces will share the expense of more nuclear generation in exchange for some of the electricity that will be produced.

""When I'm trying to deliver affordability for New Brunswickers, I'm looking at who's shouldering the burden with us,"" she says.

""How do we reduce the cost to New Brunswick ratepayers while still pursuing our objectives of clean power and reliable power?""

In addition to nuclear power, New Brunswick's electricity is generated by a combination of fossil fuels, hydro, and to a lesser extent, wind and biomass.

Without its emissions-free nuclear reactor, the province would need to burn four times as much coal, making it even harder to lower emissions, says Brad Coady, its vice-president of business development.

Meanwhile, the province's largest hydro dam, Mactaquac, needs a major upgrade that could cost up to $9 billion.

Lori Clark, the CEO of N.B. Power, says there's an onus on the federal government to help defray the costs of decarbonizing the power supply, rather than passing costs on to customers.

""I do really believe that the federal government has a role to play in this as well. They've set the deadlines for net zero,"" Clark says.

Herron is also looking for federal support, invoking the possibility of a government ownership stake in the natural gas line extension.

""I think there's an opportunity to de-risk the project if the project is initially state-owned and First Nation-owned,"" he says.

That would speed up permitting ""and it de-risks that investment for the private sector at a future date.""

Fraser would not commit to that — but he didn't close the door either, citing the precedent of the federal government's 2018 takeover of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project in British Columbia.

""More often, the right outcome will be that we create the environment that will incentivize investment, that will allow private companies to set up to succeed and to employ people in the region,"" he adds.

""But we don't want to write off the possibility that certain kinds of investments may be required for particular projects to make them viable if we believe the long-term interests of Canadians will be served.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7552150.1749070142!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/fedelxn-liberals-20250425.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-02 12:04:52.426803

The webinar, Transitioning to EV Fleets: Best Practices & Decision Tool, is calling attendees to register now for a spot in what's sure to be an insightful dialogue on an energy-conscious future.

The terrain toward electric has its share of obstacles: driving range anxieties, the puzzle of charging infrastructure, behavior, adaptation within organizations, and cost considerations are all part of the mix. These challenges are not just theoretical—they've been gleaned from actual feedback. Two surveys, executed as part of a Minnesota Local Road Research Board project, tapped into the collective brains of various state agencies, turning up data on the human element as well as the nuts-and-bolts tech and operational issues that come with fleet electrification.

Insightful analyses pegged to the nitty-gritty, like mileage studies, the optimal sizing of fleets, and strategic charger placements will augment the presentation, equipping agencies with tangible examples of how to foster EV adoption. This webinar isn't just about the 'why' – it's about the 'how'.

Knowledge will be delivered by experts in the field: Alireza Khani, Associate Professor of Transportation Systems at University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, and Alyssa Ryan, Assistant Professor in the Dept. of Civil & Environmental Engineering at Michigan State University, are set to speak.

W.R. Grace operated the facility for 14 years, closing it in December 2024. But EPA investigators say over a five-year period starting in 2019, the company didn’t have a permit for treating, storing, and disposing of hazardous waste. The agency also said chemical solvents were improperly stored and handled.

This led the EPA to issue a civil penalty for $500,000, saying Grace violated the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, enacted in 1976.

In its Consent Agreement with W.R. Grace, the EPA detailed other offenses, including:

“During the Relevant Time Period, (W.R. Grace) stored hazardous waste in certain Totes and other containers…without visibly marking for inspection the date upon which each period of accumulation began and did not label or clearly mark each container with the words “Hazardous Waste.” During the Relevant Time Period, Respondent did not label or clearly mark each of the 8 Tanks listed…with the words “Hazardous Waste.” Respondent did not meet the permit exemption conditions for tanks and containers pursuant to OAR 340-102-0034 and 40 C.F.R. § 262.34(a)(2) and (3) during the Relevant Time Period.”

In an email to KLCC, a Grace spokesperson said the company chose to settle the matter to move forward, adding that there was no risk to human health or the environment. They said the issue didn’t involve any spills, releases, or improper disposal.

“The matter primarily involved a technical question about when certain material had to meet particular waste management requirements while it was onsite. We followed the required procedures for handling, storing, and disposing materials based on our understanding of when in the process they became subject to procedures under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.”

Grace argued the issue wasn’t about improper handling, but was about timing. The spokesperson also highlighted a settlement term in the 36-page Consent Agreement with the EPA, that they (“Respondent”) neither admit nor deny “specific factual or legal allegations” contained in the document.

Grace is based in Columbia, Maryland. It sold the facility to Lacamas Laboratories of Portland last year.

SAF is vital for cutting emissions in aviation, and this work represents a significant step in scaling up domestic SAF production.","The University of Sheffield has received significant backing from the UK government to push forward the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a major stride towards cleaner air travel.

During a visit to the university on Monday, 21 July, Aviation Minister Mike Kane MP announced that Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million initiative aimed at commercialising a new SAF production method. The project is designed to attract investment for large-scale SAF production facilities, helping to increase the availability of low-carbon fuels across the aviation sector.

The initiative, known as NextGen-SAF, brings together an international consortium of partners, including Fuel Cell Energy (US), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK). It has also garnered letters of support from key industry players such as Airbus, Boeing, Qatar Airways, and the City of Doncaster Council.

Traditional SAF production typically relies on bio-based or waste-derived feedstocks, raising questions about the long-term sustainability and scalability of supply. The University of Sheffield’s innovative approach bypasses this challenge. Instead, it uses renewable energy and advanced carbon capture technologies to create synthetic fuel.

At the core of this approach is a method known as Power to Liquid (PtL), which combines renewable electricity and atmospheric or industrial carbon dioxide to produce hydrogen. These elements are then converted into synthetic hydrocarbons, which are refined into SAF.

The process not only holds promise for reducing aviation emissions but could also offer a cost-effective and flexible solution for decarbonising other industrial operations.

NextGen-SAF plans to build the world’s first demonstration plant integrating two breakthrough technologies: a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advanced Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. The MCFC is capable of both generating hydrogen and capturing CO₂, while the AFT reactor transforms these components into synthetic fuel. The demonstration plant will test the full system’s performance, with the goal of scaling it up for commercial use.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said:

“We are proud to lead this pioneering project, made possible through crucial government funding, to develop a new route for producing sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is vital for cutting emissions in aviation, and this work represents a significant step in scaling up domestic SAF production. This project not only aligns with national sustainability goals but also strengthens the UK’s fuel production capabilities and long-term economic growth.”

The announcement comes as part of a wider £63 million funding package from the Department for Transport, supporting 17 projects across the UK aimed at boosting SAF innovation.

“This £63 million is lift-off for Britain’s green aviation revolution,” said Aviation Minister Mike Kane. “We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and cementing the UK’s place as a global leader in sustainable flight.”

The University of Sheffield is internationally recognised for its leadership in SAF research. Its Energy Innovation Centre is equipped with state-of-the-art pilot-scale testing facilities, enabling close collaboration between researchers and industry to trial clean energy technologies before they’re brought to market.

The university is also home to the UK SAF Clearing House, one of only two centres globally that support fuel producers in gaining certification for SAF to be used in commercial aviation.

Sheffield played a key role in the world’s first transatlantic flight powered entirely by SAF. Its researchers assessed the impact of the fuel on particulate emissions and contrail formation, with findings showing a reduction in emissions of up to 70%, thanks to testing conducted at the Energy Innovation Centre.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-8.png,N,,2025-08-02 15:00:29.386377

The liquified form of natural gas can help meet energy-product demand - but can the U.S. meet the challenge?

The European Union and South Korea have pledged to buy billions of dollars' worth of energy products under trade deals with the Trump administration, as the White House aims to capitalize on the role of the U.S. as the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. But are U.S. producers up to the challenge?

LNG - the liquid form of natural gas (NG00) - accounts for a sizable share of U.S. energy imports to both the E.U. and South Korea. That's why the new trade agreements ""represent a significant step-change"" for the U.S. market, said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.

In 2024, the U.S. was the largest supplier of LNG to the E.U., accounting for almost 45% of total LNG imports, according to E.U. data. The U.S. also provided 12.2% of South Korea's total LNG imports that year, according to S&P Global.

The U.S. is poised to see $750 billion in energy-product purchases from the E.U. over a three-year period, or roughly $250 billion per year, and South Korea pledged to buy $100 billion in U.S. energy products over four years, or about $25 billion worth per year.

These deals encompass all forms of U.S. energy exports, not just LNG, but LNG exports are expected to ""at least double, and potentially more than double, over time,"" Thummel said.

The E.U. and South Korea are already major buyers of U.S. LNG, and U.S. exports of the fuel have been climbing since 2016, save for a period during the pandemic when energy demand sharply dropped, U.S. Energy Information Administration data show.

The E.U. is increasingly dependent on U.S. LNG, said Ed Cox, LNG specialist and editor at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. He expects U.S. LNG to ""maintain and to grow its share in overall European supply in the absence of Russian gas over the next five years,"" but he said the idea of an annual $250 billion E.U. target for U.S. energy-product purchases is ""unrealistic.""

He said the global LNG market currently has a complete annual value of around $200 billion, including all supply, so it's ""hard to imagine"" how U.S. LNG alone could help bring that value close to the $250 billion annual target for the E.U.

Timing

The purchase commitments come at time when ""low-cost energy is essential for continued U.S. economic growth,"" said Thummel.

Read: Surging electricity demand is just one reason natural gas looks so appealing to investors this summer and beyond

""As we enter the age of electricity, electricity demand is projected to rise steadily for decades,"" he said. ""Natural gas, thanks to its reliability and scalability, will play a central role in meeting this demand.""

'As we enter the age of electricity, electricity demand is projected to rise steadily for decades. Natural gas, thanks to its reliability and scalability, will play a central role in meeting this demand.'Rob Thummel, Tortoise Capital

If U.S. LNG exports double or more, and natural gas continues to fuel electricity generation, domestic natural-gas demand could rise 30% by 2030, said Thummel. His company manages the Tortoise Energy Fund TNGY, which focuses on companies that benefit from rising U.S. energy exports as well as increasing demand for electricity,

U.S. energy production will need to ""accelerate"" to meet growing short-term demand, and U.S. shale producers have ""risen to the challenge before,"" Thummel said. He also said the U.S. operates the world's most ""extensive energy infrastructure and pipeline network.""

So ""if the world demands more U.S. energy, the foundation is already in place to meet that demand over the long term,"" he said.

In the short term, however, that challenge may not be quite as easy to overcome.

The U.S. has limited ability to increase its output of energy products, especially petroleum-based products, said Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy. And when it comes to LNG, most U.S. export facilities have standing contracts for their output already in place, which are ""key to them receiving financial support and reaching [a final investment decision] to start construction years ago.""

Most of these agreements are with Asian buyers, because European emissions rules, which had some prohibitions against using gas sourced by hydraulic fracturing, made U.S. facilities ""untenable"" for European utilities, he said.

That implies that for Europe to buy more U.S. LNG, it would either have to buy it on the secondary market, limiting the benefit to U.S. businesses, or commit to contracts for the next wave of LNG buildout, ""which is many years away, so they fall outside [that] three-year window,"" Cunningham said.

So the E.U. and South Korea commitments are a ""great gesture, but are likely not realistic to actually be met,"" he said.

Korean utilities, including Korea Gas Corp., or KOGAS, have longstanding contracts with LNG terminals such as Sabine Pass in Louisiana, so their commitment to buy more could ""manifest in them taking more deliveries of the cargoes rather than simply holding rights to the output from the terminals,"" he said. ""That does bring some firmness to export-related demands, but not much since the terminals rarely face periods where they decrease output due to a lack of demand.""

Meanwhile, he said, ""Europe can certainly strive to source more resources from the U.S., but how much will it need on a monthly or annual basis will change over time based on economic factors, weather and social shifts in consumption.""

Production limits

Questions about whether the U.S. even has the ability to meet such large demand for energy products were raised when the Trump administration announced that its trade deal with the E.U. included a $750 billion purchase of U.S. energy products by 2028.

Read: The E.U. to buy $750 billion of U.S. energy products. Why that's 'absurd.'

Cox said U.S. LNG production will double by the end of the decade, but that goes beyond President Donald Trump's period in office and is also based on projects that are already under development, with contracts in place that were signed over the past five years.

The trade deal with South Korea announced on Wednesday includes a commitment by that country to buy $100 billion of U.S. LNG and other energy products, according to a post by Trump on Truth Social. Along with that, he wrote, ""South Korea will give $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States and selected by myself, as President.""

Investment in energy infrastructure could certainly help the U.S. meet the higher demand for energy products outlined under the trade agreements.

Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities USA, suggested in a recent note that the E.U. could invest in U.S. energy infrastructure, including domestic production of oil and gas, pipelines and LNG export facilities.

""That is not a new concept, and many U.S. energy projects are already owned by multiple energy partners, including international partners,"" he said.

U.S. conglomerate Koch Industries and South Korea's National Pension Service, for example, own stakes in the Colonial Pipeline, the largest pipeline for refined petroleum products in the U.S. In April, however, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners announced it had reached a deal to acquire the asset portfolio of Colonial Enterprises, which includes the pipeline.

""There are endless possibilities for the development of U.S. energy resources, and with the sudden explosion of energy-hungry [artificial intelligence], even a building of nuclear assets is a possibility,"" Yawger said.

Read: Trump and Meta's nuclear deals address the AI-fueled energy crisis. But can U.S. uranium supply meet demand?

An E.U. buildout of U.S. energy infrastructure, in partnership with U.S. firms, may be the ""piece of the puzzle that puts the $250 [billion] per year number within reach,"" he said.

Investors looking to benefit from this onslaught of energy-product demand can consider energy-infrastructure companies that operate export facilities or facilitate exports, Thummel said. Those include Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG), Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Enbridge Inc. (ENB).

And the chief executive officer of the carbon credit company that was part of the deal says he expects continued interest from big industrial companies in voluntary credit sales involving Louisiana forests, though U.S. environmental policy is beginning to shift away from climate regulation.

TotalEnergies has inked the deal with the Arkansas-based NativState to enroll in 13 long-term forest management plans across 247,000 acres in Louisiana and three other states, officials with both companies said.

TotalEnergies says it is trying to avoid or cut greenhouse gas emissions where it can — including with permanent underground carbon storage — and offset the rest by investing $100 million annually in projects that will be able to generate at least 5 million metric tons of carbon credits per year by 2030.

The NativState deal, the value of which was not disclosed, is part of TotalEnergies' buildout of that carbon offset portfolio, which is also expected to include agriculture and wetlands protection projects, company officials said in a statement.

""We are working to build a high-quality portfolio and are paying close attention to the integrity and permanence of the emissions reductions and sequestration achieved by the activities financed in this way,"" said Gabin Poizat, a TotalEnergies spokesperson.

'Some give and take'

The company, which has the world's largest combined styrene and polystyrene manufacturing plant in Carville, says it already has 1 gigawatt of renewable energy under development to supply electricity to U.S. petrochemical sites, including in Carville, a Port Arthur, Texas, oil refinery, and plastics manufacturing in LaPorte, Texas.

NativState aggregates smaller timber properties to create economies of scale and, in long-term deals reached with landowners, sets up reduced harvesting practices to create a net savings in carbon emissions.

The deal with TotalEnergies involved more than 280 landowners in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee in a portion of the nation where there is aggressive timber harvesting, NativState officials said.

Landowners agreed to 40-year sustainable management programs with help from NativState's foresters and wildlife biologists that will reduce but not eliminate harvests.

Those carbon savings are sold as voluntary credits to companies and are verified by third-party auditing. Landowners earn credit royalties while still being able to harvest some of their timber, NativState officials said.

""So, there's some give and take there, but, in the end, in most cases, that landowner is getting as much, if not more, between the carbon credits and timber revenues on these properties,"" said Stuart Allen, founder and chief executive officer of NativState.

'Political pressures'

The TotalEnergies agreement is NativStat's fourth large credit deal. Louisiana landowners have already started earning royalty payments from earlier deals, company officials said.

The companies announced the latest deal late last month shortly before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was planning to rescind the so-called endangerment finding for greenhouse gases known to contribute to climate change.

The finding is a key underpinning for the climate regulations that have followed in the 16 years since it was reached in 2009. The proposed change is part of a wider deregulatory effort by the Trump administration to spur energy and industrial production and cut consumer prices.

Allen, the NativState CEO, said Thursday that while shifting U.S. regulations may affect interest in carbon credits from smaller, domestic companies, it's not affecting the large international companies with which he is dealing.

They have 25-year planning horizons, he said, that extend past any single administration and face different business pressures than in the United States. Corporate officials from Indonesia, Japan and other countries have visited Arkansas and Louisiana prospecting for carbon deals, he said.

""And we bring groups in and their view on carbon and climate change and the political pressures on them or corporate investor pressures are considerably different than what we've seen here in the U.S., in some cases. And so I think the majority, we're not seeing any lack of demand from global players,"" Allen said.

Leading the charge is the PM E‑DRIVE Scheme, launched in late 2024 with an outlay of ₹10,900 crore until March 2026. It serves as the successor to the FAME-II scheme, focusing on demand incentives for e-two-wheelers, three-wheelers, electric trucks, buses, and ambulances. It also supports charging infrastructure, testing facilities, and domestic EV technology development.

Complementing it is the FAME-II Scheme, still in effect, which was launched in 2019 with a budget of ₹10,000 crore. It provides direct subsidies to EV buyers and encourages local EV manufacturing through phased manufacturing programs and battery production support.

India has reduced the GST on EVs and chargers to 5%, offers income tax deductions up to ₹1.5 lakh under Section 80EEB, and rolled out vehicle scrappage incentives. Norms now mandate one public charging station every 3 × 3 km grid and every 25 km along highways. A national battery-swapping policy is also in the works.

The BHEL EV Super App, currently being developed by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, will serve as a one-stop digital platform for charger bookings, payments, and station status updates.

State Governments Join the Green Push

Several states have aligned with the national vision by introducing their EV policies:

Uttar Pradesh EV Policy 2022 aims for 10 lakh EVs and 1,000 electric buses by 2030, offering strong purchase and registration incentives.

The Jharkhand EV Policy 2022 targets a 10% EV share in new vehicle registrations by 2027, with up to 70% subsidies for solar-based charging stations.

Haryana and Uttarakhand are pushing for 100% electrification of government fleets and commercial vehicles.

West Bengal supports EVs through discounted tariffs, green zones, and battery-swapping infrastructure.

Surat’s Green Vehicle Policy 2025 aims for 50% EV adoption by 2030, with plans to deploy over 460 public charging points.

Chandigarh recently expanded its EV incentives, raising the subsidized e-car quota and launching a pilot to power EV stations with solar energy.

Charging Network Expands Rapidly

India now boasts over 25,000 public EV charging stations, with Karnataka leading at 5,765 , followed by Maharashtra with 3,728 and Uttar Pradesh with 1,989. Both public and private players support these networks under government-backed guidelines.

A Multi-Layered Strategy for EV Growth

Fiscal incentives, regulatory reforms, infrastructure support, and collaborative federalism are bolstering India’s electric vehicle ecosystem. With both national and state governments actively working together, India is well on track to become a global hub for electric mobility in the coming decade.",https://www.evmechanica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/India-Boosts-EV-Ecosystem-with-New-Policy-Initiatives.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 13:06:05.078461

The “Canary Solar Grid” project in Jackson County, just outside of Ravenswood, will help power a titanium manufacturing facility. A solar microgrid is an innovative, popular energy technology that’s giving businesses and communities access to cleaner and more reliable power. Energy generated by the solar array can be stored in a battery storage system for use during times when the sun doesn’t shine. This project is notable as one of the first where a large industrial plant is directly powered by a solar-plus-storage microgrid. It’s also supporting and strengthening domestic renewable energy initiatives and supply chains; 100% of the solar panels are sourced and manufactured in Ohio, and 100% of the steel used is made in the U.S. The project is a collaborative effort between BHE Renewables and Precision Castparts Corp.(PCC), specifically their Titanium Metals Corporation facility (TIMET). The companies are part of the Berkshire Hathaway diverse portfolio of businesses.

For 50 years, the 2,000 acre site was home to Century Aluminum. Their giant smelter was idled in 2009 and permanently closed in 2015. Since then the site has been an empty expanse along the Ohio River. Now PCC has started construction on the facility that will melt titanium while BHE Renewables is installing arrays of solar panels and large battery systems, which will form the microgrid that connects to the titanium facility. Demand for titanium products is rising in the U.S., driven largely by the aerospace and defense industries. As a metal, titanium is twice as strong as aluminum and weighs nearly half as much as steel, while still having a similar strength. It is durable, highly corrosion-resistant and used in industrial applications such as airplane wings and military armor as well as high-end consumer products like golf clubs and iPhones. Many people have titanium fused into their bodies, in the form of joint replacements, dental implants, and pacemakers. Transforming titanium minerals into a sturdy metal requires enormous amounts of electricity. The solar-plus-battery system will provide the reliable power supply the melting furnaces require at a cost that compares to traditional power sources.

The cost of building the solar microgrid system is eligible for investment tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law in August of 2022. The IRA provisions included clean energy production initiatives that addressed the crisis of global warming by helping the U.S. reach critical climate emissions goals of the Paris Agreement. BHE Renewables is constructing the microgrid in phases that match TIMET’s energy needs as it develops and operates its facility. Initially, the melting plant is expected to need around 18 megawatts of power to operate before ramping up to its full capacity by the end of 2027. The first phase began operations in May 2025 when the first solar microgrid panels were installed at the Ravenswood Business Park. Each phase contains part of the solar array and part of the battery system. PCC will have their TIMET facility use the solar energy to produce titanium products, creating the start of an industrial hub. It’s designed to serve 70% of TIMET’s expected energy demand. When fully built, the BHE Renewables project will include a 106 MW solar array and a battery energy storage system with a capacity of 50 MW, or 260.5 megawatt-hours. The project is expected to be a model for future industrial facilities seeking to utilize renewable energy.

Another company based in Michigan, ONE (Our Next Energy), will also be building a new factory on the site. ONE debuted a new utility scale battery storage system in February 2023 and will make the batteries the BHE Renewables facility will need right on site. And the company will continue to manufacture their utility scale battery storage system to market to other interested businesses. The batteries deploy lithium iron phosphate technology, a lower-cost chemistry that’s catching on for stationary storage.

This project may be the first to show that a microgrid can meet an industrial customer’s demands as well as create economic revitalization through manufacturing without polluting the environment.

With all of West Virginia’s members of Congress racing backwards towards the fossil Fool industry, my hope is more solar projects will materialize in our state’s future.

Favored oil, gas, coal and nuclear power

Cut back incentives for solar and wind

Reduced funding for clean energy research

Trump wrote that weak and intermittent energy supply puts the nation at risk. He said the grid is “precariously inadequate” and needs fast action.

Local Impact in New Mexico

In Santa Fe, crews from Positive Energy Solar work on a rooftop system at the New Mexico Finance Authority building. Technicians Francisco Visarraga and Russ Kazar ran wires from the panels to the inverter. But a sudden storm cut their day short.

Still, solar jobs matter in New Mexico: as of 2024, about 13,400 people worked in the clean energy sector. These jobs include panel installers, engineers, and maintenance crews. State leaders worry that federal cuts could slow this growth.

Key Takeaways

13,400: Clean energy jobs in New Mexico (2024)

$500 billion: Tax credits cut from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act

$800 billion: Private clean energy investments driven by 2022 law

Rising demand: More homes and data centers need extra power

State action: Local governments may fill funding gaps

Aspect Before Cuts After Cuts Clean Energy Tax Credits $500 B (2022 IRA) $0 Private Investments $800 B committed Still in progress Federal Grants High Low

Strains on the Grid in Washington

Seattle’s Denny Substation sits under tall towers built in the last 20 years. Joe Nguyen, Washington State Commerce director, says utilities plan for decades ahead. But when federal help ends, those plans can stall.

Lines and transformers age. AI data centers now use more power, leaving less backup. Hot spells push capacity to the limit. If Washington and California both bake at once, power shortages could hit.

Rising Costs for Consumers

Dawn Lindell, CEO of Seattle City Light, warns rates will climb. She says:

“Grants and tax credits cut at the federal level raise construction costs. We must pass them on to customers.”

Supply chain snags and new tariffs also drive prices up. Lindell expects rate hikes to last 10–12 years, affecting homes and businesses alike.

National Industry Perspective

On July 4, President Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act. It removed about $500 billion in clean energy tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. At the same time, the EPA moved to roll back older climate rules.

Those 2022 credits had spurred more than $800 billion in private clean energy investments. Public surveys showed strong support for renewable subsidies. Now, with federal help gone, states and companies face new challenges.

Why the Green Transition Will Survive

Nils Kupzok, a Columbia University scholar, says clean energy will keep moving forward. He notes that technology costs have dropped:

Solar panel prices down by over 70% since 2010

Battery costs fell by nearly 90% in the last decade

Businesses see long-term savings, so they keep investing. And many states offer their own tax breaks and grants. Because of this, wind and solar growth may slow, but it won’t stop.

Private Sector Resilience

In San Jose, California, Mary Powell leads Sunrun, a solar services firm in 22 states. She visits a customer who leased panels and batteries.

“It keeps my lights on during outages, and it costs less than the grid.”

This real example shows why families and businesses value clean energy. When it cuts bills and adds reliability, demand stays strong—no matter what Washington does.

Looking Ahead

What’s next? The clean energy sector must adapt. States may:

Offer local tax credits

Provide low-interest loans

Fund new grid upgrades

Meanwhile, companies will:

Build microgrids

Invest in energy storage

Sign long-term power purchase deals

Jonathan Fritz, R-Honesdale, state legislators and industry leaders Thursday for a series of facility tours and a roundtable discussion focused on positioning Pennsylvania as a national leader in the domestic production of critical minerals like lithium and rare earth elements.

The day began with site visits to two pioneering lithium extraction facilities that use produced water from the Marcellus Shale.

“The Avonlea/Kendra II facility in Springville and the Gradiant/C2G facility in Montrose showcased groundbreaking technologies that recover lithium from fracking brine — reducing environmental waste while strengthening America’s energy independence,” the news release said.

“These facilities represent the future of American energy,” said Meuser, according to the news release. “What we saw today is innovation in action — private sector ingenuity transforming waste into strategic resources. They’re proving that we don’t need to look overseas to meet our energy needs. By responsibly tapping into what’s available domestically, we can create jobs, protect the environment, and secure our national supply chain from adversaries like China.”

Following the tours, Meuser participated in a roundtable hosted by Fritz at The Community Foundation of the Endless Mountains. The discussion focused on how federal and state policymakers can work with private industry to expand critical mineral production, streamline permitting, and create rural economic opportunities.

Meuser also announced that he will soon introduce legislation to establish a production tax credit for companies extracting critical minerals — including rare earth elements from coal byproducts and lithium from fracking brine, according to the news release. These credits are aimed at unlocking overlooked domestic resources, strengthening U.S. manufacturing, and turning existing waste into valuable supply chain inputs.

“America imports nearly 90% of our critical minerals — many of them from foreign adversaries. That is unacceptable,” Meuser said. “My legislation will help reverse that dependency by turning underutilized materials like coal ash and brine water into strategic assets. It’s about pairing innovation with environmental reuse — converting industrial waste streams into sustainable inputs for clean energy, defense systems, and advanced manufacturing. … This is a win-win for Pennsylvania. We bring new opportunity to our legacy energy regions, revitalize local economies, and help the U.S. lead the next industrial revolution.

This story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Liquefied natural gas vessels are fueled by their cargo—they’re built specifically to make use of the gas boiling off from their tanks. Now Cheniere Energy, the largest US exporter of LNG, is seeking “alternative fuel” tax credits for that.

The claim has baffled shipping experts, because what Cheniere Energy is doing isn’t, in any real sense, an alternative. It would also provide little climate benefit over fueling the vessels with diesel, and seeks to use the credit in a way that tax specialists say was never intended.

Yet if approved by the IRS, the claimed tax credits could yield a payout for the company exceeding $140 million, an Inside Climate News analysis found.

In its annual report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in February, Cheniere disclosed that it is “actively pursuing” alternative fuel tax credits for its use of LNG in its shipping vessels from 2018 to 2024, the year the credit expired. The IRS is reviewing those claims, the filing said.

The alternative fuel excise tax credit was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2005. It was intended to incentivize the use of fuels other than gasoline and diesel—including biofuels, LNG, and liquid fuels derived from coal—for use in motor vehicles, and it set no requirements for the relative cleanliness of these fuels.

Cheniere noted in its financial report that LNG is a cleaner-burning fuel than diesel or heavy-fuel oils and that the use of LNG was part of an ongoing effort to mitigate emissions from the company’s shipping operations. However, critics point out that fueling LNG tankers with diesel would be absurd, given that the gas continually boiling off from the refrigerated liquid cargo would have to be burned off anyway, or re-liquefied, if it wasn’t used for propulsion.

“It makes no sense not to use the fuel that you already have because of boil-off,” said Kirsten Sinclair Rosselot, an environmental performance analyst who runs the consultancy Process Profiles and was the lead author of a 2023 study that assessed fuel use and emissions from LNG vessels. “It’s not an alternative fuel.”

Cheniere declined repeated requests for comment from Inside Climate News. The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association representing the US oil and gas industry, also declined to comment.

Cheniere’s eligibility for the tax credit may hinge on how the IRS interprets one word: motorboats. The statute states that tax credits can be claimed for the use of LNG and other alternative fuels “in a motor vehicle or motorboat.”

“It’s a very aggressive tax position,” William Henck, a former IRS tax attorney and agency whistleblower, said of Cheniere’s alternative fuel tax credit claim. “It just seems like they’re pushing the envelope here.”

The tax law doesn’t define what constitutes a motorboat. However, federal shipping regulations state it is a vessel no more than 65 feet long. LNG tankers typically extend nearly 1,000 feet. “They’re talking about a tanker,” Henck said. “Does that sound like a motorboat to you?”

If the IRS approves Cheniere’s claim, the company would be eligible for a 50 cent tax credit for each diesel gallon equivalent of fuel used. Cheniere declined to reveal the size of the tax credit it is claiming. However, according to calculations by Inside Climate News, it could exceed $140 million.

From January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2024, Cheniere used company-chartered vessels to export LNG on more than 750 departures from its terminals in Sabine Pass, Louisiana, and Corpus Christi, Texas, according to shipping data from Kpler, a global trade analytics firm. The data was analyzed by Data Desk, which conducts investigative research on the oil and gas industry, and Inside Climate News.

Adapting methods used for an earlier Inside Climate News investigation of emissions from LNG tankers, ICN calculated that those export journeys burned about 770,000 metric tons of gas in the vessels’ main engines and generators. Applying the conversion factor approved for the tax credit, that corresponds to more than 280 million diesel gallons equivalent or a credit of roughly $140 million. These calculations do not include LNG used on the subsequent return journeys by the same vessels, which are fueled from a small quantity of the cargo retained for that purpose. If Cheniere is also claiming credits for these journey legs, the payout could nearly double.

ICN also calculated the total greenhouse gas emissions using LNG fuel, compared to a hypothetical situation in which ships were powered by the 280 million diesel gallons equivalent and simply flared the LNG boiling off from their cargo. Using LNG did reduce total CO2 equivalent emissions compared to the hypothetical diesel-fueled journeys, but only by about 12.5 percent. (LNG tankers have relatively high total emissions because of the methane that slips unburned through their engines.)

Companies should only assume the effects of a tax position in their financial projections when there is a 50 percent or more likelihood that their claims will be sustained after the IRS weighs in, according to guidance by the accounting firm PwC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting standards for companies.

Cheniere stated in its SEC filing that it hasn’t included the tax credits in its projections. The company added that “we believe we qualify and are entitled to claim such credits” but acknowledged “there is ongoing uncertainty regarding the final determination of our eligibility.”

Anthony Burke, a spokesperson for the IRS, declined to comment, stating that “by law, federal employees cannot disclose tax return information.” He did not respond to follow-up questions about whether the IRS has received requests for guidance on the use of LNG in export vessels related to alternative fuel tax credits or whether the agency has provided such guidance to companies.

Lukas Shankar-Ross, deputy director of the climate and energy justice program at Friends of the Earth, said approval of the tax credit by the IRS would raise red flags. “If the IRS decides that Cheniere’s globe-spanning charter vessels the length of a city block are equivalent to 65-foot motorboats, then the independence of the IRS is obviously in question,” said Shankar-Ross, who drew Cheniere’s claim to the attention of ICN.

Fuel tax credits have long been a focus of controversy. Henck’s whistleblowing involved a situation in which the IRS began approving alternative fuel tax credits to paper mills for their use of something called black liquor.

That byproduct from pulp manufacturing has been burned as fuel in paper mills for nearly a century. Adding in a small amount of diesel—as little as a few drops—qualified the blend for alternative fuel mixture credits that resulted in the use of more diesel, rather than less, and were ultimately worth $8 billion, according to the Washington Post.

“It was aggressive enough that they got the credit in the first place,” said Henck, who at the time advised teams of IRS agents examining tax returns for larger companies. “But what went way over the line, and the reason why I spoke out, is they didn’t even have to report that stuff as taxable income.”

The IRS approved the paper mills’ tax refund amid lobbying by the paper companies. Shankar-Ross said he worries something similar may be happening now with Cheniere, whose claims may get a sympathetic hearing from the fossil-fuel friendly Trump administration.

Company CEO Jack Fusco attended a private meeting at Mar-a-Lago in April 2024, when then presidential candidate Donald Trump urged oil and gas executives to donate $1 billion to his campaign, according to reporting by the New York Times. Trump said the money would more than pay for itself in saved taxes and legal expenses, the Times reported.

Two months later, Fusco donated a total of nearly $500,000 to a Trump political action committee and the Republican National Committee, according to Federal Election Commission data. “If Cheniere is looking for a return on investment in its very generous contribution to the Trump campaign, this is certainly an excellent opportunity,” Shankar-Ross said.

Shankar-Ross said he worries that if Cheniere receives tax credits for its use of LNG, others will follow. That happened with paper mills, Henck said.

“You can rest assured that if Cheniere gets approved, anyone else in the same situation will file refund claims,” Henck said. “I guarantee you that.”

Cheniere spent just over $1.7 million lobbying Congress and the administration with its in-house team in the first half of 2025, according to federal lobbying reports. Part of that sum was spent on lobbying the Treasury Department, of which the IRS is a part, and the Executive Office of the President on “tax issues impacting businesses and the LNG industry.”

Lobbying on tax credits, Henck has found, can make all the difference.

“I hate to say this, but the actual law or common sense has nothing to do with this,” Henck said. “If they can get inside access, one-on-one meetings with the decision makers in the IRS national office, they can get this thing through.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1531248500.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-08-02 08:58:48.518567

The U.S. battery manufacturing sector stands at a critical crossroads as recent policy shifts threaten to undermine years of progress in establishing domestic production capacity. With growing competition from China and new trade barriers affecting critical materials, American battery producers are navigating an increasingly complex landscape that could determine the future of energy storage in the United States.

What's Causing the Slowdown in American Battery Production?

Recent Policy Changes Creating Industry Uncertainty

The domestic battery industry had been gaining momentum through supportive policies and incentives that helped close the competitive gap with Chinese manufacturers. However, recent policy reversals have created a climate of uncertainty that threatens this progress. Tax credit reductions, regulatory changes, and Trump's critical minerals order have collectively disrupted investment plans and production timelines across the sector.

Battery manufacturers who had made long-term commitments based on expected policy stability now find themselves reassessing their strategies amid shifting regulations. This unpredictability has particularly affected early-stage projects and companies without deep financial reserves.

The Critical Graphite Tariff Issue

Perhaps the most significant challenge facing U.S. battery manufacturers is the newly imposed 93.5% tariff on Chinese graphite imports. This decision stems from accusations that Chinese suppliers are ""dumping"" graphite—selling it at artificially low prices in foreign markets to gain market share at the expense of competitors.

The tariff presents a major obstacle for U.S. battery manufacturers because:

China currently supplies almost all refined graphite used in battery production globally

Alternative supply chains remain underdeveloped and insufficient to meet demand

The tariff could add approximately $1,000 to battery production costs per unit

Domestic graphite processing capacity is years away from meeting industry needs

U.S. manufacturers face immediate cost increases without readily available alternatives

According to industry analysts cited by the New York Times, these tariffs create a challenging situation where manufacturers must either absorb significant cost increases or pass them along to consumers, potentially slowing electric vehicle adoption and grid storage deployment.

Industry Commitments vs. Current Reality

Prior to these policy shifts, battery manufacturers had collectively pledged to invest approximately $100 billion by 2030 to build a self-sufficient domestic battery industry, according to the Clean Power Association. This commitment was made with the expectation of continued policy support and incentives.

The current environment has forced many companies to reassess these plans:

Early-stage projects are being canceled before breaking ground

Ongoing construction is being paused or scaled back

Hiring plans are being reduced or frozen

Research and development investments are being reconsidered

Supply chain development efforts are slowing

This disconnect between announced commitments and current reality creates ripple effects throughout the supply chain, affecting not just battery manufacturers but also suppliers, construction firms, and communities anticipating economic benefits.

How Severe Is the Impact on the Battery Belt?

Project Cancellations and Delays

The effects of policy shifts are becoming increasingly visible across the U.S. ""battery belt""—a region spanning multiple states where battery manufacturing facilities have been concentrated. According to ""The Big Green Machine,"" a Wellesley College-affiliated tracking project, projects are being paused or canceled at six times the rate seen in 2024.

The scope of the slowdown is substantial:

Approximately 34 major projects valued at over $31 billion are facing significant challenges

These affected projects were expected to create nearly 28,000 jobs

Larger projects are experiencing disproportionate impacts due to capital intensity

Projects that have already broken ground are being scaled back rather than abandoned completely

New project announcements have slowed dramatically in recent months

These projects include both battery cell manufacturing facilities and supporting infrastructure such as cathode materials plants, anode production facilities, and recycling operations—all critical pieces of a complete domestic supply chain.

Regional Economic Consequences

The slowdown is particularly affecting regions that had anticipated economic revitalization through battery manufacturing investments. According to Politico's analysis of affected projects, Republican-leaning districts are seeing approximately 60% of the funding decline, compared to 39% in Democratic districts—an ironic outcome given the political dynamics around trade and industrial policy.

Communities that had begun developing infrastructure, training programs, and housing to support anticipated battery industry growth now face uncertainty about whether these investments will pay off. Local economic development officials report:

Difficulty attracting ancillary businesses without anchor battery facilities

Challenges retaining talent trained for battery manufacturing roles

Uncertainty about infrastructure investments made to support planned facilities

Concerns about long-term community development strategies

The regional impact varies significantly, with some areas facing multiple project delays while others see continued progress on previously announced investments.

Investment Climate Deterioration

The combination of policy uncertainty and tariffs impact investment markets has created a challenging environment for attracting and maintaining investment in the sector:

Funding for new projects has decreased significantly as investors reassess risk profiles

Existing projects are being scaled down to conserve capital amid uncertainty

Long-term planning has become more difficult without stable policy signals

International investors are reassessing U.S. market opportunities compared to alternatives

Venture capital for battery technology startups has become more cautious

""When investors see policy changing unpredictably, they factor that risk into their decisions. For capital-intensive industries like battery manufacturing, policy stability is almost as important as the policies themselves,"" notes a financial analyst specializing in clean energy investments.

How Does This Affect U.S. Competitiveness Against China?

Widening Technology and Production Gaps

While the U.S. invented lithium-ion battery technology, China has established a commanding lead in both manufacturing capacity and technological innovation. Industry experts note this gap continues to widen under current conditions.

Bob Galyen, a retired executive who worked with both GM and Chinese battery giant CATL, offers sobering insights in an NPR interview cited by Oilprice.com: ""Unquestionably, the Chinese are ahead in manufacturing technology"" and ""Clearly, the U.S. is lagging behind."" He further notes that Chinese battery R&D ""is receiving major influxes of cash at a time when U.S. manufacturers are struggling for funding.""

This competitive gap manifests in several ways:

Chinese manufacturers continue to improve production efficiency and reduce costs

Innovation cycles are accelerating in China while slowing in the U.S.

Scale advantages allow Chinese producers to amortize R&D costs more effectively

Talent increasingly flows toward markets with greater investment certainty

Technology transfer between U.S. research institutions and manufacturers faces obstacles

Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

The U.S. battery industry remains highly dependent on international supply chains, particularly for critical minerals and components. Recent policy changes have complicated efforts to establish more resilient domestic supply networks:

Critical material processing remains concentrated overseas, primarily in China

Alternative suppliers face significant cost disadvantages without economies of scale

Domestic mining and processing projects face delays due to regulatory and financial challenges

Supply chain diversification efforts are being hampered by inconsistent policy signals

International partnerships for material sourcing face new complications

These vulnerabilities create both economic and national security concerns, as battery technology underpins everything from defense applications to grid stability and transportation electrification.

Innovation Challenges

The uncertain policy environment is affecting not only manufacturing but also research and development activities:

Reduced investment in next-generation battery technologies such as solid-state batteries

Talent recruitment and retention difficulties as researchers seek more stable environments

Decreased collaboration between industry and research institutions due to funding constraints

Slower commercialization of new battery innovations as pilot projects face delays

Risk aversion favoring incremental improvements over breakthrough technologies

This innovation slowdown could have long-lasting consequences as the battery technology landscape continues to evolve rapidly globally.

What Are the Broader Economic Implications?

Impact on Clean Energy Transition

The battery manufacturing slowdown has implications beyond the immediate industry, potentially affecting the broader clean energy transition:

Grid storage projects may face delays or cost increases, affecting renewable energy integration

Electric vehicle manufacturers may experience supply constraints or higher component costs

Energy storage costs could rise, affecting the economics of renewable energy projects

Clean energy job creation projections may need downward revision

Deployment timelines for critical infrastructure modernization could be extended

This timing is particularly challenging as utilities and grid operators increasingly rely on battery storage to manage intermittent renewable energy sources and improve grid resilience.

Global Market Position

The U.S. position in the global battery market is being reassessed in light of recent developments:

Market share projections are being adjusted downward for U.S. manufacturing

International partnerships are being reconsidered as global companies evaluate options

Export potential is diminishing as domestic costs rise relative to international competitors

Competitive advantage in certain battery technologies is eroding without sustained investment

Strategic positioning in future technology standards may be compromised

These shifts could have long-term implications for American industrial competitiveness in a critical technology sector that underlies multiple industries.

Consumer Cost Considerations

The combination of tariffs, reduced incentives, and supply chain disruptions is likely to affect consumer-facing products:

Electric vehicle prices may increase or price reductions may slow

Home energy storage systems could become more expensive, affecting residential solar economics

Grid-scale storage projects may face higher costs, potentially increasing electricity rates

Price competitiveness with conventional alternatives could deteriorate

Total cost of ownership advantages may be diminished temporarily

While long-term cost trajectories still favor battery technologies, the current disruptions could slow adoption rates and create economic inefficiencies during the transition.

How Are Battery Manufacturers Responding?

Strategic Adjustments

Companies in the battery sector are implementing various strategies to navigate the changing landscape:

Diversifying material sourcing where possible, including exploring non-Chinese suppliers

Exploring alternative battery chemistries that reduce dependence on affected materials

Focusing on high-margin applications where cost pressures can be more easily absorbed

Emphasizing technological differentiation rather than cost competition

Vertically integrating to gain more control over supply chain components

These adjustments often involve trade-offs between short-term financial performance and long-term strategic positioning.

Advocacy Efforts

The industry is actively engaging with policymakers to highlight the economic and strategic importance of domestic battery production:

Emphasizing national security implications of battery supply chain dependence

Highlighting job creation potential across manufacturing, R&D, and deployment

Stressing the role of batteries in energy independence and grid resilience

Advocating for policy consistency and predictability to support investment

Building coalitions with related industries affected by similar challenges

These efforts aim to create broader awareness of how battery manufacturing fits into larger economic and security considerations.

Technology Pivots

Some manufacturers are accelerating work on alternative battery technologies that might be less affected by current trade barriers:

Sodium-ion batteries as graphite alternatives, which use more abundant and less restricted materials

Solid-state battery development to reduce reliance on traditional materials and increase energy density

Silicon-based anode technologies to reduce graphite requirements

Alternative cathode chemistries with reduced dependency on supply-constrained materials

Manufacturing process innovations to improve efficiency and reduce material requirements

These technological pivots represent both challenges and opportunities, potentially accelerating innovations that might otherwise have developed more gradually.

What Could Support Industry Recovery?

Policy Consistency and Clarity

The battery industry would benefit from greater policy stability and clear long-term signals:

Consistent incentive structures that manufacturers can rely on for investment planning

Predictable regulatory frameworks that reduce compliance uncertainty

Coordinated trade and industrial policies that acknowledge supply chain realities

Long-term strategic planning for critical materials including transition periods for new regulations

Clear pathways for domestic content requirements that reflect current capabilities

While specific policies may vary with administrations, establishing some core principles with bipartisan support could provide the stability needed for long-term investments.

Supply Chain Development

Accelerated development of domestic supply chains could reduce vulnerability to international trade disruptions:

Increased investment in domestic mining and processing with streamlined permitting

Development of recycling infrastructure to create circular material flows

Strategic stockpiling of critical materials to buffer short-term supply disruptions

International partnerships with allied nations to diversify supply sources

Public-private partnerships to address capital-intensive processing infrastructure

These developments require both policy support and private sector investment, with recognition that full supply chain development is a multi-year process.

Market-Driven Innovation

Despite policy challenges, market forces continue to drive demand for battery technologies:

Growing renewable energy deployment requires storage solutions for grid stability

Consumer interest in electric vehicles remains strong despite short-term price pressures

Grid resilience concerns support storage investments from utilities and power providers

Corporate sustainability commitments drive industrial demand for clean energy solutions

Technology cost curves continue to improve despite short-term disruptions

These market fundamentals suggest the long-term trajectory remains positive even as short-term challenges affect project timelines and investments.

FAQ: U.S. Battery Industry Challenges

How significant is the Chinese advantage in battery production?

China currently dominates global battery production, controlling approximately 75% of battery cell manufacturing capacity and processing the vast majority of critical minerals needed for batteries. The technological gap has widened in recent years, with Chinese companies now leading in many advanced battery technologies. As Bob Galyen noted, China maintains clear advantages in manufacturing technology and R&D funding that will take years of focused investment for the U.S. to overcome.

Could alternative materials replace Chinese graphite?

While synthetic graphite production and alternative anode materials are being developed, scaling these alternatives requires significant time and investment. Current alternatives generally offer lower performance, higher costs, or both compared to established graphite anodes from China. Companies pursuing alternatives face both technical challenges and economic hurdles without established supply chains. Some promising alternatives include silicon-based anodes, which could reduce graphite requirements but face their own manufacturing challenges.

How many jobs are at risk in the battery sector?

The battery industry and its supply chain were projected to create over 100,000 jobs by 2030. Current disruptions put a significant portion of these jobs at risk, with approximately 28,000 jobs from major projects already facing uncertainty according to Politico's analysis. These jobs span manufacturing, engineering, construction, and support services—many offering higher wages than regional averages. The geographic distribution of these jobs makes the impact particularly significant in certain communities counting on battery investments for economic development.

Are any regions particularly vulnerable to these changes?

The so-called ""battery belt""—spanning states including Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, and Ohio—is experiencing the most significant impacts. Many communities in these states had based economic development plans on battery-related investments. The impact extends beyond direct manufacturing jobs to affect construction, logistics, and service industries that support these facilities. Some communities have already invested in infrastructure improvements, workforce training programs, and housing development in anticipation of battery industry growth.

What would it take to establish a fully independent U.S. battery supply chain?

Creating a completely self-sufficient battery supply chain would require coordinated investments across mining, processing, component manufacturing, and recycling. Industry estimates suggest this would require sustained investment of over $200 billion and at least 5-7 years of focused development. Key challenges include establishing domestic processing capacity for critical minerals, developing technical expertise in advanced manufacturing techniques, and achieving competitive scale. A transitional approach might involve strategic partnerships with allied nations while domestic capabilities develop.

The Path Forward for American Battery Production

Despite current challenges, the fundamental drivers behind battery industry growth remain strong. Energy storage represents a critical technology for addressing climate change, improving grid resilience, and enabling the next generation of electric transportation. The question is not whether battery production will grow globally, but whether the United States will maintain a competitive position in this strategic industry.

The coming months will be critical as manufacturers, investors, and policymakers navigate the current uncertainty. Those companies able to weather the current disruptions while continuing to invest strategically may emerge in stronger competitive positions as the market inevitably expands. For the broader economy, the stakes extend beyond any single industry to affect America's position in the clean energy transition and advanced manufacturing landscape.

Furthermore, innovations in battery recycling breakthrough technologies and the development of new battery-grade lithium refinery facilities could help address some of the supply chain challenges, while investment in critical raw materials facility development remains crucial for long-term industry resilience.

While the revocation of climate-focused policies and the rollback of EV mandates have introduced short-term volatility, the underlying momentum of the clean energy transition remains unshaken. For investors, the interplay of industrial policy, technological advancement, and market-based climate solutions is creating a compelling case for renewable infrastructure and technology firms—particularly those positioned to meet the surging demand from cleantech and data center industries.

Industrial Policy: Deregulation Meets Resilience

The 2025 executive order, which rescinds prior climate directives, signals a shift toward deregulation and traditional energy expansion. However, this does not negate the foundational role of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in shaping a robust clean energy supply chain. Since 2022, quarterly clean manufacturing investment has tripled to $14 billion, with the IRA's Section 45X tax credits underpinning growth in battery cells, solar modules, and wind turbines.

Despite the policy uncertainty, domestic battery and solar manufacturing capacity now exceeds current deployment levels and is projected to align with demand through 2035. ZEV production capacity could reach 6.84 million units annually by 2035, a figure matching 60-67% of projected sales. Yet, wind manufacturing lags, underscoring the need for targeted investment in underperforming sectors.

The IRA's tax credits and green banks have insulated the sector from immediate policy shocks, but rising tariffs and project cancellations—$9 billion in Q1 2025 alone—highlight the fragility of this growth. Investors must balance the risks of a shifting regulatory environment with the long-term tailwinds of decarbonization.

AI-Driven Innovation: Accelerating Efficiency and Deployment

AI is the unsung hero of the 2025 energy transition. From optimizing supply chains to enabling next-generation technologies, artificial intelligence is reshaping how renewable infrastructure is designed, deployed, and operated.

For example, AI-powered robots are now installing large solar farms in desert regions, powering data centers with minimal human intervention. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's PolicyAI project has streamlined permitting by digitizing environmental impact studies, reducing project timelines by 30%. Meanwhile, AI-driven predictive maintenance tools are cutting downtime in battery storage and wind turbine operations, enhancing return on investment.

On the demand side, AI is enabling virtual power plants that integrate distributed energy resources, smart grids, and real-time load management. These systems are critical for meeting the surging energy needs of data centers, which now account for 3% of U.S. electricity consumption. Companies leveraging AI to optimize energy use—such as those deploying smart meters and advanced analytics—stand to dominate this market.

Carbon Monetization: From Offsets to High-Integrity CDR

The U.S. carbon market is evolving rapidly, with 84% of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits now tied to renewable-powered technologies like direct air capture (DAC) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). The DOE's DAC Hubs program, funded by the IRA, is a case in point, but these facilities face a critical bottleneck: competing with data centers for clean energy.

The shift from voluntary carbon offsets to high-integrity CDR credits is creating a new asset class for investors. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, part of the IRA, has allocated billions to sub-federal initiatives, including the Solar for All program and Climate Pollution Reduction Grants. These programs are projected to deploy 36 GW of renewables and storage by 2030, further solidifying the link between carbon monetization and clean energy infrastructure.

Investment Opportunities: Where to Focus in 2025

The intersection of industrial policy, AI, and carbon monetization points to three high-conviction investment themes:

Battery and Solar Manufacturing: Firms with IRA-backed tax credits and vertical integration capabilities (e.g., companies producing both cells and modules) are well-positioned to outperform.

AI-Enabled Infrastructure: Startups and established players deploying AI for predictive maintenance, grid optimization, and deployment automation will benefit from surging demand in data centers and smart cities.

Carbon Management Technologies: Companies developing DAC, BECCS, and high-integrity CDR platforms are set to capitalize on the $50 billion global CDR market, which is expected to grow 20% annually through 2035.

Navigating the Risks

While the long-term outlook is bullish, investors must remain vigilant. Policy uncertainty and project cancellations could disrupt near-term growth. However, the underlying trends—rising energy demand, AI-driven efficiency gains, and the commodification of carbon—remain intact. Diversifying across sectors and geographies, while prioritizing firms with IRA tax credit eligibility and AI-driven operational models, will mitigate these risks.

In conclusion, the U.S. energy transition in 2025 is no longer a binary choice between fossil fuels and renewables. It is a dynamic ecosystem where industrial policy, technological innovation, and market-based solutions are converging to redefine the rules of the game.

But one energy expert revealed the sweet spot for cooling efficiency isn’t as chilly as most people believe.
Gilgan explained each degree you raise the thermostat saves about three per cent on your monthly energy bill during peak summer.
“These tips work together with the right temperature setting,” Gilgan pointed out.
“You're not just changing a single thing, but creating a system that keeps you comfortable while your AC runs efficiently.”","AS summer heatwaves grip the nation, millions of Americans are cranking up the AC to stay comfortable – and watching their electricity bills soar.

But one energy expert revealed the sweet spot for cooling efficiency isn’t as chilly as most people believe.

Corey Gilgan, owner at Oregon Generators, said: “Most people think they need to set their AC to 68 or 70 degrees to stay comfortable, but that's actually costing them hundreds of dollars unnecessarily.”

The magic number, according to Gilgan, is 78°F (25.5°C) when you’re home during the day.

“Setting your thermostat at 78°F instead of lowering it to 72°F can cut your cooling costs by up to 10 per cent,” he explained.

“Your AC works exponentially harder the lower the temperature you set it to.

”Every degree below 78°F forces your system to remove more heat from your home, which requires significantly more energy.”

Think you’ll toss and turn if it’s warmer at night?

Not so, said Gilgan. He advised raising the temperature to 82°F while you sleep.

“Most people sleep better in slightly warmer temperatures anyway,” he notes.

“Your body temperature drops naturally at night, so that 82-degree setting feels perfectly comfortable under a light sheet or blanket.”

Every degree matters. Gilgan explained each degree you raise the thermostat saves about three per cent on your monthly energy bill during peak summer.

“People don't realize how much that one-degree change impacts their monthly bill,” he said.

“We're talking about real money here, sometimes as much as $30 to $50 per month for the average household.”

Stay cool without cranking the AC

To stay cool without blasting the AC, Gilgan recommended using ceiling fans strategically.

Run them counterclockwise in summer, he said, because the wind-chill effect makes it feel three to four degrees cooler than the actual temperature.

Another simple trick is to close blinds during peak sun hours.

Keeping them shut on south and west-facing windows between 10am and 4pm can slash indoor temperatures by up to 15 degrees in the hottest parts of the day.

He also advised timing your cooking wisely.

Avoid firing up the oven or stovetop during the afternoon heat and instead cook early in the morning, later in the evening, or take it outside to the grill to prevent adding extra heat indoors.

Finally, Gilgan urged homeowners to seal air leaks around windows and doors.

Even small gaps can let cool air escape and force your AC to work harder, but inexpensive fixes like weather stripping and caulking deliver immediate results.

“These tips work together with the right temperature setting,” Gilgan pointed out.

“You're not just changing a single thing, but creating a system that keeps you comfortable while your AC runs efficiently.”",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/08/newspress-collage-788sk79s7-1754084252173.jpg?1754069902&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-08-02 17:03:03.847977

Cox, an 11-year-old water and renewable energy company with a market capitalization of around US $958 million, will buy Iberdrola’s 15 power plants.
In a statement, Cox said it will invest more than US $10.7 billion in Mexico between 2025 and 2030.
Cox referred to Mexico as the second most-important electricity market in Latin America (only Brazil has a larger consumer market).
At the time of that announcement, the assets for sale were valued at US $4.7 billion.","Madrid-based Cox Energy has agreed to acquire Iberdrola México in a deal valued at US $4.2 billion including debt, the two companies announced on Friday.

President Claudia Sheinbaum called the acquisition “a sign of certainty in our country, of confidence and of a desire to keep investing,” at her Friday morning press conference.

“I have spoken to Cox management and they are very committed to investing in Mexico and to the development of various projects,” Sheinbaum said.

Cox, an 11-year-old water and renewable energy company with a market capitalization of around US $958 million, will buy Iberdrola’s 15 power plants. The news agency Reuters said 75% of the deal will be funded with debt and the remainder with equity.

Reuters said closing is expected by the first quarter of 2026. Approval is virtually assured since shareholders representing 84% of the company’s capital have already expressed support for the acquisition.

In a statement, Cox said it will invest more than US $10.7 billion in Mexico between 2025 and 2030.

The company defined the deal as a landmark acquisition, adding that it “aims to leverage [our] established presence and in-depth knowledge of the Mexican market, reinforcing its position in high-growth strategic markets.”

The company said it sees Mexico as a strategic market “thanks to its strong legal certainty” under the new energy regulatory guidelines in the government’s Plan México.

Cox referred to Mexico as the second most-important electricity market in Latin America (only Brazil has a larger consumer market). It highlighted the country’s “solid macroeconomic fundamentals and an investment-grade economy underpinned by a responsible fiscal policy.” It also lauded Mexico’s banking system as “sound and stable.”

The acquisition of Iberdrola’s platform offers vast potential for increased penetration and growth in Mexico’s power sector, Cox believes, especially due to “a rising demand for energy” that is driving investment.

The company’s five-year investment target not only includes the Iberdrola acquisition, but also “more than US $4 billion in new energy assets, up to US $1.5 billion in water concession assets and the development of a hub focused on Mexican welfare.”

Cox said it also hopes to co-invest in new energy projects alongside Mexico’s Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), the state-owned electric utility.

The company says the deal creates “significant synergies within its strategy to make Mexico one of its key business hubs in Latin America by integrating water and energy solutions.”

Iberdrola, a Spanish multinational electric utility which has operated in Mexico since 1999, announced its intention to sell its remaining Mexico assets last week, hiring Barclay’s Investment Bank to manage the sale. At the time of that announcement, the assets for sale were valued at US $4.7 billion.

The 15 power plants being sold — six wind parks, three solar parks and six gas and cogeneration plants — have a combined 2.6 gigawatts (GW) of capacity..

The acquisition also includes a pipeline of 11.8 GW of various renewable energy sources. Cox says 1.4 GW of the renewable energy projects in the pipeline are at an advanced stage of development and may start commercial operations in 2027-28.

Iberdrola began divesting its assets in Mexico, including a US $6 billion sale to the government in 2023, as it became a frequent target of then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s attacks.

The Cox sale will complete Iberdrola’s exit from the country.",https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 14:03:27.744412

PG&E’s stock has fallen considerably since January because of the concern that the wildfire fund will be depleted.
The current proposal involves channeling an additional $18 billion to the state’s fund.","California lawmakers are crafting legislation to replenish the state’s wildfire fund as Southern California Edison’s liabilities stemming from the Eaton Fire threaten to wipe it out.

This pool of money was created in 2019 after PG&E filed for bankruptcy as it faced billions of dollars in liabilities from two years of devastating Northern California wildfires ignited by its equipment.

The wildfire fund is meant to help utilities avoid bankruptcy in the future by giving them something to draw on when they’re sued because their electrical equipment started a wildfire.

Last week, SoCal Edison announced it was creating a claims fund to have a pot of money to pay people impacted by the Eaton fire. While CalFire hasn’t officially ruled on the cause of the fire, the announcement is a reasonable signal that the utility thinks it started the fire.

Without the state’s wildfire fund, Edison would probably need to declare bankruptcy. Once it’s gone, other utilities that are parties to the fund — San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric — will have no cushion if their equipment starts a bad fire.

“The utilities have been calling loudly for some sort of a fix, PG&E in particular,” said Michael Wara, an energy expert who is familiar with the discussions.

PG&E’s stock has fallen considerably since January because of the concern that the wildfire fund will be depleted.

Gov. Gavin Newsom would also like to see a fix, said Wara, although he did not address it Thursday during public comments about California’s firefighting capabilities.

“It’s bad for California when utilities go bankrupt,” Wara said, who directs the Climate and Energy Policy Program and is a senior research scholar at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University.

The current proposal involves channeling an additional $18 billion to the state’s fund. Half of that is to come from the utility companies. Half coming from ratepayers. Currently, utility customers see a fee on their monthly bill, which is called “non-bypassable charges,” that are set to end in 2035. For the average California ratepayer, this is $2.50 per month. The proposed legislation would extend these charges to 2045.

The utilities — despite needing the funds to be fixed — do not like the proposal that their shareholders pay half of the contributions and would prefer ratepayers to contribute the entire amount, according to reporting in Bloomberg.

“This is a negotiation and they are negotiating,” Wara said, noting that back in 2019, utilities said they could not pay so much money into the fund but found a way to do it. “Otherwise, their shareholders would be in an untenable situation.”

A second, and possibly more significant aspect of the agreement being hammered out is that it places limits on how much money insurance companies can recover against fire-sparking utilities. Currently, those settlements are a negotiation, generally 50 to 70 cents on the dollar. This agreement would cap that at 40 cents on the dollar. So, if State Farm paid out $1 million to a policyholder for a loss on a utility-caused fire, they could recoup a maximum of $400,000 from that utility.

That will mean that the cost of recovering from wildfires will shift slightly from electric-utility ratepayers, who live everywhere in the state, to insurance policyholders, who pay more in areas with high fire risk.

The legislation being crafted also proposes studying how to best manage wildfire costs.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f85512a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1999x1049+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F86%2F02c3f1684748a5625aa7fee82292%2F240109-cawindstorm-069-qed.jpeg,N,,2025-08-02 14:03:37.202321

The Trump administration is advancing major rollbacks of climate change regulations, including plans to revoke the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health, a CNN article revealed. This move would eliminate the legal foundation for many climate-related regulations under the Clean Air Act.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the action as the “largest deregulatory action in U.S. history.” The administration has also signed orders to boost the coal industry and end pollution limits on coal- and gas-fired power plants. Tax credits for electric vehicles are set to expire next month, and federal incentives for renewable energy projects have been curtailed, potentially increasing electricity costs.

Legislation has stripped California of its authority to ban new gas-powered vehicles by 2035, and national tailpipe emission standards are expected to be overturned. A congressionally mandated climate report authored by five climate skeptics supports these policy changes, though it has drawn criticism for disregarding scientific consensus.

The paper was written by a working group including John Christy and Judith Curry, who both have past links to The Heartland Institute, an advocacy group that frequently pushes back against the scientific consensus on climate change, which AFP has investigated.

It ""completely misrepresents my work,"" Benjamin Santer, atmospheric scientist and honorary professor in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia in Britain (archived here), told AFP on July 31.

Santer said a section of the report on ""stratospheric cooling"" contradicted his findings while citing his research on climate ""fingerprinting,"" a scientific method that seeks to separate human and natural climate change, as evidence for its analysis.

Similarly, climate scientist Zeke Hausfather (archived here) said some of his findings were discarded entirely ""as not fitting their narrative.""

His work is cited throughout the paper and on July 31 he told AFP the references to models historically overestimating future CO2 concentrations (Hausfather et al., 2019) and to a scenario representing high greenhouse gas emissions throughout the 21st century (Hausfather and Peters 2020) are ""not too badly misrepresented."" But he said they ""neglected to mention how the paper on models also showed how accurate historical climate models have been"" (archived here and here).

Planetary scientist and astrobiologist Joshua Krissansen-Totton said on July 31 his research (archived here) on climate and ocean pH of the early Earth -- meaning billions of years ago -- was cited to draw misleading parallels to modern ocean acidification.

AFP and other media, including NOTUS (archived here), a US digital news website affiliated with the nonprofit Allbritton Journalism Institute, found inaccurate citations, flawed analysis and editorial errors across the document.

This is the third time since January, when Donald Trump took office, that scientists have told AFP a government agency has misrepresented academic work to defend their policies.

Previous instances included made up citations in the government's ""Make America Healthy Again"" report, which the administration then rushed to edit.

""I am concerned that a government agency has published a report, which is intended to inform the public and guide policy, without undergoing a rigorous peer‑review process, while misinterpreting many studies that have been peer‑reviewed,"" Bor-Ting Jong, an assistant professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands, told AFP on July 31 (archived here).

Jong said the paper made false statements about the climate model her team examined and used different terminology that led to a flawed analysis of her findings.

Call for a coordinated response

On Bluesky, the budding social media platform favored by academics, other researchers in atmospheric and extreme weather fields also deplored that the DoE document cherry-picked data and omitted or plainly distorted their academic findings (archived here).

Climate scientist Andrew Dessler (archived here) on July 31 initiated (archived here) a call for a coordinated response from academics specialized in areas mentioned in the report.

James Rae (archived here), a climate researcher at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, who said his work is also misrepresented in the report, told AFP on July 31 the shift in how the department uses scientific research ""is really chilling.""

""DoE was at the forefront of science for decades. Whereas this report reads like an undergraduate exercise in misrepresenting climate science,"" he said.

The new gas tax increased the price by 6 cents per gallon, bringing the state’s per-gallon tax rate from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents. To adjust for inflation, per-gallon gas prices will rise 2% every year.

The diesel tax went up 3 cents per gallon at the beginning of July. Diesel will increase by 3 cents more in two years; then in 2028, it will increase by 2% a gallon each year. Factoring in future increases and inflationary adjustments translates into a 9-cent climb from 49.4 cents per gallon to 58.4 cents per gallon.

State lawmakers faced a projected $1 billion shortfall in the two-year transportation budget and an $8 billion gap over the next six years. The deficit was largely attributed to rising construction costs and a decline in gas tax revenue due to increased fuel efficiency and the rise of electric vehicles.

The gas tax increase, along with other revenue measures, is expected to generate approximately $3.2 billion over the next six years, with the gas tax specifically bringing in $1.4 billion over that period.

Also impacting the price at the pump in Washington is the state’s cap-and-trade program, established by the Climate Commitment Act in January 2023 and run by the Washington State Department of Ecology.

WASHINGTON – On Wednesday, July 30, 2025, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin traveled to Boston, Massachusetts, to speak at the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and visit EPA Region 1 Headquarters, their Regional Lab in Chelmsford, Wells G&H Superfund Site, King’s Beach in Swampscott, and Boston Dynamics.

Administrator Zeldin’s first stop was to the NARUC Conference where he participated in a fireside chat with NARUC President and Georgia Public Service Commission Chairman Tricia Pridemore about EPA’s proposal to rescind the Endangerment Finding, cooperative federalism, and unleashing American energy dominance to drive down consumer prices, increase grid reliability, and power data centers that will help America become the AI capital of the world.

Afterward, Administrator Zeldin visited the EPA Regional office in Boston where he spoke with senior staff, took questions, and delivered remarks about his vision for the agency, advancing its statutory obligations, and Powering the Great American Comeback.

Administrator Zeldin then visited the Region 1 Lab in Chelmsford. He met with EPA scientists and observed the process developed by EPA to detect PFAS in drinking water.

Administrator Zeldin continued on to the Industriplex Superfund Site in Woburn, a former manufacturing facility in Woburn, Massachusetts. The Industriplex site exemplifies how EPA, working with local, state and private partners, can utilize the Superfund process to bring a contaminated site into productive reuse. The site has been transformed into a transportation center that includes surrounding commercial and residential properties, with more opportunities for redevelopment on the horizon.

Toyota's strategic depth—rooted in operational discipline, localized production, and hybrid dominance—suggests it is uniquely positioned to outperform in a volatile industry.","In 2025, the global automotive landscape is defined by two seismic forces: the uneven transition to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and the geopolitical turbulence reshaping trade dynamics. Amid this volatility, Toyota has emerged as an outlier—not by betting on disruption, but by doubling down on its hybrid expertise. With hybrid vehicles accounting for nearly half of its global sales and 46.8% of U.S. sales in June 2025, the automaker has turned its decades-old technology into a strategic moat. This is not a temporary advantage but a calculated hedge against the fragility of the EV market and the unpredictability of trade policy.

The Hybrid Resilience Play

Toyota's hybrid dominance is rooted in a simple yet powerful economic reality: hybrids generate twice the profit per unit compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. In 2024, hybrid models contributed 40% of the company's U.S. profits, creating a cash buffer critical for funding R&D in hydrogen and solid-state battery technologies. This financial flexibility contrasts sharply with the cash-burning models of EV-first automakers like Tesla and Rivian, whose stock valuations have become increasingly decoupled from fundamentals.

The company's production agility further amplifies its advantage. While rivals like Nissan and Honda struggle with supply chain bottlenecks and price hikes, Toyota has localized 80% of its U.S. production under the USMCA agreement. This not only reduces exposure to tariffs but also allows the company to absorb the 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese imports with minimal price increases (0.7% of average unit price, versus double-digit hikes for competitors).

Navigating Trade Policy Uncertainty

The U.S.-Japan tariff agreement of 2025, which reduced automotive import tariffs from 25% to 15%, was a mixed blessing for automakers. While it eased some pressure, it also highlighted the fragility of global supply chains. Toyota's response? A $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina, paired with a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) that prioritizes regional self-sufficiency. This strategy ensures operations can continue even during trade wars or natural disasters—a stark contrast to the just-in-time supply chains that left rivals like Ford and GM vulnerable in 2023.

In India and China, Toyota is diversifying further. A 32,000-unit annual production boost in India and a 100,000-unit expansion plan demonstrate its commitment to in-country manufacturing. In China, where BEV competition from BYD is fierce, hybrid sales grew 27% in 2024, outpacing the automaker's overall sales decline.

The EV Dilemma: Prudence Over Panic

While Toyota is investing in EVs, it has avoided the overcommitment that has destabilized competitors. Its $6.8 billion U.S. electrification investment is concentrated on high-margin battery production, aligning with the Inflation Reduction Act's incentives. Meanwhile, the company has delayed its Fukuoka battery plant, signaling a wait-and-watch approach to an EV market still grappling with soft demand and supply chain instability.

This measured strategy is paying off. Toyota's 10% operating margin—double that of Honda and Nissan—provides a buffer to withstand EV market corrections. Its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3x (versus 0.8x for Nissan) ensures flexibility for R&D and capital expenditures, even as Chinese EVs like the BYD Han and Tesla Model 3 flood global markets.

Investment Implications

For investors, Toyota represents a rare combination of defensive resilience and offensive innovation. The company's hybrid leadership is not a relic but a forward-looking strategy that positions it to dominate markets where EV adoption remains constrained—particularly in regions with inadequate charging infrastructure or regulatory uncertainty.

Key metrics to watch:

- Hybrid sales growth in the U.S. (currently 22% of light-duty vehicle sales in Q1 2025).

- Delivery lead times in key markets, which have improved modestly but remain a near-term challenge.

- Solid-state battery commercialization timelines (2027–2028) and their impact on production costs.

Toyota's strategic depth—rooted in operational discipline, localized production, and hybrid dominance—suggests it is uniquely positioned to outperform in a volatile industry. While EVs will eventually redefine transportation, the transition is proving far messier and slower than anticipated. For now, Toyota's hybrids are not just a bridge to the future—they are a fortress against the uncertainties of today.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 08:58:27.107751

BMW is investing over a billion euros by 2030 to expand e-drive development and production at Steyr. This investment ensures that Steyr remains a key location for drivetrain expertise within the BMW Group. The plant has been producing internal combustion engines for over 40 years and will continue to do so alongside electric motors.

The Gen6 electric motor represents a fully-electric drivetrain produced at Steyr. It will be distributed across the production network, powering the Neue Klasse models. The plant's extensive experience makes it ideal for manufacturing these advanced motors while maintaining flexibility in engine production.

Core components like rotors, stators, transmissions, and power converters will be manufactured at Plant Steyr. The aluminum housings will be cast at Plant Landshut and processed further in Steyr. This marks an entry into electrical engineering for the Austrian facility.

The Gen6 e-drive follows a modular system approach, allowing flexible production of various drivetrain derivatives for Neue Klasse models. This modularity results in cost savings and improved scalability of production volumes while keeping supply networks adaptable.

Technological Enhancements

The Gen6 electric motor has undergone comprehensive improvements. Its rotor, stator, and power converter are designed for an 800-volt architecture to enhance performance and efficiency. Geometry and cooling enhancements optimize the two-stage spur gearbox while refining acoustics for better customer experience.

The power converter uses silicon carbide technology to boost efficiency by converting DC from high-voltage batteries into AC for the motor. These advancements lead to reduced weight, costs, and energy loss, significantly increasing vehicle efficiency by about 20% compared to previous models.

BMW's U.S. Presence

BMW of North America was established 50 years ago to support sales and distribution in the U.S. Over time, it expanded with facilities like BMW Manufacturing Co., LLC in South Carolina and MINI USA. Today, BMW operates nearly 30 locations across 12 states with a strong corporate presence.

Plant Spartanburg is BMW's largest single production facility globally and specializes in Sports Activity Vehicles like the X3 and X5. It assembles over 1,500 vehicles daily and contributes significantly to the U.S. economy by supporting over 120,000 jobs nationwide.

The efficient design of new powertrains combined with high-energy batteries enables ranges up to 800 km (WLTP) in models like the BMW iX3 from Neue Klasse. Martin Kaufmann from BMW AG highlighted that energy loss is reduced by 40%, costs by 20%, and weight by 10% compared to previous models.",https://images.drivespark.com/img/2025/08/bmw-group-1754075922041-1200x675_temp.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 14:04:34.664413

Since then, the EU has significantly ramped up LNG imports, especially from the US, while accelerating investments in renewables and energy efficiency.
Increased purchases from the US helped drive this shift, with the US now accounting for nearly 20% of the EU's overall gas imports and half of all LNG imports.""
In gas, US LNG will certainly grow in importance and will dominate European LNG imports.""","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping trade agreement with the European Union, under which the bloc will increase energy imports from the US by 2.5 times, purchasing $750 billion worth of American energy products and investing $600 billion into the US economy.

The White House described the agreement as a ""historic realignment"" of transatlantic economic ties.

The European Union is expected to spend an average of $250 billion per year over the next three years on energy imports from the United States, up from the current $90–100 billion annually, under the deal.

The increase includes projected rises in oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and nuclear fuel imports, as the EU continues efforts to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

The bloc had historically relied heavily on Russian fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, to meet its energy needs.

As part of its response to the energy crisis, the EU launched the REPowerEU plan in May 2022, aiming to cut Russian gas imports by two-thirds by the end of that year and to achieve full independence from Russian energy ""well before 2030.""

Since then, the EU has significantly ramped up LNG imports, especially from the US, while accelerating investments in renewables and energy efficiency.

By 2023, Russian pipeline gas exports to the EU had dropped by over 80%, according to official data.

- ‘Europe has largely pivoted away from Russian energy’

Speaking to Anadolu, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said the war in Ukraine prompted the EU to diversify its energy sources.

""Europe has to a large extent already pivoted away from Russian energy, with Russia's share of EU gas imports falling from more than 40% before the invasion of Ukraine to below 20% now. Increased purchases from the US helped drive this shift, with the US now accounting for nearly 20% of the EU's overall gas imports and half of all LNG imports."" said Zandi.

Zandi noted that increased US purchases helped drive the shift, with the US now accounting for nearly 20% of the EU’s total gas imports and half of all LNG imports.

However, he expressed skepticism about the EU’s ability to meet the new targets.

""In 2024, the EU imported only around $75 billion of energy products from the US, of which about $15 billion was LNG. It would take a huge increase to meet the new targets."" he said.

Zandi also highlighted institutional limitations, saying the EU lacks the power to enforce such massive spending.

""It's also worth highlighting that the EU ultimately lacks the power to direct this kind of spending, which will instead need to come from national governments or even private companies. That's even more relevant to the suggestion that the EU will invest an additional $600bn in the US over the coming years, which we suspect will prove to be a fairly empty promise,"" said Zandi.

- US to become key LNG supplier for EU

John Roberts, an energy security specialist at Methinks Ltd, told Anadolu that the agreement represents a significant step forward in transatlantic energy cooperation, positioning the US as a dominant LNG supplier to Europe.

""But only if Europe is defined as the EU and if Norway is excluded from such calculations. In gas, US LNG will certainly grow in importance and will dominate European LNG imports."" he said.

While US LNG is set to lead Europe’s liquefied gas market, most of Europe’s oil will still come from the Middle East and North Africa, he said.

""In 2024, Norway exported twice as much gas to the rest of Europe as US, (124.7bcm vs 60.7 bcm) while Algeria also supplied 44.9 bcm"" he noted.

""European investment in the US will be shaped by Trump supporting legislation and regulation that favors fossil fuels. But in the other direction, US technology companies will be seeking outlets in European renewables projects,"" Roberts said.

Roberts pointed to limitations on government influence on the projected $750 billion in EU investments,

""Neither the EU, meaning the European Commission, nor EU member governments can compel their industries to make overseas investments, unless they are state-owned. So much will actually depend on what the US itself offers companies to attract investment. I remain sceptical that the surge of European investment into the US envisaged in the deal, which has still to be both detailed and ratified, will result in such a massive increase."" he said.

The long-term impact of the deal will depend not only on political will but on economic conditions and regulatory environments on both sides of the Atlantic, he said.

Hypothetically, this could kill off any solar or wind project going through permitting that is sited on federal lands, because these facilities would technically be less energy dense than coal, gas, and nuclear plants.
This is irrespective of the potential benefits solar and wind may have for the environment or reducing carbon emissions – none of which are mentioned in the order.
Crucially, does the Interior expect that by choking off the flow of permits, cities and companies will just pony up to build what the Trump administration considers “reasonable alternatives” instead?
Is the federal government going to tell communities in Nevada, for example, that they must suddenly build gas plants in the desert instead of solar farms to meet their increasing energy needs?","The Interior Department released a new secretarial order Friday saying it may no longer issue any permits to a solar or wind project on federal lands unless the agency believes it will generate as much energy per acre as a coal, gas, or nuclear power plant.

Hypothetically, this could kill off any solar or wind project going through permitting that is sited on federal lands, because these facilities would technically be less energy dense than coal, gas, and nuclear plants. This is irrespective of the potential benefits solar and wind may have for the environment or reducing carbon emissions – none of which are mentioned in the order.

“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement included in a press release announcing the move. “By considering energy generation optimization, the Department will be able to better manage our federal lands, minimize environmental impact, and maximize energy development to further President Donald Trump’s energy goals.”

Here’s how this new regime, which I and many in the energy sector are now suddenly trying to wrap their heads around, is apparently going to work: solar and wind facilities will now be evaluated based on their “capacity density,” which is calculated based on the ratio of acres used for a project compared to its power generation capacity. If a project has a lower “capacity density” than what the department considers to be a “reasonable alternative,” then it may no longer be able to get a permit.

“On a technology-neutral basis,” the order states, “wind and solar projects use disproportionate Federal lands relative to their energy generation when compared to other energy sources, like nuclear, gas, and coal.” The document going on to give an example, claiming that data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows an advanced nuclear plant uses less federal acreage than an offshore wind farm and “thus, when there are reasonable alternatives that can generate the same amount of or more energy on far less Federal land, wind and solar projects may unnecessarily and unduly degrade Federal lands.” The order also includes a chart comparing the capacity density of wind and solar facilities to conventional nuclear, gas, and coal, as well as geothermal, and claims that these sources are superior as well. The document does not reference hydropower.

Nexans, a leader in the world’s energy transition which invested in the U.S. with its subsea transmission cable manufacturing facility in South Carolina, today announces an innovative partnership with Crowley Wind Services, a leading American shipping and logistics company, to develop and operate a Jones Act compliant cable lay barge.

Dedicated to supporting the installation of subsea transmission lines necessary for offshore wind energy, telecommunications and other major industrial applications, this collaboration underscores both companies' commitment to providing solutions for the expansion of U.S. energy sources and other industrial uses that require underwater cabling.

The 300-foot, U.S.-flagged barge, built in Louisiana and tested in the U.S. Gulf to Nexans specifications, will be crewed by American mariners under Crowley’s operation. The vessel will play a critical role in laying and burying the subsea cables needed to deliver energy from offshore to the grid onshore. The barge is the first to have vertical injectors along with a dynamic positioning system and a multiple-anchors positioning system, which allow for accurate and efficient cable placement, even in challenging conditions.

The barge boasts a 3,500-ton capacity carousel to lay and bury subsea cable using burial tools such as a vertical injector, a jet sled, or a jetting ROV, with the potential to be upgraded to 7,000 tons with two carousels for bundle cable lay and burial. The barge is positioned to support Equinor’s Empire Wind offshore wind farm for New York and can be configured to lay or repair cable for a multitude of other subsea applications.

""This barge will support our existing fleet of cable laying vessels, the Nexans CLV Aurora, Nexans C/S Skagerrak and Nexans CLV Electra, and we are pleased to be working with Crowley on developing the capability to lay nearshore subsea cable in the U.S.,"" said Pascal Radue, executive vice president of Nexans' PWR-Transmission Business Group, highlighting the significance of the partnership.

“The cable lay barge will provide a productive supply chain solution for offshore energy, telecommunications and other sectors,” said Graham Tyson, vice president of operations, Crowley Wind Services. “Coupled with our U.S. maritime fleet and mariners providing feedering services and other logistics and project management capabilities, we could not be better equipped to serve the needs of industries seeking subsea cable solutions.”

The vessel will be operated by a crew of U.S. mariners, supporting maritime investment and employment goals.

“AMO is proud to be the leading source for United States Coast Guard licensed officers in the wind farm space. Our long-lasting partnership with Crowley, and our new relationship with Nexans, will help to provide clean, affordable and sustainable energy to millions of Americans and will open the door to future offshore projects,” said American Maritime Officers National President Willie Barrere.

“The SIU welcomes this exciting opportunity and looks forward to providing dedicated, well-trained mariners to help ensure the new vessel’s success,” said Seafarers International Union President David Heindel. “SIU members have sailed aboard cable-laying vessels for decades, so we are more than up to the task. This is a worthwhile project that will boost American shipboard manpower while reinforcing the great importance of the Jones Act, which has protected United States national, economic and homeland security for more than a century.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Vessels_Large/Crowley-Cable-Lay-Barge-AMO.4f51d6.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 14:04:47.118314

The Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois Act (REV Illinois Act) can help bolster Illinois manufacturing in the electric vehicle and renewables sectors.","At the Climate Jobs Institute, we’ve been hearing the same urgent question: What will the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) mean for Illinois? The answer: fewer jobs, higher household energy costs, and stalled clean energy development — threatening hard-earned gains from years of public and private investment.

Illinois has made major progress in clean energy with the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), supported by the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These policies sparked momentum across clean electricity, vehicle electrification, and manufacturing in Illinois. But OBBBA risks unraveling this progress by rolling back critical tax incentives, stifling development, and injecting uncertainty into investment planning.

These rollbacks will threaten confidence in an already volatile clean energy economy.

We have looked at a number of economic analyses from researchers across the United States, and the projections are stark. According to Energy Innovation, Illinois could lose 21,000 potential jobs by 2030. By 2030, households could face average energy bill increases of $110 annually, rising to $180 by 2035.

Nationwide, the Princeton Zero Lab projects that the bill will lead to $500 billion less capital investment in electricity and clean fuels and a decrease in “clean energy generation in 2035 by more than 820 terawatt-hours — more than the entire contribution of nuclear or coal to our electricity supply today.”

With the changing tax credits, the Rhodium Group estimates that $522 billion in planned clean-energy investments are now at risk. More than $263 billion of this is wind, solar and energy storage facilities, while $110 billion of announced clean energy manufacturing is at risk. This will have direct implications for Illinois.

These changes have come at a time when electricity demand is increasing from data centers, onshoring manufacturing, and building and transportation electrification. The bill will make it more difficult to meet growing demand with low-cost renewables, leading to a 10-18% increase in consumer electricity rates by 2035, according to Energy Innovation.

Solar Industry

Illinois’ growing solar market and workforce – roughly 7,000 workers, according to the U.S. Energy Employment Report 2024 – are directly threatened.

OBBBA shortens the timeline for the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (45Y) and Investment Tax Credit (48E) — previously extended through at least 2032 — now only available to projects that begin construction within 12 months of OBBBA’s enactment or are completed by 2027. This abrupt deadline leaves developers scrambling and investors hesitant. It creates renewed urgency to address project delays from interconnection queues, permitting, and lengthy application processes.

The rollback of residential solar tax credits (25D), which are now set to expire in 2026 instead of 2034, threatens further market disruption and consumer pullback.

According to Energy Innovation, the state could see 1.3 fewer gigawatts of new solar capacity by 2035, with thousands of solar jobs on the line. The actual impact will depend on the industry’s ability to pivot and the state’s ability to mitigate these impacts.

Wind Industry

Wind energy is also facing serious setbacks. OBBBA shortens the timeline to take advantage of production and investment tax credits and adds tariffs and sourcing restrictions from “foreign entities of concern,” further limiting access to affordable turbine components. This is likely to stifle wind development in Illinois – around 2.7 fewer gigawatts of wind capacity is likely to be lost in Illinois by 2035, according to Energy Innovation.

Today, the US Department of Energy estimates that there are around 9,300 wind jobs in Illinois. With wind developers facing the dual challenge of condensed construction windows and increased costs, delays and cancellations are already likely. The policy changes will slow down new capacity and threaten labor demand and local tax revenues.

Clean Energy and EV Manufacturing

OBBBA will also impact electric vehicle and battery manufacturing — sectors where Illinois has made recent major gains.

A year ago, Illinois appeared to be on its way to thousands of new EV facility jobs, but projects from Stellantis in Belvidere and Lion Electric in Joliet have already been cancelled. The early sunset of EV tax credits — new and used EV credits (30D and 25E) now expire in September 2025 — will likely impact investment in new EV facilities, as well as demand for EVs like those manufactured at the Rivian plant in Normal.

Additionally, the repeal of the 45X manufacturing credit for battery and component production threatens momentum on that front. Without stable, long-term incentives, Illinois could miss out on next-generation battery plants, stalling its progress as a national clean manufacturing hub and endangering jobs tied to new federal contracts and programs.

What Illinois Must Do Next

Illinois is better positioned than many states. With CEJA as our foundation, Illinois offers solar, wind, and EV incentives that will buffer the federal impact and ensure that many clean energy projects can continue. The Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois Act (REV Illinois Act) can help bolster Illinois manufacturing in the electric vehicle and renewables sectors. Indeed, our policies may attract clean energy businesses and investors from less favorable states to Illinois.

Still, it is urgent that Illinois take steps to stabilize the clean energy economy and workforce.

First, Illinois must help solar and wind projects meet construction and energization deadlines to take advantage of the sunsetting federal tax credits. Now is the time to streamline application and permitting processes and put pressure on Regional Transmission Operators to speed up the interconnection queue.

Second, it is more important than ever that the new CEJA workforce and contractor programs coordinate with industry leaders, unions, and employers to align workforce supply with demand. Through CEJA, Illinois has made significant investments in building a clean energy workforce — particularly for individuals in disadvantaged communities and those reentering society after incarceration. But with the anticipated project losses, these programs will need to make sure that jobs are still available. CEJA administrators and grantees will need to coordinate with labor and industry to understand how they are responding to these changes. Workforce programs may need to adapt their training or offer different options to ensure that jobs people are counting on are within reach.

Over the next few years, the state has many options to address the impact of these federal rollbacks, from increasing state-level incentives to offering more financing and loan programs to offset the increased costs of clean energy projects. Solar companies may want to pivot to solar leases or diversify their offerings, perhaps by entering the growing energy storage sector. State agencies and municipalities will need to consider how to close funding gaps for affected projects to protect against layoffs and dislocation.

To avoid backsliding, Illinois will require leadership, creativity, and coordinated response from state lawmakers, communities, agencies, industry, and labor.

We’ll continue to track developments, share analysis, and uplift voices of affected people — but one thing is clear: we must act now to protect our clean energy future.",https://ler.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shutterstock_1297781557-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 08:58:16.247433

As sustainability and decarbonisation emerge as key strategic objectives, significant strides are being made in various sectors, including electrification, materials transformation, manufacturing and digital evolution.

According to PwC, automotive manufacturers are optimising products and procedures to lessen environmental impact and progress towards carbon neutrality.

Electrification and hybridisation in focus

As per insights from AutoLeap, a prominent auto repair shop management software, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are broadening their EV portfolios and investing in battery developments that enhance driving ranges, reduce charging times, and improve recyclability.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) remain pivotal, particularly in regions where complete electrification is yet unavailable.

Dentons, an international law firm, suggests that hybrids offer practical emission reduction solutions as infrastructure continues to develop.

Sustainable materials and the circular economy

The movement towards a circular economy is intensifying. Deloitte points out the increased employment of recycled aluminium, bio-based plastics and eco-friendly interiors across the industry.

According to Research and Markets, market intelligence on OEMs indicates that integrating circularity within vehicle design and implementing end-of-life strategies focusing on recycling, remanufacturing and resource retrieval is becoming a regular practice.

Martijn Karrenbeld, Global Market Sector Director, Industrial Manufacturing at Arcadis, says: “The potential for decarbonisation in industrial manufacturing is enormous.

""It is a major global consumer of energy and contributor of carbon, so every sustainability gain we make really matters.”

Measuring industry progress

Deloitte indicates that European automakers have achieved a 20% reduction in operational emissions since 2021, despite increasing production volumes.

Globally, the automotive sector is eyeing a 90% reduction in emissions by 2050 as part of broader net zero commitments.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are anticipated to compose 20-24% of the EU's new car sales by 2025, per Transport & Environment, with sales likely to increase as infrastructure enlarges and vehicles become more affordable.

The automotive sector is at a critical juncture. Deloitte and PwC suggest that the next chapter in automotive sustainability will focus on scaling EV adoption, integrating circular design throughout, and establishing transparent, low-carbon supply chains.

The electric motor for the sixth generation of BMW eDrive (Gen6) is the first fully-electric drivetrain to be produced at the Steyr location in Austria. From there, it will be shipped throughout the production network, providing the drivetrain for the Neue Klasse.

Between the project launch in 2022 and 2030, BMW is investing more than a billion euros in expanding development and production expertise for e-drives at the Steyr location. This capacity expansion will ensure the plant remains the BMW Group’s leading location for drivetrains. For more than 40 years, the plant has developed and manufactured internal combustion engines for the BMW and MINI brands. This extensive experience and wealth of expertise in drivetrains make the engine plant the ideal facility to produce the Gen6 electric motors, the company said. The site will continue to manufacture diesel and gasoline engines in parallel.

Around 1,000 employees will work in the new electric motor assembly. Depending on global demand, half of the Steyr location’s total workforce could be employed in e-mobility by 2030.

The core components of the e-drive—rotor, stator, transmission and power converter—will be manufactured at Plant Steyr. The housing for the electric motor will be cast at Plant Landshut’s aluminum foundry and further processed in Steyr. The power converter will be produced in a new in-house clean-room environment, marking the Austrian engine manufacturer’s entry into the field of electrical motorering.

E-drive components from Steyr will be assembled on two new lines. The overall production concept for the Gen6 e-drive follows the principle of a modular system, making it possible to produce different highly flexible electric drivetrain derivatives for the entire range of Neue Klasse models. The modular concept generates positive economies of scale and cost savings in both development and production. It also improves the scalability of production volumes. The modular approach keeps production, supply networks and procurement highly flexible.

The electric motor has undergone significant further development for Gen6; the rotor, stator and power converter have all been holistically designed for the Gen6 technology’s new 800-volt architecture, maximizing the performance capabilities and the efficiency of the drive system.

Improvements in geometry and cooling, along with reduced friction, optimize the two-stage spur gearbox. Customer-friendly acoustics have also been further refined. In the e-drive’s power converter, 800-volt technology and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor technology are now being used to boost efficiency. Fully integrated into the electric motor housing, the power converter converts direct current (DC) from the high-voltage battery into alternating current (AC) for the electric motor.

Comparing one of the future models of the Neue Klasse with a Gen5 xDrive model shows the improvements in the electric motor.

Energy loss is reduced by 40 percent, costs by 20 percent, and weight by 10 percent. All this makes a significant contribution to the approximately 20-percent increase in overall vehicle efficiency. The efficient design of the powertrain together with the high energy content of the high-voltage battery, enable a range of up to 800 km (WLTP) in the BMW iX3, the first model of the Neue Klasse.

One leading energy company is turning that question into a major opportunity — and helping build a cleaner, more circular energy future in the process.

As reported by EnergySage, Qcells, a Korean solar manufacturer with two factories in Dalton, Georgia, has announced plans to launch EcoRecycle, a first-of-its-kind solar recycling facility based in Cartersville. The company will start by recycling up to 250 megawatts of used panels each year and aims to grow its recycling network across the United States.

With this move, Qcells becomes the first producer of crystalline silicon (C-Si) solar panels to handle the entire process — from manufacturing to recycling — within the country. Kelly Weger, the company's senior director of sustainability, called it a vital step: ""Effectively managing solar waste is essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and resilience of the clean energy sector.""

The move reflects a growing need. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, most solar panels last 25 to 30 years, and by 2030, retired panels could contain up to $450 million worth of recoverable raw materials. This is roughly the amount needed to produce 60 million new panels.

While most panels in use today were installed after 2017, early signs of panel retirements are emerging — and as EnergySage puts it, Qcells' move is ""happening not a moment too soon.""

Meanwhile, for households, solar technology continues to reduce both utility costs and planet-heating pollution. EnergySage, an independent platform for quotes from vetted solar installers, offers tools that clarify pricing, system options, and incentives.

Through the platform, the average user can access nearly $10,000 in savings through available rebates and tax credits. Its state-by-state solar map shows typical installation costs and incentives by region.

However, in switching to solar power, time may be a factor. Solar Builder and NPR both shared that the 30% solar tax credit is set to expire after 2025, with Congress voting to phase it out. To qualify for the credit, installations must be completed by January 1, 2026. This change could significantly affect savings.

Qcells' move reflects a broader shift toward full-cycle sustainability in solar, not just how panels are made and used, but what happens after retirement.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Qcellsimage-recZTL4eXZ4bai5mE.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 03:59:00.098682

""The new model is a bold and timely step that will strengthen National Grid’s supply chain and accelerate the UK’s journey to net zero.""","National Grid is reshaping how it engages with Britain's energy supply sector through an £8bn (US$10bn) initiative, aimed at speeding up the country’s shift towards clean electricity.

Known as the New Electricity Transmission Partnership (ETP), the programme will focus on revitalising regional supply chains in England and Wales.

It brings together construction firms, suppliers and local expertise to accelerate the build of critical electricity infrastructure.

This effort is part of National Grid’s broader investment plan, seeking to strengthen the grid while aligning with the UK’s 2050 net zero target.

Over the next several years, the focus is not only on laying down cables and constructing substations but also on building capacity within communities and firms across the country.

Supporting the clean energy transition

The ETP feeds into the National Grid’s RIIO-T3 plan, a regulatory framework for electricity transmission, which includes a wider £35bn (US$44.9bn) commitment between 2026 and 2031.

Through this investment, National Grid aims to double the electricity transferred nationwide and the number of customer connections.

The ETP stands out for its approach to collaboration.

It introduces a long-term, performance-based structure that encourages suppliers to adopt sustainable practices.

By rewarding consistent, high-quality delivery, National Grid creates conditions for enduring partnerships.

The new model allows delivery partners to take the lead in their respective regions, giving them the security to invest in workforce training, equipment and local expansion.

Those chosen as regional delivery partners include:

Balfour Beatty for the North East

Burns & McDonnell, working across the UK

Linxon, working across the UK

Morgan Sindall Infrastructure for the North West

M Group Energy for South West region 2

Murphy for South West region 1, London and South East

Omexom / Taylor Woodrow (OTW) for Central West

These firms gain first refusal on substation projects in their designated areas, giving them a clear pipeline of work to plan around.

Tony Wilson, Managing Director at Balfour Beatty Power Transmission & Distribution, says: ""We’re proud to be a regional delivery partner for National Grid’s Electricity Transmission Partnership and especially to be entrusted with the North East, an area where we have a strong presence and a long-standing commitment, having delivered major energy infrastructure projects across the region for decades.

""This appointment recognises our proven track record in delivering critical infrastructure and our ability to mobilise skilled teams and innovative solutions at scale.

""The new model is a bold and timely step that will strengthen National Grid’s supply chain and accelerate the UK’s journey to net zero.""

Infrastructure delivery with local impact

The ETP model isn’t only about high-voltage infrastructure.

Simon Smith, Managing Director of Morgan Sindall Infrastructure, says: ""This latest investment cycle from National Grid will not only be pivotal to the UK by further strengthening the energy network for current and future resilience, but it brings so much for local communities with diverse career opportunities and the utilisation of local supply chain.""

With an emphasis on including regional businesses in its supply chain, the ETP fosters development of local capability.

The programme not only supports the UK's transition away from fossil fuels but also promotes energy independence, by ensuring that supply chains involved in clean energy projects are built to last.

Building resilient supply chains for net zero goals

In tandem with the ETP, National Grid is running additional initiatives aimed at making its supplier ecosystem more robust.

These include the Great Grid Partnership (GGP) and a high voltage direct current (HVDC) supply chain framework.

Together, these programmes aim to introduce better resilience, deeper capacity and greater national reach in energy construction.

The inclusion of HVDC technology, used to transmit electricity over long distances with minimal loss, demonstrates National Grid’s intent to upgrade both the physical grid and the technical competence of its supply chain.

This matters not just for delivering on green goals, but also for ensuring the system can handle increased demand as the UK electrifies heating, transport and other sectors.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/57d06ae898ff271ca840e6ad92d7bb88:09dee751d81954a6b96096929cc73be6/electricity-pylon-3916956-1280.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 03:58:26.570126

Though there are hundreds of Colorado rebates, local municipality rebates and utility company rebates.

The rebates cover electric lawn equipment, smart thermostats and heat pumps, among other energy-efficient home upgrades. While federal rebates are ending, state and local rebate programs funded by local tax dollars will continue, though those funds shrink over the years.

Colorado has launched a new website designed to help residents navigate the hundreds of available rebate programs without extensive research.

""Nobody should be expected to have to research 600. Just plug it in, make sure you get everything you are entitled to, to save you money and reduce your utility costs,"" Gov. Jared Polis (D) said.

The website requires users to provide personal information to access customized rebate options. Users must enter whether they are homeowners or renters, their zip code, birth month and year, income level, and birth months and years for all household members, including children.

Elena Torres, who was shopping at Home Depot for upgrades to her rental property, was unaware she could qualify for rebates based on her purchases. When asked if spending 10 minutes on the website would be worthwhile, Torres said, ""It certainly could, depending on what the rebate is.""

The website serves a dual purpose beyond finding energy rebates. The website also provides details on programs for families needing help paying utility bills, which explains the household demographic questions.

""It's like if you add additional search terms in one of the search engines, let's say Bing or Google or Yahoo or wherever else, it will return you more specific results,” Steve Beaty, a computer science professor at MSU Denver, said.

Beaty reviewed the website’s privacy policy and said it is one of the better ones he has seen.

""This one was pretty good, actually,"" he said. ""It wasn't all that long. There wasn't a whole lot of legal jargon.""

The privacy policy includes several consumer protections.

""They say they're not going to sell your data to a third party, big upside there,"" Beaty said.

He found one particularly noteworthy aspect.

""I thought it was also interesting and unusual that if they are ever bought or merge, or whatever, they explicitly say whoever purchases them or merges with them must abide by the privacy policy that's currently in place,” Beaty said.

What is the big deal with zip code, income level and birth months and years of household members anyway?

Beaty said if that information were sold, it could be combined with other data purchased from the dark web that could identify specific people, leading to data aggregation. It could give someone enough information to know a person’s name and birth month and year, which could compromise medical data and records that rely on someone’s name and birth date.",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/fbffe4ba-8434-4711-b196-fb88fad859d9/20250802T000947/fbffe4ba-8434-4711-b196-fb88fad859d9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 03:58:30.749862

NOAA also partners with the Northern Gulf Institute and Gulf of Mexico Alliance to expand observational capabilities and state-level technical support.","By Nolan McKendry | The Center Square

The Gulf of America’s “dead zone” has shrunk significantly this summer, with scientists measuring a hypoxic area of just over 4,400 square miles — roughly a third smaller than last year and far less than the long-term average, federal officials announced Wednesday.

The dead zone, a stretch of oxygen-depleted water that forms annually off the Louisiana and Texas coasts, is caused primarily by excess nutrients washing into the Gulf from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin.

This year’s zone, measured during a July 20–25 survey aboard the research vessel Pelican, was 4,402 square miles — 21% smaller than NOAA’s early-season estimate and the 15th smallest on record, according to NOAA-supported scientists from LSU and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium.

“This year’s significant reduction in the Gulf of America’s ‘dead zone’ is an encouraging sign for the future of this area,” said Laura Grimm, acting NOAA administrator. “It highlights the dedication and impactful work of NOAA-supported scientists and partners, and serves as a testament to the effectiveness of collaborative efforts in supporting our U.S. fishermen, coastal communities, and vital marine ecosystems.”

The measured area is equivalent to roughly 2.8 million acres of bottom habitat temporarily made unavailable to marine life such as fish and shrimp due to low oxygen levels.

That marks a 30% drop from 2024, when the zone spanned a massive 6,703 square miles — more than 1.3 times the long-term average and nearly 3.5 times larger than the target goal of 1,930 square miles set by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force.

Despite this year’s improvement, the five-year running average remains high at 4,755 square miles—still more than double the federal benchmark.

Dead zones emerge when excess nutrients — mostly nitrogen and phosphorus from upstream agriculture and wastewater — fuel algae blooms. As algae die and sink, their decomposition consumes oxygen in bottom waters. Without sufficient oxygen, marine species must flee or perish.

In 2024, the area west of the Mississippi River experienced heavy hypoxia with extremely low oxygen readings and little water mixing, according to NOAA.

“The stratification of warmer surface water over cooler, saltier bottom water was strong enough to prevent oxygen replenishment,” researchers wrote in a followup report.

Some bottom waters saw oxygen drop across the lower five meters of the water column.

Even with relatively low chlorophyll readings — indicating modest live algae near the surface — researchers noted high concentrations of degraded algae and organic detritus near the seafloor, still enough to drive significant bacterial oxygen consumption.

The Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force, a coalition of federal and state agencies, has worked for over two decades to reduce nutrient pollution flowing into the Gulf. The EPA established a dedicated Gulf Hypoxia Program in 2022 to accelerate these efforts.

“The Gulf of America is a national treasure that supports energy dominance, commercial fishing, American industry, and the recreation economy,” said Peggy Browne, acting assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Water. “I look forward to co-leading the work of the Gulf Hypoxia Task Force to assess evolving science and address nutrient loads from all sources.”

So far, nitrogen loading from the Mississippi River has not declined since the 2001 adoption of the Hypoxia Action Plan, scientists noted. NOAA’s June 2025 forecast, which had predicted a dead zone of 5,574 square miles, was based on U.S. Geological Survey nutrient data from spring river flows and fell within model uncertainty ranges.

NOAA’s Coastal Hypoxia Research, Ocean Technology Transition, and Uncrewed Systems programs are working to improve monitoring and prediction tools. This year, several autonomous surface vehicles were deployed alongside ship-based crews to compare mapping methods.

Researchers said ASVs may provide a more cost-effective way to track dead zones in the future. NOAA also partners with the Northern Gulf Institute and Gulf of Mexico Alliance to expand observational capabilities and state-level technical support.",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2025/02/Trump-tariffs.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 13:09:09.046788

Voting Wrongs

Texas Democrats are fighting an uphill battle to block the latest Republican-led effort to gerrymander the Lone Star state for electoral advantage, and Black and Latino voters are once again most likely to be impacted. This time around, President Donald Trump is publicly pressuring lawmakers in Texas and beyond to preemptively meddle in the midterm elections to preserve the GOP majority in the House of Representatives, saving him from becoming a lame duck as his approval ratings sink and Democrats attempt to ride in on a wave of voter backlash.

Both major parties are guilty of drawing congressional districts that prioritize political wins over fair representation, but democracy experts say the redistricting proposal unveiled in Texas this week is a dangerous escalation. A Republican majority is rushing to slice up congressional districts that were already redrawn in 2021 to maximize GOP power — creating a gerrymander of a gerrymander. Democrats are fighting back, but the battle may ultimately be decided by the courts and frustrated voters.

Civil rights groups in Texas are busy challenging current electoral maps in court for diluting the electoral power of Black and Brown voters. Roman Palomares, the national president of LULAC, a nonpartisan Latino rights group fighting intense voter suppression in Texas, said the latest redistricting push is “a hijacking of democracy in plain sight.”

“It entrenches Republican power by rewriting the rules of the game midstream,” Palomares said in a statement this week. “When you can’t win fairly, you cheat, and that is exactly what this is.”

Trump has demanded Texas Republicans draw a new congressional map. “Just a very simple redrawing, we pick up five seats,” the president told reporters in July. Gov. Greg Abbott recently called lawmakers back to Austin for a special legislative session to make it happen. A response to the deadly floods that rocked Texas Hill Country last month is also on the agenda, but Democrats say the GOP is focused instead on buoying Trump with the redistricting plan. Lawmakers released the proposed electoral map on July 30, five years earlier than districts would normally be redrawn with fresh census data.

Labor unions and nonpartisan civil rights groups quickly condemned the map as a blatantly partisan attack on Latino-majority districts. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat whose heavily Latino district in San Antonio would be carved up to make the district more favorable to Republicans, called the map an “illegal power grab” rooted in racism.

“Black and Brown communities will suffer the most; they’re getting torn up across the state,” Cuellar told reporters on Thursday. “In the last few decades, the overwhelming majority of growth in Texas has come from Latino and African American communities, and yet the number of seats that have been drawn to serve those communities has stayed flat or shrunk.”

Republicans claim the new map creates more Latino-majority districts, but the proposed map offers only the illusion of better representation, according to LULAC. The group said a close examination reveals that the new map dilutes voter power or potential turnout by carving up Latino communities where voters share common needs and political interests, or packing voters into districts that already lean heavily toward one party or the other. In Central Texas, the proposed map would eliminate the congressional district held by Rep. Greg Casar, a move LULAC said is targeting a “champion of civil rights.”

“The people of Texas, especially its Latino voters, deserve better than to be carved up and cast aside to serve the president’s agenda,” Palomares said. Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett also spoke out, saying that the new lines would mean she lived outside the district she currently represents.

Democratic state lawmakers are considering leaving the state in order to prevent the legislature from reaching a quorum and passing the proposed map, a tactic they used to delay approval of a congressional map during a dramatic redistricting fight in 2003. Democrats would have to camp out in another state to avoid being arrested and dragged back by state police while racking up a daily $500 fine. Republicans put the fees in place after another Democratic decampment from the state in 2021.

Texas voters are no strangers to redistricting fights, which have escalated over the decades since Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in an attempt to curb the Jim Crow-era suppression of Black voters. Republicans are now diving deep into legally dubious arguments in the latest showdown in hopes of securing a favorable map for Trump ahead of the midterms.

Dan Vicuña, director of redistricting and representation at Common Cause, a nonpartisan group supporting citizen-led initiatives against gerrymandering, spoke out against the “sloppy and transparent” July 7 letter that Trump’s Justice Department sent to GOP leadership in Texas. The letter alleges that the current congressional map was drawn with “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders,” which contradicts court testimony from Republicans who said the map is “blind to race.”

That letter kicked off the redistricting push to redraw the state’s “gerrymandered congressional map and somehow gerrymander it even more for Republicans, because Trump is afraid of how the midterms will go for his party,” Vicuña stated. Citing a controversial federal court ruling against a coalition of Black and Latino voters in Galveston, the letter gave Abbott a shallow pretext to put redistricting next to disaster relief on the special agenda, Vicuña said.

“Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the U.S. Justice Department, sent the governor and attorney general of Texas a letter making the legally dubious argument claiming that a congressional map deemed by civil racial rights experts to be racially discriminatory was in fact too friendly to people of color,” Vicuña told reporters this week.

Next week will mark the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 becoming law, a major achievement of the civil rights movement. Kathleen Thompson, executive director of the Progress Texas Institute, said Republicans in Texas have fought to overturn the landmark civil rights law ever since it was implemented.

“Now, instead of working on emergency items like flash flood mitigation and warning systems, Texas Republicans are focused on stealing your voting power,” Thompson said in a statement this week. “Sixty years later, white guys are still calling each other and saying how Brown and Black citizens can vote.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2227266800-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 13:08:44.396543

We’ll be prioritizing questions from the investment community. So if you are a member of the media, please direct your inquiries to our communications team who will be happy to respond. As always, our Investor Relations team will be available following the call for any follow-up questions.

On to slide two, where I will remind you that we will be referring to forward looking information on today’s presentation and Q and A. By its nature, this information contains forecast assumptions and expectations about future outcomes, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined here and discussed more fully in our public disclosure filings. We’ll also be referring to non GAAP measures summarized below. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Greg Ebel.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, thanks very much, Rebecca, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. I’m excited to share another strong quarter and highlight the progress we’ve made across all segments of our business. Last quarter, I spoke about the importance of continued dialogue with policymakers and regulators to ensure North American energy independence and security. I’m optimistic about our ongoing conversations and the alignment we’re seeing today on both sides of the border to advance projects and legislation that serve growing energy demand. And Enbridge continues to be in a great position to serve this growing demand with its large incumbent footprint across all four business units.

We’re gonna start today with a midyear check-in on financial performance, execution, and an update on our growth projects. I’ll walk through how Enbridge is effectively navigating trade conflict, legislative change, and geopolitical volatility. I’ll then touch on how Enbridge is capitalizing on rising power demand in North America before providing an update on each of our four core franchises. Pat will then review our financial results and reiterate our capital allocation priorities. And lastly, I’ll close the presentation with a few comments on our first choice value proposition before we open the call for your questions.

We’ve made significant progress on the commitments we laid out for you at the start of the year, and I’m proud of the work the team has done to execute our financial, operational, and growth priorities. We set another record for second quarter EBITDA driven primarily by contributions from the acquired US gas utilities and successful rate settlements in our gas transmission business. Our strong 2025 gives us confidence that we’ll finish the year in the upper end of our EBITDA guidance range, and we are well on track to meet our DCF per share midpoint. The balance sheet is also in great shape. As of June 30, we’re at 4.7 times debt to EBITDA, primarily due to realizing another full quarter of earnings from The US gas utility acquisitions that closed throughout 2024.

Our assets remained highly utilized during the quarter, and the mainline transported 3,000,000 barrels per day. That system has now been in apportionment for six of the first eight months of the year, including July and August. We closed an investment on our West Coast system by a consortium of 38 indigenous groups backed by a loan guarantee provided by the Canadian government. This partnership provides sustained economic benefits to First Nations and is aligned with Enbridge’s continuous goal of recycling capital at attractive valuations for shareholders. We also closed the previously announced acquisition of a 10% interest in the Matterhorn Express Pipeline in the Permian and upsized the Traverse Pipeline project from 1.75 BCF per day to two and a half BCF per day driven by strong customer demand.

As a reminder, the Traverse pipeline is part of the Whistler JV and is designed to transport natural gas between AquaDulce and the Katy area in Texas. Work on our planned liquids mainline optimizations is ongoing, and we’re pleased to announce that our recent 100,000 barrel per day open season on Flanagan South Pipeline was oversubscribed. We expect to reach FID on the first phase of the mainline optimization later this year. On the growth front, we sanctioned the $900,000,000 Clear Fork project in Texas located just outside San Antonio. The project is fully contracted under a long term off take agreement with Meta and will support its data center operations.

Meta represents a new addition to our growing list of AI and data center related customers. In gas transmission, we sanctioned expansions of Texas Eastern and Aiken Creek Gas Storage to serve growing industrial power and LNG demand across North America. Together, these renewable and gas projects highlight the competitive advantage of our all of the above approach and our ability to serve increasing natural gas and power demand through multiple business units, services, and geographies. Now let’s touch on the stability Enbridge continues to offer investors despite the ongoing volatility we are seeing today. The markets have been turbulent thus far in 2025, but the volatility has really showcased Enbridge’s stable business model and the value of our low risk commercial frameworks.

Our size, diversity, and disciplined capital allocation puts us in a great position to deliver predictable returns to shareholders in these conditions. Our exposure to tariffs is negligible across our operations, and importantly, Canadian oil and gas delivered to The US via our systems has not attracted tariffs. Roughly 80% of our EBITDA is generated by assets with revenue inflators or regulatory mechanisms for recovering rising costs, which helps to backstop our ratable and growing dividend and earnings. On the tax policy front, the extension of bonus depreciation provides benefits to Enbridge’s near term growth, and our sanctioned or late stage renewable projects are not expected to be impacted negatively by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The second quarter saw continued price volatility across commodity markets driven by geopolitical instability, but Enbridge’s low risk business model protected us from those dynamics with virtually no exposure to commodity prices and over 98% of EBITDA generated by assets with regulated returns or long term take or pay contracts.

Lastly, our footprint puts us in an ideal position to capitalize on growing energy demand in North America and beyond. We are connected to a 100% of Gulf Coast operating LNG export capacity, and our natural gas systems are located within 50 miles of 29 new data centers, 78 coal plants, and 45% of all North American natural gas power generation. Our gas distribution franchise is the largest natural gas utility business in North America, and we deliver reliable natural gas to over 7,000,000 customers every day in geographies with growing gas demand. In the crude market, our incumbency positions us as the leading operator to provide new and expanded egress options for customers, something both producers and policymakers are in fact seeking. And our renewable power business is opportunistically providing power to some of the largest AI and data center players in the world as the demand for energy across North America continues to grow.

And let’s take a couple of minutes to spotlight some of the investments we’re making related to growing power demand. As you can see from this slide, Enbridge has already won and will continue to win power demand related opportunities by deploying our all of the above approach to energy in order to serve blue chip customers across various sectors. During our investor day in March, we shared 4 to $5,000,000,000 of near term power generation opportunities across our gas and renewable businesses that we expected to begin announcing within six months. I’m pleased to say that we’re ahead of schedule with over $1,000,000,000 of recently sanctioned projects between Clear Fork Solar in Texas and the line 31 expansion in Mississippi. In addition, we can now confirm that Texas Eastern Transmission will be interconnected to the Homer City redevelopment generating facility in Pennsylvania.

We are working to commercialize opportunities to support data centers and hyperscalers in the state further adding to our growth backlog. We’ve recently completed milestone projects for solar power backed by PPAs with Amazon and AT and T and continue to advance over $5,000,000,000 of power demand projects serving a combined six gigawatts of new generation. With that being said, we can’t forget about the progress we’re making across various exciting opportunities in our liquids business, which I’ll get into now. Mainline volumes were strong again this quarter, delivering 3,000,000 barrels per day on average for the quarter and 3,100,000 barrels per day for the 2025. At investor day, we announced up to $2,000,000,000 of investment in the mainline through 2028 to support continued high utilization of the system while also extending asset life and reliability.

That investment is now underway, and we will earn attractive returns within the MTS agreement collar of 11 to 14 and a half percent. We also continue to advance mainline optimization phase one. Our full path FSP open season was oversubscribed, and the team is now working towards FID ing the 150,000 barrel per day mainline expansion later this year. Additionally, we launched an open season for the Southern Illinois Connector, which will leverage our existing footprint and our interest in the EPCO pipeline to provide full path optionality for our customers serving additional US Gulf Coast demand. Mainline investments of this nature are permit like, provide attractive economics, and will be sanctioned to meet our customers’ increasing egress requirements.

And lastly, down on the Gulf Coast, our 120,000 barrel per day Gray Oak expansion has partially entered service with full COD expected in mid twenty twenty six. Now let’s turn to gas transmission. We’ve got a number of exciting announcements this quarter spread out across our footprint. In Mississippi, we sanctioned the line 31 expansion of Texas Eastern to serve rising industrial and power demand, all secured under twenty year take or pay agreements with a well known investment grade customer. This project was among the opportunities highlighted at investor day to serve growing gas demand.

On the Gulf Coast, we’ve progressed optimization projects, including a $50,000,000 expansion of SESH to serve the growing power generation needs of a major electric utility that’s there serving data centers as well as an upgrade to the Tres Palajas storage facility in Texas. This storage upgrade is being done to increase injection and withdrawal rates and is part of a larger expansion opportunity we expect to realize later in the decade. In Canadian gas transmission, I’m pleased to announce a 40 BCF expansion of the Aiken Creek storage facility that will support the growing Canadian LNG market. That project will also optimize our other expansions underway on the West Coast system, providing customers with critical flexibility in a rapidly developing region, particularly on the LNG front. Lastly, we are updating our capital investment for wood fiber.

As a reminder, Enbridge has a contract structure that provides us the ability to earn a low double digit return, and we will now set that rate closer to the in service date. We remain excited about the growing LNG market in Western Canada as all of these projects are expected to enter service in the 2027 to ’29 time period, extending and adding visibility to our long term growth outlook. Now let’s move on to our gas distribution business. We remain excited about the long term growth outlook for our utility business and the foundational growth that helps to support the dividend. In Ontario, the phase two rebasing process was completed, setting rates through 2028.

And in Ohio, we received a decision on the rate case filed in 2023. While we didn’t get all that we asked for, I’m encouraged by the almost 10% ROE and increased equity thickness, which remains among the strongest returns within our utility franchise. Of note, existing capital riders are a great and continuing feature, ensuring quick cycle capital returns, which was part of what attracted us to the investment back in 2023. Lastly, we filed for new rates in North Carolina and Utah this quarter and expect we’ll have new rates in those jurisdictions by next year. And now I’ll turn to the renewable power sector.

Enbridge continues to advance its world class renewable portfolio using our financial strength, supply chain reach, and construction expertise under a low risk commercial model that delivers competitive returns. In July, we announced the Clear Fork solar project near San Antonio, Texas, a 600 megawatt facility that will support data center needs. All generation is sold under a long term offtake agreement with Meta Platforms. And importantly, the project is expected to meet all the requirements to fully qualify for renewable tax credits under new US legislation. Also in Texas, we are progressing the 815 megawatts Sequoia solar development.

The project is on track to partially enter service in 2025 with full production coming online in 2026. Also of importance, the one big beautiful bill act is not expected to impact any of our sanctioned projects, but we’ll continue to monitor future developments in this fast moving policy environment. It’s our view that the recent US legislative changes makes our backlog of late stage development projects even more valuable. But now I’ll pass it off to Pat to go over our financial performance.

Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks, Greg, and welcome, everyone. Strong utilization across our asset base has led to another solid quarter. We’re posting record second quarter EBITDA despite continued trade uncertainty and geopolitical events. Compared to the 2024, adjusted EBITDA is up 7%, earnings per share up 12%, while DCF per share is comparable. In our Liquids segment, we saw strong volumes with the mainline transporting 3,000,000 barrels per day, although weaker results at FSP and Spearhead resulted in a slight decrease compared to 2024.

In gas transmission, strong operational performance across our pipes and storage assets in addition to revised rates on U. S. GT assets added to the segment year over year. Our Whistler JV and DBR system acquisitions, in addition to Venice Extension, entering service at the 2024 provided additional contributions. Gas distribution is up relative to last year with the acquisitions of the U.

S. Gas Utilities being the main driver. Higher rates, customers, and storage revenues at Enbridge Gas Ontario, in addition to the colder weather, also contribute to the strong results within the segment. In renewables, we saw lower contributions at our European offshore assets, which were partially offset by stronger wind resources in North America. For DCF per share and EPS, higher financing costs, current taxes and maintenance capital, primarily driven by the US Gas Utilities acquisition, partially offset the higher EBITDA contributions.

The per share metrics are, of course, impacted by the at the market issuances that were completed in the 2024 to prefund The US utility. I’m pleased to reaffirm our 2,025 guidance and growth outlook across all metrics. With our strong performance through the 2025, we’re in a great position to finish the year in the upper end of our guidance range for EBITDA. The resilience of our business model is really on display as we continue to deliver predictable returns through market volatility. The acquisition of a 10% interest in the Matterhorn Express, strong mainline volumes and the strength of The U.

S. CAD exchange rate are all tailwinds to our full year guidance, but are partially offset by higher than expected U. S. Interest rates. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our near term and medium term growth outlooks.

Now let’s touch base on our capital allocation priorities. As you would expect, we continue to be focused on disciplined capital allocation. Our balance sheet provides us with financial strength and flexibility, and our debt to EBITDA has decreased to below the midpoint of our target range over the past few quarters, as expected, following the close of The U. S. Gas utility acquisitions.

We also extended our track record of recycling capital at attractive valuations. The investment by our First Nation partners and a 12.5% stake in the West Coast system, which closed in July, generated cash proceeds of $700,000,000 and demonstrated our ongoing commitment to economic reconciliation and partnership with indigenous communities. One of the keys to our value proposition is to sustainably return capital to shareholders, and we prioritize being in the 60% to 70% range of DCF payout. Our dividend is underpinned by high quality, low risk cash flow growth, and continues to support our dividend aristocrat status. As a reminder, we’ve increased our dividend to shareholders for thirty consecutive years, and we expect to return approximately $40,000,000,000 to $45,000,000,000 over the next five years.

In terms of further growth, we will continue to make disciplined investment decisions and prioritize low multiple brownfield and utility like projects with our nine to ten billion dollars of annual investment capacity. What I especially like about this quarter is that we’ve announced or made significant progress on opportunities in each of our four business units, and those opportunities are spread throughout the end of the decade, adding even more clarity to our growth plans. And with that, I’ll pass it back to Greg for some closing remarks.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, thanks very much, Ted. And as you’ve just heard, it’s been another strong showing from all the teams this quarter. Enbridge is ideally positioned to deliver predictable results through virtually all economic conditions and cycles. Our low risk business continues to prove its value to shareholders, evidenced by the consistency of our cash flows and earnings growth. This year marks our thirtieth consecutive annual dividend increase supported by our business model.

We’ve also secured high quality and sustainable growth via our now $32,000,000,000 secured capital program, adding visibility to our expected 5% growth through the end of the decade. We will continue to evaluate accretive tuck ins and tax efficient investment opportunities that fit within our wheelhouse to diligently ensure lasting returns to shareholders. And with that, I’d like to thank you all for listening. And operator, please open the line for questions.

Speaker 3: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Speaker 4: Hi, good morning.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Good morning, Jeremy.

Speaker 4: Just wondering if you might be able to frame a little bit more, I guess, opportunities you’re seeing across your footprint as it relates to natural gas expansion to serve incremental power demand and possibly data center demand growth as well. We’ve seen news coming out of Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, a lot going on in Ohio as well. I think the slides reference other opportunities across your footprint such as in the West. So I was just wondering if you could frame a bit more the opportunity set, where you see it most across the portfolio and I guess timeline to new projects materializing. Do you see this kind of a near term or just kind of steady cadence over time?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, Jeremy, maybe I’ll start and then, Cynthia can chime in, too and maybe even yeah. I know not on the gas side, but maybe Matthew too. So it’s really all of the above. Like, we we in the, GDS business the GTM business and our renewable business, I was at the technology and economic summit you were talking about in Pennsylvania. And, obviously, out of that came a press release of a big player using the Texas Eastern system to, support Homer City, in North Carolina and Mississippi and Georgia.

We talked about on this call, Utah. All of those, we’re really starting to see, things come in. I guess the point I would make, there is two elements here. There’s one there, utility element, which I would say is most of where we’re picking up the opportunities, and you heard us talk about line 31 just a few minutes ago as well as Sesh, very much utility based. But there’s a nice smattering of behind the meter type stuff, which is what Homer City would look like.

And then let’s not forget about the renewable side. I know you’re asking about gas. So it’s right across the system. Haven’t seen that much in Canada yet, but I think that’s actually an opportunity that will come too. Cynthia, do you wanna add more from what we had laid out back at the Investor Day?

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. I’ll just build on on what you said, Greg. So if we look at what we said at Investor Day, we have, just on the gas transmission side, 35 plus opportunities to 11 BCF of gas, about, you know, 4,000,000,000, one to 2,000,000,000 of that in that late stage development. Right now, we have 10 plus specific data center opportunities in that late stage. Of course, we’re located, you know, next to the natural gas generation.

So 45% of all natural gas power generations within 50 miles of our system. And within that area too, that 50 miles, there’s 29 new data centers. And then of course, we still have the opportunities for coal to gas conversions. There’s 78 coal plants in that in that area. That’s about eight eighty gigawatts of current of current power generation.

So what I would say is we’re seeing opportunities across the system in The US in particular, and that’s not to discount the opportunities we have in the natural gas side with along US Gulf Coast to serve LNG. So we still see lots of opportunities there in Canada. We’ve done lots of expansions and as was noted with the storage at Acorn Creek that’s going to serve more LNG opportunities. And last quarter we had announced our Birch Grove expansion too. So we continue to see a lot of opportunities, Jeremy.

Speaker 4: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you for that. And just want to pivot to wood fiber if you could, if you could provide a little bit more detail on some of the drivers in the higher cost expectations there and as well as maybe just any more detail to share. It seems like you still have the ability to earn a low double digit return, but any any color, incremental on those two points would be helpful.

Thank you.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. For sure, Jeremy. You know, I’m, and we are never that pleased when we see more capital than we originally planned. However, with wood fiber, as you mentioned, our contract structure does allow us to earn that double digit return on capital as we agree to invest in the project. Fortunately, and through the agreements with departments, we’re now gonna set that toll on the higher capital amount nearer to the projects in in service.

Our partner, which owns 70% of the project, as you probably recall, they they do take capital cost risk, but they get the benefit of selling the LNG commodity. So I think it’s a really good balance of interest there. And I guess my point being, while we’re always really focused on the capital being deployed to the couple of dozen projects we’ve got in execution right across the portfolio, we’re equally focused on the contractual and regulatory structures around that capital to ensure to the extent possible that we can make sure we get the return protected should capital cost change, particularly on multiyear projects. And I really think that combined focus is serving us well on this project. Now with respect to capital cost increases, I wouldn’t it’s not really one thing.

Right? We’ve had some changes in in building codes. Permitting delays, not a new issue for most jurisdictions. We’re adding additional flotilla, so that’s where we house our employees. So that’ll create room for another 900 approximately folks as we get into the heavy builds and then some site conditions.

So all those have really added up to this slide. Again, the key is, as you pointed out, our ability to continue to earn that low double digit return.

Speaker 4: Got it. Thank you.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks, Jeremy.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Katsaliev from CIBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Speaker 6: Hi, good morning, I was hoping, Greg, you can discuss how you’re seeing energy policy evolving in Canada. And if you could compare the prospects of a new pipeline to Tidewater compared to some of the various incremental expansion opportunities that are available in the industry on the liquids pipeline side.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Well, I think as you saw us announce today and you’ve really seen us been going hard at this since January and last fall, our customers at this point in time really wanna go south. Right? That’s the premium market, which we’re able to deliver to both PADD two and PADD three, think the Gulf Coast. And so Colin and his team have really put forward a number of really great incremental projects, and, you know, you can see those in the presentation.

That’s the first move. It’s the most valuable market. It’s the smartest way to do this. And then when that’s done and as our customer production grows, that’s when an opportunity could be created to go to the West Coast. And and there’s lots of discussion with governments on that.

And as you know, Robert, we have been a proponent of such a project in the past and, in fact, invested several $100,000,000 to get there. So the issue isn’t not one of, they’re being a proponent. The issue is one of government policy setting the conditions for that to get investment to occur. Let’s be honest. The government has not done that yet, and it’s not clear they intend to, at least from our perspective.

In particular, there’s still an emissions cap in place for our customers, which really stifles their ability to grow oil production. And then secondly, the West Coast tanker ban remains in place that, frankly, as long as that’s there, would make building a pipeline to the West Coast being a pipeline to nowhere. So and none nothing’s been deemed in the national interest yet either. So lots of us to watch from an industry perspective. We’re very active on that front, but we’re continuing to find ways to serve our customers’ needs by adding that incremental egress that they really want, which really means the Gulf Coast.

So TBD. Meanwhile, as you’re seeing south of the border, a lot of changes, accelerated permitting. We even start to see it in changes to the army corps of engineers and a desire to actually build energy sovereignty and project power. And so, hopefully, that’ll translate up here as the government gets its footing. And in the meantime, we’ll continue to provide counsel and advice to folks like the premier of Alberta who, you know, she continues to work to advance not only the province’s interest, but I actually think Canada’s energy interests and sovereignty via new energy infrastructure.

Speaker 6: That’s a very helpful response. Thank you. And I was just curious how the the Ohio rate case order impacts your strategy on rate cases in general in The U. S. Franchises and obviously Ohio in particular.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, Michelle’s here. I’ll let her go at that. Obviously regulatory ex piece is something we’re very focused on.

Michelle Heritance, Head of Gas Distribution and Storage, Enbridge Inc.: Sure. So, obviously, we were disappointed in the Ohio rate case, but but, really, it’s turning on a couple of, I’d call it, legal and regulatory issues. As Greg mentioned in his opening remarks, at the end of the day, the fact is we still have really strong ROE amongst the the best that you can have. We saw an increase in our equity thickness. We didn’t have any material denials into what we submitted as appropriate o and m.

All of the capital that we’ve invested is has gone into rate base. We continue to have the strong capital riders that we really like to know Ohio. So it’s still a very strong and productive jurisdiction, but we do have a couple specific issues so that we think there were errors made by the PUC in Ohio, and we filed a rehearing about a week ago a week ago today on that. So we’re we’re confident in the Ohio utility, and we’re certainly confident in its growth as as we was mentioned in an earlier question. Lots of lots of data centers, lots of generation there, so it’s a good, it’s a good utility.

But we are in rate cases in all four of our our major utilities as we mentioned. We’re coming to the tail end in Ontario, and then we would expect to see our results in Utah and North Carolina coming through in the fall. I think the big difference, though, for Utah and North Carolina is their rate cases are a matter of routine. We go every two or three years. So it’s really just a question of updating things, having a discussion about what’s the most appropriate, levels of return without the fifteen year lag that we had in Ohio.

That that really created a lot of complexity in the Ohio rate case. So we’re very confident with North Carolina and Utah. Good relationships there, transparent work. So things are good.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. So, you know, obviously, if you think back to the acquisition, which, know, we haven’t even had all these closed for a year yet, That’ll come up in September. Very consistent results and expectations. You know, we’re as you know, Rob, we’re quite conservative in the way we look at things. And I would say we’ve probably been imated the growth opportunity there, right across all the utilities and the regulatory, filings and rate cases.

That’s standard what we do across all our businesses. And, you know, sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you don’t, But it the business continues to drive forward.

Speaker 6: Excellent. Thank you.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron MacNeil from TD Cowen. Your line is open.

Speaker 8: Hey, good morning all. Thanks for taking my questions. Greg, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, but can you speak to the Cowboy Solar and Seven Stars projects? I guess I’m just trying to get a sense of if your customers are encouraging you to get these types of projects across the line, just given the changing tax credit landscape. And as it relates to other solar projects in your mid stage development bucket, are there any practical limitations that we should be thinking about in terms of your ability to get more across the line?

And then I guess finally, just given the urgency, do you have the room in your annual investment capacity to get more projects like this done?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. So we I’ll let Matthew kinda jump in here in a second. But one thing I would point out is our customer need is driven not just on the renewable side. Historically, maybe more focused from an ESG perspective. Today, the issue is the need for power, all types of power.

Right? So and you definitely see that in, like, the Metas and the AT and Ts and Amazons. Yeah. Sure. Everybody wants to kinda move forward on the sustainability front, but it’s really that need for power.

So the late stage stuff that we have continue to see, if anything, an increase. Matthew, maybe you can speak to that in request for that power. I think your question, Aaron, if I’m hearing it correctly, really, you know, post the projects we have and that are in late stage, all of which can be done within the new legislative changes in The US. It’s really after that, the next stage called later in the in the decade or the end of the decade and beyond. You know, without the tax incentives, will they be attractive?

I think that’s a TBD, but it doesn’t it doesn’t prevent the projects that we have in the backlog from moving forward. That’s for sure. And if tax incentives aren’t an element of projects on a go forward basis, they’re gonna have to compete just like everything else with capital, and we’ll see what happens macrolays. You could make an argument. What you’ll see is power prices go up, which still allows you to make your returns, but we’ll see what happens at that time.

But do you wanna speak specifically to those two projects, Matthew?

Matthew Ackman, Head of Renewable Power, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Thanks. Thanks. Just to add what to what Greg said, we do have some projects in addition to the ones we’ve announced that are late stage and with a very high probability will continue to qualify for the credits.

And we do see very, very strong customer customer demand from these blue chip type customers like Aemeta, and we’re very pleased to add them to our roster. And these are the types of customers that wanna work with Enbridge, not just in our renewable business, but frankly across our gas businesses. As Greg talked about, it’s it’s really a multiplatform strategy, to satisfy demand for electricity that’s rising rapidly. We do so I think we have visibility to some more of these projects. You mentioned a couple, that should qualify, but the key is to be very disciplined in this environment.

It’s very fluid. There’s still some moving parts. The the bill was relatively favorable on the tax credit front, but there are still some administrative actions that could occur. So we’ll be conservative, and we’ll be opportunistic, but, we’ll stick to our very strong capital discipline in renewables. As Greg said, I think one thing to note on the seven stars that you mentioned, that is actually a Canadian project.

So, I think the policy in Canada is much more stable, and predictable right now. That’s a wind project in Saskatchewan. On cowboy, we’ll see. It’s a late stage project, solar project in Wyoming. And, again, on that one, it’ll have to hit our low risk commercial model, and that’s still evolving, frankly.

So we’ll keep developing those projects, but we’ll be disciplined and low risk in our approach to FID. And, Erin, I

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: think your last point was on the capital capacity. Yeah. I mean, the projects that Matthew has spoken about and the opportunities that we talked about for renewables, at the Investor Day, very much taken into account in our financial plans, and, they would they even with those projects coming forward, remember, we always have a couple of billion dollars of incremental capacity we could invest. So it’s really not it’s not capacity. It’s more investment quality and return relative to what is a plethora of opportunities across the, the entire business.

Speaker 8: Thanks. That’s a lot of great detail. Maybe just as my follow-up, one point of clarification. You’ve mentioned Homer City a couple of times today. Looks like this project is pretty far along.

Can you just give us a sense of you know, timeline to FID, potential capital requirements, returns in service date, and any potential gating items?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Cynthia can chime in here, but, to be blunt, no. Like, I think it is it’s kind of far along from an announcement perspective, but there’s a lot of work here. Right? That’s a four gigawatt plus project towards the end of the decade.

You know, they’re working through getting their gas supply agreements in principle. There’s a lot of pieces in there. So, you know, it could be everything from a straight lateral to an expansion of Texas Eastern. But until the customer actually has determined exactly how it wants to deal with that, all I can tell you is we will get our fair share.

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for that, Greg. I would just add that we are in those discussions. These discussions had started, you know, months ago. It’ll take a little while until we get through that final design and the commitments.

But as Greg said, we will definitely have to need to participate. I would note that Texas Eastern has about 10 BCF per day of underutilized receipt potential in that Marcellus supply region. And so we can do some very economical pipeline expansions, you know, to serve Pennsylvania and Ohio along our existing right of ways. So it’s great, and we have lots of ongoing conversations with developers, power generators, hyperscalers around that area of Pennsylvania and Ohio. So more to come, and we’ll keep you posted.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. You know, Erin, I I think about this as winning by a lot of singles and maybe the odd double. You know, I think as you would well understand, say, a gigawatt plant takes, say, a 150 a day, gigawatt gas plant, you know, that’s not a massive pipeline. Right? So and you can see that with line 31.

You can see that with with the Stash. With the Stash development. So it’s a lot of incremental pieces built very economically that add up to really nice investments. So sometimes I think people looking for the big splash billion dollar pipeline projects. I think those are gonna be few and far between for individual data centers.

So I think you gotta keep watching these incremental pieces. And, frankly, as investors, I think you should so I’ll do $1,000,000,000 expansions that happened quickly, relatively permanent light, probably not cross state, even though it may involve interstate pipe, all day long versus a big, say, greenfield new billion dollar pipe.

Speaker 8: That’s helpful. Thanks, everyone. I’ll turn it back.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks. Your

Speaker 3: next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.0: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe I’ll just piggyback off of that question. You’ve talked about obviously a lot of power generation opportunity and things. But so far, the announcements on the gas pipeline side, the pace of announcements has been a bit slower compared to peers.

I mean, you talked about having excess capacity. So maybe that’s one of the reasons why your projects are maybe smaller in size than some of the larger builds that are CapEx projects that we’re seeing. But maybe you could just kind of walk us through the differences here on Texas Eastern versus some of your other competitors? And is it because you have excess capacity? Are you waiting for the right returns?

Are there dependencies tied to, you know, associated utilities? Just trying to get some more color there.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, I think it’s a bit of both. And I’m not sure I’d agree with your view that people have actually made more announcements on the other side. I think there’s people talk about stuff, but let’s go down the list. Right? You got a gigawatt and a half billion dollar projects.

And, for TVA, they were proceed with it that’s going ahead. In North Carolina and GDS. There’s a gig 1.4 gigawatts, 600,000,000 plus for a Duke facility in Utah, couple of 100 megawatts plus. In Ontario, we’re still pursuing some of those opportunities and then the stuff that we just announced today. So I’m not sure I’m not sure I’d be on the same page there.

I think some people that’s maybe all they have. And as you know, we’ve got opportunities across multiple businesses on that front. And, I mean, I don’t know, perhaps you could you have that, but I’m not aware of anybody else having signed up Amazon, having signed up Meta, having signed up AT and T on the renewable side. So I think it’s an all of the above opportunity for us, and and I’m a big believer that much of this is actually gonna be done with utilities and the power utilities. And you will know that in neither the case in Mississippi or the SESH project that we announced, which utilities, those are two.

And that’s because they’re not really keen on actually indicating exactly what we’re doing on the data center side. So I think I think, Praneeth, you’ll you’ll find I think if you if you crawl through it, I mean, we can do a better job of communicating that to you, that there’s lots of pieces that we’re knocking off. And I think we’re actually ahead of what we said in terms of announcements from the investor day when we talked about the eighteen month look forward of which we’re now, what, four months since that time frame and more to come.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.0: Yeah. No. I mean, just to kind of clarify, I think you’re definitely getting a lot of traction certainly on the renewable side and on the utility side. So I’m not saying there is an exposure to the theme, but it was more just on the gas pipeline side because you have a premier footprint there and you’re kind of in the heart of this, especially with Homer City building. Would have thought there would be more, but like you mentioned, maybe it’s TBD and we’ll definitely stay tuned.

Maybe just switching gears for my other question. Mean, mentioned OBBA and the bonus DD and A provisions there that could benefit near term growth. Guess just from a tax perspective, does that lower your cash tax burden in the near term? When do you now expect to be a meaningful cash taxpayer?

Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for the question. Yeah.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.1: I think, generally, it’s a very positive outcome from the various tax changes, like, as you said, extension of bonus depreciation, which affects a big portion of our overall business. I think the way to think about it is this further, you know, adds helps to the fact that we’ll now be able to grow per share kind of in line with our EBITDA guidance. The last few years, there’s been a bit of a differential because of the growing cash tax, but this will help to offset that and give us more and more confidence and clarity into that growth into the back part of the decade. So, yeah, we’re excited about it, and we think it can help to grow our our cash flows for our shareholders.

Speaker 8: Thank you.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Hope from Scotiabank. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.2: Good morning, everyone. On the data center theme, can you maybe add a little bit of commentary on how you’re thinking about the contractual frameworks and contractual protections regarding who the counterparty is and how you would potentially alter it, if at all, if it’s a utility customer or a behind the fence customer?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Obviously, from a credit perspective, other than and you see this on a renewable side, the Google’s and Meadows and AT and T’s, they’re obviously super credits. And that’s why we’re actually on balancing 75% of the opportunities with utilities who are existing customers today. They’re amazing credits too. So and they like to sign up for long term ten, fifteen, twenty year contracts take or pay.

If it is with a small data center hyperscaler player, I we we look at that really carefully. And, you know, some of those folks would have to probably provide LCs, etcetera. But, you know, that’s why, as I said, I think as this get continues to move forward rapidly, I I’m a strong believer you’re gonna continue to see those utility players there because this isn’t as easy as what people think. And the commitment to sign up for a ten or fifteen or twenty year pipeline contract or renewable contract says the big players will will be there. So from a analytical perspective, with all the data center opportunities out there, the winners here, just like on the pipeline side, will be the big players with scale, and that’s the customers that will largely largely serve.

I and and when I think about it, where the smaller players may have a better opportunity is frankly from our gas utilities where, you know, there’s a much larger scope of customers we have a requirement to serve. But even in some of those cases, depending what happens, they’d have to provide aids to construct, which is, you know, is an element. So I think we’ve got it covered from the big players and on the utility relatively small behind the meter stuff. You’d see that as a typical cost of service structure inside a utility. Super safe for the investor and very fair for the customer.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.3: Does that give Appreciate that color.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.2: Yeah. Exactly. And then switching gears here, just regarding the 9,000,000,000 to $10,000,000,000 of investment capacity per year. It is looking like you’re getting towards that range for 26,000,000,000 and $27,000,000,000 based off of the recent wins. How are you thinking about the cadence of when new or the cadence of project announcements and layering further capital in the next couple of years?

Or is now the focus turning towards the kind of, we’ll call it, beyond ’twenty seven timeframe?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.1: Yeah. I can take that, Rob. Yeah. I think it’s fair to say that in ’twenty five and ’twenty six, we’ve been filling up set pretty well over the last six to twelve months, and I think that should give people more and more clarity into that kind of 2728 growth rate. And I think it’s also fair to say that, you know, you look at the projects that we announced today, know, within service dates around 2829 that we’re now starting to fill in that back piece.

We still probably have a little bit of capacity to take some of the smaller bite sized things, a quick turn capital as we go here. But I think your comment is probably right in that we I think we’ve added a lot of great projects that add that clarity, call it, to the middle of the next half of the decade, and our job is to continue to provide high return projects into the back part. So from a capacity perspective, as I think I said in my remarks, I like the way it’s spread out across our businesses, but also spread out across the the rest of the decade here. So feeling very good as we get more transparency into that.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. I’d I’d say our our business development team is very much focused on the back half of the decade, and have been. Right? So that’s about extending, the growth, which, you know, we’ve got a lot of confidence in that post ’26 period. And then as Pat says, most of what we talked about today will be very little capital in the next twelve months.

And the stuff that does have capital, like on the GDS side of things, in some cases, you’ll start to earn on it before it even goes into service. But, otherwise, it’ll actually generate EBITDA within, say, the twelve months, which, of course, then creates capacity. Right?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.4: Thank you. Thanks.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pham from BMO. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.3: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just want to go to your backlog and returns? And as I look at some of these projects you sanctioned the last couple of years, you mentioned Woodfiber low double digit returns, T North, T South, percent returns. When I look at that and I look at the new projects you’re announcing today, much better returns, is it is the trend then for Enbridge capital allocation increasingly shifting more these higher return projects that,

Speaker 8: you know, you talked about

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.3: the singles high returns that as we look up the next twelve months, that average return is gonna start moving higher in that secured backlog?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely. I think you put a finger on the great tension inside the company. Lots of opportunities, but only those those projects and those jurisdictions that provide better returns, I e lower build multiples are gonna get serviced. Right?

So I would tell you right now, that’s a challenge to do more in a place like British Columbia or even Ontario relative to Ohio or or, say, Texas. So, you know, we wanna keep our builds, you know, in that six to eight times, and then and then Colin has tons of stuff that is even on the bottom end, if not the below that six to eight times, so very competitive. And then, of course, Michelle has higher multiples but quicker cycle. And so, yeah, it’s a you you should see, and this is very much our focus, steady, and it’s a big boat to move or a big denominator to move, increase in return on capital employed as we move up the chain in value added investments. You you hit it right on.

It’s it’s actually a really nice environment as capital allocators to be able to pick and choose the best returns so we can keep those steady and stay stable and growing earnings that you all expect from us.

Speaker 6: Okay. Got it.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.3: Maybe switching to the storage side, you have the Aiken expansion. Can you confirm, is there more white space beyond the 40 Bcf a day? And then what’s the strategy on The U. S. Storage assets?

Is it more recontract or is there opportunity to expand as well?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, Cynthia, do you want to speak to that?

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: Sure. So this 40 Bcf Aiken Creek is the most accessible. There would be other opportunities, but it would be not as accessible as this 40 BCF. This was part of what we knew in the acquisition that it would be as an easier stage step to get through. As it comes to other opportunities on the Gulf Coast, we continue to look at that.

We had some open seasons for storage expansions that we launched in May, and we’ve gotten some really good interest. So we’re looking at developing our salt caverns there along The US Gulf Coast. Of course, we expanded Trace Cavern 4 that just got into service beginning of the year. We also, as Greg noted, are continuing to the structure there, but we’re looking at whether with the open season interest, we’ll be expanding more at Trace, Egan, and Moss. There’s a lot of, obviously, opportunities in that area and the continued expansions and and LNG growth just provides some really good opportunities that we’re excited about right now.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Sometimes I think it’s under you know, we’ve got 600 bees out of storage across North America. Don’t forget, you know, Cynthia’s got great elements here, and the contracting has moved out a little longer and higher. You know, all that stuff sort of more three to five year type contracts, but at a higher rates than what we’ve seen for, say, the last five years. That’s kinda changed in the last eighteen months.

And don’t forget at GDS, we have a 100 or so BCF of storage that is unregulated. And is all the needs that come in on the power projects we’re talking about, LNG, not so much on data center, but LNG, etcetera, that makes that storage all the more valuable. Right? So it’s a good time for storage on the Gulf Coast and the Great Lakes regions and obviously in Western Canada where Aitken really is the only player in BC as LNG comes on.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.5: Okay. Thanks for update.

Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Berwold from Jefferies. Your line is open.

Speaker 8: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. This has been hit on a little bit from some other angles, but just wanted to ask what’s your appetite for greenfield gas pipeline in Canada? There’s a pending LNG project that needs a pipe and likely someone to develop it. So would that be of any interest to you if you got assurances similar to what you said you would need to underwrite a larger pipe on the crude side?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, I’ll let Cynthia speak to it, but I think there’s no doubt. Seems like gas pipelines in Western Canada or across Canada seem to have a not not easy, but an easier road than, say, liquids lines. And as you know, I think we’ve set ourselves up to do that. The West Coast system is fabulous. Indigenous participation in the West Coast system is fabulous setup.

No guarantee that that gets you consent, but very helpful in aligning interest. But, Cynthia?

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. We still have the Pacific Trails pipeline project. Our p two p project would serve, you know, onto the West Coast. So there’s future opportunities there. We’ll continue to maintain that.

It’s fully certified. Of course, you know, that would require a new large scale LNG facility in the region to proceed. But we are obviously very supportive and continue to look at opportunities. Opportunities. It would, as Greg noted, have to hunt in our overall capital allocation, but it is something, of course, with our West Coast system and that knowledge and experience.

And now with our our recent move to improve our indigenous relationships in BC, I think we’re well positioned to support that.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. I think the situation is it’s gonna any greenfield pipe in Canada is gonna gonna have to have better returns in the West Coast system because, you know, the West Coast system is great and been there. It’s a cost of service type structure, but you’re not taking on the risk you would with a with a greenfield project. So that that that would be the determining factor. And as we’ve talked about throughout the call, we’re not exactly opportunity poor.

Speaker 8: Okay. Understood. Thanks very much, guys.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from UBS. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.6: Good morning, guys. Congrats on a very strong quarter and I think it’s not appreciated enough, but you probably indicated that you’re coming in towards the top end of the guidance. So given your track record, we actually think you might beat it, but we keep our estimates within that range. My question to you is a little bit on the Southern Illinois Connector open season. Looks like a very exciting project.

Can you talk a little bit more about this project and how this what what the path forward for this project is?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: I think the guy that runs the liquids business is here. He usually gets the first question, so I’m glad he gets probably the last one.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.7: Yeah. Good morning. Good morning, Manav. And we’re we’re excited about building out the the plumbing in North America here to serve some long term pretty sticky demand. And so maybe unlike m l o one, Southern Illinois Connector is is more of a a recontracting play.

So it’s it’s it’s kind of a it’s not new egress over the Canadian US border, but but think of it as long hauling existing barrels on the system even further to serve some Louisiana refineries, you know, adding to that, you know, 75% of refineries served on the continent. So just adds another market to to the network and in an efficient way, right, using using existing pipes and and in this case, you know, partnering with existing JV partner. So process on that one is the open season will will go into August, and we’ll we’ll we’ll we’ll look to roll some contracts on on the Spearhead pipeline and and add further long term sticky paths to the mainline. So that’s it’s exciting, and we’re looking for more of those type of projects here to to complement the the low multiple build out and egress ads for customers.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.6: Perfect, guys. On top of that, so I’ll turn it over. Thank you so much.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thank you. Thanks, Moe.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.0: Hi, good morning. Curious what the remaining gating items are on the Mainline expansion from this point? And are you expecting based on discussions that returns on this are going to be carved out separately from the CTS?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.7: Yeah. So as as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we’re we’re we’re looking at and tracking for an FID later this year. The the primary gating item has has has been achieved, which is the open season on the Southern part of the path, Flanagan South, and that was oversubscribed. So lots of interest in in long term demand to The US Gulf Coast. The other gating item is working with with the traditional counterparties within cap, if you like, or industry on on base kind of rolling in the, like, the mainline capital into the rate base.

And there’s many precedents for that historically. We’ve expanded the mainline, you know, countless times over the years, and we’re we’re confident we’ll, come to agreement with industry on that. And so it would fit within, CTS or in rate bay or MTS or in rate base. And when when we roll, you know, the subsequent tranche of of mainline agreement beyond its expiry in 2028, that capital would be, you know, duly considered in in the rate base of the mainline going forward. So we’d earn of and on the capital in the mainline as well.

So two parts to that project, kind of the mainline and then Flanagan South and and Seaway to The Gulf, and we’ve got many precedents for doing this historically. So there’s some, you know, a little bit of gating there, but a well treaded path historically to do such.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.0: Okay. Thanks. Thanks for that. Second question, there’s there’s a few different project proposals now to bring Permian gas to other markets away from the Gulf Coast. So I’m curious what you see as the next steps for your JV with Whitewater.

Can you extend the value chain into Louisiana? Do you look more at storage? What other opportunities do you see in that JV with Whitewater the next few years?

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Keith. You know, we’re really pleased with how our investment in and our joint venture with Whitewater has gone. There has been obviously some upside since the original one. We continue to have expansion projects.

You know, with Traverse, we just upsized that. We still see a lot of gas that would flow or want to flow to serve the the LNG markets. And so we think that there’s further expansion opportunities there. I know Whitewater just announced with a similar project yesterday that they’ve upsized Pelican. So we’re still seeing a lot of interest in that area.

The traverse pipeline as was noted provides more interconnectivity to allow that bidirectional flow between Agua Dolce and Katy hub. So that does create that tie. It does tie you know, what we loved about that those assets is it does tie to our existing footprint, that header system that we have with Techco and, of course, Traceable Ashes storage. So, yes, we would look at all opportunities to expand to to move those volumes, and we continue to see a lot of opportunities on a go forward basis.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: And we we could do something on our

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: own too. We could.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: So it’s not just whitewater. It’s obviously, you know, be customer driven and, you know, do we think we have a better mousetrap than maybe the JV? Although, as Cynthia says, we’ve been really pleased with the the way that’s operated together. So, yeah, I mean, anything’s on the table there. And as you know, as GORs go up in the region, the demand for that gas continues to rise.

And, you know, I as as Cynthia just said, I think it’s you witnessed that in going from a b and three quarters to two and a quarter on the Traverse pipeline. So the opportunity is there, and we’ll either use the JV or we’ll figure out something on our own.

Speaker 6: Thank you.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Maurice Choi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.4: Thanks and good morning everyone. I’ll just stick with one question, but it’s more of a wholesome question about relationships of customers rather than delivering individual assets. If you continue to hear more record spending on AI, you know, how broad of a cooperation discussion did you have with Meta in terms of supporting their needs beyond Clearfork? And maybe even AT and T and Amazon since you touched on them earlier, recognizing that Enbridge certainly has the assets, expertise, and relationships across all energy forms?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, you know, maybe I’ll start, and and Matthew can chime in here. It’s that that’s actually a really great question because, you know, I would say early days, you know, you’re almost dealing with supply chain people where they see it as a a source of something they need, I e power or the case of gas, to run their operation. I think as time goes off, we’re moving up the chain in who we’re dealing with at these corporations because of the real strategic nature of energy, which we all know, but it’s not you know, that’s not something maybe the tech world or data centers were kinda thinking through in the same way that we have. So making sure we understand their long term interest, what they’re trying to do, the scalability has has caused it to move up as opposed to just be a supply chain issue. Yeah.

Matthew Ackman, Head of Renewable Power, Enbridge Inc.: I totally agree, Maurice. Thanks for the question. That’s exactly how we think of it. And, you know, we’re in the early innings of a major trend in energy that we can capitalize on across several of our business units. Renewable can be a little bit of a nexus, for for that initially.

And if you saw the quote from Meta, in our Clearfork announcement was that they were thrilled to be working with Enbridge, and we’re very pleased to be working with them. And it just goes to show that, you know, they’re signaling they wanna definitely do more, and there’s lots of conversations with these types of customers that are ongoing. And so we see those being more the types of customers we can do business with across all of our platforms.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. And and and size matters. Right? The old Russian accent that quantity has a quality all of its own. People wanna work with big players.

So, you know, Meta doesn’t wanna wanna work with a small cap energy provider. They wanna work with a major, player and someone who’s in 40 plus states and, you know, multiple countries and and all the provinces, if you will, if you think in a North American context. So that is really mattering in a big way. And I think as you see further projects FID ed and Matthew’s World and and, both on GDS and, GTM. You’ll see these players come to the fore either through a utility, but they wanna know how are they ultimately getting that infrastructure served, and can they rely on the energy?

And and that’s what we provide.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.4: No. That’s very good to hear. Thank you very much.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thank you.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.5: Thank you for squeezing me in. I just had a follow-up on the Ohio utility. Related to the impairment of this asset, can you talk about what led to this considering that it was only recently acquired? And when we take this into account as well as the rate case decision that’s currently being appealed, longer term, does this change your view on the trajectory of growth or on the margin change the amount of CapEx you would allocate between the utilities?

Michelle Heritance, Head of Gas Distribution and Storage, Enbridge Inc.: I’ll get things started and Pat can add if he wants to, Teresa. But the impairment the primary impairment associated with the Ohio utility, it was to do with the treatment of the pension asset, which was quite a significant asset that was in there. And and they were determined those pension assets were determined to be excluded from the calculation of rate base. The the position we had actually put forward was to have them excluded from rate base, so that’s not inconsistent with what we were looking for. We’re just asking for a rehearing with regard to how they treated the accumulated deferred income tax on that pension and where they they put that in for the purposes of calculating revenue reduction.

So it’s something we expected was going to happen. And that that’s the majority of the the write off of the regulatory asset that we recorded. And then there’s a smaller amount associated with the annual incentive plan. And in that case, again, we’re we’re applying for rehearing on that point and primarily with regard to the what we believe is retroactive rate making where they’ve gone and disallowed it from anything that was put in attributable to that piece previously. But, Pat, I don’t know if there’s anything else you’d like

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.5: to add.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.1: I think you covered the kind of the genesis of the write off. Well, I think your second question on let’s just change our capital allocation. No. I mean, I think Greg hit it quite quite clearly that it’s still a very good return, almost 10%. We actually got a higher equity thickness coming through that.

We have the main maintenance of the of the capital riders, which are important in this asset. And so I think it’s still a very positive framework to to work with for a regulatory perspective. So I think you could see us go back for hearings a little more often than they would have done historically. As you know, there was this first hearing in, like, fifteen years. So I think you’ll see some of that from a from a rate strategy perspective.

But at at the end of the day, not at all unexpected as a result of the rate case.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. And I I wouldn’t I don’t think it has anything what to do with the fundamentals of the business, your comment about a write off so soon after the acquisition. Like, frankly, we think they’ve erred in law. In fact, they may be where they’re going violates actually some federal pension laws, but we’ll take we’ll take that up with them. And if we’re right, you’re gonna see this reverse down the road.

So, that’s the way we kinda think about it.

Michelle Heritance, Head of Gas Distribution and Storage, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I’d pass on is a lot of those pension assets actually went with Dominion. So remember, this is a rate case that was filed by Dominion in 2023. Dominion continues to carry the obligation with regard to the pensions with for all the retired employees. And because it had been fifteen years, that had really grown to quite a large piece.

That’s with Dominion. We’ve just got the current employees going forward. So all of that needs to be updated with the regulator, and our plan is to file for another rate case here likely by the end of this year just to bring all those numbers. These are these numbers date back to ’23. They date it back to pre acquisition, so there’s a lot that needs to be updated with the regulator too.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.5: Thank you for the detailed answer and we look forward to the next chapters of this development.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks.

Speaker 3: Your final question comes from the line of Patrick Kenny from National Bank Financial. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.8: Thank you. Good morning. Just back on the preference here of customers continuing to push more and more barrels to the Gulf Coast. Just wondering if we can get a quick update on Ingleside, how throughput has been trending on a year over year basis and where things are at with respect to potentially sanctioning some of the optimization and dock expansion opportunities?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.7: Hey, Pat. It’s Colin. Up until the right, I think, is the the summation to your answer. So we steadily are growing volumes through the terminal. As we’ve talked to you about its advantaged.

We’ve got some more storage coming online. I would also, yeah, point you to some longer term kind of bigger upsides and and adding docks and stuff. We’ve done all the dredging, as you know, historically, and continue to add add barrels to it. We’re adding a fungible service, which is incremental to the historic business model, which has been just, you know, dedicated term storage. So that’s incremental as well.

So I think all the the whole menu of services and variety of of smaller, you know, optimizations and tweaks. And then later on as as the Permian Basin grows, we can we can add docks. I can confirm that we have connected the the adjacent Flint Dock over and are able to load there too and optimize windows to get, you know, the smaller vessels there and the bigger vessels, VLCCs at the Legacy Dock. So plan is on track and and more to come.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: It’s interesting that we all often focus on domestic demand and things like that, but global oil demand is really, really strong. And, obviously, that’s a that’s a a great setup for Ingleside on a go forward basis as well, regardless if you see some Permian weakness later in the year.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.8: And maybe as a quick follow-up there on your point, Greg. I know you’ve been previously looking at NGL export opportunities as well at Ingleside. But I guess in light of Asian buyers perhaps looking to diversify their petrochemical supply, curious if you might be looking to pivot opportunistically at other sites across North America, including Canada’s West Coast here, especially as LNG exports continue to ramp up over time?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.7: Yeah. You know, I’d I’d say the the strategy still is to kind of copy paste all the advantages from crude export at that terminal to other commodities at that terminal. So still NGL and potentially, you know, clean ammonia over time as well here. So that that remains the playbook. We got lots of land.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. You better move us, you know, as opposed to doing it in Canada. Think if we copy paste to a different location, probably somewhere else along the Gulf Coast, and you’ve heard us ruminate about that from time to time. And, yeah, that that’ll come to fruition over time a little further out, though.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.8: Okay. That’s great. Appreciate it. Thank you.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thank you. And

Speaker 3: that concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Rebecca Morley for some final closing remarks.

Rebecca Morley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance, Enbridge Inc.: Great. Thank you. And we appreciate your ongoing interest in Enbridge. As always, our Investor Relations team is available following the call for any additional questions that you may have. Once again, thanks, and have a great day.

You might have seen the viral photo: a proud announcement about the return of the great American car, paired with an image of… a Lada. Yes, that Lada—the boxy, Soviet-era sedan that’s about as Russian as borscht and snow. It’s the kind of mix-up that makes you do a double-take, then laugh, then wonder how it happened in the first place.

So, what’s going on here? Was it a simple mistake, or does it say something deeper about how we view American car culture today? Let’s dig in.

What Makes a Car “American” Anyway?

For decades, the American car has been a symbol of innovation, freedom, and even rebellion. Think of the Ford Mustang tearing down a desert highway, or the Chevy pickup hauling hay bales at sunrise. But the lines have blurred. Today, many “American” cars are assembled from global parts, and some of the most reliable vehicles on U.S. roads are made by companies headquartered in Japan or Germany.

A recent report from the American University Kogod School of Business found that only about half of the top-selling cars in the U.S. are actually built here with a majority of American parts. The rest? They’re global mashups—engines from Mexico, transmissions from Canada, electronics from Korea. The Lada photo gaffe, intentional or not, highlights just how fuzzy the definition of “American car” has become.

How Did the Lada Become an Accidental Mascot?

Let’s be honest: the Lada isn’t exactly the poster child for American automotive excellence. It’s a relic of Soviet engineering, known for its simplicity and ruggedness, not its style or speed. So why did it show up in a celebration of American manufacturing?

Most likely, someone grabbed a stock photo without double-checking the details. It’s a classic case of “good enough” in the age of fast-paced digital content. But there’s an irony here that’s hard to ignore. The Lada, with its utilitarian design and no-nonsense attitude, almost feels like a tongue-in-cheek nod to the days when American cars were built for durability, not just looks.

Are We Romanticizing the Past or Facing Reality?

There’s a certain nostalgia baked into the idea of the “great American car.” We remember the chrome, the tailfins, the V8s rumbling down Main Street. But the reality is, the auto industry has changed. Today’s cars are safer, more efficient, and packed with technology. Yet, the longing for a return to “the good old days” persists.

The Lada photo blunder might actually be a wake-up call. Maybe it’s time to stop chasing an idealized past and start appreciating the innovation happening right now. Electric trucks, hybrid SUVs, and advanced driver-assist systems are redefining what it means to drive American. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, electric vehicle sales in the U.S. grew by over 85% in 2023 alone—a clear sign that the future is already here, even if it doesn’t look like the past.

What Can We Learn from This Mix-Up?

Here’s the thing: mistakes like this are easy to laugh at, but they also open the door to bigger questions. What do we really want from our cars? Is it nostalgia, or is it progress? And how do we balance pride in American manufacturing with the realities of a global economy?

One lesson is clear: authenticity matters. Whether you’re building cars or telling stories about them, people crave the real deal. That means celebrating the true achievements of American automakers—like the resurgence of electric vehicles made in Detroit or the rise of innovative startups challenging the status quo.

The Big Takeaway

The great American car isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments. Start with one change this week, whether it’s learning more about where your car comes from or test-driving something outside your comfort zone, and you’ll likely spot the difference by month’s end.",https://www.globalvillagespace.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/americas-car-comeback-a-surprising-symbol-of-the-future.avif,N,,2025-08-02 19:02:11.135844

What’s the Real Impact of Tariffs on Ford’s EV Ambitions?
Are Partnerships the Secret Sauce for Ford’s EV Future?
That’s not just good for Ford; it’s good for anyone hoping to see more affordable, practical electric cars on the road.
Ford’s EV transformation isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments.","What Will Ford’s New EV Strategy Actually Change for Drivers and Investors?

Ford’s upcoming August 11 announcement isn’t just another corporate update—it’s being billed as the company’s “Model T moment” for electric vehicles. That’s a bold claim, especially from CEO Jim Farley, who’s known for his candor and willingness to shake things up. But what does this mean for the average driver or the savvy investor watching the EV space?

Farley has made it clear: profitability is the new North Star. Instead of chasing every EV niche, Ford’s going to zero in on segments where it can actually make money. This is a big shift from the “growth at all costs” mindset that’s dominated the electric car conversation for years. Investors should take note—Ford’s not just chasing volume, but sustainable returns.

Why Is Ford Looking to China for Inspiration Instead of Detroit?

Here’s where things get really interesting. Farley isn’t shy about his admiration for Chinese EV makers. He’s even been daily-driving a Xiaomi SU7, calling it “fantastic” and admitting he’s reluctant to give it up. That’s not just lip service. On a recent earnings call, Farley flat-out said that Ford’s real competition isn’t GM, Stellantis, or Volkswagen anymore—it’s Chinese companies like BYD and Geely.

Why? Because China’s EV makers are outpacing the rest of the world in both cost and innovation. According to the International Energy Agency, China accounted for nearly 60% of global EV sales in 2023, and their cars are often thousands of dollars cheaper than Western rivals. Farley’s takeaway: if Ford wants to survive, it needs to radically re-engineer how it designs, builds, and sources its EVs. No more business as usual.

How Is Ford Planning to Catch Up With Chinese EV Leaders?

Ford’s answer isn’t just to build cheaper cars—it’s to rethink the entire process. Farley talks about “radical re-engineering” of the engineering, supply chain, and manufacturing. That means looking for efficiencies everywhere, from battery sourcing to final assembly. It also means leaning into partnerships. As EV technology becomes more commoditized, it’s getting harder for any one brand to stand out on tech alone. Ford’s strategy is to team up where it makes sense, especially on complex systems like electrical architecture, and focus its resources where it can actually make a difference.

There’s a bit of humility here, too. Ford knows it’s behind, but it’s willing to learn from the best—even if the best are halfway around the world.

What’s the Real Impact of Tariffs on Ford’s EV Ambitions?

Tariffs are a thorny issue for Ford. The company is shelling out about $2 billion a year just in tariff-related costs, mostly from imported components. That’s a huge drag on profitability. But Farley sees a silver lining. Recent negotiations have brought some tariffs down from 25% to 15%, and he believes Ford’s status as a major American employer could help it secure more favorable treatment in the future.

There’s also a bigger trend at play: regionalization. As countries tighten their own electrification and emissions rules, and as tariff regimes shift, automakers are being forced to localize production and supply chains. Ford’s betting that by being nimble and leveraging its U.S. manufacturing footprint, it can turn these challenges into a competitive edge.

Are Partnerships the Secret Sauce for Ford’s EV Future?

With EV technology rapidly commoditizing, Ford is doubling down on strategic alliances. It’s a pragmatic move—no single automaker can do it all, especially as the pace of innovation accelerates. By partnering on things like battery tech, software, and supply chain logistics, Ford can share costs, speed up development, and avoid reinventing the wheel.

This approach is already paying off in the industry. For example, Ford’s collaboration with SK Innovation on battery plants in the U.S. is expected to create thousands of jobs and secure a steady supply of batteries for future models. It’s not just about cost-cutting; it’s about building resilience in a volatile global market.

What Does This Mean for the Future of Affordable EVs?

Farley’s “Model T moment” comment is more than just marketing. The original Model T revolutionized transportation by making cars affordable and accessible to the masses. Ford’s new EV strategy hints at a similar ambition: to bring down costs and make electric vehicles a realistic option for everyday drivers, not just early adopters or luxury buyers.

If Ford can pull this off—by streamlining manufacturing, leveraging partnerships, and out-innovating on cost—it could spark a new wave of EV adoption in North America and beyond. That’s not just good for Ford; it’s good for anyone hoping to see more affordable, practical electric cars on the road.

The big takeaway? Ford’s EV transformation isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments. Start with one change this week, and you’ll likely spot the difference by month’s end.",https://www.globalvillagespace.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ford-unveils-bold-ev-overhaul-to-challenge-china-and-drive-profitable-innovation.avif,N,,2025-08-02 20:01:02.633001

This action marks the most sweeping reexamination of federal climate policy since the 2009 endangerment determination was first issued. The 2009 determination concluded, under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (""CAA""), that six GHGs from new motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that could endanger public health or welfare, thereby allowing EPA regulation.

EPA justifies the proposed rule by arguing the statute authorizes vehicle standards only for pollutants that endanger health or welfare through local or regional exposure, not for substances—such as GHGs—which were based on global climate change concerns. EPA further reasons that it lacked statutory authority in 2009 to issue a freestanding endangerment finding and now proposes to revoke it outright.

If finalized, the rule requires no response from motor vehicle and engine manufacturers; instead, the proposed rule promises flexibility. EPA is specifically proposing to remove certain regulations concerning emission standards, reporting requirements, and testing procedures.

The legal ramifications of the rule could be widespread. While the 2009 Endangerment Finding was made in the context of motor vehicle emissions, it led to a series of cascading consequences that led to other rules regulating GHGs under the CAA. EPA recognizes this reliance in the rule and states it has ""initiated or intend[s] to initiate separate rulemakings that will address any overlapping issues."" EPA already proposed a rule to repeal GHG emission standards for power plants by finding that the emissions are not reasonably anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare. Regulations that stem from statutory authority other than the CAA will likely not be affected by this proposal.

Written comments on the proposed rule must be received on or before September 21, 2025. Litigation surrounding the final rule is expected. Regulated parties should prepare for a period of substantial uncertainty in which federal GHG standards may be stayed, withdrawn, or revised, while state initiatives and market forces continue to advance GHG reduction efforts.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15759_5453.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 14:03:40.984932

Below is a summary of the major updates, with each section highlighting the core changes.

The Return of Bonus Depreciation and Other Big Deductions

The OBBBA permanently reinstates 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property placed in service after January 19, 2025, and increases the Section 179 expensing limit to $2.5 million. New options allow for 40% or 60% bonus depreciation in certain cases, and special rules apply for qualified production property. These incentives are designed to encourage business investment in equipment, machinery, and other properties.

One Big Beautiful Bill Act Increases Deduction for State and Local Tax but Fails to Address Nexus Concerns

Individual taxpayers benefit from a temporary increase in the SALT deduction cap, rising from $10,000 to $40,000, with a gradual phase-out for high-income earners. The cap increases by 1% annually until 2030, after which it reverts to $10,000. However, the Act does not address business state tax nexus concerns, leaving Public Law 86-272 unchanged.

Employee Retention Credit (ERC) Changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act: Some Disallowances, Six-Year Statute of Limitations and Expanded Penalties

The OBBBA disallows pending ERC claims submitted after January 31, 2024, for the third and fourth quarters of 2021, but leaves earlier claims intact. The statute of limitations for IRS audits on ERC claims is extended to six years, and new penalties apply for improper claims and due diligence failures by ERC promoters.

Qualified Small Business (1202) Stock: Easier to Qualify and Exit; Bigger Tax Savings

For new stock issuances, the QSBS exclusion under Section 1202 is expanded: the asset limit rises to $75 million, the exclusion phases in over three years (50% at year 3, 75% at year 4, 100% at year 5), and the gain exclusion cap increases to $15 million or 10x basis. These changes make QSBS more attractive for investors and business owners.

One Big Beautiful Bill Act Preserves Federal Tax Exemption for Municipal Bonds

The OBBBA preserves the federal tax exemption for municipal bonds and introduces several modifications, including a reduced threshold for 4% low-income housing tax credits, a new exempt facility bond category for spaceports, and changes to qualified small issue bonds.

The One Big Beautiful Bill’s New Qualified Opportunity Zones

The QOZ program is made permanent, with rolling 10-year designations and stricter requirements for low-income community qualifications. New rules introduce a rolling five-year deferral for capital gains, enhanced benefits for rural opportunity zones, and a 30-year cap on tax-free exit benefits. Reporting requirements are also heightened.

Piedmont Lithium Inc. (Nasdaq: PLL; ASX: PLL) is a U.S.-based lithium company aiming to become a key player in the North American electric vehicle (EV) battery supply chain. The company’s main asset is North American Lithium (NAL), a joint venture in Quebec churning out spodumene concentrate—essentially the starting material for lithium batteries. Piedmont also has a stake in Ghana’s Ewoyaa lithium project and is working on two fully integrated lithium hydroxide plants: Carolina Lithium in North Carolina and Tennessee Lithium in Tennessee. Piedmont makes money by selling spodumene concentrate both on spot markets and via contracts, with ambitions to move further down the supply chain and process its own battery-grade lithium hydroxide. The lithium industry is running fast, powered by booming EV demand—but it’s a wild ride, with price swings, supply hiccups, and a raft of new regulations (especially U.S. tax breaks favoring local battery materials). The big dogs Piedmont is up against include Albemarle and Livent on one side, plus up-and-comers like Sigma Lithium and Lithium Americas. Piedmont’s edge? They’re one of the few U.S.-based, vertically integrated lithium producers, bolstered by offtake deals (including Tesla) and U.S. government incentives, which help them secure long-term EV supply deals.

Recent Performance

From August 2, 2024 to August 2, 2025, Piedmont’s stock slid from $9.13 to $7.32—a loss of 19.8%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 climbed more than 16%, going from 5,346.56 to 6,238.01. Piedmont’s poor showing traces back to a dramatic slump in lithium prices driven by global oversupply and slower-than-hoped EV adoption. Worries have also piled up about how quickly they’re burning through cash and falling revenue (Q1 2025 pulled in $20 million, down from $45.6 million the previous quarter).

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Piedmont racked up record growth in 2024, with revenue jumping 150.8% to $99.9 million and spodumene shipments up 169.5% to 116,700 dmt. Q1 2025 stayed on track, shipping 27,000 dmt and targeting full-year shipments of 113,000–130,000 dmt. The growth engine here is clear: Carolina and Tennessee lithium hydroxide plants (each planning to produce 30,000 tons per year), the Ewoyaa project in Ghana, and the pending Sayona merger (expected to create Elevra Lithium). Strong and steady EV demand, reshoring of supply chains in North America, and U.S. tax credits should keep medium-term demand healthy.

Quality & Moat

Piedmont’s strengths are offset by some hefty weaknesses. The positives: they’ve struck strategic offtake agreements (think Tesla), have a proven asset in NAL, and secured key permits for their Carolina project—helped by growing U.S. interest in supply security. But on the downside, they posted a net loss of $56.8 million over the last twelve months and keep burning cash, with operating margins at –54.8% and returns on invested capital at –21.9%. The management has trimmed capital spending and raised cash by selling assets and equity, but delivering on new projects and smoothly merging with Sayona are still big hurdles.

Valuation

Piedmont’s stock is trading at a rock-bottom 0.33× EV/sales multiple, far below the market average of 4.43×. That steep discount reflects their current losses and the risks around their various new projects. Forward P/E isn’t even meaningful as they’re posting losses, compared to the market average of 24.96×. The deep discount might protect against further downside, but it only changes if Piedmont can rein in cash burn, get new plants up and running, and start delivering profits. Upcoming milestones—like plant progress and merger benefits—could be the triggers for a re-rating.

Market Sentiment

In the short run, Piedmont’s stock is up 9.6% on its 50-day trend, but it’s anything but calm—volatility is at 102%, compared to 23% for the average stock (the beta is 1.80). Short sellers are circling, with 9.7% of the float sold short. Analysts, for now, are sitting on the fence with a Hold consensus, though the average price target is $13.50 (that’s 117% potential upside) based on six analyst calls. Institutions are taking a wait-and-see approach, and insiders haven’t been active given the pending merger vote.

Key Risks

Commodity Price Volatility: Lithium prices have dropped more than 80% since late 2023 due to oversupply out of China and cooling EV demand. That’s squeezing Piedmont’s margins and cash flow.

High Cash Burn and Financing Risk: Piedmont is losing cash fast (FCF yield of –44.2%) and running operating losses, so they’ll need to keep raising funds, which could mean shareholder dilution or tougher debt terms.

Execution and Project Delays: Getting the Carolina and Tennessee lithium plants built and running on time is critical—any delays push back Piedmont’s path to profitability.

Merger Approval Uncertainty: The merger with Sayona is key for scaling up and getting synergies, but it needs shareholder and regulatory sign-off. Any hiccups could derail Piedmont’s plans.

Regulatory and Community Opposition: Local permit and environmental concerns (especially around water in Gaston County) could ramp up costs or delay operations.

Bull Case

Long-Term EV Demand: Forecasts suggest global EV adoption will keep growing at over 20% a year through 2030, which keeps lithium demand strong.

IRA-Driven Domestic Incentives: U.S. tax credits for domestic battery materials are a tailwind for American producers like Piedmont, improving the economics for new projects.

Undervalued on EV/Sales: With an EV/sales multiple at 0.33×—far lower than peers—Piedmont could see a lot of upside if it can stabilize and boost margins.

Merger Synergies: The Elevra Lithium merger could deliver $15–20 million in annual cost savings and provide more funding options for projects.

Robust Asset Pipeline: The Carolina and Tennessee projects aim to deliver 60,000 tons per year of lithium hydroxide, setting Piedmont up as a fully integrated supplier across the lithium chain.

Bear Case

Continued Price Downturn: If lithium remains oversupplied or EV sales keep missing expectations, Piedmont could be forced to sell below cost.

Cash Refinancing Needs: Heavy cash burn may mean regular dilutive share sales or expensive borrowing, which could hit shareholder value hard.

Negative Profitability: With operating margins still deep in the red at –54.8%, breakeven isn’t on the immediate horizon.

Merger Execution Risk: A cross-border merger and reverse stock split are complex and risky, and could distract management while they’re needed elsewhere.

Regulatory Delays: Permitting and local pushback could slow progress on the Carolina and Tennessee plants, which means waiting longer for new revenue streams.

On Our Radar

Special Stockholder Meeting: Meeting adjourned to August 11, 2025 for the Sayona merger vote—a quorum is still needed to close the deal.

Q2 2025 Earnings Release: Expected mid-August 2025 and should update the market on shipments, cash flow, and overall project momentum.

Merger Closing: Piedmont is targeting a mid-2025 close of the Elevra Lithium merger, if the votes and approvals come through.

Carolina Lithium FEED Study: Piedmont expects a final investment decision by late 2025, pending results of front-end engineering for the Carolina Lithium project.

Ewoyaa Permitting: Parliamentary ratification for the Ewoyaa mining lease in Ghana is expected in the second half of 2025.

Investment Conclusion

Piedmont Lithium is a classic high-risk, high-reward story. It looks undervalued on EV/sales and plays a strategic role in building out North America’s battery supply chain, which could pay off big if lithium markets bounce back and new plants start delivering. But right now, negative margins, rapid cash burn, tough project execution, and big open questions about the Sayona merger all pose real risks. Long-term investors with a healthy appetite for risk might see the current share price and discounted valuation as a rare opportunity—but only if they’re prepared to keep a close eye on project milestones, merger approvals, and where lithium prices go from here.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-08-02 06:00:10.968103

*** Giulia Mannarino of Belleville, is a grandmother concerned about her two granddaughters’ futures and a member of Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action.","It’s exciting that one of the world’s largest solar microgrid and storage projects is currently under construction and located in West (by God) Virginia! The “Canary Solar Grid” project in Jackson County, just outside of Ravenswood, will help power a titanium manufacturing facility. A solar microgrid is an innovative, popular energy technology that’s giving businesses and communities access to cleaner and more reliable power. Energy generated by the solar array can be stored in a battery storage system for use during times when the sun doesn’t shine. This project is notable as one of the first where a large industrial plant is directly powered by a solar-plus-storage microgrid. It’s also supporting and strengthening domestic renewable energy initiatives and supply chains; 100% of the solar panels are sourced and manufactured in Ohio, and 100% of the steel used is made in the U.S. The project is a collaborative effort between BHE Renewables and Precision Castparts Corp.(PCC), specifically their Titanium Metals Corporation facility (TIMET). The companies are part of the Berkshire Hathaway diverse portfolio of businesses.

For 50 years, the 2,000 acre site was home to Century Aluminum. Their giant smelter was idled in 2009 and permanently closed in 2015. Since then the site has been an empty expanse along the Ohio River. Now PCC has started construction on the facility that will melt titanium while BHE Renewables is installing arrays of solar panels and large battery systems, which will form the microgrid that connects to the titanium facility. Demand for titanium products is rising in the U.S., driven largely by the aerospace and defense industries. As a metal, titanium is twice as strong as aluminum and weighs nearly half as much as steel, while still having a similar strength. It is durable, highly corrosion-resistant and used in industrial applications such as airplane wings and military armor as well as high-end consumer products like golf clubs and iPhones. Many people have titanium fused into their bodies, in the form of joint replacements, dental implants, and pacemakers. Transforming titanium minerals into a sturdy metal requires enormous amounts of electricity. The solar-plus-battery system will provide the reliable power supply the melting furnaces require at a cost that compares to traditional power sources.

The cost of building the solar microgrid system is eligible for investment tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law in August of 2022. The IRA provisions included clean energy production initiatives that addressed the crisis of global warming by helping the U.S. reach critical climate emissions goals of the Paris Agreement. BHE Renewables is constructing the microgrid in phases that match TIMET’s energy needs as it develops and operates its facility. Initially, the melting plant is expected to need around 18 megawatts of power to operate before ramping up to its full capacity by the end of 2027. The first phase began operations in May 2025 when the first solar microgrid panels were installed at the Ravenswood Business Park. Each phase contains part of the solar array and part of the battery system. PCC will have their TIMET facility use the solar energy to produce titanium products, creating the start of an industrial hub. It’s designed to serve 70% of TIMET’s expected energy demand. When fully built, the BHE Renewables project will include a 106 MW solar array and a battery energy storage system with a capacity of 50 MW, or 260.5 megawatt-hours. The project is expected to be a model for future industrial facilities seeking to utilize renewable energy.

Another company based in Michigan, ONE (Our Next Energy), will also be building a new factory on the site. ONE debuted a new utility scale battery storage system in February 2023 and will make the batteries the BHE Renewables facility will need right on site. And the company will continue to manufacture their utility scale battery storage system to market to other interested businesses. The batteries deploy lithium iron phosphate technology, a lower-cost chemistry that’s catching on for stationary storage. This project may be the first to show that a microgrid can meet an industrial customer’s demands as well as create economic revitalization through manufacturing without polluting the environment. With all of West Virginia’s members of Congress racing backwards towards the fossil Fool industry, my hope is more solar projects will materialize in our state’s future.

When Will Haseltine saw images online of a small, boxy electric pickup from startup Slate Auto this past spring, he got on the waitlist right away. The sparse interior and crank windows reminded him of the no-frills pickups he grew up around in Memphis, Tennessee – but he was most enamored with the sub-$20,000 price tag.

That price, though, factored in a $7,500 federal tax break, which is set to expire Sept. 30, a casualty of the budget package U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this month. Now Haseltine isn’t sure the truck will fit his budget when it comes out, expected late next year.

“The Slate was the first time that I looked at a car, wanted it, and could also really make it happen,” said Haseltine, a 39-year-old musical instrument technician. Without the tax credit, he said: “That’s just plain too much.”

Michigan-based Slate has raised $700 million from investors, including founder Jeff Bezos, and has racked up more than 100,000 reservations for its cars. But the company is launching into a tough U.S. market.

A few years ago, the electric-vehicle space was awash in hopeful entrepreneurs looking to cash in on the global transition to electric cars. But U.S. EV sales growth has cooled as consumer interest has faded. The loss of federal tax breaks will further hurt demand, auto executives and analysts predict.

Like other EV startups, Slate likely faces a long road to profitability. The EV business has proven to be a money loser for most industry players, partly because batteries remain relatively expensive. Even in China, where smaller, inexpensive EVs have proliferated and companies enjoy a cost advantage over Western automakers, most are unprofitable.

Slate founders believe the company can overcome those obstacles by offering something that is in short supply in today’s U.S. car market: affordability. The average new-vehicle selling price is above $45,000.

“We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never delivered,” Slate CEO Chris Barman said at a Detroit conference in July.

The company has a chance to fill a void left by Tesla, which has backtracked on plans to introduce a mid-$20,000s electric vehicle.

The startup has taken a bare-bones approach to its two-seat pickup, which is slightly smaller than a Honda Civic hatchback. How bare-bones? A stereo and power windows will cost extra. Slate hasn’t disclosed the cost of such add-ons.

‘IT’S A COOL IDEA’

Slate’s creation started with an idea from Miles Arnone, the CEO of Re:Build Manufacturing, a Massachusetts-based startup that includes several former Amazon employees. Arnone believed workers needed better access to affordable vehicles.

Arnone shared his idea with Jeff Wilke, the company’s chairman and a former Amazon executive, and eventually, a small team was formed. The group hired Barman, who spent most of her career as an engineering executive at Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis.

Barman told Reuters recently that Slate will be able to absorb the loss of the $7,500 tax credit because the truck’s price still will undercut competitors.

The company plans to build the pickup at an old catalog factory in Warsaw, Indiana. Executives are taking steps to hold down costs, starting with a simplified design that uses about 500 parts in the truck’s assembly, compared with a few thousand for a traditional truck.

The plan to build all of its trucks in a basic package – what the company calls a “SKU of one” – allows customers to choose to add a stereo, center console, special lighting, and other features later.

The pickup will be built with composite body panels in gray, with an option for a vinyl wrap. That will sidestep the need for a paint shop, which is one of the most expensive investments in a typical car factory.

Slate’s minimalist approach is a leap of faith that Americans will forgo creature comforts they have been increasingly willing to splurge on. Last year, U.S. buyers spent 33% above the base price on average, springing for higher-end trim packages and extra features, according to . That was up from 28% in 2014.

But there is mounting evidence that new cars are becoming out of reach for many Americans. That could worsen under the effects of the Trump administration’s tariffs, which threaten to increase prices on popular budget cars imported from Mexico, Korea and elsewhere.

From that standpoint, Slate’s price-conscious pickup might be hitting at the right time, said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific.

“There’s a growing appetite, especially among younger drivers, for vehicles that are more honest, more modular and less over-engineered,” he said. “Slate taps right into that.”

Traditional automakers and startups have found mixed success rolling out larger electric pickup trucks in recent years. Now, startups like Slate and California-based Telo are focusing on smaller electric pickups.

In a town hall meeting in early May, Ford CEO Jim Farley and Executive Chair Bill Ford told employees they admired the company’s customer-centered ethos and focus on affordability.

Tim Kuniskis, Stellantis’ head of American brands, called Slate “super interesting” at a June event, while also questioning how affordable it would be for some shoppers once they added all the options they wanted.

“The idea behind it, we’ve talked about that idea a million times,” he said. “It’s a cool idea.”",https://arizonadigitalfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-07-28T102100Z_1_LYNXMPEL6R0FH_RTROPTP_4_AUTOS-SLATE.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 01:01:04.681523

CEO Darren Woods said a final investment decision (FID) for the US major's giant blue hydrogen and blue ammonia project in Baytown, Texas, which is expected by the end of the year, could be postponed.

“It’s a little early to tell, but that’s, I think, certainly a strong possibility,” he said during the company’s second-quarter earnings call on Friday.

Woods added that Exxon has seen ""mixed progress"" at the ambitious Baytown development while stressing the overall complexity of the project, which will require the simultaneous development of supply, demand and supportive policy to be viable.

Progress on those fronts has not been smooth lately, particularly when it comes to fundamentals, according to Woods.

“If we can't see an eventual path to a market-driven business, we won't move forward with the project,"" he said.

Exxon expects its Baytown project to produce around 1 billion cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen — made with natural gas and carbon capture — which would make it the largest low-carbon hydrogen project in the world, as well as 1 million tons per year of blue ammonia.

Clean hydrogen, ammonia and lithium are at the core of up to $30 billion in “low-emission opportunities” through 2030 that the company has identified.

Policy Changes

On the supply side, Exxon cited complications stemming from the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which revises clean energy tax credits that were originally established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

“We were disappointed that under the recently approved '45V' tax credit [for clean hydrogen production], timing for start-up of construction was shortened from 2033 to the beginning of 2028,” Woods said. “While our project can meet this timeline, we're concerned about the development of a broader market, which is critical to transition [away] from government incentives.""

Exxon is now evaluating if the combination of “45Q” tax credits for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the shortened 45V qualification window will provide the support needed for a low-carbon hydrogen market to grow.

Looking for Buyers

On the demand side, Exxon is working on translating the heads of agreement it signed with French commodities trader Trammo, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., Japanese trading house Mitsubishi, as well as Jera, Japan’s largest utility, into firm sales contracts. The major signed its first firm offtake deal with Japanese firm Marubeni in May.

However, the cost of clean hydrogen and ammonia remains a challenge for offtakers that have access to cheaper alternatives like natural gas.

“We haven't landed that,” Woods said, adding that Exxon won’t take FID on Baytown until it has signed enough offtake agreements that make it confident in the project's returns.

“We knew that helping to establish a brand-new product in a brand-new market, initially driven by government policy, would not be easy or advanced in a straight line,” he said. “It's why we focused on low-carbon opportunities aligned with our existing capabilities and advantages.""

Lithium

Woods suggested that the company's production of lithium from brine in southwestern Arkansas could also be pushed, as lowering the cost of direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology could take longer than initially anticipated.

Exxon is looking to lower its DLE costs so that it can be “very competitive” in the global marketplace, particularly compared to Chinese lithium producers.

The first phase of Exxon's Pine Unit lithium extraction project is slated to come on stream in 2027 with a production capacity of 165,000 barrels per day of brine and 18,100 tons/yr of lithium.

Exxon said in the past that it sees the opportunity to produce enough lithium to supply 1 million electric vehicles annually by 2030.

Woods said Exxon has made “great progress” on CCS, one of its key low-carbon initiatives, and highlighted the company's current developments as “some of the lowest-cost in the country.""

The US is the world's largest exporter of LNG and July's output was its third highest on record. This year the US has seen three of its highest ever monthly LNG production figures, according to LSEG data.

US LNG shipments could have been higher had its third- largest export facility, Freeport LNG, not experienced several unplanned outages, reporting seven power outages at its plants to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality during the month of July. Its output fell in July to 1.3 mt from 1.4 mt in June, LSEG data showed.

The US could double its LNG export capacity by 2030, based on projects already under construction and expected to get the financial greenlight as the industry builds momentum following US President Donald's Trump's vow to bolster the country's energy industry. This week Venture Global gave a positive final investment decision for its massive 28 million mtpa CP2 facility in Louisiana.

In July, Plaquemines, also in Louisiana, exported 1.4 mt of LNG, compared to 1.2 mt in June, helping the US get to 9.1 mt in July, compared to 8.4 mt in June, LSEG data showed.

Gas prices fall in Europe and Asia

European gas prices fell in July to $11.56 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) from $12.38 per mmBtu in June at the European benchmark Title Transfer Facility in the Netherlands, according to LSEG data.

Even so, the softer prices were not enough to deter US LNG exports to Europe, which remained the favored destination. Some 5.25 mt of LNG, or just under 58 per cent of July's total, headed to Europe during July, slightly lower than the 5.53 mt, or 66 per cent, sold in June, LSEG data showed.

US exports to Europe could increase in the coming years following a trade deal earlier this week in which the European Union promised to buy $750 billion of US energy over a five-year period.

In July, gas prices were also lower in Asia, as the benchmark Japan Korea Marker fell to $12.18 per mmBtu from $12.90 per mmBtu in June.

Exports to Asia rose slightly during the month to 1.8 mt, or 20 per cent, of US LNG exports in July, compared to 1.56 mt, or 19 per cent, in June as demand for energy for cooling grew, according to LSEG data.

""After lackluster Asian LNG demand for much of 2025 so far, hotter July weather drove some improvement,"" bankers from Morgan Stanley told its clients in a report on Wednesday.

US sells more LNG closer to home

US LNG exports to South America grew in July as the continent faced colder-than-normal seasonal weather. The US sold 1.03 mt, or 11 per cent of its total LNG exports, to Latin America, with cargoes going to Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Chile. Cargoes were also sold to several Caribbean countries, including Jamaica, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.

Egypt continued to import US LNG cargoes, buying eight in July, totaling 0.59 mt. There were also six cargoes with 0.43 mt of LNG that left US ports in July with no clear destination, signaling they were available for orders.

In July, Canada saw its first LNG shipment from a major plant, with the start-up of LNG Canada in Kitimat, British Columbia. That facility is the first North American plant with direct access to the Pacific Ocean and a shorter sail time to Asia.

It’s part of a broader national trend in which AI infrastructure is accelerating faster than energy systems can adapt, posing new challenges for utilities, governments, and consumers.

As AI model training and inferencing become increasingly resource-intensive, large-scale data centers are reshaping America’s energy and water usage. Industry estimates suggest data centers already account for 4.4% of US electricity consumption and could reach 12% by 2028. Some utilities warn that national electricity demand may rise as much as 50% within five years, with no state currently positioned to manage that level of growth.

AI infrastructure is outpacing utility capacity

Some of the new AI data centers being planned include one-gigawatt facilities, which is enough to power every home in a major US city like Philadelphia. Power consumption per AI query is also substantially higher than traditional internet use. A typical ChatGPT request uses approximately 2.9 watt-hours of electricity, compared to 0.3 watt-hours for a standard web search.

The growing energy burden is already prompting shifts in utility strategy. Pacific Gas & Electric, for instance, reversed plans to retire three coal plants. Grid operators in Texas have issued emergency alerts in anticipation of rising demand.

Meanwhile, Wyoming has emerged as a key location for new infrastructure due to its geographic stability and connectivity to the national internet backbone via Interstate 80. Companies including Microsoft and Meta are expanding in the state. Meta’s planned 900-acre hyperscale data center near Cheyenne is expected to come online within three years.

Water use raises new resource concerns

AI-related energy consumption is only part of the infrastructure equation; water usage is also a growing concern, especially in drought-prone regions. Many AI data centers use evaporative cooling systems, which require significant water resources. Estimates suggest each facility may use 2 million liters of water per day — roughly the equivalent of daily consumption for 6,500 US households.

This is particularly challenging for Western states like Nevada, Utah, and Colorado, where water is already scarce. In Nevada’s Reno area, for example, projected energy demand could require a 40% expansion of the state’s electricity sector within a decade. Colorado’s Front Range is planning to triple data center capacity, with a single new facility expected to draw 160 megawatts — surpassing even steel plants and mining operations in total electricity use.

Costs and emissions may fall to consumers

The economic and environmental impacts of this growth are significant. Data centers in the US may soon use more power than entire countries; one estimate compares their future energy footprint to Poland’s total consumption in 2023. Amazon alone could consume up to 48 terawatt-hours per year if it follows through on all planned facilities, and that roughly matches Nevada’s total electricity use last year.

States are beginning to respond. Utah recently passed Senate Bill 132 to develop alternative energy provisions for high-demand customers. Still, meeting the infrastructure requirements could cost up to $2 trillion by 2030. The resulting power generation is projected to cause $5.7 to $9.2 billion per year in public health-related costs due to increased emissions.

These costs are expected to be passed on to consumers through higher utility bills and environmental tradeoffs. As AI continues to expand across sectors, its energy footprint may soon impact every household — not just through digital services, but on monthly energy statements.",https://assets.techrepublic.com/uploads/2025/07/power-plant-photo-unsplash-1494818889428-42c443ab9f69-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-02 06:58:55.694212

But keep in mind, this has nothing directly to do with Social Security benefits.","At 887 pages, it certainly is one big bill, but as Margaret Wolfe Hungerford wrote, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.”

U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, is quoted as saying, “If everybody draws a red line, you end up with a maze.”

Everybody got a little piece under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and nobody got all they wanted. The compromises needed to get consensus from deficit hard-liners, Medicaid defenders, the SALT caucus and Inflation Reduction Act protectors created a confusing hodgepodge of provisions. I confess that I have not read the entire 887 pages, but I have read countless summaries and sat in on webinars reviewing the provisions. Each webinar has had a different emphasis on various provisions, and here are a few that I found most interesting or confusing.

Tax Cut and Jobs Act

Passed in 2017 during the first Trump administration, it had provisions that were set to expire at the end of this year. The OBBBA made a lot of those provisions permanent.

◗ Tax rates: The lower individual income tax rates and tax brackets that were implemented temporarily have been made permanent.

◗ Standard deduction: 70% of filers used the standard deduction. After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was implemented and the standard deduction was significantly increased, that percentage rose to around 90%. The OBBBA makes the increase permanent.

◗ Estate and gift tax exemption:

OBBBA permanently extends the estate and lifetime gift tax exemption, and effective in 2026, increases the exemption amount to $15 million for single filers and $30 million for those married filing jointly.

◗ Child tax credit:

Increased from $2,000 to $2,200 and will be inflation adjusted. There are also strict Social Security number requirements to qualify.

◗ Alternative minimum tax:

A parallel tax system designed to ensure that certain high-income taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of tax. Before TCJA, there were over 5 million filers. The TCJA decreased that to about 200,000; the figure is expected to remain there under the new OBBBA provisions.

New deductions

◗ Tips and overtime: No tax, but there are restrictions on who qualifies and caps on deductions.

◗ Charitable contribution deduction for those who don’t itemize:

You are allowed to deduct up to $1,000 for a single taxpayer or $2,000 for joint returns

◗ Enhanced senior deduction:

Temporary $6,000 deduction per qualified senior age 65 and older. This is in place for tax years 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028. This amount is phased out for higher-income individuals. President Trump proposed eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits as part of his 2024 campaign. This provision is a way to meet Trump’s pledge.

Currently, 64% of seniors do not pay taxes on Social Security. This provision would increase that to 88%. Contrary to a communication by the Social Security Administration, this exemption is not tied to being a Social Security recipient. Those claiming Social Security before age 65 do not receive the credit, and those who are over 65 but not claiming benefits are still eligible for the deduction. For example, a married couple filing jointly for tax year 2025 will have a standard deduction of $31,500. In addition, there is no change to the extra standard deduction of $1,600 if they are age 65 or older, or $3,200 for the couple.

Then, the budget bill gives each spouse an additional deduction of $6,000, or $12,000 for both, which would be available even for those who itemize their other deductions. Thus, for tax year 2025, a senior couple would owe no tax on their first $46,700 of income. But keep in mind, this has nothing directly to do with Social Security benefits. It lowers taxable income for all income tax purposes.

The latest SSA communication and additional rhetoric regarding this $6,000 senior deduction might raise false hope for many seniors.
