Companies that make solar power components in the United States are still positioned to benefit from tax policy and tariffs, despite the Trump administration’s aversion to renewable energy.

Some big manufacturers, such as First Solar and Hanwha Qcells, are expanding, while smaller players also see opportunities.

Among the new names is T1 Energy, a solar company based in Austin, Texas, which said this month that it was forming a partnership with Corning Inc. of New York to set up a supply chain in which nearly all components would be produced in this country. T1 is part of a cluster of businesses that are helping to make Texas a leader in solar manufacturing.

“No country ever wants to be totally dependent on imported energy,” said Russell Gold, an executive vice president of communications for T1 and a former journalist reporting on energy for publications including Texas Monthly and The Wall Street Journal. “When you’re talking about solar manufacturing, we’re building the oil and gas fields of the future.”

The emergence of T1, which until recently was called Freyr Battery, is part of a broader trend of many companies aiming to meet the growing demand for solar power while also navigating complex tax credits and tariffs.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed in July, did little to change tax credits for manufacturers, maintaining a 2030 phaseout for manufacturing tax credits. This was in contrast to the bill’s rapid phaseout of other clean energy credits.

One caveat is that the bill contains restrictions on using components that come from “prohibited foreign entities,” which is mainly aimed at stopping credits from going to China. The Trump administration has not yet released guidance on how it will interpret this part of the bill, which leaves uncertainty for projects that rely on the manufacturing credits.

On top of recent legislation, the Trump administration’s ever-changing tariffs provide additional reasons for companies to want to develop U.S.-based supply chains.

But the United States has a long way to go to become a serious competitor in solar manufacturing. China dominates global production of solar panels and the major components that they’re built with. Chinese companies have many of the latest technologies and economies of scale, making it difficult for anyone else to compete.

The world’s six largest solar panel manufacturers, ranked by gigawatts of annual production, are based in China, according to BloombergNEF. The seventh is Canadian Solar, with headquarters in Kitchener, Ontario, and the eighth is First Solar, based in Tempe, Arizona.

Setting up a supply chain doesn’t happen quickly or easily, said Antoine Vagneur-Jones, head of trade and supply chains for the research firm BloombergNEF. He anticipates that many solar companies will face technical challenges as they try to secure supplies of polysilicon and other materials.

“People are being rightly skeptical, given that this is something that’s quite new in the U.S.,” he said.

The solar supply chain has several main operations, which often take place in separate plants, starting with the processing of polysilicon to turn it into a form that can be used on solar cells. Next is the manufacturing of solar cells, which are small squares with polysilicon across their surface. A manufacturer also needs suppliers for glass, racking and electronic equipment.

The final step is assembling the parts into a finished panel, something that Vagneur-Jones likens to putting together Ikea furniture.

Vagneur-Jones thinks First Solar is well-positioned because it has decades of history producing solar panels in the United States and managing a supply chain. The company expects its U.S. factories will have the capacity to build 14 gigawatts of solar panels per year by the end of 2026. This is at three plants in Ohio, one in Alabama and one that is about to open in Louisiana.

“It’s important to recognize the fact that we’ve got some manufacturers who are planning things that can be taken relatively more seriously than others,” he said.

He also sees potential for success with Hanwha Qcells, a South Korean solar manufacturer that has operated in Dalton, Georgia, since 2019 and is working on a large expansion in the state.

Beyond the major players, he sees many smaller companies that are at earlier stages of their development, and he said it will take time to know which ones will emerge as success stories.

T1 fits into this category of newer, smaller companies that are planning to ramp up production and build U.S.-based supply chains.

Until a rebranding was announced in February, T1 was called Freyr Battery. The company, with roots in Norway, planned to open a U.S. battery plant in Georgia. Then, it scrapped the Georgia plans and said it was focusing on solar manufacturing, initially at a panel plant near Dallas, which it bought from a Chinese company.

T1 announced in March that it was building a plant in Rockdale, Texas, which is about 60 miles northeast of Austin. The plant would have the capacity to build 5 gigawatts of solar cells, which are thin squares covered with processed silicon. A typical solar panel has dozens of solar cells across its surface.

The partnership with Corning illustrates how T1 plans to build a supply chain.

T1 will use polysilicon processed at a Corning plant in Michigan, starting in the second half of 2026. The material will then be delivered to T1’s planned cell manufacturing plant in Rockdale before going to T1’s Dallas plant for final assembly as solar panels.

The partnership would support about 5,800 new jobs, according to T1 and Corning.

“This landmark supply chain agreement with Corning will help invigorate America with scalable, reliable, low-cost energy,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1’s chairman and CEO, in a statement. “This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security. The U.S. needs to establish critical energy supply chains built on domestic capacity and industrial know-how.”

T1 is part of a growing cluster of solar manufacturing businesses in Texas.

Texas has 18 solar component facilities online, more than any other state, according to a May report from the American Clean Power Association, a trade group. If all announced projects get built across the country, Texas would still be the leader, with 26, followed by Ohio, with 16, and Alabama, with 9, the report said.

For example, Canadian Solar built a module manufacturing facility in Mesquite, Texas, that was announced in 2023 and completed last year and has 5 gigawatts of production capacity.

While renewable energy is sometimes partisan, with Trump and many Republicans criticizing it, the Canadian Solar announcement in 2023 included supportive comments from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz.

“Texas is an energy production powerhouse, and we embrace an all-of-the-above energy strategy,” Cruz said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/G1_Dallas_2_hires-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 06:00:14.759354

Fatih Birol, secretary-general of the International Energy Agency (IEA), a world-renowned energy expert, responded to the question of ""the energy policy that the new government of Korea should focus on."" South Korea's energy policy has taken a step toward the Moon Jae In government's 'de-nuclear power plant' and the Yoon Suk Yeol government's 'de-nuclear power plant'.

Secretary-General Birol advised in a interview with Maeil Business Newspaper on the 29th of last month, ""The Korean government should pursue a balanced energy policy in the long run."" ""The biggest headache has been the shaking of energy policies and excessive politicization of energy as governments change and international disputes entangle,"" he said, as the head of the IEA for the 10th year this year. ""We expect energy to be treated as an economic problem, not politics.""

He positively evaluated the energy policy direction of the Lee Jae-myung administration, which brought up the ""energy mix"" instead of the nuclear power plant. Secretary-General Birol said, ""It is positive that the current government has expressed its willingness to promote a balanced energy mix without forgetting the importance of nuclear power, which is essential to the Korean economy,"" adding, ""We hope that not only traditional nuclear power plants but also small module reactors (SMR) will be introduced in Korea soon.""

Birol also gave great significance to recent moves to cooperate with Korea on nuclear power. This is because the U.S., which has original nuclear power plant technology, and South Korea, which has strengths in large nuclear power plant projects based on construction and operation capabilities, can meet and create synergy.

""The U.S. is leading innovation, especially in the small module reactor (SMR), which has the advantage of flexible deployment and low initial cost,"" he said. ""Korea has a more stable construction track record in terms of budget and schedule than the U.S. or Europe."" KPMG predicts that the SMR market will grow to 300 billion dollars (418 trillion won) by 2040.

In particular, Secretary-General Birol predicted that the Korea-U.S. nuclear power plant alliance will bring about a major change in the global nuclear power plant export landscape. ""Of the 52 nuclear power plants that began between 2207 and 2024, 25 were designed by China and 23 were designed by Russia,"" he said. ""Korea-U.S. cooperation can also contribute to diversifying the nuclear power market and will be a very attractive option for countries seeking to introduce new nuclear power plants such as Southeast Asia.""

Secretary-General Birol observed that Korea could find new opportunities amid the spread of artificial intelligence (AI) and the acceleration of energy transition. ""The clean energy technology manufacturing market is currently worth 700 billion dollars (975 trillion won), but it will grow to 2 trillion dollars (2,788 trillion won) over the next 10 years, which is equivalent to the global crude oil market,"" he said. ""Korea can contribute to the diversification of supply chains around the world and is in a position to enjoy economic benefits in the process.""

""South Korea is one of the few leaders in the global battery supply chain except China,"" he said. ""We will be able to fully expand our leadership to key power grid equipment such as transformers and cables.""

Secretary-General Birol predicted that stable power supply and flexible power grid systems are essential for Korea to take the lead in the global AI competition. From this point of view, he gave a positive evaluation to the 'energy highway' promoted by the Lee Jae-myung government.

Secretary-General Birol said, ""What I felt in common with leaders from around the world, including Europe, the United States, Africa, and Latin America, was the lack of transmission networks around the world. It is a great decision for the Korean government to accurately diagnose this problem and expand the transmission network to smoothly supply all electricity, including renewable energy, to consumers.""

""It is difficult to choose a country that has enough power generation and transmission networks at the same time,"" he said. ""I hope that the energy highway will be realized as soon as possible and Korea will become a role model.""

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) confirmed authorization for the Rio Grande LNG project developed by NextDecade, while the Department of Energy (DOE) granted Commonwealth LNG a license to export to non-free trade agreement countries, valid through 2050. These approvals provide a full regulatory framework as the developers approach critical deadlines for their Final Investment Decisions (FIDs).

Rio Grande LNG: validated expansion and tight timeline

Rio Grande LNG, located in Brownsville, Texas, already has a first phase of 17.5 million tons per year under construction. The project aims for a total capacity of about 27 million tons per year with two additional trains. Bechtel, in charge of engineering and construction, has set a price validity deadline of September 15, 2025, placing NextDecade under time pressure for its FID. The project will be supplied by the Rio Bravo pipeline, operated by Enbridge, designed to transport up to 4.5 billion cubic feet per day from Agua Dulce.

On the commercial side, Train 4 is fully covered with 4.6 million tons per year of contracts split between Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), Saudi Aramco, and TotalEnergies. Train 5 has begun commercialization with a firm 2.0 million tons per year agreement signed with JERA Co., Inc. These long-term commitments, together with equity contributions, strengthen the bankability of the expansion.

Commonwealth LNG: DOE authorization and strategic contracts

Commonwealth LNG, based in Louisiana, has secured its final DOE export authorization to non-free trade agreement countries. The project targets 9.5 million tons per year of capacity with six modular SnapLNG trains designed by Technip Energies. First LNG delivery is expected in 2029, subject to an investment decision in 2025.

The company has secured about 4 million tons per year in long-term agreements: 1 million with JERA, 1 million with Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS), and 2 million with Glencore International AG. Glencore has also entered into a gas supply agreement with Kimmeridge’s upstream unit based on international netback pricing, aligning feedstock costs with export sales. The developer has also requested approval for preliminary site work to accelerate execution after FID.

Market context and U.S. FID wave

These advances come as several U.S. projects have already reached final investment decisions this year, including Venture Global’s CP2 LNG Phase 1 (14.4 million tons per year), Cheniere’s Corpus Christi expansion (5 million tons per year), and Woodside’s Louisiana LNG project (16.5 million tons per year). These milestones highlight the trajectory of the United States toward a new large-scale liquefaction wave.

Spot reference prices remain favorable: around $10.7 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in Europe and about $11.2/MMBtu for the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) in Asia at the end of August.

We will showcase our expertise in low-carbon project delivery, including the e-drive systems, renewable energy integration, and modular construction.","In an exclusive interview, Rob Shaul, Senior Vice President of Low Carbon Solutions at McDermott, outlines the company’s strategy to enable a sustainable energy future. From pioneering low-emission LNG infrastructure to delivering global megaprojects using modular construction and renewable-powered e-drive systems, Shaul explains how McDermott is addressing the energy trilemma: energy security, affordability, and sustainability.

How critical is the role of natural gas and LNG in supporting the energy transition and ensuring energy security?

Natural gas and LNG are absolutely essential to the global energy transition. While carbon-free energy production is the ultimate goal, natural gas plays a critical role in achieving interim decabonisation milestones, such as net-zero. That’s where LNG comes in. It is widely considered a bridge fuel that provides energy security and a reliable, lower-emission alternative to coal and oil, while bridging the gap as renewable and other carbon-free infrastructure continues to scale up.

At McDermott, we support this transition by delivering full project lifecycle services from concept to commissioning and fully integrated engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction (EPFC) solutions designed to reduce emissions and improve efficiency across the LNG value chain. For example:

Low-carbon LNG facilities: McDermott is pioneering the development of LNG plants with up to 95% reduction in operational emissions and 65% reduction in construction-related emissions.

Modular execution: Our modular fabrication approach optimises plot plan space, provides execution certainty and reduces the carbon footprint associated with traditional construction.

E-drive systems: By integrating electric drive systems powered by renewable energy, McDermott’s LNG solutions can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95% compared to gas turbine-driven LNG facilities.

Global reach and scalability: With strategically located fabrication yards and execution offices, we optimise delivery based on regional priorities, ensuring efficiency and sustainability.

Could you give us an overview of your project pipeline and recent milestones?

One of our key projects is the Woodfibre LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada, which is set to be among the world’s lowest-emission LNG plants. Using imported hydroelectric power, a renewable source, the project significantly reduces emissions and exemplifies our commitment to low-carbon delivery through modularisation and integrated project execution.

We are also nearing completion of the first LNG train at the Golden Pass LNG Export Project in Sabine Pass, Texas, with Trains 2 and 3 to follow. The project represents over 15 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG capacity. Once complete, it will bring McDermott’s total large-scale LNG trains delivered on the US Gulf Coast to nine —the second most of any contractor. It demonstrates our ability to execute some of the world’s largest and most complex projects.

Beyond Woodfibre and Golden Pass, McDermott has a strong global LNG portfolio. At Freeport LNG, our team and its joint venture partners delivered three pre-treatment trains, a liquefaction facility with three trains, a second loading berth, and a 165,000 m3 full-containment LNG tank. Each LNG train at the Freeport LNG facility produces around 5.1 Mtpa of LNG and incorporates cutting-edge e-drive systems, including the world’s largest electric motor-driven refrigeration compressors—three 75 MW electric motors per train, which significantly improves North America’s energy export capabilities.

These e-drive systems offer significant benefits: reduced emissions, faster restarts, increased operating flexibility, and improved year-round efficiency.

What are the ways in which your company is powering a sustainable future?

McDermott is leveraging its global scale and breadth of capabilities to support decarbonisation across the energy industry. In addition to e-drive systems powered by renewable energy in LNG facilities, we are also focusing on other critical low-carbon focus areas including HVDC substations for offshore wind; low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia; carbon capture and utilisation; and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Currently, McDermott is delivering Europe’s first green steel project for Stegra in Boden, Sweden, and executing FEEDs (front-end engineering design) for Clean Hydrogen Work’s Ascension Clean Energy blue ammonia project in Louisiana and the Exploits Valley Renewable Energy Complex (EVREC) in Newfoundland.

What key messages do you want to highlight at Gastech 2025, and what are you planning to showcase at the show?

At Gastech 2025, McDermott will highlight our leadership in delivering sustainable LNG, hydrogen and ammonia solutions through advanced technologies and integrated project execution.

We will showcase our expertise in low-carbon project delivery, including the e-drive systems, renewable energy integration, and modular construction. Visitors to booth M30 can learn how we are addressing the energy trilemma, and balancing energy security, affordability and sustainability through practical, scalable solutions.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/w0shxpcc/woodfibre-lng-module-02_2.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134008441934670000,N,,2025-09-01 04:02:55.535586

The phase-out of federal EV tax credits by September 30, 2025, has created a short-term tailwind for Q3 sales, but the underlying trend is concerning. U.S. EV sales in Q2 2025 fell 6.3% year-over-year, with Tesla’s 46% share masking a broader industry slowdown [1]. Competitors like BYD and Xiaomi are gaining traction in China, while Audi and BMW are reclaiming European ground [5]. This suggests that Tesla’s early-mover advantage is eroding as the EV market matures and competition intensifies.

Autonomous Driving: A Lifeline or a Liability?

Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology remains its most ambitious bet for long-term growth. The company’s camera-only approach, while cost-effective, has drawn criticism for lacking redundancy compared to LiDAR-based systems used by Waymo and GM [4]. Consumer sentiment is mixed: 35% of U.S. buyers view FSD as a deterrent, while only 14% see it as a draw [1]. Regulatory hurdles, including a $329 million verdict in a Miami Autopilot-related accident, further complicate deployment [4].

Yet, the potential rewards are vast. The global autonomous vehicle market is projected to reach $2.3 trillion by 2030, with Level 4/5 AVs dominating 60% of sales [5]. Tesla’s FSD v14 update, expected to boost AI model parameters tenfold, could position it as a leader in this space [1]. The company’s Dojo supercomputer and Optimus humanoid project also hint at a broader AI-driven ecosystem, potentially diversifying revenue beyond EVs [6].

The Robotaxi Race: Tesla vs. Waymo

Tesla’s planned robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, highlights its aggressive timeline, but it lags behind Waymo’s 10 million paid rides and 0.41 accidents per million miles [4]. Waymo’s multi-sensor stack and regulatory compliance give it an edge in markets prioritizing safety. Tesla, however, aims to leverage its massive fleet for data training and a ride-hailing network, mirroring Uber or Airbnb [1]. This “democratization” of autonomy could disrupt mobility-as-a-service, but regulatory delays in Europe and China remain a wildcard [4].

Financial Realities and Investor Sentiment

Tesla’s U.S. brand desirability has dropped from 38% to 29%, reflecting waning consumer enthusiasm [5]. While FSD revenue hit $326 million in Q3 2024, this pales against the company’s $2.5 million vehicle production target for 2025 [2]. Analysts are split: some see recurring revenue from autonomy and AI as a growth catalyst, while others warn of short-term cash burn amid rising R&D costs [1].

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on the Future

Tesla’s sales slump is a warning sign for the near term, but its long-term viability hinges on its ability to monetize autonomy. The company’s AI-driven innovations and robotaxi ambitions align with a $2.3 trillion market opportunity, yet regulatory and consumer hurdles are non-trivial. For investors, the key question is whether Tesla can scale its autonomy initiatives faster than competitors like Waymo while maintaining profitability. Those with a 5–10 year horizon may find the current valuation compelling, but patience and risk tolerance are prerequisites.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 04:01:16.735241

As Trump backs LNG exports, Pennsylvania residents fight $7B terminal

As the Trump administration accelerates liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, communities in Pennsylvania are pushing back against a proposed $7 billion terminal on the Delaware River. Supporters of the LNG expansion project tout economic gains, including thousands of jobs, billions in GDP contributions, and millions in tax revenue. But community groups warn of health and safety risks in an already overburdened environmental justice zone, where polluting industries have disproportionately harmed low-income neighborhoods and communities of color for decades. Pollution from waste incinerators and refineries has driven cancer and asthma rates in these communities well above national averages. The debate highlights growing tensions under the Trump Administration between short-term economic gains and long-term risks associated with community health and climate impacts.

Adani, Torrent Power win major coal contracts as India expands fossil fuel capacity

India’s energy transition faces a sharp contradiction as Adani Power and Torrent Power secured $3.7 billion in contracts to build new coal-fired plants in Madhya Pradesh. The projects, totaling 2,400 MW, mark Torrent’s largest investment to date and highlight India’s deepening reliance on coal despite global decarbonization pressures. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, the government’s plan also calls for nearly 88 GW of new coal projects by 2032. India’s dual-track strategy highlights the risks associated with stranded fossil fuel assets and the urgent need to scale up clean energy financing.

U.S. nuclear expansion hinges on uranium enrichment

The U.S. nuclear industry is entering a pivotal phase as small modular reactors (SMRs) and micro-reactors gain momentum, promising cheaper and faster deployment of emissions-free electricity. These smaller reactors require high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), a specialized fuel currently produced domestically only by Centrus Energy under a U.S. Department of Energy contract. However, with the U.S. still reliant on imports for two-thirds of its enriched uranium, supply chain bottlenecks could slow nuclear expansion. Much of the U.S.-enriched uranium comes from an enrichment plant in New Mexico, which is provided by the European company Urenco. The supply chain is also highly dependent on Russian enrichment, further threatening Trump’s promises of rapid nuclear energy expansion.

Battery storage allows producers to better match supply and demand, thereby reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
By 2040, the global battery storage capacity is expected to rise ninefold to over 4 TW, according to Rystad.
The world’s utility-scale battery storage capacity is growing at an unprecedented rate, as companies worldwide invest in making their renewable energy delivery more stable.
Lower costs and technological advancements have encouraged more widespread uptake of battery storage, a trend that is set to continue for decades to come.","Following the huge growth in global renewable energy capacity over the last decade, companies and governments have been steadily increasing investment in battery storage to help improve the stability of their green energy supply.

As countries worldwide develop their renewable energy industries, aiming to shift from a reliance on fossil fuels to alternative clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power, one of the main challenges has been to ensure a stable supply of energy to the grid. Solar power can only be produced during the day, while wind turbines only generate power when the wind is blowing. That means that most countries have continued to rely on fossil fuels during low or no production hours. However, this is gradually changing thanks to the deployment of utility-scale battery storage.

Battery storage can be used to store wind and solar power to deliver to the grid during the hours when no electricity is being produced. They mainly consist of lithium-ion batteries. In the U.K., which has the largest installed capacity of offshore wind in the world, the power source continues to be unstable without the use of batteries, which is a massive restriction to achieving a green transition. Battery storage allows producers to better match supply and demand, thereby reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The U.K. government estimates technologies like battery storage systems could save the country up to $48 billion by 2050, ultimately reducing people’s energy bills.

The multinational energy and gas utility National Grid says, “Intelligent battery software uses algorithms to coordinate energy production and computerised control systems are used to decide when to store energy or to release it to the grid. Energy is released from the battery storage system during times of peak demand, keeping costs down and electricity flowing.”

In 2024, global energy storage increased by approximately 200 GWh, bringing the world’s total battery storage capacity to 375 GWh, according to a May Rystad Energy report. China took the lead, installing 100 GWh of new capacity, followed by the United States, which added 35 GWh. Germany, Australia, and the U.K. represented the other main additions. By 2040, the global battery storage capacity is expected to rise ninefold to over 4 TW, according to Rystad.

This massive capacity expansion has been supported by a fall in electricity storage prices, with battery projects decreasing significantly as the technology has improved and more commercial-scale projects are deployed. The global average cost of battery energy storage declined to under $300 per kWh last year, making it far more accessible than in the past. Rystad highlighted that if it were to fall to $250 per kWh, the cost of storing electricity could be as low as $60 per MWh, which could help operators to increase their profit margins.

A recent study suggested that, in Germany, the cost of developing and operating utility-scale solar with integrated battery storage has become cheaper than the equivalent cost for gas-fired power plants. Innovations in battery technology and lower costs have allowed for the development of round-the-clock solar power, with the world’s first 24-hour solar PV project announced for Abu Dhabi at the beginning of the year. The state-owned renewable energy company Masdar is designating $6 billion in funds to develop 5 GW of solar and 19 GWh of battery capacity, which it expects to come online in 2027.

If successful, this could encourage other companies to make similar investments, which would further drive down reliance on fossil fuels to fill the renewable energy supply gap. In addition, technological advancements have also led to longer-life batteries, with manufacturers guaranteeing 10,000 charge-discharge cycles and over 80 percent battery health during that lifespan at present.

Several new markets are investing in battery storage, which is accelerating the industry’s expansion. China and the U.S. continue to dominate the battery storage market in 2025, but several gigawatt-hour projects have been approved or are under development in Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada, and the U.K. New additions are expected to increase by 35 percent this year, with annual additions totalling as much as 247 GWh, according to BloombergNEF estimates. The industry is expected to see acompound annual growth rate of 14.7 percent through 2035, to achieve an annual addition of around 972 GWh that year.

According to BloombergNEF, utility-scale battery power is expanding more rapidly than previously predicted in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, meaning it could overtake the residential sector to become the largest in the region from 2026. This has been supported by favourable policies and financial incentives across the region.

The world’s utility-scale battery storage capacity is growing at an unprecedented rate, as companies worldwide invest in making their renewable energy delivery more stable. Lower costs and technological advancements have encouraged more widespread uptake of battery storage, a trend that is set to continue for decades to come.

The US has launched a trade investigation into solar panels from India, Laos, and Indonesia, further extending its longstanding protectionist stance in the renewable energy industry. Such actions cannot help the US rebuild its industrial competitiveness, and only show a reluctance to face up to its own structural weaknesses.

The US International Trade Commission voted on Friday to proceed with an investigation into whether solar panels from India, Laos and Indonesia are stifling domestic manufacturing, Reuters reported on Saturday. The move follows the initiation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations by the US Department of Commerce just weeks earlier against crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells imported from India, Indonesia, and Laos.

Apparently, India, Indonesia, and Laos have become new targets in the US solar trade dispute, and this is not the first time the US has resorted to protectionist measures in the solar energy sector. US solar manufacturers have reportedly claimed that Chinese companies with operations in those countries receive unfair government subsidies and are selling their products below the cost of production in the US. However, in line with other claims the US has made against Chinese industries and products, this seems like nothing but a flimsy excuse for taking protectionist actions.

Due to high production costs, American solar manufacturers have always been at a disadvantage in market competition. While trade barriers may temporarily restrict the entry of some imported products, they fail to change the fact that US companies' costs remain high.

The predicament faced by the US solar industry is not a result of external competition, but rather its internal structural weaknesses. The US has long been a powerhouse in scientific research and technology, with many innovative ideas born in its laboratories. However, the problem lies in the weak translation of these scientific achievements into industrial production. The transition from laboratory breakthroughs to mass production is often hampered by inefficiencies in supply chain integration and industrial coordination. As a result, the cost of US domestic solar panels is much higher than those produced in Asian countries.

Looking back, the US has previously imposed tariffs on Chinese solar products in an attempt to protect its domestic industry through trade barriers. Yet, years later, there has been no significant revival in its domestic manufacturing capacity. The fundamental issue lies in America's inability to achieve large-scale, low-cost production of solar panels. Whether in terms of industrial scale, market absorption capacity, or cost control, the US does not have the fundamental conditions to support a globally competitive solar manufacturing industry.

Moreover, the negative impacts of protectionism are clearly visible in the US solar market. Trade protectionism has led to a significant increase in the price of solar products in the US. The cost of solar installations in the US is three to four times higher than in other countries. Such high prices have deterred consumers, leading to a decline in demand for solar installations. With shrinking demand, many solar companies in the US are facing bankruptcy. In recent years, many solar companies, including some large-scale ones like SunPower, went out of business, according to media reports. This not only restricts the development of the US solar industry but also hampers the large-scale application and growth of the entire renewable energy industry.

By attempting to use protectionism to solve a cost problem that cannot be fixed through trade barriers, the US is working against economic principles. In today's highly globalized economy, tariffs and investigations alone cannot rebuild national industrial competitiveness.

To a certain extent, the struggles of the US solar panel industry are emblematic of broader challenges in US manufacturing. The country's strengths in high-end technology cannot make up for its weaknesses in market adaptation and industrial foundation. The core problem lies in its failure to control costs, which are rooted in complex structural issues, expensive labor, and relatively low production efficiency. These persistent issues are increasingly constraining the growth of the renewable energy industry in the US.

As countries around the world actively promote the expansion of renewable energy, the problems caused by these structural shortcomings are becoming more and more pronounced, as well as the gap between the US renewable energy sector and global leaders. However, it's also important to note that this is the outcome of the global division of labor, and win-win cooperation could still be carried out if countries pursue openness instead of protectionism.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2025/2025-08-31/561f455e-44f6-4432-aff0-c7d273fcc5e6.jpeg,N,,2025-09-01 05:00:09.642929

But the limited availability and high cost of tritium, a version of hydrogen used to initiate fusion reactions, presents a barrier to the technology’s success. A Los Alamos team is investigating an accelerator-driven system that uses molten-salt technology to produce a supply of commercial tritium from nuclear waste.

“Despite the value tritium holds for the nation’s energy interests, tritium for commercial purposes is simply not produced domestically,” said Terence Tarnowsky, Los Alamos physicist and leader of the tritium production project. “The system we’re proposing could very usefully upcycle nuclear waste in a commercial tritium mission that helps on-ramp the fusion economy.”

Tarnowsky is employing modeling and simulation to understand the design, development, performance requirements and cost of an accelerator-driven system using molten-salt technology. Such a system is potentially versatile enough to work with unique fuel types, including the thousands of tons of used nuclear fuel potentially available from commercial nuclear power plants.

Replenishing supply of a nonrenewable resource

Tarnowsky’s initial estimates suggest that a 2-gigawatt deuterium-tritium fusion energy plant, a system that generates energy via fusion initiated with deuterium-tritium fuel, will require 112 kilograms of tritium per year. But less than approximately 25 kilograms of tritium are known to currently exist on the planet, with the majority of it existing as the byproduct of nuclear reactors and not available commercially.

Tarnowsky’s concept turns the problem of used nuclear fuel — storage is expensive and presents a safety and proliferation concern — into an opportunity. Using computer simulations, Tarnowsky is evaluating potential tritium reactors that use a particle accelerator on used nuclear fuel to drive reactions that produce tritium. The beam from the particle accelerator would generate neutrons in the molten salt. These neutrons can be used to produce tritium from dissolved lithium. Tritium finds its use in a fusion reactor when it combines with deuterium to release tremendous amounts of energy while generating almost no waste.

The accelerator model offers versatility — it can be turned on and off — and does not involve chain reactions, a possible safety advantage over tritium produced via nuclear power plants. Advances in the technology mean that this concept, which has been considered in the past, is more efficient now.

Tarnowsky is building on his recent modeling by going on to evaluate the dollar cost for tritium production and the possibility of using molten lithium salt in the design. Surrounding the nuclear waste with molten lithium salt would provide cooling, make the radioactive material harder to extract, and contribute to the ability to track and safeguard inventory.

“Understanding how design impacts costs and other factors is integral to how we approach decision-making around energy,” Tarnowsky said. “Our modeling aims to show what designs offer the best mix of efficiency and cost effectiveness as we move toward potential implementation.”

Tarnowsky presented his research at the American Chemical Society’s National Meeting and Exposition in August.

Electric vehicle manufacturers are expressing strong opposition to a proposed GST increase on high-end electric vehicles, cautioning that it could hamper progress in the nation's transition to clean mobility at a crucial time. The GST rationalisation group of ministers (GoM) has suggested raising tax rates to 18% from 5% for EVs priced above Rs 20 lakh. Although the GST Council has not reached a final verdict, the mere discussion has unsettled manufacturers, who report it is influencing consumer confidence.

GST Revolution Ahead: Experts Decode PM Modi’s Plan To Simplify India’s Tax Structure

Tata Motors' MD Shailesh Chandra highlighted recent EV advancements - vehicles achieving 500 km range, over 24,000 public charging points nationwide, and competitive pricing against conventional vehicles in several SUV categories. He emphasised that the current tax rate has been crucial in reducing buyer reluctance. ""It is therefore imperative that the 5% GST rate for EVs be retained,"" said Chandra, as quoted by Economic Times. ""Any upward revision would adversely impact EV adoption in India and slow down the transition to clean mobility, diluting environmental gains, and impacting India's aspirations towards zero-emission mobility,"" he added. India's electric car sales reached 15,528 units in July, showing a 93% increase compared to the previous year, as reported by FADA. EVs comprised 4.7% of total passenger vehicle sales, up from 2.4% in July 2024. Vehicle manufacturers are concerned that if the suggested rate increase is implemented, prices for approximately one-quarter of EVs above Rs 20 lakh would increase significantly, potentially affecting adoption rates. A Mahindra & Mahindra representative stated that maintaining the 5% rate is essential for price competitiveness with conventional vehicles and for developing the Rs 10-40 lakh EV segment, crucial for India's international competitiveness. Industry leaders emphasised the need for consistent policies to encourage sustained investment. ""To sustain EV adoption, we need stable long-term policies, accelerated CAFE norms, and zero percent GST on fully electric vehicles,"" said Anurag Mehrotra, MD, JSW MG Motor India. ""Investments in charging infrastructure and easing home charging will also be critical."" Premium car manufacturers indicated that while affluent buyers might be less affected by price changes, the entry-level luxury EV segment could face significant impact. Mercedes-Benz India's MD and CEO, Santosh Iyer, noted that current low GST rates have helped achieve necessary sales volumes and quickened BEV adoption.

In their book, Abundance, Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein argue that the progressive policies so carefully put in place by progressive politicians over the past several decades — things like the Administrative Procedures Act and the National Environmental Policy Act — have fueled the furious assault on reason and rationality on display every hour of every day by the MAGA crowd — especially the full frontal assault on renewable energy.

They write that progressives over the past 30 years have been more concerned with erecting barriers to right-wing policy initiatives than actually getting things done. The result of all those restrictions is the perception that government doesn’t work. It is that constant drumbeat of “government is the problem” thinking that has brought the New Fascism to prominence in the US, they suggest.

In other words, the road to hell is paved with good intentions and Democrats have pretty much shot themselves in the foot with their insistence on requiring all government action be fully compliant with every jot and tittle of the progressive agenda.

In a recent article by Rebecca Egan for Grist, she suggests many of those environmental protection efforts created by progressives are now being turned into weapons against environmental action by the fossil fuel industry and its acolytes. The evidence can be seen in a statement by the failed president of the United States that he posted on his personal antisocial media channel recently in which he said the administration “will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar. The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!”

Actually, the days of stupidity are just beginning, as he and his slavish minions are taking a sledgehammer to renewable energy at every opportunity. Egan says many renewable energy experts say what the president and the Interior Department are doing is using the environmental legal playbook created by progressives against them to derail renewable energy.

Laws meant to protect and safeguard wildlife and public lands from mining, drilling, and habitat degradation — such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act’s prohibition against “unnecessary or undue degradation” — are being used as a cudgel against wind and solar, Egan writes.

“They are effectively trying to co-opt arguments that we have used for years to push back on fossil fuels,” Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, the executive director at the Western Environmental Law Center, told Egan. “But I think it should go without saying that they are abusing those laws.” Thompson and Klein would agree with that analysis.

Renewable Energy & Capacity Density

He pointed to the recent capacity density order by the Interior Department as a particularly troubling example. Secretarial orders are meant to function as internal guidance to agencies. “They are not intended to put in place substantive rules that dictate outcomes,” he said, calling the capacity density order “a de facto prohibition against the siting and permitting of renewables on federal public lands. The DOI is fixating on this one metric — capacity density — to the exclusion of a holistic understanding of costs and benefits of a particular energy technology.”

What is capacity density? In simple terms, it is a measure of how much energy can be created per square foot, or square yard, or acre of land. A tank of gasoline has a greater energy content than a 65 kWh battery. By the DOI’s logic, electric cars would be banned on public roads unless and until their batteries reach energy density with gasoline on a per volume basis.

As Egan points out, when a wind or solar farm is decommissioned, the equipment is removed and within a year or two, it’s hard to tell anything was there and the land can be reused. But when a refinery or a fossil fuel plant shuts down, the ground is poisoned. Cancer-causing chemicals like benzene saturate the soil and remediation can take years, assuming it happens at all.

“The DOI is fixating on this one metric, capacity density, to the exclusion of a holistic understanding of costs and benefits of a particular energy technology,” said Schlenker-Goodrich.

“The [DOI is] trying to come up with the facade of a rational reason to stop doing anything related to renewables, but this one especially is really mind-boggling,” said Josh Axelrod, senior policy advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Everything it compares wind and solar to — none of those types of facilities are built on federal land. … There’s no comparison.”

Impacts On Public & Private Land

The Interior Department’s order that all wind and solar projects on federal land undergo “elevated review” is another misuse of environmental law, experts told Grist. Routine procedures that would have previously been handled by a DOI bureaucrat will now need the secretary’s personal sign-off.

The restrictions will impact projects on private land just as much as on public land. A recent analysis from The American Clean Power Association found that 27 of the new procedures requiring Burgum’s sign-off — such as needing consultations around harm to wildlife and endangered species — will allow the DOI to effectively end development of renewable energy projects nationwide.

The goal, it seems, is to create an impossible backlog that bleeds projects of funding before they can get off the ground, Egan writes, and the rules and regulations created by environmentalists are making such attacks on common sense possible. It’s a variation on the old expression “Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.” And boy, howdy, are Democrats getting it!

Picking Winners & Losers

Alex Klass, an environmental law professor at the University of Michigan, told Egan, “[The administration] can talk about energy dominance and talk about the need for new energy,” she said, “but before there was always an argument [that] you shouldn’t try to prop up an industry that can’t make it on its own. That’s basically what they’re doing.”

What’s worse is that foreseeable environmental consequences are being ignored. Burgum has cited concerns for migratory birds and whales as justification for shutting down offshore wind projects. Yet on August 26, the Interior Department announced plans to hold 30 offshore oil and gas lease auctions over the next 15 years.

Offshore drilling has been shown to be especially harmful to marine animals. Seismic blasting can result in hearing loss, which affects the ability of whales to breed and communicate. “It’s clear that actual energy development is being approached from a position of political theater, rather than practicality,” Egan writes.

Interior officials are working overtime to roll back environmental regulations around mining, despite local concerns about a scarcity of fresh water supplies. “Given the administration’s aggressive antipathy for environmental regulations, experts say it’s impossible to believe that the Interior Department’s sudden conservationist concerns around solar and wind impacts are being made in good faith,” Egan reports.

“It’s not like the Biden administration stopped permitting oil and gas development. There’s lots of oil and gas development,” said Alex Klass. “They just also tried to prioritize wind and solar. Here they’re saying, ‘Not only are we not going to prioritize [wind and solar], we’re going to try to shut it down entirely.’”

Remember when Republicans said government should not be picking winners and losers in the marketplace? Now they are doing much more than picking winners; they are effectively banning entire industries from competing both at home and abroad.

Project to create up to 48 jobs and generate $36 million in revenue

A Bunbury company will employ more workers and pursue new manufacturing opportunities in the wind energy sector after receiving more than $2 million under a partnership program established by the Cook Government.

RCR Advanced Technologies, part of the half-century-old RCR Mining Technologies, is the second recipient under the $8 million Wind Energy Manufacturing Co-Investment Program, delivered in collaboration with the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre (AMGC).

The $5.3 million project is set to strengthen Western Australia's capability to produce wind energy componentry locally and support the development of clean energy projects, facilitating Western Australia's broader energy transition.

The Bunbury-based company will receive $2,047,900 in co-investment funding to pilot the production of innovative transition flanges for wind turbines.

Transition flanges connect the turbine tower to the foundation and are currently manufactured overseas. RCR is in talks with turbine manufacturers to build the flanges in WA, to reduce shipping logistics and deliver supply chain reliability.

RCR will modernise and expand its workshop capability, purchase state-of-the-art machinery and upgrade quality control processes to meet the standards of large wind energy developers.

It will also use the investments to upskill its workforce to be capable of undertaking future refurbishment of wind turbine components such as gearboxes and drive shafts.

Leveraging this co-investment and its extensive manufacturing expertise in materials handling equipment for the resources sector, RCR will strengthen its collaboration with global original equipment manufacturers, such as Vestas, and engage with other major renewable energy project developers.

The project is expected to create up to 48 new jobs and generate $36 million in new revenue over the next five years.

The Wind Energy Manufacturing Co-Investment Program provides financial and non-financial support to help local manufacturers increase their participation in wind energy supply chains.

It offers up to 50 per cent of eligible project costs, with industry partners required to match the funding, ensuring a strong collaborative approach.

The program supports manufacturers at various stages of development through two funding streams, related to market entry and growth. It is being delivered in partnership between the Department of Energy and Economic Diversification and the AMGC.

RCR joins Australian Winders as the second recipient under the program, which has so far committed more than $2.5 million in co-investment funding to support WA's growing wind energy manufacturing sector.

Western Australia has multiple large wind farms scheduled for development in the coming decades, several being above one gigawatt in scale.

It’s also powering careers. Electricians and laborers are finding steady work on solar, wind, and grid projects. And the newest data backs them up: clean energy jobs are growing faster than the U.S. job market overall.

What the research shows

Clean energy jobs are rising twice as fast as overall U.S. employment, with 2023 growth in the 4–5% range versus about 2% economy-wide.

Unionization in clean energy hit a record of ~12.4% in 2023, above the private-sector average and even surpassing traditional energy.

Energy jobs pay more. Median hourly pay for U.S. energy workers has been reported at about 34% above the national median—evidence that many clean-energy roles are good, middle-class jobs.

Ohio by the numbers

Different research groups count jobs in slightly different ways. But they point to a clear trend: Ohio is a top-tier clean energy employer. Here’s a simple snapshot:

Measure Latest Figure Source Clean energy job growth, U.S. (2023) ~4.2%–4.9% (about 2× overall economy) DOE USEER 2024 / DOE press brief Unionization rate in clean energy (U.S., 2023) ~12.4% DOE USEER 2024 Energy wage premium (U.S.) ~34% above national median EFI/NASEO wage analysis Ohio clean energy jobs ~114,000 (2023 methodology) Clean Jobs Midwest Ohio clean energy jobs ~142,000 (USER-based ranking) Top-10 states list (USEER-derived) Ohio rank Top 10 nationally (often ~8th) Regional and state reports

Local voices: training and steady work

On the ground, union crews say the boom is real. Pat Hook, business manager of IBEW Local 683 in Columbus, said utility-scale solar projects in central Ohio have already created “hundreds and hundreds of jobs” and “millions of dollars in wages and benefits.” His members are also bringing in new apprentices who learn on live projects and earn while they train.

Kevin Pranis, Great Lakes marketing manager for the Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA), framed the value of training this way: “We really train people to be construction professionals.” Those skills move between job sites—solar, wind, highways, and schools—so workers can keep steady hours and grow their careers.

Why these are “career” jobs

Apprenticeships open the door. Earn a paycheck, learn a trade, and get industry credentials.

Portable skills travel across sites (solar arrays today, grid upgrades tomorrow).

Safety and benefits are part of the package in many union shops.

National data matches those claims. Unionization in clean energy rose to a record level in 2023, and energy employers reported fewer hiring challenges than in the prior year. That helps projects stay on schedule and supports stable careers.

Community impact: more than paychecks

Some local groups raised concerns about land use and environmental impacts around large solar sites. Those debates matter. But project backers point to finished facilities that are now producing power and raising local tax revenue. Districts report gains that support schools, police, and fire services. And because many projects sit near small towns, the dollars ripple through diners, hotels, and hardware stores.

Key takeaways for Ohio

Ohio is a top-10 state for clean energy employment.

Job growth is real and faster than the overall labor market nationwide.

Wages are strong, and union coverage is higher than average.

Training pathways from unions and community programs are expanding to meet demand.

Where to learn more (and how to get started)

Interested in an electrical career or an apprenticeship? Explore IBEW.org for information on training and locals, including Central Ohio’s IBEW community. And for laborer pathways in site prep, concrete, trenching, and more, visit LIUNA.org. These groups run proven programs that help people enter the trades, build skills, and move up.

Ohio’s outlook

So, what’s next? More utility-scale solar is in the pipeline. Grid upgrades are ongoing. Storage is growing too. The broader U.S. data suggests clean energy hiring will stay strong, and research groups expect states like Ohio to keep adding jobs—especially where manufacturers, developers, and unions work together on training and fair pay.

At a glance: national and Ohio context

Topic Quick Fact What it means Speed of growth Clean energy added jobs at ~2× the national rate in 2023 Hiring momentum favors trained tradespeople and new apprentices. Unionization Clean energy unionization is ~12.4%. More jobs come with bargaining power, safety standards, and benefits. Pay Energy median pay ~34% above national median These roles tend to support middle-class living and stable careers.

Wind and solar combined produced more than 20%, and the mix of all renewable energy resources generated nearly 28%.

Industry analysts have told POWER they expect renewables will remain important to U.S. power generation, though growth may be slower, while other countries such as China and much of Europe continue to ramp up their use of solar, wind, geothermal and more. It’s expected to be a major topic of conversation at the upcoming RE+ 2025 event in Las Vegas, Nevada, which begins September 8 and continues through September 11.

Margolin provided POWER with insight into how companies are approaching sustainability targets during a period of upheaval in the energy landscape, as government priorities around energy shift not only in the U.S. but also worldwide.

POWER: Are companies moving away from sustainability targets in the current regulatory landscape, or are they simply calling them something else?

Margolin: While there have been a few high-profile retreats from sustainability initiatives, by and large we’re seeing firm commitment to previously stated sustainability targets among our client base, and in some cases actually a doubling down. The broad uncertainty that has emerged is placing clients in a position where they’re increasingly viewing renewables as a mechanism to insulate from anticipated increases in energy costs and volatility.

We’re seeing more clients look to renewables to lock in power prices, gain budgetary certainty, and increase reliability in energy supply as competition for energy becomes fierce and the ability to add new generation sources is constrained. Corporate sustainability commitments aren’t as publicized as they were in recent years, but we’re not seeing much substantive retreat; in some cases, we’re seeing increased commitment.

POWER: Why do you believe current market conditions remain favorable for renewable energy buyers?

Margolin: The main reason is price: renewables in most markets offer some of the lowest cost energy available. Because renewables don’t have associated fuel costs, you can lock in your price and insulate yourself from the volatility that characterizes fuel-generated sources.

Second is expediency. Renewables are the fastest form of technology that can hit the market, with development times of 12 to 18 months depending on project type and size. Other utility-scale sources face major supply chain issues or technical development challenges with longer lead times.

Renewables also don’t obligate an energy buyer to be beholden to a utility. They offer flexibility that allows energy users to generate their own system or engage in power purchase contracts with renewables developers. The procurement opportunities are diverse and flexible, enabling energy buyers to tailor solutions to their energy usage, payment preferences, and budgetary constraints.

Additionally, many clients are publicly traded or backed by private equity where shareholders and investors still value sustainability and moving toward renewable energy sources. That pressure from stakeholders hasn’t abated, providing motivation beyond pure economics.

POWER: In light of policy uncertainty, how can organizations make the most of the limited window for cost-effective clean energy deals while managing their impact on procurement timelines and decisions?

Margolin: The most important thing is getting internal teams aligned. The number one obstacle we see is lack of internal cohesion. Energy buyers need their sustainability group, facilities, procurement, accounting, finance, and tax teams aligned, ensuring everybody knows the objective and that all constraints and abilities are incorporated into a buying plan with C-Suite buy-in.

Once a client has internal alignment, we see the ability to move expeditiously through the process: quickly from opportunity identification to origination to negotiation to contracting to implementation. Many projects in the marketplace can come online in time to capture remaining federal tax credits. It’s a question of whether the client can organize quickly and engage in the process.

POWER: What approaches and strategies does ENGIE Impact use to help clients identify the best deals and lock in renewable energy contracts that hedge against future price volatility?

Margolin: First, we work with the client to understand not just sustainability goals, but how they operate: budgeting, financing, and planning horizons. It’s a conversation around goal setting and achievement.

Second is opportunity identification. We develop roadmaps and strategies where, once we understand their portfolio and operations, we present available marketplace options. This enables us to recommend three or four pathways worth pursuing.

Third, we work on internal buy-in, ensuring everyone understands different procurement tools, costs, and operational impacts. Once aligned, we move to origination, identifying transactable opportunities that fit the strategy.

Finally, we advocate for the client in negotiations, perform due diligence, conduct econometric analysis, and negotiate optimal terms. We manage implementation oversight and provide ongoing monitoring to ensure clients receive what they contracted for throughout the project’s operational life.

POWER: What are the risks associated with delaying procurement? (e.g., higher compliance costs, other financial challenges)

Margolin: The biggest risk right now is losing incentive opportunities. Federal investment and production tax credits are being phased out, and to qualify before they’re eliminated, you need projects that meet certain deadlines. Delays risk missing incentives, which could drive project costs significantly higher.

Beyond incentives, the longer corporate energy buyers delay incorporating renewables into their strategy, the greater their exposure to rising energy prices. The universal expectation across energy markets is that prices are increasing for all sources: renewables, gas, coal, and nuclear. The longer you wait, the greater exposure to both rising and volatile prices.

POWER: Should existing wind or solar power purchase agreements be renegotiated as conditions evolve?

Margolin: It’s difficult to make blanket statements since this depends on individual contracts and projects. What’s important for buyers is monitoring market conditions and forecasts. Energy buyers should understand where markets are heading, then evaluate existing contracts for any that might work against them.

We work closely with clients to understand why energy prices are projected to increase. You need to understand all the contributing factors, not just accept that prices will rise. While that may be the prevailing view, you must also understand the risks to that perspective and position yourself to hedge or leverage both upside and downside opportunities.

POWER: Are clients working to expedite the signing of more deals in 2025 to meet the accelerated deadline for project starts?

Margolin: Absolutely. Companies with aligned internal teams that are already in renewable energy procurement or ready to go are viewing this as go time. There’s definite urgency, primarily due to tax credit expirations.

Projects beginning construction before July 4, 2026, can qualify for full tax credits. Projects that can’t meet that deadline but come online by end of 2027 can still qualify. The rush is to secure projects with prospects of being online or under construction to capture those credits.

Many developers are positioned to meet these deadlines with safeguarded equipment, established financing, labor forces, and permitting expertise. It’s very busy right now (matching developers with off-takers).

POWER: Do you foresee an uptick in clean energy storage projects and deals, given that they remain in favor?

Margolin: Absolutely. Storage makes sense and would see significant growth regardless of incentive structures because it smooths market volatility and provides arbitrage opportunities on power prices in certain markets.

Storage continues growing because it makes financial and operational sense, and it wasn’t disadvantaged by policy changes like wind and solar were. The storage space is also benefiting from technological developments. Beyond traditional batteries, we’re seeing impressive improvements in costs, reliability, durability, and reduced use of precious materials.

We’re also seeing evolution beyond batteries: pumped air, pumped hydro, molten materials for heat storage, and gravity storage. This diverse storage ecosystem has taken off in Asian markets and we expect U.S. deployment as well.

POWER: What makes you hopeful about the future of clean energy procurement despite the policy headwinds?

Margolin: Renewables aren’t going away. If demand grows as projected, we must add new generation. When you examine all forms of energy generation we can add to the grid, renewables win in almost every parameter: lowest cost energy in most markets, fastest to grid, healthiest supply chains, and flexibility to tailor procurement strategies.

Renewables offer flexibility to detach from the grid or operate semi-attached, providing distributed generation opportunities other technologies lack. When you evaluate the entire suite of criteria for new energy sources, renewables continue leading.

The policy environment will make renewable energy more expensive, but it will still be the most cost-advantageous with all the other advantages discussed. We’re still adding renewables; they’ll just cost more.

POWER: What role do you see corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments playing in accelerating procurement decisions this year?

Margolin: It’s still a major role, though diminished compared to 2020-2024. It remains significant because investors, employees, and shareholders value sustainability, not for feel-good reasons, but because investors and pension fund managers recognize sustainability as value-adding.

It improves business operations, provides insulation from volatility, and reduces risks from climate change, geopolitics, and market volatility. Over the past 15 years, the financial community has broadly recognized that sustainability translates to optimal performance.

While less publicized recently, it hasn’t disappeared, and I don’t expect it will because underlying fundamentals haven’t changed. Companies with high pollution or emissions footprints are still seen as generating waste, which isn’t favorable for operations.

POWER: Can you share an example of how a client successfully secured a deal that both improved returns and future-proofed compliance?

Margolin: We worked with a large government agency with greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for 2030, 2045, and 2050. We helped them procure on-site solar systems for dozens of portfolio properties at rates that save money compared to staying with their utility.

They’re saving money, reducing emissions, and hardening against grid and market volatility while moving significantly closer to meeting their emissions reduction goals. This demonstrates how renewable procurement can simultaneously address financial, operational, and compliance objectives.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/fig2-wind-solar-hydro-shutterstock-570200689.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 05:00:28.106751

America’s power grid is at a tipping point. On July 7th, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued an unmistakable warning: with growing trends in power plant retirement, surging electrification, and exploding demand from AI data centers, the U.S. could see a 100-fold increase in blackouts by 2030. Without quickly developing and adopting U.S.-made grid-enhancing technologies (GETs), system failure is inevitable.

The department’s conclusion is blunt: incremental, patchwork improvement— “business-as-usual” grid management—no longer cuts it. It’s time for “radical change.”

Energy demand is growing at an extraordinary pace. By 2030, electric vehicles and data centers alone will consume 35 gigawatts (GW)—doubling their 2022 demand and adding unprecedented stress to systems already on edge. Meanwhile, our grid will lose 104GW of reliable baseload power from coal and gas plant retirements, and the vast majority of new generation will come from intermittent wind and solar power.

Utilities have traditionally adopted new technologies at a glacial pace. For decades, the urgency wasn’t there. From my earliest days as a scientist, I’ve wanted to solve genuine, large-scale grid problems. Today, there’s a clear and compelling reason to innovate: we can’t afford to proceed with the old, decade-long timelines for adopting new technologies.

But the hands of our innovators are tied. If we don’t streamline regulatory hurdles, we could slide into an era of chronic energy insecurity. Without immediate, decisive action, rolling blackouts and grid failures will become routine, threatening everything from basic public safety to the future of our cities, industries, and national competitiveness.

For an AI-powered, electrified nation, that is simply untenable. While we can’t throw caution to the wind, we need reasonable policy changes to fast-track new, proven grid technologies.

Upgrading Our Foundation

With smarter, American-made solutions, we can strengthen our grid from within. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) enable utilities and grid operators to quickly drop in and deploy upgraded components on existing infrastructure, without large-scale overhauls.

One example is advanced capacitor film—a specialized, super-thin plastic that forms the backbone of the capacitors that store and release energy across the grid. These components are foundational—if the underlying technology isn’t robust, you can’t guarantee stability. As we push to meet rising demand on aging infrastructure, the cracks in our foundation are starting to show, resulting in power blackouts, bottlenecks, and project delays.

The films traditionally used in capacitors are made of BOPP (biaxially oriented polypropylene) and start to break down at 85°C. As temperatures rise above that threshold, these films shrink, degrading performance, forcing operators to replace capacitors more frequently, invest in cooling infrastructure, and/or “derate” (run capacitors below their maximum voltage). This requires more oversight and reduces capacitor performance and efficiency, making it harder to meet increasing energy demand.

Compounding the issue, our energy security is at risk. We rely solely on foreign companies, primarily in China, to supply this consumable material. Cutting off our supply would directly threaten grid reliability, public safety, and our national economy.

Innovative alternatives are emerging. At Peak Nano, we’ve pioneered a high-performance, drop-in-ready capacitor film made in the U.S. called NanoPlex™. This film extends equipment service life by up to five times, cuts energy loss in half, and operates at temperatures up to 135°C with virtually none of the shrinkage or derating issues seen with traditional materials.

Deploying technologies that allow grid operators to get more power and reliability out of existing assets is exactly the kind of leap forward the DOE demands.

We cannot do it alone. The capacitor film industry is worth $200 billion annually, and China is raking in the lion’s share. With broader investment in R&D and commitment to building domestic manufacturing, we can kick-start a supply chain revolution to reshore critical grid-enhancing technology, strengthening the foundation of our grid. This isn’t just about better performance—it’s an investment in America’s energy security.

Practical Change and Policy Imperatives

To rebuild the foundation of our grid, we need to rethink how our grid is structured and operated.

We’re seeing a shift away from large, centralized power plants towards a distributed mesh of modular generation units called microgrids, which create localized power and sell excess back to the grid. Startups and utilities are beginning to embrace this model, which better integrates diverse energy sources and enables grid growth without the delays and opposition tied to building massive power stations. Capacitors sit at the intersection of microgrids and the main grid, holding and distributing power on demand.

Future-proofing our grid also requires a move from analog to digital grid management. Enhancements like solid-state transformers and high-frequency switching will enable more precise energy management and reduce power loss. AI-based demand forecasting and consumption matching will allow us to squeeze greater efficiency from existing equipment, but that depends on the reliability and longevity of our power hardware.

Utilities and OEMs face obstacles to adopting GETs—high upfront costs, regulatory barriers, and public resistance. Modernization will require significant investment and collaboration among state and local actors.

The Advancing GETs Act of 2024 presents a promising framework to accelerate innovation and utilities investment. But success also hinges on policymakers funding public outreach to win community support, helping people understand that short-term disruptions will bring long-term benefits such as lower electricity bills, reliable power, and new local jobs.

We must also move technology out of the lab and into the field. I tell young engineers, “You can’t build a modern power grid from a conference room.” We need skilled electricians and line workers trained on new solutions and practical, real-world deployments to refine and scale innovations.

Securing Our Energy Future

According to Secretary Wright, “In the coming years, America’s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power… to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.”

We must bring in new technologies that will “hold up the house” during the energy transition. Capacitor films may seem like a small component, but they’re the very foundation on which our energy infrastructure is built.

Our national security, economic prosperity, and daily lives depend on a modern, resilient power grid. As we race to meet demand, these upgrades must begin today. America’s future can’t wait.","https://img.tdworld.com/files/base/ebm/tdworld/image/2025/08/68af65e7aaceefd0335a817a-1479040330977254___mainimage1280x720.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-09-01 04:02:13.847137

“In conclusion, the record levels of oil and natural gas production in the United States highlight the strength of the energy sector in 2025,” said Di Giacomo.","The United States cemented its status as the world’s preeminent energy superpower this June, reaching unprecedented heights in both crude oil and natural gas production.

According to an August 29, 2025, analysis by Antonio Di Giacomo, Financial Markets Analyst for LATAM at XS, the country hit a historic high of 13.58 million barrels per day (bpd) in crude oil production, driven by robust output from Texas, New Mexico, and the Gulf of Mexico.

This development “consolidates the country’s position as the world’s largest crude oil producer,” Di Giacomo stated, underscoring the “resilience of the U.S. energy sector, despite challenges to investment and fluctuations in international oil prices.”

Total supply of crude and refined products soared to 21 million bpd, the highest since October 2024.

Di Giacomo emphasised that this surge is not merely a function of expanded production, but also the result of “stronger domestic demand.”

Featured among the indicators of revived consumption, gasoline usage climbed to 9.23 million bpd, a peak not seen since July 2024.

Meanwhile, jet fuel demand reached 1.85 million bpd, marking its highest point since August 2018.

“Fuel consumption dynamics are partly explained by the recovery of air travel and the rise in tourism during the summer season,” Di Giacomo detailed.

“Likewise, the strength of the U.S. labour market, along with GDP growth in the second quarter, has boosted the use of cars and trucks for both productive and leisure activities.

“These factors have helped sustain domestic energy demand.”

Simultaneously, gross natural gas production in the lower 48 states set a new record at 120.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), edging past the previous high set in March.

The most substantial production gains were attributed to Texas and Pennsylvania, registering increases of 0.7% and 1%, respectively.

According to Di Giacomo, “This level surpassed the previous peak reached in March, reinforcing the United States’ position as a key exporter in global liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets.”

Di Giacomo noted, “The country’s LNG export capacity has been a decisive factor in strengthening the U.S. gas industry. In recent months, exports to Europe and Asia have increased, driven by persistent demand for energy security and supplier diversification.

“This has placed the United States at the centre of global energy geopolitics, in a context marked by international tensions and shifting trade flows.”

Despite these gains, the analyst cautioned about the pressure such rapid expansion exerts on the sector.

“High production levels also bring challenges,” noted Di Giacomo.

“Pressure on strategic reserves, transportation and storage infrastructure limitations, as well as debates over the energy transition, remain key issues on the political and economic agenda.

“Balancing hydrocarbon leadership with climate commitments is one of the central tensions faced by the current administration.”

Looking forward, the sector faces a challenging landscape.

Di Giacomo suggests that while forecasts indicate U.S. energy output will stay robust, the industry continues to face uncertainties tied to swings in global prices, actions by the Federal Reserve, and levels of investment in renewable energy.

He notes that the future success of the sector hinges on maintaining its competitive edge, fulfilling domestic energy needs, and evolving to address climate-related challenges.

Di Giacomo concluded his outlook by highlighting the dual imperatives now facing U.S. energy.

“In conclusion, the record levels of oil and natural gas production in the United States highlight the strength of the energy sector in 2025,” said Di Giacomo.

“With solid domestic demand and a strategic role in the global market, the country reinforces its position as a leader in the international market.

This effectively cuts the number of newly registered cars, mainly affecting emerging countries with slower electrification rates.
Use synergies in the system – alternative fuels as by-products from the aviation sector Reducing emissions in the car sector does not necessarily require electrification.
If electrification cannot be scaled up quickly, the car fleet will be composed of ICEs for a long time.
This process will likely require decades to complete, and in the transitory phase, ICEs comprise a large fraction of the car fleet.","We estimate the emissions from the car sector until 2100 based on projected sales shares of electric vehicles (EVs) and cars with internal combustion engines (ICEs)27 (Fig. 1). Using data from Bloomberg28, we split global values into two groups of emerging and developed countries to capture their different timely adoption of EVs. We fit these projections to historical values for each country reported by the IEA to match current developments to the expected progression of sales shares. The fleet growth is based on data for OECD and non-OECD countries from EIA12, which we match to the categories of emerging and developed countries. We deduce the new vehicle registrations from the fleet size and specific car lifetime per country. Finally, we estimate vehicle emissions by considering car and battery manufacturing and consumption of fuel and electricity. In three scenarios (Business-as-usual (BAU), Middle-of-the-Road (MoR), and Optimistic), we vary the level of ambition regarding the transition to electrification and the decarbonization of grid electricity and analyze different options to meet climate goals by reducing the cumulative emissions of the car sector until the end of the century.

Regional resolution

We combine multiple data sources to address the need for regionally resolved forecasts of electric vehicle markets. This allows us to show the different technology adoption speeds, especially in contrast between developed and emerging countries.

IEA collects historical data (2001–2023) for EV sales, fleet, and new and total vehicle registrations for 31 countries (Supplementary Fig. 1). The remaining countries are aggregated as Rest of the World and Other Europe. These historical data are the starting point for our analysis.

Projection of car sales shares

We complement the historical car sales data by three scenario projections (Stated Policy, Sustainable Development, and Net Zero Emissions) for EVs published by the IEA27 and map them to our scenarios (BAU, MoR, Optimistic). These data reflect a global perspective without any distinction between countries or market types. However, the development of the electric vehicle market happens at different speeds in different regions: while developed regions act as early adopters with higher financial resources, electrification in emerging economies will follow at a slower speed. Historical data on electric vehicle car sales are available at the individual country level. Still, projections on the same level for all countries in our analysis and ideally from a single source are not available. To reflect different speeds of the transition to EVs in different markets, we therefore combine two datasets: global IEA projections divided into three scenarios for different speeds of transition and the projections of Bloomberg28, which have only a single scenario but are divided into an emerging, a global, and a developed country perspective. We do this by applying the relative differences between the “global” projection and “emerging” and “developed” from Bloomberg to the three EV sales share projections of IEA until 2050. We fit these six projections to the data’s historical development to obtain a forecast for each country or region from the underlying dataset. First, we categorize the countries into developed or emerging according to S&P BMI29. Second, we change the respective projections’ (developed or emerging) starting year until it matches each country’s last value from the historical dataset (Fig. 1 I bottom). To expand from the literature values, in the absence of reliable projections, we assume the sales shares to be constant from 2051 to 2100.

Projection of fleet size

We model the number of vehicles in the fleet for each country. EIA forecasts the vehicle stock development in OECD and non-OECD countries until 205012, which we match to the list of emerging and developed countries in our analysis. We use these growth rates to obtain the future number of vehicles per country, starting from the historical fleet size (Fig. 1 IIA). From 2051 to 2100, we extend the projections by EIA in the following way: for developed countries, the fleet size is assumed to be constant as the number of vehicles in this region is already projected to be near-constant by EIA; for emerging countries, EIA projects strong growth until 2050, which we then reduce by 2% each year until 2100 to reflect the increased level of wealth and the associated expected saturation of the car market.

Projection of new vehicle registrations

To apply the previously calculated sales share to the development of the fleets, we need to derive the number of newly registered vehicles, which are so far unknown. The newly registered vehicles consist of i) new vehicles entering the fleet and ii) replaced vehicles that leave the fleet at their end of life (Fig. 1 IIb). The former is the difference between the vehicle stock of two consecutive years. For the latter, we assume a Gaussian-distributed vehicle lifetime. In a similar analysis, Märtz et al.21 used a static global lifetime of 12 years per vehicle. This, however, leads to discrepancies between the cumulative fleet size (the sum of all newly registered vehicles over their lifetime) and the target fleet size by EIA12. Also, Held et al.30 found that vehicle lifetimes differ significantly between countries. To minimize the error, we adjust the vehicle lifetime individually per country in a recursive optimization loop to fit the EIA fleet size forecast12. The resulting vehicle lifetimes are close to the ones identified by Held et al.30.

While this method allows for the matching of cumulative new registrations with the designated development of the fleet size in a manner that matches literature values for vehicle lifetimes, it has several limitations: (i) no explicit import or export of vehicles between countries, (ii) our probability function for vehicle lifetime is a step function for each country that is smoothened with a Gaussian distribution over five years while Held et al.30 used a continuous probability density function, (iii) historical effects such as the drastic drop in new vehicle registrations during the Covid pandemic in 2020 are propagated through the analysis. While the latter creates a propagating effect throughout the analysis, which appears to repeat the pattern that led to its creation, this should not be interpreted as a projection of the exact cause (e.g., a global pandemic) repeating itself. It suggests that the historic decline in vehicle sales during the pandemic leads to a non-replacement and, therefore, lower vehicle sales after one lifetime of the vehicles. In other words, the cars not sold during the pandemic will not have to be replaced at the end of their lifetime. Of course, considerable uncertainty is associated with this projection, but this is an intrinsic uncertainty of future data projection. If the drop in sales during the pandemic would not appear in future sales in one way or another, this would be just another assumption, i.e., assuming that cars would be replaced earlier or later than their usual lifetime. Therefore, we accept the repetitive historical behavior resulting from the selected method and the historical data. Combining new vehicle registrations with electric vehicle sales shares gives each country’s fleet composition over time.

Extrapolation until 2100

The datasets and projections used do not extend beyond 2050. However, many ICEs will be in the fleet after 2050, which might impair the carbon budgets. To derive the cumulative emissions until 2100, the projections must be extended. Any underlying predictions are assumed to be constant after the year 2050, except for fleet growth in emerging countries, which will likely continue beyond 2050. We thus fix the EV sales shares and the carbon intensity of grid electricity at their respective values of 2050 and do not assume further development. For fleet growth until 2050, the projections of EIA12 for developed and emerging countries are used. From 2051 to 2100, the fleet size is kept constant at the 2050 value for developed countries. For emerging countries, on the other hand, the ten-year average fleet growth rate as projected by EIA from 2040 to 2050 is reduced by 2% annually and used to project growth until 2100, taking increasing wealth and market saturation of the market into account.

Vehicle emissions

LCA of EVs

The lifecycle emissions of an EV are comprised of vehicle and battery manufacturing, as well as grid electricity used to charge the battery. For the car without a battery, we assume 4.56 kg CO2-eq per kg of vehicle mass after Buberger et al.31, where this value is assumed to drop to zero until 2100 (assuming decarbonization of the economy). Each car is assumed to carry a 50-kWh battery. For battery manufacturing, 100 kg CO2-eq per kWh of capacity is taken from Kelly et al.32. We linearly reduce this value to zero in 2100 with the same reasoning as for vehicle manufacturing. We take the carbon intensity of grid electricity from 2020 to 2040 from IEA33 for the stated policies scenario (STEPS), the sustainable development scenario (SDS), and the net-zero scenario (NZE) and apply a break-down into countries and regions34,35. In our analysis, we map the STEPS scenario onto the BAU, SDS to MoR, and NZE to the Optimistic scenarios. We further assume an identical evolution of specific emissions in all countries. The consumption of electricity is assumed to be 15 kWh/100 km.

LCA of ICEs

For manufacturing an ICE vehicle, the emissions are assumed to be the same as for an EV without a battery. The combustion of one liter of gasoline emits 3.183 kg CO2-eq.21. We do not distinguish between gasoline and diesel vehicles but assume the same emission factor for a generic ICE vehicle. We assume a constant consumption of 5.9 L/100 km of ICE cars and an annual distance traveled of 15,000 km per vehicle (both for ICE and EV).

Selection of alternative fuels

We assume a selection of power-to-liquid fuels and different biofuels, i.e., HEFA fuels (hydrogenated esters and fatty acids) from the conversion of soybean oil and yellow grease, and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) conversion of herbaceous biomass, of municipal solid waste (MSW), of forestry waste, and agricultural residues. For HEFA fuels, the two indicated pathways serve as the basis for calculating costs and emissions, but the actual feedstock base is more extensive and comprises other waste oils, fats, and greases such as used cooking oil (UCO).

Fuel emissions

We use emissions for biofuels from Dray et al.18, who derive the values adjusting for future hydrogen and electricity emissions (assuming zero emissions for renewable electricity). For biofuels, the emissions of the fuel mix consisting of different fuel pathways are derived from the specific emissions of the single pathways18 and the breakdown of pathways in the potential analysis36. The biofuel supply is then assumed to always have this composition36, which is not a function of the scenarios used in our analysis. The emissions of power-to-liquid fuels are derived from the ICAO report on the feasibility of the long-term aspirational goal to defossilize aviation37, where the emissions for PtL derived from direct air capture of CO2 for IS1 are assumed for BAU, from IS2 for MoR, and IS3 for Optimistic. We do not distinguish between emissions of CO2 derived from waste sources or the air but assume all CO2 to come from the air.

Fuel availability

The available amounts of alternative fuels for the road transport sector are assumed to be the by-products of the alternative aviation fuels that often cannot be produced selectively, e.g., in the Fischer-Tropsch pathway. Several regulatory bodies, such as the United States and the European Union, have created incentives for producing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). We assume a global scale-up of SAF shares in the aviation sector as defined by the ReFuelEU Aviation38 (2% in 2025 up to 70% in 2050). Furthermore, we assume that in 2100, 100% of the jet fuel will have to be SAF. From 2050 to 2100, we will use a linear scale-up of these shares from 70% to 100%. As SAF are often produced with by-products in the middle distillate range, we assume that 39% of the SAF fuel volumes appear as road fuels (gasoline, diesel)36. These shares are then multiplied by the total SAF volumes that are derived by assuming aviation fuel demand to grow by 1.1–2.8% per year (lower end of the range: 1.1% annual growth until 2050 and no further growth; upper end of the range: 2.8% yearly growth until 2100; Fig. 6). In each of the three scenarios (BAU, MoR, Optimistic), the same availability of alternative fuels is applied, assuming aviation to be defossilized globally as announced by ReFuelEU Aviation38 irrespectively of the road fuel sector.

We use the maximum fuel production ramp-up rates from Dray et al.18 for biofuels and PtL fuels that cannot be exceeded. When biofuels reach their assumed maximum potential of 190 Mt/y of road fuels, no further growth is allowed, even though some reports indicate that further biomass potentials exist via the growth of lignocellulosic plants on marginal lands39,40,41,42. For PtL fuels, we do not assume a maximum potential as there is no fundamental limit to their production (assuming CO2 from DAC). Unless limited by the maximum biofuel potential, we assume the total road fuels to comprise 50% of biofuels and 50% of PtL fuels. Once the maximum production potential of 190 Mt/y for biofuels is reached, only the PtL fuels are assumed to be able to scale up further.

The transition to electric vehicles

The primary decarbonization strategy in the road transport sector is electrification43. Several countries and regions, such as the European Union, US states, Canada, and India, have announced a ban on internal combustion engines (ICE) until or before 204044. Combining EVs’ high efficiency with renewable electricity, the overall emissions of road-based transport could be brought to near zero (while already being locally emission-free). While many legislators recognize the long-term target, transitioning to electric vehicles requires a large-scale infrastructure adaptation, from establishing electricity generation, distribution, and transmission to local charging. This transition has already begun, but its completion will require time and large investments. Developing countries and remote regions will likely take more time in this process, and some sectors or regions may not be electrified at all. In this transitory phase, the fleet will comprise a growing share of electric vehicles and a remaining share of cars with internal combustion engines.

As the electrical grids are being decarbonized, the emissions of electric vehicles are also decreasing (towards zero for a fully renewable chain). In contrast, the emissions of ICEs depend on the fuel used. The emission reduction potential for fossil fuels is about 17% when all process steps in the supply chain are decarbonized45 while alternative fuels can decrease the emissions by 80–90% or even more46,47,48,49. The emissions from passenger cars and light-duty vehicles (LDV), therefore, depend on the speed of this transition (involving the generation of renewable electricity, electrical grids, EVs, and charging stations) and to which degree alternative fuels are used.

Figure 1 analyzes the transition to EVs based on renewable electricity availability and EV sales development in different regions. Three cases are defined: (i) a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, (ii) a middle-of-the-road (MoR) scenario, and (iii) an optimistic scenario. The scenarios’ sales shares50 and grid electricity emissions are based on the IEA scenarios for stated policies, sustainable development (compliant with the Paris climate goals), and the net-zero goal (limiting global warming to 1.5 °C), respectively. Additionally, we distinguish between developed and emerging countries29 because of their fundamentally differing underlying developments. While the markets in developed countries such as the US or most of the EU are saturated concerning the total number of vehicles, strongly growing economies such as China or India will experience significant growth in the vehicle fleet.

In developed countries, the sales share of EVs is projected to increase faster, mainly due to the higher available financial resources (both on a national and personal level) that allow to compensate for the higher cost of electric vehicles today. In the BAU scenario, the maximum EV sales share only reaches about 40%, leaving most of the future fleet composed of ICEs. In the MoR and optimistic cases, the sales shares of electric vehicles reach 80% or more, converting the fleet to mostly EVs by 2040.

The resulting emissions of the ICE fleet are already falling today, except for the BAU scenario in emerging countries (which see a significant increase and a plateau towards 2100), where the increasing number of ICE cars leads to still rising emissions. The emissions of EVs experience a peak in the 2030 s for developed countries and around 2040 for emerging countries. This behavior is explained by the quickly growing fleet of EVs on the one hand and the decreasing carbon intensity of the electricity grids (and production of vehicles and batteries) on the other. The emissions keep rising with the growing fleet of EVs until grid decarbonization overturns this dynamic. As this process happens faster in developed countries, the peak in EV emissions is seen in the 2030 s. Due to slower grid decarbonization, emerging countries peak in the 2040 s. The larger speed of electrification is also the reason why EV emissions are higher in the MoR (in emerging countries) or Optimistic scenarios (in developed countries) than in the BAU scenario. The different dynamics in electrification and grid decarbonization lead to the different order of scenarios in these two regions. In all scenarios and regions, the total emissions decrease from the BAU to the MoR and to the Optimistic scenario (see SI). These results agree with the findings of the IPCC AR6 WG III (Chapter 10)51, assuming similar emission reductions for the car and transport sectors (see SI for more information).

The scale of the problem

Most of the cumulative emissions are attributed to the ICEs in the fleet (remaining vehicles and newly registered ones, see Fig. 2). Figure 3 shows the cumulative emissions until the end of the century for the three scenarios broken down into vehicle type and time frame (today-2050 and 2051–2100). The emissions of the BAU scenario significantly exceed the carbon budget for all climate goals (1.5, 1.7, 2.0 °C): close to 300 Gt CO2-eq. are emitted until 2100, about two-thirds of which in the second half of the century. In this case, the largest share of emissions is due to the ICE fleet, which is decreasing in developed countries but increasing (although the respective sales share is decreasing) in emerging countries (see Supplementary Fig. 5 for more information). The yearly emissions drop insignificantly until the end of the century because the fleet increase in emerging countries compensates for the drop in emissions by electric vehicles, as can be seen clearly in the example of China (see emissions breakdown in Supplementary Fig. 5). In the MoR and Optimistic scenarios, the cumulative emissions stay below the two-degree budget but above the limit for a 1.5 °C-increase. The difference between the MoR and Optimistic scenarios is the latter’s faster and more extensive fleet electrification. This leads to a smaller ICE fleet and, thus, lower associated emissions, especially after 2050. If the ambitious electrification rates of these two scenarios can be reached, the Paris climate goal is achievable in the road-based transport sector. If, however, electrification should take a pace as in the BAU scenario or even slower, the climate goals are out of reach, and additional measures must be taken.

How do we reach the climate goals?

The road-based transport sector emits significant amounts of GHGs, which are not compliant with the climate goals in the business-as-usual case. A more considerable effort, including a diverse set of measures, may be required to limit emissions to a lower level in these cases. For each of the three scenarios, we analyze the effect of three measures to reach the climate goals (2.0, 1.7, 1.5 °C global warming until the end of the century).

Speed up current development—exclusively new electric cars

To avoid excessive emissions, a large ICE fleet using fossil fuels must be avoided, especially in the second half of the century. Thus, as a first measure, faster electrification is proposed—an obvious choice based on the projected emissions in the different scenarios (see emissions from ICEs and EVs in Fig. 3). We assume that from a given year on, only electric cars can be registered (Fig. 4). This goal has been set for 2035 in different regions of the world, i.e., the European Union and California, via a ban on conventional ICEs. Reaching this goal globally in 2035 would decrease the emissions significantly, especially in the BAU scenario, leading to lower cumulative emissions by about 270 Gt CO2-eq., until 2100. In the MoR and Optimistic scenarios, the reduction is still significant at about 50 Gt CO2-eq. These saved emissions are equivalent to moving the car sector by 0.7 °C or 0.1 °C closer (for the BAU or MoR/Optimistic scenarios) to its respective sector-related climate goals.

We find that the specific year of an ICE ban has only a minor influence on reaching the climate goals: even an ICE ban in 2050 would result in corresponding sector-specific emissions compatible with the Paris climate goals in all scenarios. Of course, an ICE ban presents a challenge, especially in emerging countries, where the electrical grid may not be adapted to the distributed loads, and there is a lack of charging infrastructure (including developing local grids). Likewise, countries with a distributed population may need help reaching full electrification soon due to the widespread infrastructure that must be implemented and EVs being most efficient in an urban environment. Nevertheless, it represents an effective instrument for reducing emissions, especially in the BAU scenario.

Limit car use globally—reduced fleet growth

The second proposed measure to reduce the emissions is a reduction of the fleet growth rate as projected by EIA12, which is used as a standard in all scenarios (Figs. 2, 4). In the EIA projection, the global car fleet is projected to grow from 1.4 billion today to about 2.2 billion in 205052. Significant growth is only expected in emerging countries, while the fleet size in developed countries is almost constant (Fig. 2). As a measure to reduce emissions, here we reduce the projected global growth by 0–100% and calculate cumulative emissions (Fig. 5). By continuing the projection, assuming a constant fleet size in developed countries after 2050 and gradually decreasing growth in emerging countries (by 2% annually, see), the global car fleet will reach 2.5 billion units at the end of the century. Limiting this growth rate reduces the number of vehicles without changing the projected electrification rate. This effectively cuts the number of newly registered cars, mainly affecting emerging countries with slower electrification rates. Consequently, the number of new ICEs entering the fleet is reduced, reducing the emissions. This effect is most significant in the BAU scenario, where the EV sales share reaches only 40% in emerging countries.

Use synergies in the system – alternative fuels as by-products from the aviation sector

Reducing emissions in the car sector does not necessarily require electrification. It can also be achieved by using alternative fuels with lower specific emissions than fossil fuels. Currently, these fuels are used in the car sector as either ethanol and biodiesel (mixed with gasoline and diesel) or in the aviation sector, where they are produced from plant oils and represent a core pillar of the defossilization strategy53. A significant volume increase in ethanol and biodiesel production would cause competition for land with food and fodder production and is likely of limited potential. As legislation in the EU and other regions requires rising shares of alternative fuels in aviation, the production volumes are expected to increase over the following decades. Various fuel pathways are being developed, using biological and non-biological carbon as a resource base to satisfy the demand. Most of these have in common that they are not selective, i.e., they not only produce jet fuel but a mix of different hydrocarbons, including gasoline54. It is likely that large amounts of gasoline as a by-product will become available from the aviation sector, which could help to reduce emissions in the automotive industry. To estimate these by-products’ amount, we assume that the required shares of alternative fuels in ReFuelEU Aviation38 (2% in 2025, rising to 70% in 2050) are reached globally, following the emission reduction goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 as suggested by IATA53. We use a fixed by-product share of 39% of road fuels concerning aviation fuel volumes36. Furthermore, aviation fuel burn is assumed to grow annually by 1.1–2.8%18, with growth estimates subject to large uncertainties. To cover a broad range of fuel demand in the aviation sector, we use a lower bound of 1.1% fuel demand growth until 2050 (and constant fuel demand after that) and an upper bound of 2.8% annual growth until 2100. The resulting by-product volumes are shown in Fig. 6, where we explicitly contrast the expected fuel production in these aviation growth scenarios with the theoretical maximum fuel production capacity18. While we do not further disaggregate techno-economic feasibility or policy risk, the upper and lower aviation growth bounds serve as a proxy for uncertainties in supply scale-up. We acknowledge that additional constraints—such as fuel selectivity, land use, and lifecycle emissions—could influence actual supply and identify these as areas for future analysis. A detailed treatment of land use and lifecycle emissions is beyond the scope of this paper. In the MoR and Optimistic scenarios, aviation by-products could cover the demand of the remaining ICE fleet in the 2050ies even for a slowly growing aviation sector. For a strong growth of aviation, even the remaining fuel demand in the BAU scenario could be covered towards the end of the century, where the expected fuel production from aviation does not exceed the capacities of expected maximum ramp-up rates of fuel production facilities18.

Assuming all the liquid by-products from aviation become available for road transport, significant emission reductions are achievable: in the BAU scenario, cumulative ICE emissions could decrease by 12–28% (49–115 Gt), by 23–42% (32–58 Gt) in the MoR, and by 31–33% (34–37 Gt) in the Optimistic scenario (Fig. 7). The overall impact on emissions is limited because of the time it takes to ramp up fuel production and the road-based transport sector’s larger fuel demand than the aviation sector’s supply. Assuming strong growth of the aviation sector (see SI for more information), the annual emissions of the car sector can be reduced by more than half towards the end of the century, irrespective of the scenario. Considering that alternative fuels will appear as by-products from this sector, their contribution towards reducing emissions in the car sector can thus be precious. A further reduction of ICE emissions would require larger volumes of by-products from, e.g., the shipping sector or through dedicated production (in the absence of demand-side measures). In this case, the maximum foreseeable output (Fig. 6, gray dotted) would cover the remaining fuel demand of the car sector in the 2040ies (for the MoR and Optimistic scenarios) or towards 2060 in the BAU scenario. Of course, the actual alternative fuel share will be determined by costs, which, in detail, exceeds the scope of this study.

For many people, personal road transport is an essential part of daily life and enables them to travel between families and communities or commute to work. It is also a significant source of global emissions, threatening to overburden the global ecosystem. Bringing our emissions to zero and maintaining our standard of living is one of the major challenges we face in this century. Accomplishing this task in the transport sector requires a global effort by switching to a renewable energy base. Considering the urgency and magnitude of the efforts and investments involved, a clear strategy for decarbonizing the car sector is required.

With the analysis above, we aim to quantify the effects of different pathways towards reducing emissions in the car sector. Below, the most important findings are summarized and discussed.

Emissions from the car sector represent a significant share of the total emissions and must be reduced to comply with climate goals

About 9.5% of global CO2 emissions are emitted by cars today55,56. If only stated policies are enacted, the cumulative emissions until 2100 will surpass the car sector’s share of the two-degree carbon budget. Additional efforts have thus to be made to reduce the emissions.

Emerging countries experience substantial growth in their car fleets, while developed countries have an almost constant number of vehicles

This is mainly due to the correlation between GDP and car ownership57, which leads to fleet growth occurring primarily in the large emerging economies of China, India, and Brazil. Therefore, an effective reduction of future emissions is tied to a strategy addressing both new registrations and existing cars in the fleet. A global effort to enable a quick transition to an electric vehicle infrastructure especially in the emerging economies could help to prevent the sale of a large number of ICE vehicles using conventional fuels.

Electrification is the most effective means of reducing new car’s emissions while maintaining equitable mobility

In most economies, EVs already achieve lower emissions than ICEs today. If electrification cannot be scaled up quickly, the car fleet will be composed of ICEs for a long time. To comply with the climate goals, these vehicles must be defossilized with alternative fuels. Otherwise, more drastic measures must be taken to limit global car sales or use. Because global fleet growth mainly happens in emerging economies, limiting car sales would hinder these economies’ growth. Considering that developed countries have contributed the most emissions to this day starting from the industrial revolution and the establishment of economies built on the conversion of coal and oil, this measure would be questionable to achieve an equitable distribution of efforts to prevent climate change. A more promising approach would be the establishment of an EV infrastructure in strongly growing countries to prevent the global growth of the ICE fleet. This could potentially happen via bilateral or global efforts including but not limited to a global emissions trading system that facilitates the financing of measures to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases where it is the most economical.

Alternative fuels are a suitable way to reduce the emissions of the remaining ICE fleet and are likely to be available in sufficient quantities as by-products from other sectors such as aviation

Alternative fuels are currently under development and can reduce specific emissions by more than 90%47. Sectors such as aviation and shipping depend on the continuous use of liquid fuels, which, together with regulatory decisions, will create a large market for alternative fuels. The production of these fuels is, in many pathways, not selective: by-products will be produced that could be used in the road transport sector to decrease the emissions of the remaining ICE fleet. For large-scale production, the costs of alternative fuels could drop to values below the market price of fossil fuels in most countries18,38,58,59,60. To establish a quick ramp-up of these production volumes, a global effort is required creating an (ideally unified) regulatory framework that allows to export alternative fuels to other markets and the necessary ecosystem to attract investments. To this end, a reliable and ambitious legislation ramping up the shares of alternative fuels and the creation of financial instruments to attract long-term investors needed to support the scale-up of the technology will be crucial.

The most effective strategy to reduce the car sector’s overall emissions relies on quick electrification and defossilization of the remaining ICE fleet with alternative fuels

As a global option for equitable and climate-friendly mobility, electrification requires renewable electricity and a large-scale charging infrastructure. This process will likely require decades to complete, and in the transitory phase, ICEs comprise a large fraction of the car fleet. The only way to defossilize these vehicles is by exchanging the fossil fuel by a renewable one. Alternative fuels can effectively reduce the emissions of the remaining fleet of ICEs at potentially competitive cost if produced at scale and if synergies with other sectors (aviation, shipping) are leveraged. With this strategy, new electric vehicles and the remaining ICEs can be addressed, and the automotive sector’s total emissions can be reduced most effectively. To this end, regulation should address this challenge with a technologically open but ambitious framework that allows the defossilization of vehicles with either electrification or alternative fuels and that accounts reliably and transparently the emissions created in either case. This will open a long-term perspective for investors required to finance the scale-up and establishment of infrastructures of both technologies. In the end, there is no need to be on the fence.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44333-025-00051-7/MediaObjects/44333_2025_51_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-09-01 01:58:29.911006

Natural gas is primarily methane, and leaks in pipelines can lead to serious environmental issues.
Furthermore, while it is cleaner than coal or oil, natural gas still produces both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.","The Donald Trump-appointed head of the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a new natural gas pipeline in the Northeastern United States, despite criticism from myriad experts on the matter.

What's happening?

According to Canary Media, EPA Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin is advocating for the construction of the Constitution pipeline, which would transport natural gas from Pennsylvania into New York, citing the potential to save New Englanders money on their energy bills.

The pipeline was a long-shuttered project, proposed by energy development company Williams in 2014. In 2016, the state of New York rejected the proposal's water quality certification. The project was ultimately scrapped in 2020 after prolonged legal challenges but was resurrected in May after New York Governor Kathy Hochul reached a deal with the Trump Administration for an offshore wind platform, in return for relaxing the state's restrictions on new gas pipelines.

Enter Zeldin, who touts the new pipeline as a means to lower energy costs in the Northeast by bringing more natural gas to the region's power plants.

Why is this pipeline important?

There's just one problem with Zeldin's argument: Experts say it isn't true. Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, stated that the Constitution pipeline will not solve the region's insufficient natural gas supply problem.

""I am not aware of any large-scale gas supply projects into New England today,"" Dolan told Canary Media. ​""Until there is a way to increase that, I struggle to see how Constitution changes anything meaningful for us.""

Additionally, many Northeastern states are transitioning away from natural gas toward other forms of power generation.

""There certainly is an increasing demand for energy, particularly electricity,"" said Jeremy McDiarmid, managing director and general counsel for Advanced Energy United, per Canary Media. ​""But the narrative that natural gas is going to somehow create a big downward pressure on electricity and energy bills is just not proven out in the data.""

While natural gas isn't responsible for the kind of carbon pollution that coal or petroleum power plants are, it does produce its own forms of planet-heating pollution. Natural gas is primarily methane, and leaks in pipelines can lead to serious environmental issues. Furthermore, while it is cleaner than coal or oil, natural gas still produces both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

What's being done about the pipeline?

It's unclear what the pipeline's future is at this point, despite the administration's stance on it. The state of New York would still need to approve water quality permits before construction could begin.

In the meantime, experts say that a more effective strategy than building more pipelines would be to construct a more diverse system that is less reliant on natural gas.

In our daily lives, we can help reduce energy usage by switching to energy-efficient appliances and unplugging energy-hungry devices when they're not in use.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Constitution-pipelineimage-recUBQKqz4bolojxx.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 04:02:17.727328

Together, electrified vehicles now hold a 69.7% share, a stark contrast to ICE vehicles’ 27.3% [2]. This transition creates clear investment opportunities in automakers and suppliers positioned to capitalize on the shift.

Market Dynamics: Hybrid Dominance and BEV Resilience

Hybrids have emerged as the bridge between ICE and full electrification. Their 45.7% market share in July 2025 reflects consumer pragmatism—combining fuel efficiency with range flexibility [1]. Meanwhile, BEVs, though facing a 4.3% year-to-date decline in registrations compared to 2024, remain resilient. The Renault 5 E-Tech, for instance, dominated the BEV segment in France, selling 2,813 units in January 2025 and maintaining strong corporate fleet demand, which grew 70% year-on-year [3]. This resilience is bolstered by government incentives, including a revised ecological bonus and a social leasing program set to launch in September 2025 [4].

Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), however, face headwinds. Their market share fell to 7.2% in July 2025, down from 8.2% in July 2024, as consumers increasingly opt for either BEVs or conventional hybrids [1]. This trend underscores the importance of automakers like Renault and Stellantis, which are pivoting toward BEV-native platforms and affordable hybrids.

Strategic Automakers: Renault and Stellantis

Renault’s electrification strategy is a standout. The Renault 5 E-Tech has sold nearly 49,000 units since its 2025 launch, contributing to a 44% electrified vehicle share in Europe [5]. The company’s focus on B-segment EVs and hybrid models, coupled with global expansion in markets like South Korea, positions it as a key player. Similarly, Stellantis is leveraging its multi-energy platform strategy, with affordable models like the Fiat Grande Panda and Citroën e-C3 targeting a projected 18% EV market share in 2025 [6]. Its Atlante charging network and partnerships with European charge point operators further solidify its infrastructure advantage.

Financially, both automakers are navigating challenges. Stellantis reported a 14% revenue drop in Q1 2025 due to lower shipment volumes, but its hybrid market share rose to 15.5%, and BEV share hit 13% [7]. Renault, meanwhile, saw a 2.9% global sales increase in Q1 2025, with electrified vehicles accounting for 44.2% of European sales [8]. These figures highlight their ability to adapt to shifting demand.

Suppliers and Infrastructure: The Hidden Levers

While automakers grab headlines, suppliers like Bosch, Continental, and ZF are critical to France’s electrification. Though specific contracts in France are not detailed, these firms dominate the European EV ecosystem, supplying components such as batteries, power electronics, and optimized tires for commercial fleets [9]. For example, Continental’s white paper on electric mobility emphasizes tire solutions to reduce CO₂ emissions in electrified commercial vehicles [10].

Infrastructure investments are equally vital. France’s “battery valley” in Hauts-de-France, anchored by gigafactories from Automotive Cells Company and Verkor, aims for self-sufficiency in battery production by 2027 [11]. Meanwhile, Milence’s electric freight corridor from Barcelona to Lyon exemplifies the expansion of charging networks, supported by €1.5 billion in subsidies and a 45% investment tax credit [12]. These developments create tailwinds for suppliers and automakers alike.

Investment Opportunities

The transition to electrified vehicles offers three key entry points:

1. Automakers with strong BEV and hybrid portfolios: Renault and Stellantis are well-positioned, with Renault’s focus on affordability and Stellantis’ multi-energy platforms.

2. Suppliers in the EV value chain: Bosch and Continental’s roles in components and infrastructure provide recurring revenue streams.

3. Infrastructure developers: Companies expanding charging networks or battery production, such as Milence and ProLogium, benefit from government incentives.

However, risks persist. Consumer hesitation in H1 2025 led to a 6.4% drop in EV registrations, though this is expected to reverse with the social leasing program’s return [13]. Investors must also monitor PHEV declines and the pace of ICE phaseouts.

Conclusion

France’s automotive market is a microcosm of the global shift to electrification. While hybrids dominate today, BEVs and infrastructure investments are the long-term drivers. Automakers like Renault and Stellantis, alongside suppliers and infrastructure players, offer compelling opportunities for investors willing to navigate the transition’s complexities.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 02:01:48.172603

As of Monday, Sept. 1, Texas will have a whopping 835 new laws on the books.

These measures touch nearly every aspect of life, from education and healthcare to public safety, property rules and support for first responders. With so many changes coming at once, Texans can expect a variety of noticeable impacts on their daily lives, plus shifts in how some state agencies operate.

To catch you up ahead of the big day, The Texas Newsroom and partner stations across the state have broken down some of the most significant measures below — plus other noteworthy new laws you may not have heard about yet.

Restrictions on Texas land purchases for certain foreign-linked people

Senate Bill 17 bars individuals, companies and government-affiliated entities with ties to China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from buying most Texas real estate, including homes, commercial property and farmland.

Visa holders from those nations may purchase one residence to live in, but no additional properties. Violations carry criminal penalties for individuals and steep civil fines for companies. A lawsuit challenging the law is pending at the 5th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals.

Texas bans THC vapes and foreign-made e-cigarettes

Senate Bill 2024 makes it illegal to sell or advertise certain e-cigarettes, including those containing THC, kratom, kava, alcohol or mushrooms.

The law also bans e-cigarettes made in China and other designated foreign countries and expands the definition of e-cigarettes to include non-nicotine vapes. Additionally, SB 2024 restricts products that appeal to minors, such as those resembling food, school supplies, or cartoons.

Smoke shop owners across the state are already adjusting their inventories to comply. Of note: The law is separate from the ongoing debate in Texas over broader THC regulation.

‘Make Texas healthy again’

Senate Bill 25, known as the “Make Texas Healthy Again” law, requires medical schools to teach nutrition and adds new continuing education requirements for physicians. It also bars schools from taking away recess as punishment for younger students.

Starting in 2027, many processed foods with additives must carry a warning label stating the ingredient is not recommended for human consumption by a number of regulators. Supporters say the change will give Texans clearer information about food safety, while critics warn it could confuse shoppers or face legal challenges.

Texas to ban student DEI and LGBTQ+ clubs

Senate Bill 12 prohibits K-12 student organizations based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The law also expands parental oversight, granting access to students’ curriculum, mental and physical health records and requiring schools to notify parents when students request a nickname or different pronouns. Non-compliance by teachers may result in disciplinary action.

Critics warn the law strips much-needed support from LGBTQ+ youth, while supporters say it preserves parental rights and ends “woke DEI indoctrination.”

$1.5 Billion in funds for Texas’ film incentive program

Senate Bill 22 invests $1.5 billion in the Texas Moving Image Industry Program to attract film, TV shows, commercials, animation and video game production to the state.

The program has operated for nearly 20 years, but its budget was previously debated each session. Now, $300 million will be guaranteed every two years through 2035. Projects starting after Sept. 1 can apply for rebates of up to 31% of qualified in-state spending.

A coordinated campaign by Texas filmmakers and actors, like Matthew McConaughey and Taylor Sheridan, helped secure this legislative win by testifying at the Texas Capitol.

Patients to receive some test results on a delayed schedule

Senate Bill 922 delays the electronic release of certain medical test results for up to three days, giving doctors time to explain results to patients.

Previously, results for serious conditions — such as cancer or genetic diseases — were released immediately, sometimes leaving patients to receive life-changing information without guidance. Supporters say the change helps patients understand results in context.

Peer support network for first responders

House Bill 35 establishes a statewide peer support network for firefighters and EMS personnel. Modeled after a law enforcement program credited with reducing Texas police suicides, the network will connect first responders with confidential, peer-to-peer mental health support.

Advocates say the program could provide a vital lifeline for those coping with the stress and trauma of emergency work.

While the new law creating the support network goes into effect on Sept. 1, it’ll take a few months to ramp up: The program’s official launch isn’t expected until March 2026.

In the meantime, the state has filled in the gap by opening up its law enforcement peer support network to first responders — especially those involved in rescue and recovery efforts around July’s historic flooding.

New penalties for assaulting utility workers

Senate Bill 482 will increase penalties for assaulting utility workers, making it a third-degree felony and raising harassment to a Class A misdemeanor if the incident occurs while the worker is on duty.

Sponsored by Houston Sen. Carol Alvarado, the bipartisan measure was prompted by threats faced by utility crews restoring power after Hurricane Beryl.

“Despite these risks, utility workers remained on the front lines ensuring access to electricity, gas and telecommunications,” Alvarado said. “These changes ensure that utility workers receive the same level protection as other emergency personnel during times of crisis.”

The law covers workers in electricity, gas, telecommunications and pipeline industries and aims to give them the same protections as other emergency personnel.

Statewide alert system for agricultural and wildlife threats

House Bill 1592 will create a new statewide system that’ll centralize alerts about pests and diseases that threaten Texas plants and wildlife.

Right now, updates come from several state agencies, but under HB 1592 they’ll be compiled and managed online by the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Agency. Texans will also be able to sign up for electronic notifications.

Supporters say the change will help farmers and ranchers respond faster to invasive species — like the emerald ash borer, citrus psyllid and New World screwworms — which pose growing risks due to climate change and global trade.

Higher stakes for educators over ‘harmful materials’

Senate Bill 412 limits legal protections for teachers, librarians, medical professionals, and parents providing material deemed harmful to minors.

For decades, an “affirmative defense” protected those using such material for educational, scientific, medical, government or legislative purposes — but starting Sept. 1, that protection will no longer apply to educators or other non-officials, leaving it only for judges and law enforcement.

Supporters say the change closes a decades-old loophole, while critics warn it could drive self-censorship and limit access to legitimate educational content, including LGBTQ+, racial and sexual health materials.

Cities banned from using funds to assist with abortion access

Senate Bill 33 restricts local governments from using public funds to support women seeking abortions. It specifies that taxpayer money may not be given to either abortion providers or funds that assist with out-of-state abortion access. It also bans public funds from being used to offer help with child care, travel, lodging or other types of “logistical support” for abortion seekers.

Texas cities including Austin and San Antonio had previously set aside money to support organizations or individuals seeking out-of-state abortion care. Both cities attracted lawsuits from Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argued that the funds violated the Texas Constitution, as well as the state’s abortion bans.

Texas boosts resources for volunteer firefighters

Senate Bill 34 is designed to help rural and volunteer firefighters respond more effectively to wildfires. The law, prompted by the 2024 Panhandle fires that burned over a million acres, creates a statewide database of firefighting equipment to improve coordination and air support.

It also increases state funding for volunteer firefighters in areas the forest service identifies as high risk. Sen. Kevin Sparks, a Midland Republican who authored the law, said it addresses gaps that hindered response times during last year’s disasters.

“Despite the heroic efforts of the volunteer firefighters, response times were hindered by a lack of timely air support, poor communication between agencies and responders, largely due to incompatible equipment,” Sparks said earlier this year.

The IRS update applies to various types of electric vehicles, including used, new, and leased EVs, aligning with specific sections of the tax code.
In addition to the extended timeline for the tax credit, consumers have the option to receive the benefits as an instant rebate at the point of sale.
Notably, this instant rebate option allows consumers without a tax liability to also benefit from the credit.
As the deadline approaches, consumers are encouraged to explore their options and act accordingly to maximize the financial incentives available for their electric vehicle purchases.","A significant change in federal tax incentives for electric vehicle (EV) buyers is on the horizon, as consumers prepare for the impending expiration of tax credits valued at up to $7,500 after September 30. However, a recent update from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) suggests that there may still be options available for consumers looking to take advantage of these credits.

The tax breaks, which were eliminated as part of a Republican tax and spending measure passed in July, stipulate that the eligibility for a tax credit is contingent on the point at which the vehicle is “acquired.” Initial interpretations indicated that consumers needed to have the vehicle physically in their possession by the cutoff date. However, the IRS clarified that consumers can still qualify for the tax credit if they have a “written binding contract” in place and make a payment on or before September 30, regardless of when they take possession of the EV.

Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, emphasized that this IRS clarification provides a glimmer of hope for consumers who may not be able to drive off in their new vehicles by the deadline. “This means that if you can’t drive off in the clean vehicle of your dreams by Sept. 30, there is still hope,” she remarked.

The IRS update applies to various types of electric vehicles, including used, new, and leased EVs, aligning with specific sections of the tax code. Malmgren noted that consumers can secure their vehicles by ordering from a dealer or manufacturer, signing a contract, and making a deposit ahead of the deadline, with the further stipulation that the vehicle also meets certain eligibility criteria.

In addition to the extended timeline for the tax credit, consumers have the option to receive the benefits as an instant rebate at the point of sale. This provides the advantage of accessing funds more quickly without needing to wait until filing their annual tax return. Notably, this instant rebate option allows consumers without a tax liability to also benefit from the credit.

To ensure proper processing, taxpayers are advised to obtain a time-of-sale report from the dealer when they take possession of their EV or within three days following the pickup. This step is crucial to secure the tax benefits associated with the transaction.

About Sibanye Stillwater

Operates as a precious metals mining company in South Africa, the United States, Europe, and Australia.

What are the underlying business or industry changes driving this perspective?

Technological innovation and the rapid global adoption of battery electric vehicles are accelerating the substitution of platinum group metals, particularly palladium and platinum, in catalytic converters. This will likely erode Sibanye Stillwater's core PGM revenue and long-term earnings, as evidenced by downward revisions to light-duty vehicle and battery electric vehicle production forecasts.

Intensifying environmental regulations and increasing global expectations on sustainability are translating into higher compliance and remediation costs. This will raise recurring operational expenditure, compressing net margins and putting pressure on the company's ability to maintain profitability, especially in its South African and French operations which already face headcount and ramp-down challenges.

Persistent operational instability in South Africa, including labor unrest, safety incidents, aging mine infrastructure, and seismicity-induced stoppages, continues to threaten consistent production. This undermines revenue predictability and increases the risk of costly supply disruptions-which were highlighted by disappointing gold production and guidance cuts.

Excess supply and depressed near

and medium-term lithium prices have resulted in significant impairments and will continue to hinder the ramp-up and returns from new mining projects such as Keliber, placing long-term pressure on both Sibanye Stillwater's earnings resilience and its efforts to diversify away from PGMs.

Supply chain risks, rising resource nationalism, and tightening tax/regulatory regimes-particularly in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and potentially the U.S.-are likely to increase royalties and taxes over time and elevate expropriation risk. This will curtail after-tax returns and may necessitate further capital-intensive investments, restricting free cash flow and value creation for shareholders.

Sibanye Stillwater Future Earnings and Revenue Growth

Assumptions

How have these above catalysts been quantified?

This narrative explores a more pessimistic perspective on Sibanye Stillwater compared to the consensus, based on a Fair Value that aligns with the bearish cohort of analysts.

The bearish analysts are assuming Sibanye Stillwater's revenue will decrease by 0.1% annually over the next 3 years.

The bearish analysts assume that profit margins will increase from -3.2% today to 8.8% in 3 years time.

The bearish analysts expect earnings to reach ZAR 9.9 billion (and earnings per share of ZAR 3.47) by about August 2028, up from ZAR -3.6 billion today. The analysts are largely in agreement about this estimate.

In order for the above numbers to justify the price target of the more bearish analyst cohort, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 9.5x on those 2028 earnings, up from -26.6x today. This future PE is lower than the current PE for the US Metals and Mining industry at 12.9x.

Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to remain consistent over the next 3 years.

To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 19.34%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.

Sibanye Stillwater Future Earnings Per Share Growth

Risks

What could happen that would invalidate this narrative?

The ongoing energy transition and electrification trends are expected to drive robust long-term demand for battery metals like lithium, nickel, and copper, as well as platinum group metals, supporting Sibanye Stillwater's future revenue growth and insulating earnings from a potential decline in commodity prices.

Strategic diversification into recycling, battery metals, and circular economy assets positions Sibanye Stillwater to benefit from increased sustainability requirements and supply chain localization for critical minerals, which could enhance revenue stability and support profit margins.

Operational efficiency improvements, restructuring, and mechanization projects in both South Africa and the U.S. have already led to reduced costs and increased margins, and continuing investment in such initiatives could sustainably raise net margins and earnings.

Recovery in PGM prices and anticipated supply deficits in both primary and secondary PGM markets after 2026, alongside disciplined cost management, create a favorable environment for stronger long-term EBITDA and free cash flow.

The company's strong balance sheet, improved liquidity position, and conservative capital allocation-alongside access to tax credits (such as the U.S. Section 45X credits) and government grants-reduce financial risk and could allow for renewed dividend payments and further investment, bolstering both revenue and profit prospects.

Valuation

How have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?

The assumed bearish price target for Sibanye Stillwater is ZAR19.5, which represents the lowest price target estimate amongst analysts. This valuation is based on what can be assumed as the expectations of Sibanye Stillwater's future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors from analysts on the more bearish end of the spectrum.

However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of ZAR50.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just ZAR19.5.

In order for you to agree with the bearish analysts, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be ZAR112.2 billion, earnings will come to ZAR9.9 billion, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 9.5x, assuming you use a discount rate of 19.3%.

Given the current share price of ZAR33.34, the bearish analyst price target of ZAR19.5 is 71.0% lower. Despite analysts expecting the underlying buisness to improve, they seem to believe the market's expectations are too high.

We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.

During the meeting, Awad emphasized that the Central Department for Climate Change plays a pivotal role in advancing Egypt’s climate commitments and strengthening coordination with both domestic and international partners. She underscored the urgency of equipping climate units across government ministries with the necessary training to accelerate the implementation of climate adaptation and mitigation measures.

The Ministry of Environment presented an assessment report evaluating how various ministries are addressing climate change.

In parallel, the ministry has begun developing an adaptation framework for the governorates of Qena and Kafr El-Sheikh, in partnership with Germany’s GIZ.

Ali Abu Senna, head of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, noted that the ministry is currently digitizing its monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) system to track greenhouse gas emissions across key sectors including energy, agriculture, industry, and waste. The system also monitors climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, while documenting extreme weather events—such as heatwaves, cold spells, and unseasonal rainfall—and their impacts on vulnerable sectors, particularly agriculture.

With an expected completion date in the first half of 2027, Pampa Fidelia will supply enough energy to power 300,000 homes.

Juan Villavicencio, managing director of renewables and batteries at ENGIE Chile, noted the significant capabilities of renewable energy in Chile.

""In 2025 alone, we managed to connect 468 MW of green energy to the country's energy matrix, and today we are happy to celebrate this great achievement for our company, as well as for Chile,"" Villavicencio said.

As a major energy resource, wind farms are able to offer significant environmental benefits by providing a clean, renewable, and sustainable source of electricity while helping to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

""All this work is key to our ambition to have an installed capacity of 3.5 GW by 2027, of which more than 60% will be renewable energy and storage. Our transformation, along with the coal phaseout, is much more than a plan; it is a reality,"" Villavicencio said.

Adoption of wind energy lowers carbon pollution and improves air quality. Wind farms can also make electricity more affordable for both utility companies and consumers by reducing the cost of energy production and offering price stability.

While North Carolina‘s population grew at the eighth-fastest rate in the U.S. over the past decade, Graham County declined by about 800 residents.
“People had to move away to find jobs,” says Lynn Cody, a Graham County commissioner for 20-plus years.
EcoKing’s new jobs are expected to pay an annual salary averaging $46,707 a year, about $1,100 more a year than the current Graham County pay.
Just before the first big meeting between Graham County leaders and EcoKing executives, Carpenter realized none of the N.C. team spoke Mandarin.","More than a decade after Graham County suffered an economic body blow with the closing of its biggest manufacturer, a Chinese company is stepping up with a planned $80.5 million to create 515 jobs in Robbinsville.

Foreign companies have announced investments of $43.5 billion and the promise of almost 65,000 jobs in the Tar Heel state over the previous 10 years. But mountainous Graham County, the third-least populous N.C. county, missed out.

“It’s an extremely rural county that doesn’t get a whole lot of looks,” says Solange Tricanowicz, a recruitment manager for the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. That’s part of what made EcoKing Solutions’ jobs announcement in July such a major win for the far western edge of the state.

EcoKing Solutions says it will start manufacturing biodegradable paper products by next year for customers, including Chipotle and Panda Express. Plans call for 300 employees by 2027. Another 215 workers are expected after Duke Energy increases the site’s electrical capacity from 8 megawatts to 24 megawatts.

If EcoKing follows through on its promises, it will be the largest private employer in Graham County, which has about 8,050 residents and a labor force of 3,646.

Potential new industry offers hope for an area that lost 400 jobs when Stanley Furniture closed in 2014 after offering employment to generations of workers for three decades. While North Carolina‘s population grew at the eighth-fastest rate in the U.S. over the past decade, Graham County declined by about 800 residents. Robbinsville, the county seat about 90 miles west of Asheville, has a population of about 563 residents, about 190 fewer than in 2010.

“People had to move away to find jobs,” says Lynn Cody, a Graham County commissioner for 20-plus years. “We’re hoping this will bring some people back.” He calls EcoKing’s decision a “true blessing.”

EcoKing’s parent company started in 2008 in China, where it employs about 1,200 workers. The company started looking for a U.S. site more than a year ago because 80% of its products are sold to American fast-food restaurants and grocery stores, says John Lin, the vice president and project lead.

“Our clients like to use a product made in the U.S.A.,” says Lin, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Taiwan. He’s moving his family from Atlanta to Robbinsville.

While EcoKing started looking at expanding before the recent friction in U.S.-China trade relations, Lin says President Donald Trump’s threats of higher tariffs on the Asian nation helped push it forward. “Tariffs do affect us a lot,” he says.

The company will use the region’s forests to turn timber into wood pulp to make its products, helping avoid trade duties, says Lin. “We can say we’re made in the U.S.A. and then sell our products to the world.”

The U.S. had a $101 billion trade deficit with China during the first five months of this year, with $148.5 billion in imports and $48.6 billion in exports, government data shows. The deficit totaled more than $1.3 billion over the past four years.

EcoKing’s new jobs are expected to pay an annual salary averaging $46,707 a year, about $1,100 more a year than the current Graham County pay. Those wages are “incomparable” to the low wages earned by EcoKing workers in China, says Lin, but the company will benefit from lower shipping costs.

WHY ROBBINSVILLE

How did a company 7,500 miles away find tiny Robbinsville? It starts with the 2014 closing of the Stanley plant, says Josh Carpenter, director of the seven-county Mountain West Partnership, which oversees regional economic development.

Stanley’s 601,000-square-foot building is the county’s “largest roof,” Carpenter says. In 2016, Oak Valley Hardwood moved into a “postage stamp” portion of the building, and about 30 workers rough-milled lumber and shipped it to China, where it was turned into furniture and other products. That business closed at the start of the pandemic in 2020.

The previous business owner tried to market the building on his own without success. In late 2023, after Carpenter convinced the owner to use a broker, the building immediately began to attract attention from data centers and potential tenants because of its size and available electric power. The all-brick building is “built like a tank,” says Carpenter. “There’s nothing else like it in the county.”

EcoKing’s parent company was scouring several Southern states to locate its first U.S. factory. A phone call from its real estate broker in Atlanta set the wheels in motion,

says Carpenter.

EcoKing needed a big building because it wants to build three production lines here. “More space equals more production equals more people,” says Carpenter.

Recruiting a Chinese company presented unique circumstances. Just before the first big meeting between Graham County leaders and EcoKing executives, Carpenter realized none of the N.C. team spoke Mandarin. A day before the meeting, he recruited Western Carolina University business professor Yue Cai Hillon, who is from the same region in China as EcoKing’s parent company. That was an unexpected bonus, Carpenter says.

The rest of the project followed a fairly normal process. “As everyone is, they were enamored with the beauty of the place, first,” says Carpenter.

State and local incentives totaling about $7.5 million, which are tied to meeting job and investment targets, helped close the deal. About 60 Chinese-owned companies operate in the state, though scrutiny has tightened in recent years as trade relations became more tense, according to state economic development officials.

EcoKing expects to draw workers from a 45-minute drive, including Cherokee, Macon and Swain counties. It plans to invest at least $10 million prepping the property over the next year and will use as many local workers as possible, Lin says. Construction jobs will employ about 100 people. EcoKing plans a showroom in Robbinsville for new customers, bringing more exposure to the region.

County residents also helped sell the project, says Carpenter. EcoKing executives ”just kept saying, ‘You all are the nicest people.’” ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EcoKing_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 03:00:07.775088

Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.

Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.

And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.

Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.

Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.

“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.

But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.

“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”

Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.

State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.

For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.

But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.

“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.

Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.

Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.

“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”

Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.

State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.

Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.

“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.

Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.

O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.

Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.

Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.

Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.

In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.

O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”

New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.

Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.

“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

Jacqueline Esposito is a Long Island resident and director of advocacy at Waterkeeper Alliance.","Long Island has always been defined by our water. From the sparkling clarity of the Long Island Sound to the lifeblood in our aquifers, residents have long relied on these irreplaceable resources: springs, ponds, wells, and drinking taps. But growing evidence shows that legacy, and the trust we place in it, is now under serious threat from a commonly used yet highly toxic chemical that’s rampant in our environment.

A group of synthetic chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, has been detected in drinking water across Long Island and many other places around the world. Known as “forever chemicals,” these compounds are found in our water, air, fish, and soil because they don’t break down easily. These highly durable substances have been used in industrial and everyday consumer products since the 1950s to make them last longer. But that same strength means PFAS persist beyond these products and, due to limited or nonexistent regulation at all levels of government, they are able to travel through multiple pathways, lingering in our environment and bodies for decades.

As an unsurprising and arguably preventable consequence, a growing body of scientific research has linked PFAS to cancer, liver damage, thyroid disease, reproductive harm, and other serious health problems, even at extremely low levels of exposure, and is estimated to be contaminating the drinking water for 165 million people in America.

Waterkeeper Alliance, as part of a national monitoring initiative, recently released a report that found 98% of tested waterbodies were contaminated with one or more PFAS. Yet even as this evidence mounts, Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and former congressional representative for eastern Long Island, is preparing to roll back critical protections that limit these hazardous chemicals in our drinking water. The consequences for Long Islanders if he rolls back safeguards are stark: according to the Environmental Working Group, roughly 1.3 million New Yorkers, primarily on Long Island, rely on water systems that exceed the current federal thresholds for PFAS contamination that Zeldin is expected to roll back.

Zeldin faces a clear choice: stand with Long Islanders and protect our access to safe, clean drinking water or stand in the way. At a minimum, he must uphold and fully implement the EPA’s PFAS drinking water standards and invest in upgrades for wastewater treatment plants to remove these compounds. But the stronger path backed by scientists and public health experts is to go further. PFAS should be regulated as one hazardous class, not one chemical at a time. That would stop companies from simply replacing one toxic compound with another, and it would streamline testing, cleanup, and enforcement across original sources and pathways.

We cannot afford to weaken protections now. Long Islanders swim, drink, and fish in these waters. Our communities, health, and economy all depend on clean water. Zeldin knows this. As a member of Congress, he voted to limit PFAS in drinking water and hold polluters accountable. Now, as the head of EPA, he’s considering rolling back the very protections he once supported. He can’t have it both ways.

The world is racing towards a greener future, and the materials of tomorrow are being created today. For industries such as energy, high-tech manufacturing and construction to reach greater heights in advanced research and manufacturing, they require cutting-edge solutions. For over a century, Konoshima Chemical has been a leading Japanese company in materials and chemical research, development and manufacturing. More recently, its efforts in CO2 reduction, clean energy and transparent ceramics have garnered international attention.

The company is pioneering transparent ceramics, particularly Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG), which is being adopted across industries. YAG ceramics fill a variety of niches, including scientific research, medical, defense, industrial, fusion energy and high-intensity laser systems. In particular, the ceramics’ high transparency enables stable, high-output lasers required for fusion research and advanced physics, as its large size and superior thermal and mechanical durability outperform those typically employed in single crystals. Konoshima Chemical’s ceramics are being evaluated as critical components in high-powered laser assemblies critical for experimental fusion reactors. Laser fusion energy systems utilize extremely powerful laser pulses to rapidly compress and heat fuel, creating the extreme temperatures and pressures necessary to ignite a controlled thermonuclear reaction that releases vast amounts of clean energy, much like stars.

Konoshima Chemical ensures stable quality and can customize the dopant concentration levels to user requirements. The company’s transparent ceramics have been well-received internationally, as evidenced by the ceramics’ adoption by NASA and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States. He sees the 10 to 20-centimeter segment as having the greatest potential for Konoshima Chemical’s global expansion, as the company is the only producer capable of achieving quality higher than that of a crystal. There is considerable potential in autonomous vehicles; however, production costs remain relatively high for the consumer market.

Takuma Factory

Konoshima Chemical’s ceramics have a wide variety of applications across industries and scientific disciplines. Its Bonded LuAG Ceramic Scintillators are a key component in ultra-high-resolution X-Ray imaging. Developed with Japan’s RIKEN and the High Luminance Photon Science Institute, this technology enables 200 nm resolution—nearing the theoretical limit of X-ray imaging. The detector uses LuAG:Ce ceramics, bonded with precision for unmatched clarity. It’s applied in advanced imaging systems for detailed biological and material studies.

Konoshima Chemical has been recognized for advancing material performance and efficiency, reducing carbon emissions and promoting a safer, more human-centric work environment. “Our factory emits a significant amount of CO2, and we recognized that this isn't sustainable for the future. That led us to consider what actions we could take,” Fukawa says. When the company began exploring CO2 recycling, synergies within the company emerged. Konoshima Chemical has developed an innovative technology that can convert emissions into a valuable material. The company is in the early stages of its long-term plan to establish a system that utilizes the carbonization technology it developed for producing carbonate compounds as a raw material, achieving factory-level net-zero CO2 emissions—a first in Japan. “Our system has potential applications beyond our own operations and could be adopted by other companies and industries,” he says. The company was awarded the Good Design Award, which has led to enquiries within Japan. Fukawa says that the company plans to promote it globally as it is well-suited for international use. While there are theoretical alternatives, Konoshima Chemical’s solution is already available. “If the right conditions are in place, it can be deployed anywhere in the world right away,” he says.

With 108 years of operation under its belt, Konoshima continues to innovate, push boundaries and find solutions for tomorrow’s challenges. As its transparent ceramics enable breakthroughs in energy and science, its CO2 recycling is turning emissions into building materials. The company is reshaping advanced manufacturing and positioning itself as an innovative leader as global industries seek sustainable, high-performance materials. Speaking on ceramics, Fukawa, the company’s goals, “Moving forward, we hope to expand our reach into the private sector and generate sales in those areas.”",https://www.theworldfolio.com/img_db/articles/article-68adb15a159db.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 20:59:24.288625

Of the 163 eligible coal plants, 11 are in Texas and six have been approved, including Parish’s operator, NRG Energy.
In June, the Environmental Protection Agency under Trump proposed a rule to eliminate the 2024 MATS rule completely.
But owners of the chemical plants should not act so surprised, said Neil Carman, a former regulator for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
Carman pointed out that the heads of chemical companies have been in talks with Trump’s EPA since the election.","For Donna Thomas, smokestacks are a typical sight from her home in Fort Bend County, Texas. Since she was a child, she has seen the coal and natural gas-powered W.A. Parish Generating Station puff clouds of haze during the day and light up brightly at night. The facility — which has been around since 1958 — is both part of the background and all she thinks about.

Thomas is not alone. For decades, residents have expressed concerns over the pollution emitted from the Parish coal plant — a separate facility from the natural gas plant — and called for its closure. The plant, located about 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston, is ranked by Texas environmental regulators as one of the worst polluters in the state for certain hazardous emissions. These include mercury, a toxic heavy metal particularly harmful for children and pregnant people.

This year, mercury has been top of mind for environmental activists and residents like Thomas. In April, President Donald Trump announced an exemption for companies from implementing stricter Biden-era mercury regulations for two years. Of the 163 eligible coal plants, 11 are in Texas and six have been approved, including Parish’s operator, NRG Energy. In Missouri and Illinois, five coal plants have been exempted, and in Pennsylvania, all 12 of the coal plants seeking approval have been approved.

Then in July, Trump exempted chemical companies for two years from Biden’s 2024 HON Rule, a set of regulations that control hazardous air emissions from chemical plants called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The Trump administration determined the exemptions are in the country’s best interest and represent a burden on industry, and that the technology is not available to meet stricter regulations. Companies like NRG agree.

However, critics say the Biden administration’s 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards — called MATS for short — and the HON Rule were long overdue and the two-year delay in implementing them is merely a tactic to protect industry profit margins at the expense of public health.

Moreover, critics point out that the MATS delay may be giving companies the freedom to ignore toxic air emission rules until the Trump administration repeals the Biden-era regulations altogether. In June, the Environmental Protection Agency under Trump proposed a rule to eliminate the 2024 MATS rule completely.

The two rules together have set off alarm bells for experts and environmentalists in Texas, home to one of the world’s largest petrochemical sectors and 11 coal-powered plants. The exemptions will run from 2027 — when the Biden rules were supposed to take effect — to 2029.

“We know these rollbacks are not good for anyone, especially for those that are community fenceline,” said Thomas, also the founder and president of the Fort Bend Environmental — a grassroots organization focused on environmental justice. “We have around 1,000 homes within three miles of Parish, so that’s going to affect all of them.”

A Two-Year Delay

The EPA has been working on stricter environmental regulations for chemical plants since the early 1990s. Only in 2020 did Biden’s EPA begin drafting new rules in earnest.

But owners of the chemical plants should not act so surprised, said Neil Carman, a former regulator for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

“The chemical industry has known for decades that this was all coming, but they don’t like rules, because it means they have to put on more pollution control and they have to do more leak inspections,” said Carman, now the clean air director for the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club. “These plants will always tell you safety first, safety first, but then you run into this thing called money.”

Of the 79 chemical facilities in Texas requesting exemptions, 15 have been approved, including 13 along the Gulf Coast and the so-called petrochemical corridor.

Carman pointed out that the heads of chemical companies have been in talks with Trump’s EPA since the election. In March, the administration announced that companies could apply for exemption from MATS, HON and seven other sets of emissions standards.

That same month, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin met with Dow Inc. Chairman-CEO Jim Fitterling to discuss regulations imposed by the Biden administration, according to public records and emails obtained by the Sierra Club.

In one email sent on March 17, Dow reps asked to discuss “clarity” on the EPA’s recent announcement that it will reconsider the HON rule and “Dow has met with the Office of Air and Radiation regarding an extension of the current compliance deadline, which is impossible to meet.”

In May, Zeldin met with Fitterling and other chemical company CEOs to discuss the industry at large. Then in July, Trump announced the exemptions for HON, including for two chemical plants in Louisiana and one in Seadrift, Texas, operated by Dow and its subsidiary Union Carbide.

In a statement to Capital & Main, a Dow spokesperson said that “safety and integrity are at the core of both companies’ operations” and the “extensions are appropriate and necessary to address the technical challenges and to ensure the continued safe and efficient operation of these facilities.”

Carman doesn’t buy it. He worked as an environmental regulator in Texas for 12 years. Even then, he said, companies never seemed to be able to find the budget to limit their emissions and chemical leaks. For him, it’s still the cost.

“A lot of these are old plants and so when they go in and do all this work,” Carman said, “they have to find a place where they’re going to put in new controls and they have to engineer it. They have to design it all. It’s months of planning, but these rules were out there. They knew they were coming. They just want two more years of delay.”

Limiting Mercury

When the EPA implemented the 2012 MATS rule, mercury emissions dropped 86% — or four tons — in five years.

In 2024, Biden’s EPA approved a rule to strengthen MATS by tightening the emissions standards for mercury by another 70% and reducing pollutants discharged through wastewater from coal-fired plants by more than 660 million pounds per year.

The rule could prevent as many as 11,000 premature deaths, 2,800 cases of chronic bronchitis and 130,000 asthma attacks, according to the EPA under Biden.

However, in April, Trump approved the exemptions for 47 coal-powered plants across the nation. As of mid-August, 70 are now exempted, including Parish.

“These rules were just so critically important to people’s health,” said Surbhi Sarang, senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund. The Trump administration “was doing this process that was just not transparent. I mean, there was no process. Whereas in rulemaking, there’s public comment. This is just like a presidential action that was kind of taken in a vacuum and then announced.”

In response to the exemption, Erik Linden, senior director of communications at NRG, said the time is needed and will be used to evaluate the technology for air quality systems and monitoring equipment for compliance.

“All existing MATS emission controls will be properly maintained and remain in service,” Linden said of the current MATS rules that began in 2012. The exemption would give NRG until 2029 to implement the changes.

However, in July, Trump’s EPA proposed eliminating Biden’s rule entirely by the end of the year. Interested parties had three weeks to submit comments, and the Environmental Defense Fund’s request for an extension was denied.

“Rule-making usually takes 12-18 months if not longer,” Sarang said. “They’re moving very quickly.”

All of this is alarming for residents living near industry. With the extent of the changes to environmental regulations coming down from the Trump administration, there’s a lot for Thomas, the Parish generating station neighbor, to process. But she hasn’t given up. Increasingly, Thomas is talking to her neighbors and fellow residents about fighting back.

This means sending letters to representatives in Texas and in Washington, D.C. Thomas said it pays to be loud.

Parish is “going to do the same thing it’s been doing,” Thomas said. “If the EPA does not put a stop to these [emissions] getting out, then everyone is going to pay for this with their lives and in their water and in their air.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2150754136.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 20:59:45.922644

""China is shaping the energy landscape through green energy transformation marking a paradigm shift in global energy market.","Beijing, China, Aug. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the summer, scorching heat waves often send temperatures soaring beyond 45 C along the dry banks of the Jhelum River in Pakistan.

In a riverside village, local resident Ahmed reaches out to turn up the electric fan. As the room gradually cools down, his two children focus intently on their homework.

Just a few kilometers away from Ahmed's home, turbines at the Karot Hydropower Station spin at 100 revolutions per minute, continuously delivering clean electricity to surrounding regions.

Also benefiting from this power source are key residential and industrial load centers such as Gujranwala, Lahore and Rawalpindi in Pakistan.

With a total installed capacity of 720,000 kilowatts, the Karot Hydropower Station is expected to generate approximately 3.2 billion kilowatt-hours of clean electricity annually.

It could meet the daily electricity needs of around 5 million people and significantly alleviate Pakistan's power supply-demand gap, the Global Times learned from the China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG).

Dubbed ""Pakistan's Three Gorges Project,"" the Karot Hydropower Station is a flagship collaboration between China and Pakistan - both member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).

In recent years, SCO member states have actively advanced green energy transitions by introducing supportive policies and setting carbon reduction goals. Cooperation projects in hydropower, photovoltaics, wind energy, and nuclear energy have steadily moved forward.

In his speech in July 2024 at ""SCO Plus"" meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that ""we should build a common home of prosperity and development. Modernization is the shared goal of all countries in the SCO.""

China proposes that 2025 be designated as the SCO Year of Sustainable Development so as to help us focus on fostering new forces for growth, Xi said, according to the Xinhua News Agency.

Today, China's clean energy blueprint stretches across the SCO landscape - from the Tianwan and Xudapu nuclear power plants, to the Turgusun Hydropower Station and Kapshagay photovoltaic station in Kazakhstan; the Issyk-Kul solar farm and Toktogul Hydropower Station in Kyrgyzstan; the Bukhara wind farm and Navoi photovoltaic plant in Uzbekistan; and the Karot Hydropower Station in Pakistan - all emerging as new growth drivers among SCO member states.

""With the regional green transformation is taking effect in SCO with China being its central driver, it is making meaningful contributions to international climate goals by shifting large economies toward low-carbon pathways,"" Muhammad Asif Noor, secretary general of the Pakistan-SCO Friendship Forum, told the Global Times.

Train local talents with widespread recognition

New energy cooperation between China and its SCO partners has actively contributed to economic growth and improved livelihoods. The Karot Hydropower Station - the first hydropower project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) invested and developed by CTG - stands as a vivid example.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said before that the Karot Hydropower Project, a major pilot project under the CPEC, would generate environment-friendly and cheap electricity, promoting green development in Pakistan, according to a Xinhua report in 2022.

Muhammad Aftab Alam is one of the many beneficiaries of the project. As the safety manager of the Karot Hydropower Station, he told the Global Times that ""as one of the builders of the project, I feel extremely proud! It not only provides affordable clean energy, but more importantly, it has nurtured a large number of skilled and experienced Pakistani professionals who are well-versed in standards. They are the future and hope of this country.""

Alam joined the Chinese company in 2015 and is now considered a ""veteran employee."" ""I have been deeply moved by the professionalism and dedication of my Chinese colleagues who remain committed to overseas projects, far away from their families. We've built a strong sense of teamwork,"" he said.

Before joining the Chinese enterprise, Alam worked at a local hydropower station. His motivation for joining the Karot project was to create a better educational environment for his children. ""My children receiving better education and me having the chance to work on a larger platform - that's my goal.""

By integrating China's ecological civilization philosophy into CPEC construction and adhering to international environmental and social sustainability standards, the Karot project has earned wide recognition, including winning several Pakistani awards on social responsibility and environmental development.

Alam has also reaped many personal benefits - all three of his children have been admitted to university, and his eldest daughter is currently pursuing a doctoral degree.

""I hope they can leave something meaningful on this land,"" said Alam, ""just like the Karot Hydropower Station I see before me.""

""China is leading the green transition in the SCO through joint ventures, sustainable infrastructure, and green technology sharing that open doors for employment, development, and industrialization,"" Noor said.

Boost economy, green lifestyle

The Karot project is not a standalone case in the successful green cooperation between China and SCO partners as they are pursuing shared goals of greener future and low-carbon growth when the world is facing growing pressure from climate change.

In the verdant grasslands of Kazakhstan, a striking sight unfolds across the vast horizon: A series of wind turbines standing tall against the backdrop of the sky. This is the Akmola wind power project cluster, a significant investment by a Chinese enterprise in the region.

With a total installed capacity of 221 megawatts, this project cluster is set to supply 843 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity annually, which translates to a remarkable reduction of 278,300 tons of standard coal consumption and a decrease of 686,600 tons in carbon dioxide emissions each year, according to a report by the People's Daily on August 26.

The wind turbines, along with the monitoring, control, and data collection systems in this project, are all equipped with Chinese technology, specifically designed to withstand the harsh climatic conditions of the region, characterized by long winters and extreme low temperatures.

In the rugged mountains of Uzbekistan's Zarafshan region, wind turbines now dot the horizon - a landmark of change brought by the Zarafshan wind power project. For local residents, harsh winters once meant enduring frequent blackouts and the daily struggle of life without electricity. ""Cold and darkness have given way to warmth and light,"" local resident Alisher told the Global Times.

This transformation stems from a Chinese-built wind farm that not only strengthens local energy security, but has also created new job opportunities. Once fully operational, the project is set to supply green electricity to 500,000 households and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 1.1 million tons annually.

""It marks a significant step toward Uzbekistan's energy transition and sustainable economic development,"" a project employee previously shared with the Global Times.

In another special humanitarian initiative, a Chinese company has partnered with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to transform the Termez Cargo Center in Surkhandarya, Uzbekistan into a clean energy-powered hub. This solar upgrade, part of a broader climate action collaboration, marks a significant step toward sustainable energy solutions for emergency supply storage and transport, benefiting both refugees and host communities.

Besides large infrastructure projects, Chinese-brand new energy vehicles (NEVs) are also gaining momentum in many Central Asian cities, ushering a new trend of low-carbon transport. In the recently launched ""Green Mobility Week"" campaign in Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty, Chinese-made electric busies gained popularity during the event. In many other Central Asian cities, Chinese-made NEVs have also attracted fans.

Together for sustainable future

China is ready to work with all sides to carry forward the Shanghai Spirit, strengthen unity and coordination, promote green development, write a new chapter of common development, and jointly build an even closer SCO community with a shared future, Xi said in a congratulatory letter to the Green Development Forum of SCO Countries in July 2024, according to Xinhua.

Xi pointed out that it is the consensus of SCO countries to protect the environment and promote green development. China, committed to the philosophy that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets, has in recent years unswervingly pursued a model of sound development featuring improved production, higher living standards and healthy ecosystems, leading to remarkable achievements in building a beautiful China, Xinhua reported.

The ""China-SCO Renewable Energy Cooperation Report 2024"" released during the SCO Energy Ministers Meeting on June 26 shows that SCO member countries contribute half of the global renewable energy installed capacity. By the end of 2024, the renewable energy generation capacity of SCO member countries had reached 2.31 billion kilowatts, which is 14.5 times that of the organization's founding and accounts for approximately 50 percent of the global total. In 2024, the newly installed renewable energy capacity in SCO member countries reached 420 million kilowatts, accounting for about 72 percent of the global new renewable energy capacity, with China contributing over 370 million kilowatts.

""China is shaping the energy landscape through green energy transformation marking a paradigm shift in global energy market. This paradigm shift means a fast-paced approach toward carbon neutrality supported by landmark technological transformation in China. China's role is pivotal because it brings not only financial resources and technological expertise, but also a developmental philosophy that aligns economic growth with climate change goals,"" Noor told the Global Times.

With leaders from more than 20 countries and heads of 10 international organizations set to participate, the upcoming SCO Summit 2025 is expected to pool consensus and steer the organization toward building a closer community with a shared future.

China is ready to work with all sides to carry forward the Shanghai Spirit, strengthen unity and coordination, promote green development, write a new chapter of common development, and jointly build an even closer SCO community with a shared future, Xi said in a congratulatory letter to the Green Development Forum of SCO Countries in July 2024, according to Xinhua.

Xi pointed out that it is the consensus of SCO countries to protect the environment and promote green development. China, committed to the philosophy that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets, has in recent years unswervingly pursued a model of sound development featuring improved production, higher living standards and healthy ecosystems, leading to remarkable achievements in building a beautiful China, Xinhua reported.

The ""China-SCO Renewable Energy Cooperation Report 2024"" released during the SCO Energy Ministers Meeting on June 26 shows that SCO member countries contribute half of the global renewable energy installed capacity. By the end of 2024, the renewable energy generation capacity of SCO member countries had reached 2.31 billion kilowatts, which is 14.5 times that of the organization's founding and accounts for approximately 50 percent of the global total. In 2024, the newly installed renewable energy capacity in SCO member countries reached 420 million kilowatts, accounting for about 72 percent of the global new renewable energy capacity, with China contributing over 370 million kilowatts.

""China is shaping the energy landscape through green energy transformation marking a paradigm shift in global energy market. This paradigm shift means a fast-paced approach toward carbon neutrality supported by landmark technological transformation in China. China's role is pivotal because it brings not only financial resources and technological expertise, but also a developmental philosophy that aligns economic growth with climate change goals,"" Noor told the Global Times.

With leaders from more than 20 countries and heads of 10 international organizations set to participate, the upcoming SCO Summit 2025 is expected to pool consensus and steer the organization toward building a closer community with a shared future.

,Texas American Energy ,2025-08-31 23:20:11+00:00,ABC13 Houston,Over 800 new laws go into effect in Texas on Sept. 1. Here are some of the significant ones,"Alex Nguyen, The Texas Tribune",,,,,https://abc13.com/post/800-new-laws-go-effect-texas-sept-1-here-are-significant-ones/17704499/,"More than 800 new laws are about to take effect in Texas, bringing sweeping changes to the state's education systems, water infrastructure, and more.
A significant part of the law activated immediately, while another big chunk will take effect on Sept. 1.
Senate Bill 13 will give parents and school boards more power over what students can access in public school libraries.
Senate Bill 15, which received mixed support from both parties, will allow for certain single-family homes to be built on smaller lots.
Senate Bill 33 will ban cities or counties from using their money to support residents seeking abortions outside Texas.","More than 800 new laws are about to take effect in Texas, bringing sweeping changes to the state's education systems, water infrastructure, and more.

Gov. Greg Abbott signed 1,155 bills that came out of the regular legislative session, including over 200 laws that went into effect immediately, such as the school cellphone ban, the abortion ban clarification, the property tax cut, and increased oversight over the energy grid. Meanwhile, some won't activate until next year or until voters approve constitutional amendments in November, such as stricter bail policies and a $3 billion dementia research fund. In addition, there are 140 bills that the governor didn't take action on, including 34 that took effect immediately.

Most, however, will start on Sept. 1, the traditional date for laws passed during the regular session. Here are some notable measures that will soon take effect:

Senate Bill 1 lays out the state's new $338 billion two-year spending plan, with over 70% of the budget being reserved for education and health and human services. Some notable parts include spending to maintain and provide property tax cuts, a new school voucher program, additional funding for public schools, as well as investments in the state's energy, water, and broadband infrastructure.

The plan also initially included a $60 million measure that would have let Texas enter a federal summer lunch program for low-income kids, but Abbott vetoed it due to ""significant uncertainty regarding federal matching rates for this and other similar programs.""

Senate Bill 2 will create one of the country's largest school voucher programs, allowing parents to pay for their children's accredited private school tuition or other education-related expenses with public tax dollars. In most cases, each child will receive just over $10,000 per year, though students with disabilities could receive up to $30,000 in additional funding. Wealthier families with children already in private schools could also participate.

Texas can spend up to $1 billion during its upcoming two-year budget cycle, though the program's cost could rise significantly afterwards.

The law's passage followed years of fighting between GOP lawmakers, who framed the issue as providing school choice to parents, and Democrats and rural Republicans who said vouchers would harm public schools. Abbott threw his weight behind the effort to elect more pro-voucher Republicans and succeeded last year. SB 2 takes effect on Sept. 1, but the voucher program itself isn't expected to launch until the 2026-27 school year.

House Bill 2 will provide about $8.5 billion in new money to public schools, as districts across the state tackle long-running challenges following years of stagnant funding. From this pot, more than $4 billion will go toward raising educators' pay. The additional dollars will also be used for educator preparation, special education, safety requirements, and early childhood learning. A significant part of the law activated immediately, while another big chunk will take effect on Sept. 1. Some will roll out in future years.

Senate Bill 10 will require the visible display of the Ten Commandments on donated posters that are at least 16 by 20 inches in public school classrooms, which are attended by around 5.5 million students in Texas. While supporters said Christian teachings are important to understanding American history, critics said this law undermines the separation of church and state. Such laws have already faced legal challenges in Texas and other states. They include an Aug. 20 ruling from U.S. District Judge Fred Biery, which temporarily blocks the measure from taking effect for nearly a dozen school districts, including Austin, Houston, and Plano.

""This issue is likely to get to the United States Supreme Court,"" Biery said prior to the case's opening statements in San Antonio. Texas is expected to appeal his ruling.

Senate Bill 12 will extend the ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies to K-12 schools. In particular, it will prohibit school districts from factoring race, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation into hiring decisions. It will also bar schools from offering instructions, programs, and guidance that focus on sexual orientation or gender identity, including sponsoring student clubs such as Gender and Sexuality Alliance. The law's backers said the legislation gives parents more control over their children's education, while critics said it targets and censors marginalized groups, such as LGBTQ students. Some civil rights groups, including the ACLU of Texas, have launched a legal challenge against the law.

Senate Bill 13 will give parents and school boards more power over what students can access in public school libraries. These boards can also delegate this oversight process if 50 parents in the same district sign a petition for the creation of a local school advisory council. Supporters said the law will protect students from inappropriate content and give parents more control over what their children consume, while critics said it will lead to increased censorship of certain topics such as gender and race. Texas was already among the top states for book bans in recent years, according to PEN America.

Senate Bill 37 will give politically appointed regents more power over public universities, including by granting them more say over the hiring of administrators, as well as over some responsibilities that were traditionally held by faculty members. It will also create an office that can investigate universities for failures to comply with state laws, such as regarding DEI initiatives. The law's backers said it is needed to tackle what they consider to be liberal bias in universities and better align them with Texas's workforce demands. Critics, however, said the law will threaten academic freedom and undermine research.

House Bill 33, authored by Republican state Rep. Don McLaughlin, who was mayor during the Uvalde school shooting, will require law enforcement agencies across Texas to establish crisis response policies. Among several changes, the law will compel school districts and local law enforcement to meet annually in order to assess their emergency operations plans, resources, and capabilities. It will mandate law enforcement agencies and emergency medical service providers to complete training programs on how to respond to active shooters at primary and secondary schools. And following an actual shooting, these responders will also have to file a report detailing and evaluating their actions within several months to facilitate faster public access to information.

Senate Bill 7 will create a framework for funding water projects through the Texas Water Development Board and providing oversight over them, amid a broad effort to tackle the state's looming water crisis. Certain sections of the law would take effect in September 2027 if voters approve the constitutional amendment outlined by House Joint Resolution 7 in November. This ballot measure, if accepted, would allocate $1 billion each year from the state's sales and use tax revenue to the Texas Water Fund between 2027 and 2047.

Senate Bill 15, which received mixed support from both parties, will allow for certain single-family homes to be built on smaller lots. In particular, the law will ban big cities from requiring these homes to sit on more than 3,000 square feet of land, if they are being constructed in a new subdivision that is at least five acres in size. This is a drop from the 5,000 to 7,500 square feet of land that are commonly required in Texas's largest cities - except for Houston - according to a Texas Tribune analysis. While some lawmakers were wary about interfering in local control over the issue, supporters said the change will allow cities to build more housing and keep costs down.

Senate Bill 17 will ban governments, companies, and individuals who legally reside in China, North Korea, Russia, and Iran from owning land and properties in Texas. The governor also has the authority to add countries or entities to the list. The prohibition doesn't apply to U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The law's backers said this is about protecting resources and national security from hostile nations, while critics said SB 17 is discriminatory and will lead to racial profiling.

Senate Bill 33 will ban cities or counties from using their money to support residents seeking abortions outside Texas. The law followed Austin City Council's appropriation of $400,000 last year to help such individuals, prompting lawsuits from Attorney General Ken Paxton and a former council member. San Antonio City Council also allocated $500,000 for a reproductive justice fund in 2023, though it ended up not being used for abortion-related initiatives following a private lawsuit and much debate. It then approved $100,000 in April for abortion-related travel, which was temporarily blocked after Paxton sued.

House Bill 46 will expand the state's medical marijuana program to include patients with chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, and Crohn's disease. Physicians will also be able to prescribe inhalation via vaporized and aerosol products, such as vapes. This expansion will take effect while the Texas Legislature contemplates whether to regulate or ban hemp-derived THC products.

House Bill 229 will define man and woman based on biological reproductive systems and apply that definition across the state code. Government entities collecting vital statistics information will also have to use it. The law's backers said this is needed to protect women's rights and align with executive orders declaring that there are only two sexes. Critics said the law erases trans people from state records in Texas, home to one of the country's largest trans communities.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17705223_083125-ktrk-capitol-sw-img.png?w=1600,N,,2025-08-31 19:59:50.155623

Two complaints were filed against the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The Justice Department says CARB’s actions violate the Clean Air Act, which bars states from regulating vehicle emissions without a preemption waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Under the Biden administration, the EPA granted California waivers for two CARB regulations that imposed stricter emissions limits on heavy-duty trucks. Those rules were aimed at advancing California’s electric vehicle mandate and could be adopted by other states following California’s standards.

In June 2025, President Donald Trump signed congressional resolutions under the Congressional Review Act that nullified the EPA’s waivers. According to the DOJ, without those waivers, CARB is prohibited from enforcing its regulations, yet it is attempting to do so through the Clean Truck Partnership.

“Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate — whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. “President Donald Trump and Congress have invalidated the Clean Air Act waivers that were the basis for California’s actions.

You asked. We listened,” the post reads.

As of June 2025, electric vehicle sales represent around 35% of global vehicle sales and are expected to reach as much as 40% by 2030.

This is likely because EVs are not only cheaper on average than gas-powered vehicles — with prices still dropping for used models — but can also provide up to $1,500 in energy savings for gas and maintenance compared to gas-powered models as well.

Although the mining process for collecting materials like lithium to power EV batteries relies on dirty energy sources, which can emit several million tons of planet-heating gases into the air.

Research has found that we are still digging over 18.2 billion tons of coal, oil, and natural gas per year, which can only be replaced with cleaner energy sources if we are willing to work towards that transition.

In addition, a recent MIT study found that gasoline-powered vehicles, on average, emit about 350 grams of carbon pollution per mile over their lifetime, compared to only 200 grams per mile from EVs charged on the U.S. power grid, further highlighting the minimal environmental impact EVs have compared to gas-powered vehicles driven on a much broader scale.

A gasoline car (a common one) emits more than five tons of pollutants per year. With an electric car, that disappears. That is why Walmart wants to emphasize that this step goes beyond business and is part of its commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable model.

And the wallet notices it too. Electric car owners spend up to 60% less on energy than those who use gasoline. In the first tests, charging at Walmart was about 42 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is a lower price than many private stations.

Total compatibility: plugs for everyone

According to Walmart, it does not matter what electric car you have. The chargers at their stations will be ready both for the CCS1 standard (used by most brands that are not Tesla), and for the NACS connector (popularized by Tesla and increasingly used by more manufacturers). So it does not matter if you drive a Ford, a Hyundai or a Tesla: you will be able to plug it in without any problem.

Charging and changing the model

Walmart is not only going to install chargers, what they are doing is standing right in the middle of the transportation transformation and saying: “here we are.” They want charging the car to become something everyday, easy and accessible for everyone. Going shopping, plugging in the car, and leaving with the bags… and the battery full. And here we all win, them on their side, the drivers on another… And the rest of the citizens win by emitting less pollutants.

And as if that were not enough, with this charger network they are stepping into a field where others like Ikea or some gas stations that have started to reinvent themselves are already present. Walmart, as always, is going to compete big. For now, all we can do is wish them luck and wait to see how these years develop with this plan!",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Flo-EV-chargers-790x474-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 19:00:22.880827

The summit brought together over 500 experts from across the public and private sectors, ranging from energy executives to environmental advocates, to explore innovations in energy, climate resilience, and sustainable growth.

This year’s theme was the energy transition, highlighting the interconnectedness of supply chains, environmental policy, and the urgent need for decarbonization. These themes align directly with NYLCV’s advocacy efforts, especially our push for investments in clean energy and transportation electrification across New York State.

Much of the conversation focused on the potential for business to utilize innovation and investment opportunities to drive progress as well as profits, a mindset that NYLCV highly encourages. As a nonpartisan organization committed to clean air, clean water, renewable energy, and open space, we know that the energy transition isn’t just necessary, it is an opportunity to reshape our economy for the better.

Global Discourse, Local Action

The summit offered a unique opportunity for NYLCV to engage with leaders from both the public and private sectors. The event explored topics ranging from offshore wind and compressed air energy storage to clean transportation and carbon markets, many areas where New York has already taken bold action.

Panels on emerging tech, such as long-duration storage and sustainable aviation fuel, underscored the importance of innovation in scaling emission reduction efforts. A particularly notable presentation by Canadian green energy company Hydrostor detailed how compressed air can be used to store off-peak energy and reduce reliance on peaker plants during times of high demand. Another presentation from an energy storage company highlighted how large-scale battery facilities can alleviate blackouts, a timely concern as heatwaves become more frequent in NYC. These technology applications reflect the same principles NYLCV supports in advocating for grid modernization and resilience at the state level.

Also highlighted was the growing momentum around environmental justice and community-based adaptation. Organizations like CORE, in conjunction with speakers such as Chelsea Clinton, emphasized the need for proactive rather than reactive resilience planning. This is particularly vital in in vulnerable areas facing exceptionally high climate risks. NYLCV’s efforts to increase local investment in parks and green infrastructure echoes this focus on equitable climate solutions that benefit historically marginalized communities.

National Voices Encourage State Leadership

Though the scale of the summit was global, many of the issues hit close to home. From electrifying bus fleets to building smarter, more equitable cities, NYCV’s priorities were reflected in nearly every conversation, a reminder that state and local governments can lead when federal efforts lag.

Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, now with Bloomberg Philanthropies, delivered a keynote speech stressing the role individual states have in achieving climate targets. She emphasized that even in the absence of \ federal leadership, climate champions like New York must continue to lead on clean energy, emissions reductions, and environmental protections.

NYLCV’s mission to evaluate, endorse, and elect environmentally focused candidates remains essential in advancing this vision. Our work bridges the gap between grassroots advocacy and policy implementation, ensuring that ambitious climate goals are backed by political will and public support.

A Broader Perspective on the Energy Transition

Topics ranged broadly, from smart grid technologies to circular manufacturing. Whether discussing regenerative agriculture or advanced recycling systems, the summit reinforced that climate solutions must be integrated, interdisciplinary, and scalable.

Some other key insights from the conference included:

Expanding possibilities for public-private partnerships in funding the transition, including models supported by green banks and philanthropic capital, even in the face of unfavorable economic forecasts.

The need to better align climate finance and long-term infrastructure planning, particularly in high-cost, high-risk sectors like storage, carbon capture, and electrification.

Looking Ahead

NYLCV’s participation in Sustainability Week reaffirmed our role as a connector between local advocacy and national momentum. NYLCV remains committed to advancing policies that accelerate the energy transition, promote climate equity, and ensure that environmental leadership in New York continues to influence both national and global progress.",https://www.nylcv.org/wp-content/uploads/solar-copy-of-blog-header.png,N,,2025-08-31 19:00:26.210890

Utilities face several challenges as they address an increasing number of outages. About 83% of major U.S. power outages between 2000 and 2021 were driven by weather-related events, according to Climate Central.

As customers grapple with these rising power interruptions, 65% report that they’re frustrated with utilities’ impersonal communications.

However, utilities can now address this communications challenge by taking advantage of AI. Rather than simply reacting to outages as they happen, power providers can embrace intelligent, customized, and proactive messaging that humanizes these crises for their customers.

Utilities that adopt such options make customers happy. Those that have improved their communications have experienced increased customer satisfaction, according to the J.D. Power 2024 Electric Utility Business Customer Satisfaction Study. Partly due to enhanced communication, business customer satisfaction with electric utilities in 2024 increased 30 points on a 1,000-point scale.

A separate study from J.D. Power points to the pluses of using a suite of communication methods.

The J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Utility Digital Experience Study found that the largest electric, natural gas, and water utilities in the U.S. are not embracing the use of websites and mobile apps for communicating with customers – and they should be.

These are the most effective customer communication channels available to utilities, the study said.

Beyond Traditional Emergency Alerts: The Workflow Revolution

As the J.D. Power report suggests, boosting customer satisfaction requires adding new communication methods. Forward-looking utilities are no longer relying on traditional one-way emergency notifications.

Utilities can now send more detailed messages from multiple channels and customize them for customers in different locations or for those who speak different languages. This allows them to tailor messages to meet various customers’ needs. In addition, two-way communication is becoming more common. Customers are now able to communicate with their power providers about outages and other issues through various channels. They can text, call, email, send messages using chatbots on utility websites, or through utilities’ social media. They can also specify which type of communication they prefer.

AI plays a vital role in this evolution of emergency communication. AI enables more flexible workflows. These are a group of pre-set steps that perform specific tasks such as data manipulation. Workflows serve as the building blocks of communication–and with AI, these building blocks can be used over and over, rearranged, or assembled in various ways to meet different customers’ needs. As building blocks, workflows are part of a larger automated system that provides what’s needed to execute everyday tasks.

The Intelligence Factor: Purpose-built workflows that anticipate customer needs during crises

With AI, workflows can not only be rearranged; they can be built to predict what customers will need during emergencies. In real time, they can adjust and escalate messaging as emergency conditions evolve.

If, for instance, a utility needs to warn people in one location to evacuate because of a hurricane, flooding, or other crisis, the utility can increase the frequency of messaging. Utilities can also geotarget their messaging to specific, smaller portions of their territories.

In addition, intelligent workflows can coordinate customer communication with what’s happening in the field. This might mean that a small group of customers reports an outage, then the utility informs a larger, targeted group in the area affected that their power is out. As soon as more information is available, the utility will explain what’s happening in the field. A tree has fallen on a line, and it will take three hours to restore power, for example.

Hyper-Personalized Emergency Messaging

With intelligent workflows, messaging can be hyper-personalized at scale. Utilities can establish workflows that automatically select the optimal communication channels for each customer, based on their preferences. Power providers can also focus on cultural sensitivity, sending multilingual emergency communications that are more likely to help customers understand what’s happening when they face power interruptions–and how to respond. These messaging options help build customer trust. In their native language, customers learn more quickly and in greater detail about when a storm is coming or whether they need to find an alternative power source for their medical devices. Keeping customers informed in this way can reduce anxiety during service disruptions.

How Customer Responses Inform Emergency Response Priorities

Smart workflows allow two-way communication to take place in real time. As utilities receive input from customers about the timing and location of outages, they can gain critical awareness about the location of outages–and how much an outage affects specific customers–allowing utilities to prioritize their response. Thus, with customer feedback, utilities have a comprehensive situational awareness of what’s happening on the ground.

Intelligent workflows allow utilities to message about both emergency and non-emergency situations. They can automatically respond to real-time triggers such as hurricane warnings, red flag alerts about the potential for wildfires, and demand response programs. In these cases, organizations can send text, email, voice, and app notifications to customers based on their messaging preferences.

As they’re communicating with customers about emergencies, utilities can personalize and segment their messages based on customers’ location and customer profiles. These tailored communications are more relevant to customers and more likely to engage them.

Using Data From Customers to Identify Potential Problems

With the help of AI, utilities can anticipate and respond to customers’ needs. AI can analyze data that includes customers’ consumption history, weather forecasts, prices, and customer interactions. It can also analyze data from sensors and smart meters to predict potential equipment failures and schedule maintenance proactively, which can minimize downtime. This allows power providers to act on critical issues before they become problems.

Responding proactively builds trust in customers. Utilities can also build trust by turning regulatory requirements into opportunities.

Utilities must comply with specific requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and state utility commissions about environmental, customer privacy, worker safety, reliability, and other issues. Intelligent workflows can help by creating opportunities to boost customer satisfaction.

For example, during a crisis, utilities are allowed to circumvent some regulations to contact customers without permission, and intelligent workflows make this happen quickly. This is important because it’s critical to deliver messages on time, especially for medically vulnerable customers. Those who may rely on electricity-powered medical devices learn as soon as possible that they may need to find an alternative way to power the devices, which helps these customers understand they can trust the utility to inform them about service interruptions when they need it most.

In addition, regulations call for utilities to conduct safety inspections of gas lines and electrical equipment periodically. Intelligent workflows can transform these visits into comprehensive home energy consultations. While inspectors are already on-site for safety checks, they can offer customized efficiency recommendations, identify rebate opportunities, and even schedule follow-up services. While customers might view these visits as intrusive, utilities could turn them into a valuable service that customers appreciate.

Customer satisfaction also increases when utilities communicate accurately and quickly during emergencies.

A J.D. Power residential customer satisfaction survey found that utilities that communicate effectively during outages and other emergencies score higher in customer satisfaction metrics than those that don’t communicate as well. When utilities proactively inform customers about outages, infrastructure improvements, utility programs, and services, or about ways to save on utility bills, they experience a positive increase in overall satisfaction.

How Consistent, Reliable communication strengthens community preparedness

Proactive and accurate communication also helps communities prepare for disasters.

During hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, and other natural disasters, utility services are critical to expediting emergency responses. For example, emergency responders need electricity to do their job, and customers may rely on electricity to power their medical devices or for cooling during heatwaves. When high winds and storms damage powerlines and substations, homeowners, businesses, and facilities such as hospitals and water treatment plants need to be informed quickly and accurately.

Intelligent workflows can provide the timely information that allows communities to prepare for and respond to disasters. These workflows also enable customers to report where and when outages occur, helping utilities make decisions that protect communities.

How AI Supports Technology Integration and implementation

As utilities cope with emergencies, they can take advantage of AI-powered workflows that work with numerous technologies. This yields seamless system integration. For example, the workflows can inform weather monitoring tools and systems.

This leads to real-time weather updates about challenges such as lightning and high winds. Utilities can also use advanced data analytics about issues such as customer preferences to escalate communications. They can integrate with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that pull together and analyze information from sensors and devices, allowing for automated control of equipment.

Utility-grade SCADA weather stations are designed for utilities and SCADA operations that rely on DNP3 and/or Modbus protocols, providing weather station measurements in a configurable, turn-key package. They include fast-to-field features that simplify installation and commissioning.

Utilities can use weather monitoring systems to activate alarms for notification and control based on specific weather criteria, including precipitation accumulation, high or low temperatures, and high wind speeds.

AI-powered workflow integration can improve utilities’ response to outages. For example, a single platform that integrates customer relationship management data with work data can give utilities visibility into and enhance efficiency in outage response efforts. By unifying these views onto one platform, utilities can more easily automate storm response, from logistics to communications to resource management.

With smart workflows, utilities can continue to embrace personalized messaging–based on customers’ language, location, and communication preferences, even during emergencies when millions of emergency interactions are needed.

Adopting Best Practices

To make the most of AI-powered messaging and intelligent workflows, utilities can adopt best practices. They should begin with clear objectives and should map out customer journeys – roadmaps of how customers interact with their power providers. These roadmaps can be used to identify automation opportunities.

Customer roadmaps aim to understand a customer’s perspective at various stages of interaction. This process involves understanding customers’ pain points and emotions. Utilities should begin this process by identifying their specific goals–improving satisfaction, retaining customers, or improving outage management, for example.

Organizations can then build profiles of varying customer segments, focusing on demographics, usage patterns, or specific needs. Utilities can create profiles for residential customers, businesses, low-income homeowners, or medically vulnerable customers, for instance.

Next, utilities can identify possible interactions such as phone calls, social media communication, or outage notifications. They can then determine which tools customers use in these interactions, including text, email, phone calls, or chatbots. Organizations should also identify the feelings and motivations underlying these communications. They can use surveys and interviews to pull together information about how customers are feeling and behaving during each type of interaction.

Using this information, utilities can determine which circumstances make customers unhappy. They can then identify opportunities to boost customer satisfaction. They can implement changes based on these maps. Organizations should constantly update the maps as more data becomes available.

During this process, it’s essential to integrate data–such as demographic information about customers–and ensure that workflows can adapt to changing customer needs and new regulations.

Prioritizing Human-Centered Design to Maintain Trust and Create Empathy

Customer roadmaps can help utilities focus on human-centered design, concentrating on the needs of customers and showing empathy for them. This can help develop relationships with customers that build trust and satisfaction.

The customer roadmaps help organizations understand customers’ motivations, preferences, and utility service challenges. In addition, utilities can turn to focus groups and interviews to understand their customers better.

As part of this process, utilities need to identify the challenges they want to address and the customers who are best suited to provide feedback about them. It’s essential to create a straightforward plan.

Human-centered design creates higher levels of customer engagement and helps customers feel more empowered.

Practical Applications of Smart Workflows

When utilities have identified challenges, created customer roadmaps, and focused on human-centered design, they can use these tools in emergency response. For example, with automated alerts from customers’ preferred channels, power providers can keep customers informed, reducing their anxiety during emergencies.

Intelligent workflows also benefit non-emergency communications. They can minimize billing and service notifications, reducing errors and delivering vital information promptly.

For example, utilities depend on automated billing to determine customers' bills. These are based on changing consumption rates. These systems integrate with smart meters and internet-connected devices that monitor usage in real time and base bills on actual consumption. Utilities can detect unusual usage patterns that might alert them to approaching service disruptions.

Smart meters enable automated and accurate meter readings, cutting the need for manual meter reading processes. This reduces the possibility of human errors, estimated bills, and disputes between consumers and utility providers.

Intelligent workflows also optimize workforce efficiency and shorten response times. Intelligent chatbots and other innovative tools allow customers to resolve problems quickly, which frees up staff to address different issues.

Case Study: Crisis Communication in Action

The Mansfield Municipal Electric Department, which serves 10,000 customers in northeast Massachusetts, realized many of the benefits of intelligent workflows for crisis response. The utility was seeking a more responsive and tailored way to message residents about outages. Mansfield Electric was using traditional messaging options that lacked personalization and speed. And the town of Mansfield’s mass notification system wasn’t sophisticated enough to target customers impacted by service disruptions. At the time, the town’s manual outreach programs were plagued by operational inefficiencies, leaving customers either unaware of or unprepared for emergencies.

Such challenges reflect growing pressures on utilities.

“Utilities today face unprecedented pressure to modernize without compromising compliance, cost, or customer trust,” said Scott McClintock, chief revenue officer at Convey. “At Convey, we empower them to do exactly that, delivering proactive, intelligent communications that meet the moment and evolve with customer expectations.""

A fast deployment of AI-powered messaging for Mansfield Electric

To address the moment’s challenges, Mansfield Electric chose Convey’s REACH Cloud Preference Center to meet its goals, rolling out the program in March 2024. Deployment time was short – only 45 days. Now, the town’s utility benefits from multichannel messaging – proactive updates via voice, text, and email that will help the utility respond to crises. The utility can now send timely, relevant information to help customers make informed plans during outages.

Town leadership has recorded personalized text-to-speech and voice messages, which create familiarity and trust among customers, especially during power emergencies. In addition, the REACH Cloud dashboard allows the utility to track community engagement.

As a result, Mansfield Electric has experienced improvements in customer satisfaction, reduced call volume, and operational efficiency – all improvements that will help the utility provide more effective emergency communications and response.

The Future of Emergency Communications

The next generation of intelligent workflows takes advantage of AI tools that are capable of interpreting, acting, and adapting in real time, moving from static scripts to dynamic, self-healing processes. This enables predictive maintenance, autonomous grid management, and the integration of new communication channels.

With AI-driven workflows, utilities deliver personalized service 24/7, reduce their support costs, improve employee productivity, and enhance customer satisfaction. In the future, these advantages will be expanded to the entire grid, which will include AI-enhanced grid intelligence, enabling autonomous decision-making and improved resiliency.

Utilities that implement advanced emergency communication will gain a competitive edge through more effective and personalized communications and improved public safety and resilience.

As the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Utility Digital Experience Study pointed out, utilities must focus on modern communication strategies such as websites and mobile apps to boost customer satisfaction. Technology that focuses on showing empathy and the human element of emergency response is also essential.

The electric utility landscape will continue to evolve, and utilities must embrace a strategic approach to AI adoption, relying on the many new emergency response tools available as a result of AI.

Utilities that embrace intelligent, automated, and empathetic messaging are likely to thrive in an industry facing increasing climate-change-driven power disruptions.

Lawmakers are coming back to D.C. this week after their August recess. Starting Tuesday, they'll be back on Capitol Hill and facing a long to-do list, with the risk of a government shutdown looming in the background. Now, stop us if you've heard that one before. Joining us now to help preview what's on the agenda is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hi, Claudia.

CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.

RASCOE: So I hope you enjoyed the recess. It sounds like there will be lots to take care of when lawmakers return. Where should we start?

GRISALES: Probably what you just mentioned, funding the government. That's likely the hardest job on tap. The deadline to do that is September 30. So when lawmakers get back, they'll have less than a month to approve regular appropriations bills. That's a process that can take months, and they're already very much behind. Many say it's a fantasy they'll get there. For example, many House Republicans just want to approve another stopgap measure that will keep funding levels static. Then, underlying all of this, we have seen this Republican-led Congress cede their power of the purse to the president again and again. For example, this summer, they passed a rescissions package from the White House that clawed back $9 billion in foreign aid and funding for public media. So we're expecting President Trump to have a lot to say here. And Democrats say they're going to fight these efforts in a new way.

RASCOE: So then the nearly evergreen question - could we be headed toward a shutdown at the end of the month?

GRISALES: It's possible. We have heard discussion that some lawmakers would approve a shorter-term stopgap measure, say for a month, for example, to give them time to negotiate. Democrats, for example, they have faced demands from their base to do more when it comes to these funding battles. For example, earlier this year, minority leader Chuck Schumer made way for a GOP stopgap spending plan to move forward, but he paid the price with a lot of blowback from the base. So Democrats are expecting to do a lot more fighting this time around. So that means Republicans could face a roadblock when it comes to passing a funding measure if Senate Democrats filibuster that effort.

RASCOE: The Jeffrey Epstein issue is also waiting for lawmakers to take it back up after garnering so much attention this summer. Where do things stand there?

GRISALES: Right. They're coming back - Republicans - to quite the crossroads here because they have heard demands from their own base about presenting more transparency on this case, and that they haven't delivered on campaign promises to release files related to this. Now, we did see the House Oversight Committee have a busy August. They issued subpoenas for documents and witness testimony. The Justice Department started turning over files from its investigation into Epstein to the committee, and the Republican chairman, James Comer of Kentucky, says he intends to make the records public. But Democrats are going to have a lot to say. They're arguing that Comer is slow-walking the process. They say the release will be far from comprehensive once the public gets to see it. And they have a key ally in Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie. He's teamed up with Democrats to try to force a vote on a full release of the records on the House floor come next week.

RASCOE: OK. Quickly, what else are you watching for from Congress?

GRISALES: Well, we know the Senate left in the midst of fighting over approving President Trump's nominees. That will likely pick up. And lawmakers will need to face the music on a lot of issues that boiled over during recess. Republicans saw a blowback on the major bill that they passed earlier this summer from Trump's demands. And Trump has also exerted more influence on the Federal Reserve. And we've seen a lot of chaos at the CDC and expect a lot from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. when he testifies later this week.

The lithium market has experienced a dramatic decline since its peak in 2022, but recent data suggests a potential turnaround may be underway. After plummeting nearly 90% from its highs, prices have begun showing signs of recovery in mid-2025. For investors and industry participants, the critical question remains: Is lithium rebounding for real this time?

What Caused the Lithium Market Crash?

The Perfect Storm of Oversupply and Demand Slowdown

The lithium market experienced a dramatic decline from its 2022 peak, when prices reached approximately A$6,000/mt. By June 2025, prices had plummeted to four-year lows of US$610/t, representing a staggering 90% drop. This collapse resulted from multiple converging factors creating perfect market conditions for a price crash.

The rapid capacity expansion by producers globally coincided with slower-than-expected electric vehicle adoption rates in Western markets. Meanwhile, substantial inventory buildup throughout the supply chain created a significant oversupply situation that the market couldn't absorb quickly enough.

How Chinese Production Flooded the Market

Chinese producers played a particularly significant role in the market oversupply, aggressively expanding their lithium processing capacity between 2022-2024. This domestic production increase wasn't happening in isolation – it occurred alongside substantial imports from emerging producers in Africa and South America.

The combined effect created a supply glut that pushed prices down to levels where many operations became economically unviable. Chinese capacity expansion wasn't just about volume; it also included technological improvements that allowed processors to handle lower-grade resources more efficiently, further pressuring high-cost producers elsewhere.

What Are the Signs of a Lithium Market Recovery?

Recent Price Movements Show Positive Momentum

Recent market data indicates a potential recovery underway in the lithium sector. CIF China prices for 6% concentrate have risen to $945-955/mt, while other sources report prices between $778-858/mt. Though still far below the 2022 peak, these figures represent a significant improvement from June's four-year lows.

The upward trajectory suggests market sentiment may be shifting from bearish to cautiously optimistic. Price movements have been accompanied by increased trading volumes, particularly in Chinese spot markets, indicating genuine buyer interest rather than speculative activity.

Supply Rationalization Is Finally Taking Effect

The market is experiencing meaningful supply rationalization as unprofitable operations shut down:

Multiple Australian mines including Bald Hill and Ngungaju have suspended operations

High-cost Chinese operations have scaled back production significantly

Zimbabwe projects have reduced output in response to low prices

A significant mine closure in China due to licensing issues has removed approximately 3-8% of global lithium supply

This supply discipline is creating the conditions necessary for price recovery, with lithium carbonate futures in China responding positively, climbing 1.8% to 8,000 yuan/ton. The market appears to be entering a more balanced state after years of oversupply.

Chinese authorities have also implemented stricter enforcement of mining permits, specifically targeting operations contributing to oversupply conditions. This regulatory approach represents a strategic shift that could provide longer-term support for price stability.

How Strong Are the Demand Fundamentals?

EV Market Growth Continues Despite Headwinds

While EV adoption rates have slowed from their earlier explosive growth, the overall trajectory remains positive. China continues to lead global EV adoption, with steady growth in Europe and North America. Analysts project lithium demand growth of approximately 26% in 2025, reaching 1.46 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE).

BYD's rising popularity in the electric vehicle market has reignited investor attention toward the EV sector's long-term potential. The company's success demonstrates that consumer preferences are increasingly favoring electric models, supporting fundamental demand for lithium batteries.

Region EV Sales Growth (YoY) Market Penetration China 18-22% 31% Europe 12-15% 24% North America 15-18% 10% Global Average 16-20% 19%

Diversified Demand Sources Strengthen the Outlook

Beyond EVs, additional demand sources are emerging that provide resilience to the lithium market:

Grid-scale energy storage systems deploying at accelerated rates

Robotics and automation technologies requiring high-performance batteries

Consumer electronics with larger batteries and longer lifecycles

Industrial applications expanding beyond traditional uses

This diversification creates a more resilient demand profile less dependent on a single sector, potentially reducing future market volatility. Energy storage deployments in particular are growing at over 30% annually, creating significant new lithium demand that wasn't fully factored into earlier market projections.

How Are Companies Positioning for the Recovery?

Operational Strategies Reflect Cautious Optimism

Mining companies are implementing strategic plans in anticipation of market improvement:

Core Lithium has unveiled a restart plan for its mothballed project, with improved margins and an increased resource estimate of 48.5Mt @ 1.26% lithium

Major players like Rio Tinto, Albemarle, SQM, and Ganfeng are pursuing M&A opportunities and operational efficiencies

Cost reduction initiatives are widespread across the sector, with producers focusing on lowering break-even points

Innovative processing technologies are being deployed to improve recovery rates and reduce operating expenses

These actions indicate industry confidence in an eventual market recovery, though timing remains uncertain. Companies appear to be positioning for a multi-year upswing rather than a quick return to peak prices.

Investment Activity Shows Renewed Interest

Market participants are showing signs of renewed interest in the lithium sector:

Some fund managers, including Argonaut and Ten Cap, have reportedly taken positions against short-sellers

Analysts from major financial institutions, including CBA's Vivek Dhar, have begun calling the bottom of the market

Capital raising activities for lithium projects have seen improved investor reception

Strategic investments by automakers seeking to secure supply chains are increasing

This renewed investment interest suggests growing confidence that the worst of the downturn may be over. However, the investment community remains cautious, with most participants waiting for clearer signals before making major commitments.

Why Should Investors Remain Cautious?

Supply Disruptions May Be Temporary

While recent supply disruptions have helped prices recover, there's uncertainty about their longevity. The Chinese mine shutdown that sparked the recent rally could potentially be reversed if licensing issues are resolved. Analysts generally expect a more sustainable recovery in 2026 rather than immediately.

Commodity market bottoms typically involve a multi-month base-building phase, sometimes with price retests before a stronger uptrend emerges. History suggests that premature enthusiasm about price recoveries can lead to disappointing investment outcomes.

Inventory Levels Remain Elevated

Despite production cuts, significant inventory overhang persists throughout the supply chain:

China's chemical inventories have increased by approximately 35,000 tonnes since January 2025

This inventory buildup must be absorbed before a sustained price recovery can take hold

The market is still projected to have a modest surplus in 2025, with a potential transition to deficit only by 2026

Inventory Category Current Level Change vs. 12 Months Ago Months of Supply Raw Material Elevated +25% 3.2 Chemical Intermediates High +35% 2.8 Refined Products Moderate +10% 1.9

These inventory levels represent a substantial headwind that must be worked through before prices can sustain higher levels. The timeline for this inventory reduction depends on both production discipline and demand growth.

Price-Sensitive Supply Could Quickly Return

If prices stabilize or recover significantly, idled capacity could quickly restart:

Projects like Core Lithium's Finniss operation could resume production

Producers in regions like Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and China could re-enter the market

This elastic supply response could cap price recovery

Many operations that have been temporarily suspended maintain their equipment and permits, allowing for rapid restart once economics improve. This creates a ceiling effect for prices until demand growth can absorb both existing inventory and potential returning supply.

Alternative Investments Remain Attractive

Investor capital that exited lithium has found homes in other commodities, particularly gold. For lithium to attract significant investment flows back from safe-haven assets would require compelling evidence of a sustained recovery, not just short-term price movements.

Gold's historical role as a hedge against economic uncertainty has strengthened its appeal during lithium's downturn. Without a dramatic shift in broader economic conditions or a substantial acceleration in lithium demand, this capital reallocation may be slow to reverse.

What Are Customers and Partners Signaling?

Mixed Signals from End Users

Recent developments from lithium customers and joint venture partners present a mixed picture:

Liontown reported that US automaker Ford has reduced its committed purchase volumes

IGO fully impaired its stake in the Kwinana lithium hydroxide facility

Most producers with restart plans have not committed to specific timelines, preferring to wait for sustained price improvement

Cost reduction remains a primary focus across the industry

These signals suggest caution among major industry participants despite the recent price improvements. Battery manufacturers and automakers appear to be adopting a wait-and-see approach before making significant new commitments to lithium purchases.

""While we're seeing some positive price momentum, customers remain hesitant to lock in long-term contracts until they see clear evidence of sustained market recovery. The psychology of the market remains cautious after experiencing such dramatic price volatility."" – Industry analyst

What Price Level Would Confirm a New Bull Market?

The US$1,000/mt Threshold

Market analysts suggest that sustained prices above US$1,000/mt would provide stronger evidence of a new bull market in lithium. This level would support the economics of many currently idled operations and potentially trigger restart decisions. Until prices reach and maintain this threshold, the recovery remains tentative.

This price point is particularly significant because it represents a level where approximately 60-70% of global production capacity can operate profitably. Sustained trading above this level would indicate a fundamental shift in market dynamics rather than a temporary fluctuation.

Watching for Sustained Demand Growth

Beyond price levels, investors should monitor EV sales growth rates, particularly in China, Europe, and North America. Accelerating adoption would provide fundamental support for higher lithium prices. Additionally, energy storage deployment trends will offer insights into the diversification of lithium demand beyond the automotive sector.

Key metrics to watch include:

Monthly EV sales figures in major markets

Battery manufacturing capacity utilization rates

Grid-scale energy storage project announcements

Consumer electronics replacement cycles and battery capacity trends

Positive momentum across these indicators would suggest a robust foundation for sustained lithium price recovery.

How Should Investors Approach the Lithium Sector?

Selective Positioning Based on Cost Structure

Not all lithium producers are created equal. Companies with low-cost operations, strong balance sheets, and strategic partnerships are better positioned to weather continued volatility and capitalize on the eventual recovery.

Investors should focus on producers with:

First or second quartile cost positions

Diverse customer relationships beyond a single geography

Financial strength to withstand further market weakness

High-quality resources with favorable mineralogy

Clear path to value-added products rather than just raw materials

These characteristics provide resilience during market uncertainty while offering significant upside potential when prices recover more substantially.

Balancing Opportunity with Risk Management

While signs of recovery are emerging, the lithium market remains volatile. A balanced approach might include:

Establishing initial positions in quality producers with strong balance sheets

Maintaining cash reserves for potential market pullbacks

Diversifying across the battery materials supply chain

Setting clear price targets for both entry and exit

Focusing on companies with multiple potential catalysts beyond just lithium price recovery

This measured strategy acknowledges the potential for continued market volatility while positioning for long-term sector growth. Furthermore, investors might consider keeping an eye on Australia lithium innovations which could significantly impact production costs and efficiency.

FAQs About the Lithium Market Recovery

Will lithium prices return to 2022 peak levels?

Most analysts consider the 2022 price spike an anomaly driven by supply chain disruptions and panic buying. While prices are expected to recover from current lows, a return to those extreme levels is unlikely in the near term. A more sustainable price range of $1,000-2,500/mt appears realistic based on cost curves and demand projections.

How are Chinese EV sales affecting lithium demand?

Chinese EV sales continue to grow, though at a more moderate pace than in previous years. The success of manufacturers like BYD has highlighted the ongoing transition to electric mobility, supporting lithium demand fundamentals. China's domestic policies continue to favor EV adoption, providing a solid foundation for lithium demand growth.

What impact will new lithium extraction technologies have?

Direct lithium extraction technologies could potentially increase supply and lower costs, but widespread commercial deployment remains several years away. These technologies are unlikely to significantly impact the market before 2027-2028. Technical challenges and capital requirements for scaling these solutions mean they represent a longer-term evolution rather than an immediate disruption.

How are geopolitical factors influencing the lithium market?

Supply chain security concerns and geopolitical tensions have increased interest in developing lithium resources in politically stable jurisdictions. This could lead to premium pricing for non-Chinese supply in the medium term. Western governments are increasingly supporting domestic battery supply chains, creating potential advantages for producers in those regions. Additionally, India's lithium strategy is emerging as a significant factor in the global market.

Further Exploration

Lithium's position as a critical material for the energy transition ensures its long-term importance, despite current market challenges. The sector's recovery trajectory will likely be influenced by both macroeconomic factors and industry-specific developments in the coming years.

For investors, the current environment offers both risks and opportunities. Those with a longer-term perspective may find value in selectively building positions in quality producers while maintaining appropriate risk management strategies. As with any commodity market, timing will be challenging, but the structural growth story remains intact.

Monitoring key indicators across the supply chain – from mining activity to battery production to end-user demand – will provide valuable insights into the strength and sustainability of lithium's market recovery. In particular, developments in Argentina lithium insights and Thacker Pass production trends can offer early signals of how global supply dynamics are evolving.

According to a recent analysis by S&P Global, while lithium prices are showing signs of recovery, there remains debate about whether the rebound will be sustained in the longer term. Similarly, market observers at Stockhead have questioned if we're finally seeing the end of what they call the ""long lithium winter"" that has plagued the sector since 2022.

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast.
Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.
President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office.
More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""

CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.

RASCOE: So I hope you enjoyed the recess. It sounds like there will be lots to take care of when lawmakers return. Where should we start?

GRISALES: Probably what you just mentioned, funding the government. That's likely the hardest job on tap. The deadline to do that is September 30. So when lawmakers get back, they'll have less than a month to approve regular appropriations bills. That's a process that can take months, and they're already very much behind.

Democrats, for example, they have faced demands from their base to do more when it comes to these funding battles. For example, earlier this year, minority leader Chuck Schumer made way for a GOP stopgap spending plan to move forward, but he paid the price with a lot of blowback from the base. So Democrats are expecting to do a lot more fighting this time around. So that means Republicans could face a roadblock when it comes to passing a funding measure if Senate Democrats filibuster that effort.

RASCOE: The Jeffrey Epstein issue is also waiting for lawmakers to take it back up after garnering so much attention this summer. Where do things stand there?

The Inflation Reduction Act earmarks $369bn for climate action, which aims to slash US emissions by roughly 40% by 2030, against a 2005 baseline.

Measures include 10 years of consumer tax credits to make heat pumps, solar panels, and electric heating, ventilation, and air conditioning more affordable.

Households could also receive up to $7,500 in tax credits to buy new clean vehicles, and $4,000 to buy used clean vehicles.

Roughly $30bn in targeted grant and loan programs is earmarked for states and electric utilities to accelerate the transition to clean electricity, and more than $20bn is set aside to support climate-smart agriculture practices.

The package also includes over $60bn to on-shore clean energy manufacturing in the US, and a further $60bn in environmental justice priorities to drive investments into disadvantaged communities.

Although this is a significantly scaled-back version of Joe Biden's original $3.5tn 'Build Back Better' spending plan, the president welcomed the bill, saying that Democratic senators had “sided with American families over special interests”.

“I ran for president promising to make government work for working families again, and that is what this bill does – period,” he said.

“This bill also makes the largest investment ever in combatting the existential crisis of climate change. It addresses the climate crisis and strengthens our energy security, creating jobs manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles in America with American workers.”

The bill passed by a margin of 51 to 50 on Sunday, and comes after 18 months of intense wrangling.

It also includes major legislation on healthcare and corporation tax, allowing the government to negotiate lower prices for prescription medicines for the over-65s provided by the Medicare health insurance programme.

A minimum 15% tax will apply to most corporations that make more than $1bn a year in profits.

The federal tax credit for electric vehicles, offering up to $7,500 for qualifying new models, has been a cornerstone of U.S. efforts to boost EV adoption since its expansion under the Inflation Reduction Act. But with the passage of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” signed into law in July, this incentive is set to expire on September 30, 2025, creating urgency among consumers and automakers alike. Industry analysts have warned that the cutoff could dampen sales momentum, particularly as EV market penetration hovers around 8% of new vehicle sales, according to recent data from the Energy Department.

For insiders in the automotive sector, the deadline represents more than a consumer hurdle—it’s a pivot point for supply chains, pricing strategies, and competitive positioning. Manufacturers like Tesla and General Motors have ramped up promotions, but the abrupt end could exacerbate inventory gluts or force discounts that erode margins.

A Subtle Shift in IRS Guidance

Recent clarifications from the Internal Revenue Service have introduced a modest extension to this timeline, allowing buyers to secure the credit without taking immediate possession of the vehicle. As detailed in a Mashable article published on August 29, 2025, the IRS now defines a vehicle as “acquired” upon entering a written binding contract and making a payment—such as a nominal down payment or trade-in—by the September 30 deadline. This means delivery can occur later, providing breathing room for those navigating backorders or custom configurations.

This adjustment, outlined in IRS guidance released on August 21, stems from broader rules under the clean vehicle tax credit program. A CNBC report from August 26 highlights how this change favors buyers, potentially averting a last-minute rush that could strain dealership operations and logistics networks.

Implications for Market Dynamics

For EV industry executives, this wiggle room could stabilize fourth-quarter projections by encouraging orders that might otherwise be deferred. However, the extension is limited; contracts must be binding and non-refundable in most cases, per IRS stipulations, which could complicate financing arrangements tied to actual delivery.

Moreover, not all vehicles qualify—the credit applies only to models meeting strict criteria on battery sourcing, assembly location, and price caps. A list of eligible EVs, as compiled in a January 2024 Mashable piece, includes standouts like the Tesla Model Y and Chevrolet Bolt, though the roster has shrunk due to evolving regulations.

Strategic Considerations for Automakers

Automakers are already adapting: Ford and GM have issued dealer bulletins emphasizing the new rules to maximize sales before the cutoff, according to insights from a Yahoo Finance article dated August 24. This could lead to a surge in pre-orders, but it also raises questions about post-deadline pricing, where the absence of the credit might necessitate rebates or incentives to maintain volume.

Income limits remain a factor, capping eligibility at $150,000 for single filers and $300,000 for joint, as noted in NerdWallet’s July 2025 overview. For used EVs, a separate $4,000 credit also ends on September 30, adding another layer to purchasing decisions.

Looking Ahead to Policy Shifts

The broader policy context underscores uncertainty; the “Big Beautiful Bill” reflects a political recalibration away from subsidies, potentially signaling reduced federal support for electrification. Industry insiders speculate this could accelerate investments in domestic battery production to qualify for future incentives, if any emerge.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-e332d200-6b82-4a82-8860-e6de25bae149.jpeg,N,,2025-08-31 17:01:46.171233

This comes three years after the energy companies caused a major oil spill off the coast of Louisiana.

What's happening?

According to NOLA.com, the oil spill happened on the shrimping season's opening day in 2022. A Hilcorp oil tank fell into Terrebonne Bay and spilled about 14,000 gallons of oil into Lake Pelto.

WCC allegedly damaged the oil tank during a transfer. The lawsuit also blames Hilcorp, claiming that it never properly inspected the tank.

Louisiana state officials closed 33 square miles of oyster harvesting waters. Shrimp fishers stayed away from the area for fear of contamination and ultimately had an unsuccessful shrimping season.

Why is the oil spill concerning?

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include shrimpers, boat owners, and seafood businesses. This oil spill has harmed people with many different livelihoods across the Gulf Coast.

Without consistent, quality products to sell, everyone in the shrimp industry risks being unable to provide for themselves.

""Fishermen are now confused on whether they should be taking a chance of going out to shrimp. Do you spend the money for supplies to get rejected at the dock for the sale of your shrimp?"" Kimberly Chauvin, co-owner of the David Chauvin Shrimp Company, said to the Houma Courier.

""And docks are worried that if we buy the shrimp, are we going to get paid by the processors or will they reject the shrimp? This is a no-win situation for us. Once we pay a fisherman, we don't get that money back. You just take a loss.""

This isn't the first time this has happened, either. Hilcorp was involved in over a dozen oil spills in 2021 following Hurricane Ida, according to NOLA.com. The oil company also paid out $920,000 after it was accused of dredging oyster reefs without a permit.

When oil spills happen, they don't just hurt people. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says that oil spills can cause severe illnesses and death in wildlife. It can also take a long time for animal populations to bounce back after an oil spill, and many don't rebound.

What's being done about the oil spill?

While the lawsuit can't reverse the oil spill, it aims to hold Hilcorp and WCC accountable for their actions.

The plaintiffs are accusing the companies of negligence and believe the companies have violated several environmental laws. They hope the lawsuit will help restore local ecosystems and ""repair reputational damage done to Terrebonne Bay's and Louisiana's seafood industry,"" per NOLA.com.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shrimp-industry-lawsuitimage-rectVGCgPOobhYEuK-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 16:02:01.928857

This means that beginning October 1, EV drivers will have to follow the same occupancy rules as all other vehicles.
Additionally, the DMV confirmed that discounted tolls tied to the CAV decal program will end too.","Starting October 1, 2025, a new government rule will end the EV HOV perk in California. Initially, California electric vehicle (EV) drivers were allowed to drive on high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. The program, also known as the Clean Air Vehicle (CAV) decal program, will officially end after the federal government decided not to extend it.

According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and Air Resources Board, more than 500,000 vehicles in California will be affected by the new government rule.

EV Drivers Face Longer Commutes as HOV Lane Access Ends

Since 1999, the CAV decal program allowed EV drivers, plug-in hybrids, and hydrogen-powered vehicles to use the HOV lanes even with only one occupant. This incentive was so effective in encouraging clean vehicle adoption in California.

Unfortunately, this incentive will expire on September 30, 2025. This means that beginning October 1, EV drivers will have to follow the same occupancy rules as all other vehicles. Those found using the carpool lanes without passengers could face fines.

Additionally, the DMV confirmed that discounted tolls tied to the CAV decal program will end too.

“The federal government’s decision to eliminate this smart and popular program will hurt hundreds of thousands of California drivers,” the DMV said in a statement. “It’s a lose-lose situation and the state is now looking at other options to provide this service to Californians.”

Longer Commutes Ahead

Drivers will be forced to move back to the general-purpose lanes when CAV decal program comes to an end. This will add hours of traffic over the course of a week. For instance, in congested corridors like State Route 91, the decal saved drivers significant driving time. The removal of this perk will now see most motorists take 20 to 30 minutes more on the road each day.

Final Opportunity for Drivers Before the Program Ends

While the CAV decal program is ending, the DMV has created a short grace period for drivers who want to apply for the decal before it expires. The deadline is August 29, 2025. However, it is essential to note that their HOV lane access will expire on September 30, 2025. This is not an extension, but a last chance for those who had not applied to use the perk.

Why the Program Is Ending

The CAV program is ending because the federal government has not authorized single-occupant EVs to use carpool lanes. For California to renew these decals, it needs approval from the federal government. California state officials had hoped that the deal would continue through 2027, but they are bound by federal law.

Why Critics Call the Decision a Step Backward

Local groups like the Electric Vehicle Association of San Diego have opposed the move, saying that the decal program is a low-cost and high-impact policy that encouraged EV purchases and also eased congestion. Additionally, hundreds of thousands of drivers will now have to endure longer and more expensive commutes.

Will Ending HOV Lane Access Slow EV Adoption?

Experts have argued that incentives like HOV access have contributed to EV sales, especially in regions that experience heavy traffic, such as the Bay Area and Los Angeles. This incentive was so effective in encouraging clean vehicle adoption in California. It also had ambitious targets to ban the sale of gas-powered car sales by 2035.

Without access to the carpool lane perk, the other benefits, like tax credits, cheaper fueling, and lower maintenance costs, may not be enough to encourage households to buy or use EV vehicles.

Conclusion

The deadline to apply for a Clean Air Vehicle decal is August 29, 2025. However, all decals will expire on September 30, 2025. Therefore, starting October 1, 2025, only drivers who meet the standard carpool occupancy rules will be able to use the HOV lanes. Single-occupant EVs will not enjoy the privilege anymore.",https://www.grada3.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DMV.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 17:01:32.844064

In a major regulatory reversal, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has officially withdrawn its 2024 proposal to strengthen wastewater discharge limits for meat and poultry processing facilities. The agency cited potential disruptions to the U.S. meat supply, facility closures, and significant job losses as key reasons behind the decision.

Originally developed under the Biden administration, the proposal would have required facilities to adopt new wastewater treatment technologies, a move environmental groups hailed as long overdue. But industry stakeholders, led by the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC), warned the rule would impose crippling costs on meat processors and threaten plant viability nationwide.

""The EPA's withdrawal reduces future compliance costs for this vital American industry and helps support affordable food prices and cost of living,"" the agency noted in a summary statement, aligning the move with President Donald Trump's deregulatory priorities and his broader campaign to combat the ""cost-of-living crisis.""

Job Losses and Supply Chain Disruption Weighed Heavily

EPA's original analysis projected that up to 16 plants could close under the preferred regulatory scenario. In the final action document signed by Administrator Lee Zeldin, the agency estimated the no-rule option avoids the closure of between 10 and 93 plants, potentially preventing the loss of 3,199 to 26,657 American jobs.

The agency emphasized lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, when processing disruptions led to severe meat shortages and price spikes. ""Even impacts considered economically achievable could pose serious threats to the nation's food supply,"" the EPA warned.

Industry Applauds ‘Common-Sense' Decision

The NPPC welcomed the rollback, calling it a victory for science-based, economically viable regulation.

""The National Pork Producers Council applauds the Trump administration and EPA Administrator Zeldin for taking a common-sense approach,"" said NPPC President Duane Stateler, a pork producer from McComb, Ohio.

The group stated that stringent permitting changes under the Clean Water Act (CWA) would have forced sweeping upgrades and costly compliance burdens across the meat sector, reducing capacity and driving up prices for consumers.

Environmental Groups Decry Missed Opportunity

Conversely, environmental advocates criticized the decision, arguing it favors short-term economics over long-term sustainability. Groups that had sued EPA to act on slaughterhouse discharges said even the proposed rule's preferred option would have cut nitrogen by just 10% and phosphorus by 37%-while a more ambitious alternative could have reduced those discharges by 83% and 94%, respectively.

The decision effectively ends a two-year public comment process, during which environmental and industry groups clashed over how to balance environmental justice, clean water goals, and the economic realities of meat processing in the U.S.

What's Next for EPA and the Meat Sector?

The decision signals a continued pivot away from aggressive environmental enforcement in favor of economic resilience and supply chain stability, a hallmark of the Trump administration's policy framework.

Yet critics warn that without stronger safeguards, rural waterways and low-income communities near processing plants will continue to bear the brunt of pollution from the $200 billion U.S. meat industry.",https://www.agrolatam.com/files/image/63/63197/68b361d074ea0_600_315!.png?s=eb6d254dabda9749cda292f9aad90b5f&d=1756588437,N,,2025-08-31 18:01:33.489826

Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""

Geo-Energie Jura AG began geothermal simulation tests in June to test how well water can flow through the rock in a future reservoir.

The simulation included temperature measurement at 3,986 meters and a borehole casing at 3,800 meters. The testers calibrated eight seismometers after placing them at the bottom of the borehole. Water injection activity started on July 8 and stopped on July 14 after reaching the threshold twice. Various testing and monitoring continued until July 31.

Scaling the testing in stages to pause for analysis, as the company has done, is vital to reducing earthquake risks. By the end of testing, researchers recorded 3,387 very low-magnitude seismic events that quickly decreased as water injections stopped.

To ensure safety, researchers continuously monitor activity and collect data. The second phase will include geothermal reservoir stimulation if it continues to meet safety guidelines.

Geothermal heat derives from beneath the surface. It's harnessed by power plants, heat pumps that directly heat and cool buildings, and enhanced geothermal systems such as the Geo-Energie Jura AG project to create electricity. As the hot water or steam from the underground reservoir reaches the surface, it drives turbines connected to electricity generators.

Hot springs and geysers are naturally occurring hydrothermal sources of this energy. However, sometimes drilling wells is necessary.

This energy source can transform society thanks to its reliable and limitless supply from the planet's constantly replenished internal heat. Unlike solar or wind, it's available regardless of the weather. Its low carbon emissions also reduce pollution, enabling a cleaner and healthier environment for all.

Plus, the savings on home systems can be massive.

The average payback period to offset installation is five to 10 years, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Once built, these systems have lower maintenance costs than HVACs and can increase home resale value, according to ABE Heating and Cooling.

Some states and local governments may also provide incentives for homes and businesses to install them. On average, these systems can reduce energy bills by as much as 70%.

While the supporting documentation for the proposed changes to the use of offshore wind resources has been marked as for internal use only, the proposed policy changes would entail the withdrawal and cancellation of 12 offshore wind grants and projects currently under development. The restructuring of the grants and shifting of these projects to maritime infrastructure, which is centered around shipbuilding, as well as the historical sources of energy policy, would have to start the restoration of the infrastructural systems of energy, which are foundational and core to the policies of America. This ultimately needs to be done in a way to secure the shipbuilding and general maritime capabilities of America as a whole.

The changes as proposed have raised great concern, particularly amongst proponents of renewables. These shift changes are argued to be aimed at stalling the advancement of offshore wind power, utilizing the potential available offshore resources in the United States. Such arguments are counter-refuted by salient figures in government who emphasize the offshore wind policy shift as being key to strengthening national security as well as energy stability for the future of the country.

The DOT and MARAD Focus on Maritime Dominance

The decision by the DOT and MARAD to discontinue funding offshore wind projects demonstrates the Biden administration’s intention to focus on the revitalization of the US shipbuilding industry. In a statement, the DOT explained that the funding would be redirected to increasing shipbuilding capacity and developing further domestic energy projects. The government also reiterated its intention to more fully utilize the nation’s energy resources, indicating that the emphasis on offshore wind projects was a misallocation of time and resources to more pressing and crucial maritime priorities.

Granted, this decision has attracted the ire of those who support renewable energy projects. However, the stance of the DOT and MARAD is that the projects are essential to securing the country’s energy and maritime independence.

Impacted Projects and Locations

Withdrawn by the DOT and the MARAD, the grants cover offshore wind projects with major terminals and port developments in several states across the US. The most affected would be the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind in California, which has lost funding worth $427 million. The Salem Wind Port in Massachusetts and the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port in Virginia will also be adversely impacted. The former will lose $33.8 million, while the latter will lose $39 million. Even smaller projects like the Wind Port, being developed by the Bridgeport Port Authority in Connecticut, and the Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Virginia, will also be adversely affected.

All these ports were meant to support the advancing offshore wind industry by providing the storage, maintenance, and transportation infrastructure for the wind energy equipment, including turbines and monopiles. The grants, which were meant for the development of these facilities to meet the demands of offshore wind projects, were set under false expectations and have now, unfortunately, been retracted.

Burdock, along with many industry experts, bashed the government for cutting funding as, “reversing decades of net gain on clean, renewable energy policy, energy transition, and job creation.” As she highlighted, “Granting funding for the offshore wind ports offers an infrastructure upgrade which supports many sectors and does not solely target wind energy. Any funding cuts will likely slow down the initiatives taken nationally to gain energy dominance and ensure energy security.”

For the sake of job retention in the fishing and maritime industry, Burdock agrees that funding towards the development of wind ports should continue, as it will gain a great deal of investment to help meet the country’s energy demand. It was suggested that the withdrawal of these offshore wind renewable energy grants could result in the U.S. losing its global dominance in renewable energy, a great deal of jobs and economic opportunities, and more.

Renewable Energy Support Regardless of Obstacles

In spite of the grant withdrawal difficulties, the U.S. has invested heavily in offshore wind and hydrogen renewable energy in the last few years. In 2023, President Joe Biden stated that in the United States, 18 offshore wind shipbuilding projects were in development, with 3.5$ billion in capital pledged to 12 manufacturing facilities and 13 ports to support the offshore wind supply chain.

The Biden administration has also noted that these investments in renewable energy are resulting in the creation of new jobs in shipyards across the country in Louisiana, Florida, Michigan, and other states. These jobs include building crew transfer vessels and specialized ships for offshore wind installation. The wind energy projects still underway serve to show the commitment to promoting offshore clean energy, even while funding has been restricted for some ports.

Realignment of the Spending Priorities to Conventional Energy and National Security in Maritime Affairs. The cancelled projects fund withdrawals, as argued by DOT and MARAD, should now fund the reconstruction of the traditional maritime infrastructure, which is considered vital for national security. ‘Flexible Directorate of Marine Affairs and Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Senior’- it would also permit the country to bolster the maritime capacity and energize the traditional energy infrastructure. The goal of the government is to achieve, for the first time, the long-term energy security of the country while developing a military shipbuilding base, which would also be capable of meeting the national defense demands of the country.

Duffy also termed the focus of projects on offshore wind ‘wasteful,’ arguing that there are better uses of those resources for the betterment of the country’s maritime industry.

Conclusion: Does this set a step back for the progress of offshore wind?

Although the decision to withdraw funding for offshore wind terminals and ports and the subsequent impact on the sails of offshore renters has ruffled feathers within the renewables industry, the government’s view is a pronounced example of interweaving energy and defense priorities. The reallocation of the nearly $700 million in grants is a case in point, signifying a regain of focus on traditional energy and maritime infrastructure.

The Siteot application reflects a setback in all clean and sustainable ambitions for the offshore wind industry. The rest of the country, along with the U.S. renewable energy sector, is waiting to find out how the planned U. S. energy and maritime strategy will affect future expansion for offshore wind and renewables.

The ruling not only resolves a specific dispute but may also carry broader implications for other high-profile funding battles, including challenges related to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

This development is part of a larger national conversation about how federal climate funds are distributed, monitored, and—at times—pulled back. With billions of dollars tied to environmental justice and greenhouse gas reduction programs, the stakes are incredibly high for communities, advocates, and policymakers working to ensure that resources reach those most affected by pollution and climate change. For readers following the intersection of climate action and public accountability, this case is a clear example of how legal frameworks are shaping the future of environmental policy. Learn more about climate and environmental justice issues here.

Background: The EPA’s Environmental Justice Block Grants

The Environmental Justice (EJ) block grants were designed to channel federal funding into communities disproportionately impacted by environmental hazards—places where industrial pollution, unsafe drinking water, and climate change impacts often intersect with racial and economic inequities. These grants aim to empower local organizations, grassroots movements, and state and tribal governments to implement solutions that address environmental health risks while promoting long-term resilience.

However, disputes can arise when grantees and the federal government clash over compliance, reporting, or implementation. In this case, a recipient of one of these block grants sued the EPA after the agency moved to terminate the funding. The plaintiff argued that the termination was unlawful and would harm communities relying on the project.

The Court’s Ruling

The judge ultimately sided with the EPA, dismissing the lawsuit and affirming the agency’s authority to terminate grants under certain circumstances. The decision emphasized the discretion federal agencies hold in managing taxpayer-funded programs, particularly when concerns arise over accountability, performance, or compliance with program guidelines.

While the ruling brings closure to this specific dispute, it also sets a precedent that could influence future cases. Notably, ongoing legal challenges around the EPA’s administration of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—a multibillion-dollar program created under the Inflation Reduction Act—may now look to this case as a reference point.

Why This Matters for Climate Policy

The dismissal of this lawsuit underscores several critical points:

Federal Oversight and Accountability: Agencies like the EPA have broad discretion to ensure grants are used effectively. If performance or compliance issues arise, termination is a tool they can legally use.

Ripple Effects for Other Programs: Similar litigation tied to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is central to reducing U.S. emissions while boosting clean energy projects, may be influenced by this precedent.

Impact on Communities: While the ruling clarifies legal authority, it also raises concerns that sudden funding cuts could leave vulnerable communities in limbo—particularly those that rely heavily on EJ block grants to address ongoing environmental health crises.

For communities disproportionately affected by climate change, the consistency and stability of funding streams are just as important as the existence of the programs themselves. The challenge ahead is balancing oversight with reliability so that frontline organizations can plan long-term solutions without fear of abrupt financial disruption.

Looking Ahead: Implications for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund represents one of the most ambitious federal climate investments in U.S. history, dedicating $27 billion to clean energy projects, emissions reductions, and community-driven climate initiatives. With lawsuits already emerging over how funds are awarded and whether certain organizations qualify, this recent dismissal could embolden the EPA’s authority to defend its decisions and terminate funds when necessary.

However, advocates caution that the agency must tread carefully. If enforcement and oversight are perceived as overly heavy-handed, it could discourage smaller grassroots organizations from applying—precisely the groups that environmental justice funding is meant to empower.

Sustainable Action and the Path Forward

The court’s ruling is a reminder that climate action does not take place in a vacuum. Legal battles, federal oversight, and political debates all shape how resources are distributed—and whether vulnerable communities truly benefit.

As the U.S. accelerates its transition toward clean energy and more equitable climate solutions, transparency and accountability will remain key. But so too will stability, ensuring that projects can grow and thrive without fear of sudden funding disruptions.

The dismissal of the EPA grant termination lawsuit closes one chapter, but it opens the door to broader discussions about how we protect, administer, and deliver climate funding at scale. At the core is a fundamental truth: effective climate action depends not just on bold commitments, but on ensuring those commitments reach the communities that need them most.",https://sustainableactionnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/output-onlinepngtools-7.png,N,,2025-08-31 18:01:45.653066

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

What are Australian lithium stocks?

Australian lithium stocks refer to shares in ASX-listed companies involved in the exploration, mining, processing, and export of lithium and lithium compounds, mostly centered in Western Australia. These stocks are a critical part of the global battery materials and renewable energy supply chain.

Why are lithium stocks on the ASX so important in 2025?

Due to Australia’s vast lithium reserves, efficient regulations, and advanced infrastructure, its ASX-listed stocks supply a significant portion of the world’s battery-grade lithium—fueling new technology, clean energy, electric vehicles, and global supply chain stability in 2025 and beyond.

Which are the best lithium mining stocks on the ASX in 2025?

Pilbara Minerals (PLS), Mineral Resources (MIN), Wesfarmers’ lithium division (including Galaxy Resources), Lepidico (LPD), IGO Ltd, and Core Lithium Ltd (CXO) are regarded as among the best lithium mining stocks, with strong reserves, market positions, and downstream impact.

How is lithium mining impacting infrastructure and agriculture in Australia?

Lithium mining boosts rural infrastructure investment, employment, and logistics upgrades. For agriculture, it necessitates careful water and land management to minimize environmental impact—leveraging sustainability tools and ESG compliance to ensure co-existence of both sectors.

How can technology like Farmonaut improve mining and supply chain management?

Neither Ellomay nor its independent public accountants have reviewed or consulted with the Luzon Group , Ellomay Luzon Energy or Dorad with respect to the financial results included in this press release.","TEL-AVIV, Israel, Aug. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American; TASE: ELLO) (“Ellomay” or the “Company”) , a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and USA, today reported the publication in Israel of financial statements as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 of Dorad Energy Ltd. (“ Dorad ”), in which Ellomay indirectly held, as of June 30, 2025, approximately 9.4% through its indirect 50% ownership of Ellomay Luzon Energy Infrastructures Ltd. (formerly U. Dori Energy Infrastructures Ltd.) (“ Ellomay Luzon Energy ”).

On August 31, 2025, Amos Luzon Entrepreneurship and Energy Group Ltd. (the “ Luzon Group ”), an Israeli public company that currently holds the remaining 50% of Ellomay Luzon Energy, which, in turn, held 18.75% of Dorad as of June 30, 2025, published its quarterly report in Israel based on the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law, 1968. Based on applicable regulatory requirements, the quarterly report of the Luzon Group includes the financial statements of Dorad for the same period.

The financial statements of Dorad as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Ellomay will include its indirect share of these results (through its holdings in Ellomay Luzon Energy) in its financial results for this period. In an effort to provide Ellomay’s shareholders with access to Dorad’s financial results (which were published in Hebrew), Ellomay hereby provides a convenience translation to English of Dorad’s financial results.

On July 22, 2025, Ellomay Luzon Energy acquired an additional 15% of Dorad’s share capital as a result of its exercise of a right of first refusal granted to it under Dorad’s articles of association and shareholders’ agreement, and therefore the Company’s current indirect share of Dorad is approximately 16.9%.

Dorad Financial Highlights

Dorad’s revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2025 – approximately NIS 566.8 million.

Dorad’s operating profit for the three months ended June 30, 2025 – approximately NIS 56.9 million.

Dorad’s loss for the three months ended June 30, 2025 mainly results from an increase of approximately NIS 72.7 million in financing expenses compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 due to NIS/USD exchange rate differences in connection with deposits denominated in USD. Certain of Dorad’s expenses (natural gas acquisition and maintenance costs) are also denominated in USD.

Dorad notes in its financial statements that on June 13, 2025, the State of Israel launched operation “Rising Lion” against Iran, as part of the Iron Swords war, for the purpose of removing the nuclear and missile threat against Israel. As a result of this operation, and in view of the high risk to lives and property from the ballistic missile attacks and unmanned aerial vehicles that were launched against Israel by Iran in response, strict restrictions were imposed on the Israeli home front that included, inter alia, restrictions on gatherings and restrictions on movement. In addition, as a result of closing the Israeli airspace, hundreds of thousands of Israelis were delayed in returning to Israel. As part of the restrictions on gatherings and movement, the Israeli economy began operating in a state of emergency whereby only essential businesses were allowed to open and the schools and higher education system shifted to online learning, two instructions that resulted in substantial damage to the Israeli economy. On June 24, 2025, an agreement was reached regarding a ceasefire, after which the Israeli economy resumed operating in full capacity. Dorad’s revenues in June 2025 decreased by approximately 22% compared to the same month in the previous year, including due to the military operation. As this is an event beyond Dorad’s control, and factors such as the continuation or cessation of the fighting may affect Dorad’s estimates, as of the date of approval of Dorad’s financial statements (August 14, 2025), Dorad was unable to assess the extent of the impact of the war and the operation on its business activities and results in the medium and long term. Dorad continues to monitor developments on the matter on an ongoing basis and is examining the implications for its operations and the value of its assets.

Based on the information provided by Dorad, the demand for electricity by Dorad’s customers is seasonal and is affected by, inter alia, the climate prevailing in that season. The months of the year are split into three seasons as follows: summer – June-September; winter – December-February; and intermediate (spring and autumn) – March-May and October-November. There is a higher demand for electricity during the winter and summer seasons, and the average electricity consumption is higher in these seasons than in the intermediate seasons and is even characterized by peak demands due to extreme climate conditions of heat or cold. In addition, Dorad’s revenues are affected by the change in load and time tariffs – TAOZ (an electricity tariff that varies across seasons and across the day in accordance with demand hour clusters), as, on average, TAOZ tariffs are higher in the summer season than in the intermediate and winter seasons. Therefore, the results presented for the quarter ended June 30 , 202 5 , which include the intermediate month s of April and May and the summer month of June , are not indicative of full year results. In addition, due to various reasons, including the effects of the increase in the Israeli CPI impacting interest payments by Dorad on its credit facility , the results included herein may not be indicative of second quarter results in the future or comparable to second quarter results in the past .

A convenience translation of the financial results for Dorad as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and as of and for each of the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 is included at the end of this press release. Ellomay does not undertake to separately report Dorad’s financial results in a press release in the future. Neither Ellomay nor its independent public accountants have reviewed or consulted with the Luzon Group , Ellomay Luzon Energy or Dorad with respect to the financial results included in this press release.

""We're talking about Microsoft providing the technology to oil companies to dramatically increase fossil fuel production,"" Holly said.
Amazon has also worked with drillers to help simulate their oil production in a bid to maximize their output.
They also need to draw clear lines in the sand, such as no AI or cloud deals to explicitly expand fossil fuel production.""","Will and Holly Alpine loved their jobs at Microsoft, which made quitting to protest the company's work with the oil and gas industry a terrifying experience.

The Seattle-based couple worked in the company's responsible AI and sustainability divisions, respectively, and were heavily involved in internal groups pushing the company to become greener. He had worked at Microsoft since 2020, and she had been there since 2014.

During their final few years at Microsoft, the couple said they raised concerns with internal memos about how the company's tech was helping the oil and gas industry expand fossil fuel production.

""I had concerns that the tools I was helping build were being weaponized by bad actors, and I was concerned about the lack of accountability,"" Will, 36, told Business Insider.

Eventually, they realized they could create more change if they left the company. ""We had reached a conclusion that, within reason, we did everything we could from the inside constructively — and there was no one else pushing from the outside,"" Holly, 33, said.

Microsoft declined to comment. The company has committed to becoming carbon negative by 2030.

Leaving Microsoft

In early 2024, the couple left their jobs and launched the Enabled Emissions Campaign to raise awareness of Microsoft's work with the fossil-fuel industry and put pressure on the Big Tech giant from the outside.

Leaving their stable tech jobs has been the ""most ambitious and challenging period of our lives,"" Will said.

The decision also came with some serious lifestyle changes.

The couple has had to ""cut their cost of living dramatically,"" Holly said, although being vegan meant they were ""already used to living affordably"" by eating ""lots of rice and beans.""

The couple also takes part in the sharing economy ""wherever possible,"" participates in their local ""Buy Nothing"" group, and buys most goods secondhand. Will said that, as an engineer, he embraces DIY.

They also decided to be child-free, which helped them avoid the ""major expense of child-rearing,"" Holly told Business Insider.

""We are privileged tech workers, we had stable finances, no kids; we just decided, you know, if not us, who? We should take the leap and just kind of trust in the universe that it's going to work out,"" she said.

Microsoft's oil and gas ties

Microsoft's overall carbon emissions increased by 23.4% between 2020 and 2024, according to the company's most recently published figures.

These numbers do not include emissions from increased fossil fuel production linked to efficiency gains from Microsoft's technology, the Alpines told Business Insider.

According to a 2019 Microsoft press release, the application of its cloud, Internet of Things, and machine learning technology by a subsidiary of oil and gas giant ExxonMobil was anticipated to ""expand production by as much as 50,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day by 2025.""

Microsoft declined to provide a more up-to-date estimate.

That is the equivalent of 6,356,475 metric tonnes of CO2 being emitted in one year, according to modelling from the Green Web Foundation, a non-profit. It's also more than half of the entire carbon footprint that Microsoft reported in 2019, on one contract.

""We're talking about Microsoft providing the technology to oil companies to dramatically increase fossil fuel production,"" Holly said. ""Those increases in emissions are not counted in any of Microsoft's reporting.""

Microsoft's work with the oil and gas industry preceded the generative AI boom, and the Alpines say AI is helping to ramp up fossil fuel production. AI could already help increase fossil fuel production by up to 10-15%, cutting oil recovery rates while increasing recovery rates of oil and gas, per a 2020 Barclays report.

""It has fundamentally reshaped the economics of fossil fuel extraction, and generative AI is a layer of innovation on that that's really increased the scale,"" Holly said.

Microsoft isn't the only Big Tech giant with ties to the oil and gas industry. Amazon has also worked with drillers to help simulate their oil production in a bid to maximize their output. While Google once had connections to the industry, it pledged to stop selling its machine learning platform for oil exploration use cases in 2020, following employee backlash.

Launching the Enabled Emissions Campaign

The Enabled Emission Campaign's primary goals are to highlight how companies use technology to increase the production of fossil fuels and call for guardrails for this use.

""We think Big Tech companies should stop enabling the problem that they claim to be solving, and Big Tech must account for and disclose the full climate impact of the contracts they sign, especially with fossil fuel clients,"" Will said. ""So that means measuring these enabled emissions, and not just their own operational footprints. They also need to draw clear lines in the sand, such as no AI or cloud deals to explicitly expand fossil fuel production.""

The couple spends their days focusing on policy advocacy, deep research, fundraising, and coalition-building.

Fundraising for the campaign has been tricky. ""A lot of folks are not actually even aware of this work happening, so it's kind of an awareness-raising first before we can even get to that fundraising,"" Holly said.

The EEC has raised a pre-seed round from an anonymous individual donor who is known to the couple. The funding has allowed them to sustain themselves financially for the time being, but Holly said the couple had ""traded short-term stability for the opportunity to address a long-term crisis.""

An added difficulty has been the US's policy landscape during Donald Trump's second term, with the administration rolling back tax credits that benefited the clean energy sector.

""We haven't been inside Microsoft since Trump 2.0, but we've witnessed a shift of backsliding in climate commitments as partially driven by the race for AI supremacy,"" Will said, adding that there was no response from Microsoft when Trump pulled the US from the Paris climate accord for the second time.

Microsoft can't feasibly claim to want to be carbon negative while helping oil majors increase their output, Holly added. She hopes the EEC will help move the needle and push the company to break these ties.",https://i.insider.com/685d16a93d5881a51c1c1c76?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-08-31 16:00:42.902984

The bottom line Renewable manufacturing is messy, fast, and unforgiving, but it rewards teams that impose light, honest structure on the chaos.","The renewable energy boom has grown up. Solar panel lines no longer look like hobby labs; they run at breathtaking tempo, swapping recipes and cell formats mid-shift. Wind-turbine manufacturers balance discrete assembly with project-style logistics and field service. Battery and power-electronics makers juggle chemistry, traceability, and fast-moving compliance. Even small shops—fabricating racking, inverters’ sheet metal, cable harnesses, EV-charger enclosures, heat pump components—now need the kind of planning discipline that used to be reserved for big aerospace. In 2025 the question isn’t “Do we need ERP?” It’s which ERP helps you plan production, prove traceability, control cost, and run greener—without burying a lean team in complexity.

This guide ranks seven manufacturing ERPs that stand out for renewable-energy makers this year. The emphasis is pragmatic: short time to value, real shop-floor traction, and capabilities that matter for green hardware—serial/lot traceability, BOM and routing control, quality, supplier collaboration, project and service management, and signals that support sustainability reporting (think: material provenance, scrap and rework capture, energy-aware scheduling, downstream maintenance data). The list reflects the diversity of renewable manufacturing, from boutique component shops to growing OEMs and multi-site groups. You’ll see options that fit a ten-person operation and others that suit a multi-entity organization with centralized purchasing and consolidated reporting.

Before diving in, one more word on “supporting renewable energy.” There isn’t a single magical “green” module that makes an ERP eco-friendly. What helps in the real world are solid manufacturing foundations—clean item masters and BOMs, routings that mirror how work is actually done, accurate consumption and scrap capture, reliable supplier and batch records—and then the openness to connect with MES, IoT, LCA tools, and carbon-accounting apps. Keep that lens in mind as you read.

1) MRPeasy — The right-sized manufacturing ERP for solar, storage, and clean-tech component makers

MRPeasy sits at the top because it does what many renewable manufacturers need most: it elevates day-to-day planning and control without dragging the team through an 18-month rollout. The platform is unapologetically manufacturing-first—BOMs, multi-level BOMs, and routings are first-class citizens; work orders are easy to launch; and capacity planning ties to real work centers and calendars. For a small-to-midsize shop printing battery-pack brackets today and building inverter subassemblies tomorrow, that clarity translates to fewer shortages, a steadier promise date, and margins you can actually trust.

The heartbeat of MRPeasy for renewable makers is its production planning. You can model each product’s routing step by step—say, cut-and-bend, weld, powder coat, assemble, end-of-line test—and assign times, resources, and skills. When demand lands, the system generates work orders that respect those constraints instead of inventing a schedule that only exists on paper. Because lot and serial tracking are baked in, you can link every inverter chassis or combiner box to the exact material batches and process steps that created it. That’s critical for warranty, for field service, and for the growing set of audits in solar, storage, and grid hardware.

MRPeasy also shines in purchasing and inventory. Renewable makers live and die by lead times and minimum order quantities: aluminum extrusions, resin cartridges, rare connectors, insulated busbars, adhesive tapes—each with its quirks. The software gives planners clean reorder points, shortage flags, and purchase suggestions that tie back to the jobs that need the parts. As a result, buyers aren’t ordering “because we’re nervous” but because upcoming work actually requires it. When a supplier changes spec or lot certifications, the traceability chain stays intact, which makes customer conversations calm instead of frantic.

For those building to order, MRPeasy’s quoting and job costing keep you honest. You can price a new inverter model or a bespoke racking design using real BOMs and routings, then watch the actuals as the order flows. That feedback loop is what eliminates the slow bleed of under-quoted work. Add quality checkpoints to routings, capture scrap and rework where it happens, and you have data to improve yield and reduce waste—two levers that are as “green” as they are profitable.

Just as important, MRPeasy manufacturing ERP software plays well with others. Most renewable shops already run accounting in QuickBooks or Xero, use CAD and PLM, and increasingly connect machines through lightweight MES or IoT. MRPeasy’s API and CSV connectors are straightforward, so you can push finished-goods and cost data to accounting, import items and BOMs from engineering, or feed shop-floor data collectors without hiring an army of integrators. It’s not a clinical ERP with claims processing, and it’s not trying to be; it’s focused manufacturing control that a small team can learn and love.

There are limits. If you’re a multi-entity DSO-style organization with elaborate consolidations or a global enterprise with deep EHS tooling, other systems on this list will go further on that axis. But for the most common renewable-manufacturing realities—small to midsize teams building physical things, juggling supply risk, needing clean traceability and predictable throughput—MRPeasy is the fastest path to a calmer, greener operation.

2) Oracle NetSuite — The financial backbone for multi-entity clean-tech groups

NetSuite earns its place because many renewable energy businesses graduate from a single shop to a portfolio of entities: a manufacturing arm, a service company that installs and maintains systems, and a distribution unit. When that happens, you need serious multi-entity finance, centralized purchasing, and consolidated reporting. NetSuite is excellent at that. It offers robust general ledger, dimensions, intercompany eliminations, and procurement frameworks that let a central team buy for several factories and service regions at once, while still giving each site the inventory visibility it needs.

For renewable manufacturers, the draw is the “hub-and-spoke” model. Procurement can standardize supplier contracts for aluminum, PCBs, fasteners, and power semiconductors, then allocate stock where production needs it. You can give plant managers dashboards that focus on open POs, inbound containers, and vendor performance while keeping CFO-level control of spend and cash. Add the suite’s project accounting and you can track the cost of a new line, a pilot program, or a product transfer as a true project, not just a guess in a spreadsheet.

On the sustainability front, NetSuite’s value is data hygiene and extensibility. Clean item masters, consistent units of measure, landed cost handling, and lot/serial fields set the stage for downstream reporting in ESG and carbon apps. The marketplace is huge, so there are ready ways to plug in MES, PLM, LCA, and carbon-accounting tools. NetSuite itself won’t model every nuance of a wind nacelle’s manufacturing routing or a cell assembly line; the trick is to integrate specialized shop-floor systems and keep finance and supply chain truthful and timely. If you are a scale-up with investors scrutinizing gross margin, cash conversion, and compliance, NetSuite gives you credible numbers at the speed you need.

3) Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central — The Microsoft-centric path to disciplined operations

For manufacturers who live inside the Microsoft world—Teams, SharePoint, Power BI—Business Central is a comfortable, capable ERP. It covers the essentials of finance, inventory, purchasing, and production in a way that fits small and midsize organizations. The native reporting through Power BI is a boon for renewable makers who want to build dashboards showing scrap trends by product family, on-time completions, supplier OTIF, or inventory turns for critical components.

Business Central is good at the process discipline that renewable operations crave. You can codify approval workflows for spend, standardize item and vendor records, and create BOMs and routes that the shop can actually follow. Manufacturers often add a light MES or barcoding app to make data capture painless on the floor, then let Power Automate move information between engineering, production, and procurement. And because everything speaks Microsoft, adoption is easier: the same identity, the same UI ideas, the same reporting vocabulary.

The caution here is to size the manufacturing features against your reality. If you are running a sophisticated battery line with recipe management and complex co-products, Business Central may need add-ons to match your process depth. If you are fabricating enclosures, assembling inverter stacks, winding coils, or building EV-charger pedestals with straightforward routings, it’s more than enough. Many renewable firms pair Business Central with PLM or CAD connectors to keep BOMs in sync, and the result is a tidy, maintainable stack.

4) Acumatica — Open, API-first ERP for growing clean-tech makers

Acumatica’s reputation in manufacturing comes from an open API and modern architecture that make it friendly to integrate and extend. For renewable manufacturers who plan to add plants, shift production between regions, or connect to an expanding constellation of apps (MES, IIoT, quality, service), that openness pays off every month. The manufacturing edition supports BOMs and routings, material planning, production orders, and multi-warehouse inventory with the sort of clarity a production planner can live in all day.

What makes Acumatica appealing to clean-tech is how well it handles multi-location inventory and project accounting. If you’re supporting a pilot line in one site, a maturing line in another, and contract manufacturing in a third, you can keep a single truth for items and costs while respecting local realities. For companies that mix product and project revenue—say, you build a standard product but also run customer-funded engineering projects—Acumatica ties the financials together in a way that doesn’t require an army of spreadsheets.

On the sustainability side, the platform’s flexibility helps capture the operational signals you need for greener decisions: scrap by work center, overtime spikes that hint at energy peaks, vendor performance that correlates with quality escapes. Acumatica won’t claim to be a carbon-calculator, but it captures the ground-truth data those tools need. With a healthy ecosystem of partners, you can bolt on barcoding, configure-to-order portals, and carbon or LCA reporting without bending the core system out of shape.

5) Infor CloudSuite Industrial (SyteLine) — Deep manufacturing DNA for complex assemblies

Infor CSI, known to many as SyteLine, brings serious manufacturing depth to the table, which can be a strong fit for renewable OEMs building complex products like wind turbine components, utility-scale inverters, or battery energy storage systems with field service. Its planning engine understands multi-level BOMs, alternate routings, engineered-to-order variations, and the daily grind of rescheduling when a supplier slips or a test station goes down. If your world involves tight engineering change control and heavy configuration, CSI is worth a look.

Infor’s quality and traceability features are mature, and the system handles lot/serial tracking in a way auditors appreciate. For renewable firms, that means cleaner warranty investigations and faster root-cause loops when something in the field needs attention. The service management capabilities also help once your gear leaves the factory: you can connect installations, warranties, spare parts, and maintenance visits back to the way each unit was built. That feedback is a quiet superpower for improving designs and reducing lifetime environmental impact.

CSI is bigger and denser than lighter ERPs on this list. It tends to fit organizations that already have defined processes and want a system to enforce them at scale. For smaller shops making brackets or harnesses, the learning curve may feel steep; for mid-market OEMs with a lot of moving parts, the rigor pays for itself.

6) Epicor Kinetic — A modernized classic for discrete manufacturing in clean energy

Epicor Kinetic is the cloud evolution of a long-running manufacturing ERP, and it shows well in the discrete world: job management, advanced scheduling, MES, quality, and field service. Renewable manufacturers that assemble racking systems, inverter cabinets, turbines’ subassemblies, or power-electronics cabinets often like Kinetic’s combination of shop-floor execution and planning. The scheduling board and job traveler concepts are familiar to production folks, which speeds adoption.

Kinetic’s quality module supports nonconformances, corrective actions, inspections, and the usual suspects that keep auditors happy. The MES options make it easier to gather operator time, machine states, and production counts without living in paper. Those nuts-and-bolts improvements translate to greener operations indirectly: less rework, fewer scrap piles, and data you can actually analyze. If you carry serialized finished goods, the traceability is adequate, and you can track components as lots or serials depending on what the industry demands.

Epicor’s ecosystem is large, so you can find connectors for CAD/PLM, e-commerce portals, and service-management tools. For renewable firms that want a mature, industrial ERP that is still actively modernized, Kinetic hits a reasonable balance. It asks for a thoughtful implementation—no ERP does the thinking for you—but once routings, resources, and quality plans mirror reality, it hums.

7) Odoo Manufacturing — A configurable, budget-friendly path for agile green makers

Odoo is the oddball on purpose. It’s a modular ERP that can be as light or as expansive as you need, and its Manufacturing, Inventory, Purchase, and Accounting apps cover the basics well. For renewable manufacturers on a budget, or for those who want to prototype processes quickly, Odoo is an appealing canvas. You can model BOMs, checkpoints, and work centers, track lots and serials, and use barcodes on the floor without breaking the bank.

What makes Odoo relevant to renewable manufacturing is its customizability. If your process does not fit neatly into a standard ERP flow—maybe you blend make-to-order with kitting, or you run lab recipes alongside discrete assembly—you can use Odoo Studio and the large partner network to shape screens and workflows. The result can be surprisingly elegant for small teams, especially when paired with its website, CRM, and helpdesk modules for a cohesive front-to-back experience.

It has trade-offs. Odoo’s strength is breadth and modifiability, not deep out-of-the-box manufacturing depth for every edge case. Governance matters: decide what you will configure and what you will standardize. For many clean-tech startups and component makers, the combination of low entry cost, quick wins in inventory discipline, and a path to integrate with LCA or carbon apps later is exactly what they need to get moving.

How to choose the right ERP for renewable manufacturing in 2025

Choosing ERP is less about a feature checklist and more about fit and focus. Start by mapping what you truly do. Are you a component shop with frequent engineering changes? A line-builder with recipe-like steps and strict quality gates? An OEM that sells equipment plus multi-year maintenance contracts? The more clearly you describe your reality, the faster vendors can show you the path that works.

If you are a small to midsize manufacturer producing solar racking, EV-charger hardware, cable assemblies, sheet-metal enclosures, inverter subassemblies, or similar, the fastest route to better days is an MRP-first system that your team can actually run. That is why MRPeasy tops this list. You will get clean item masters, BOMs, and routings in weeks, not quarters. Purchasing will stop guessing. The shop will stop overpromising. And you will start to trust your margins. For many clean-tech makers, that is the real sustainability win: a process that wastes less material, less energy, and fewer human hours.

If you are a mid-market organization with several legal entities, centralized procurement, and board-level consolidation needs, a finance-forward ERP such as NetSuite or Dynamics 365 Business Central will likely anchor your stack. Pair it with specialized manufacturing or MES where needed. The finance backbone will give investors and lenders the confidence they expect, while your operations team gets the day-to-day tools to plan, buy, and build with fewer surprises.

If you are a complex OEM—think wind components, utility-scale inverters, or BESS containers with field service—systems like Infor CloudSuite Industrial or Epicor Kinetic can match your depth. You will invest more in implementation, but you will get rigorous scheduling, quality, and service management that stand up to audits and warranty demands. Your sustainability improvements will come partly from the sheer discipline of the system and partly from the data now available to feed product engineering and EHS reporting.

There is also a builder’s path with Acumatica and Odoo. You value openness and want to integrate your ERP with homegrown cloud services, IoT gateways, or LCA tools. You may be running multiple sites with different levels of maturity. The key is to protect the core—items, BOMs, routings, inventory—and let the edges innovate. This approach pairs well with renewable firms that iterate fast and aren’t afraid to refine processes every quarter.

Regardless of platform, a few practices separate successful ERP programs from stalled ones. First, make the master data boring. Decide on naming conventions for items, units, revisions, and suppliers. Agree on how you will structure BOMs and routings. Boring up front saves months later. Second, instrument the bottleneck. In many clean-tech shops the constraint is coating/curing, end-of-line test, or a single machine center. Put that center on a big screen: queue length, average job age, and completion rate. Nothing is greener than eliminating rework at the constraint. Third, close the loop. Capture scrap and rework at the step where it happens and route that fact to engineering and purchasing. Renewable makers survive or fail on yield; an ERP that makes yield visible, case by case, is a quiet superpower.

Finally, think of sustainability reporting as a harvest, not a separate farm. When staff book the correct lot, clock the right step, enter an NCR with cause codes, or record a supplier certificate, they are planting the seeds for carbon and compliance reporting later. You do not need a sustainability module to begin; you need to trust your operational data. From there you can bolt on carbon or LCA tools that read the truth out of your ERP and turn it into the disclosures customers, investors, and regulators expect.

The bottom line

Renewable manufacturing is messy, fast, and unforgiving, but it rewards teams that impose light, honest structure on the chaos. That is exactly what ERP is supposed to bring. In 2025, MRPeasy is the most compelling first choice for small and midsize renewable makers because it matches how they actually build things: with BOMs and routings, with finite capacity, with imperfect suppliers and even more imperfect spreadsheets. It lets you plan, execute, and trace without waiting a year for payoff.",,N,,2025-09-01 04:01:42.467981

Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.

Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.

And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.

Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.

Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.

“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.

But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.

“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”

Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.

State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.

For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.

But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.

“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.

Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.

Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.

“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”

Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.

We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.

– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office

State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.

Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.

“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.

Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.

O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.

Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.

Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.

Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.

In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.

O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”

New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.

Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.

“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

The BBB ends EV tax credits and home charger incentives by Sept 30, making many EVs costlier.

Removing incentives and penalties will spike new EV sales pre-Sept, then cause a trough; used EV prices jump.

Cutting support undermines US EV competitiveness, risks battery-belt jobs, and cedes leadership to China.

The Big Beautiful Bill will end EV tax incentives by 30 September, including on the installation of home charging equipment. Incentives for public EV charging infrastructure, as well as renewable energy generation, are being cut. It also removes the penalties on carmakers if they make gas guzzlers. It removes both the carrot and stick that supported cleaner cars, making gas cars cheaper, and many EVs more expensive, and all more difficult to charge.

The EV tax incentives have been in place since 2008, and the 2022 revisions currently give a tax rebate of up to $7,500 on purchasing certain new EVs, and $4,000 on used ones. These tax incentives apply to both BEVs and PHEVs, although there are very specific limitations on which vehicles and buyers they apply to.

Looking more broadly, in a world where EVs are rapidly increasing their share of the market and the future of transport is electric, America has dropped out of the race, leaving China to win. A sharper focus on the narrow US EV landscape shows EV sales will spike between now and September 30 -- then they will hit a major trough. Used EV prices will spike, and lower-income buyers will have less access to affordable EVs, new or used.

The world is moving to EVs, but the US is no longer

Making US EVs less competitive

Dropping the EV tax incentive will have major implications in the more affordable EV market. The Chevy Equinox EV, starting at $33K, has shot out the lights in sales so far this year, while the Ford Mustang Mach-E, starting at $37K, has stalled. The Equinox, after the tax rebate, will come in at around $26K, a lot cheaper than the more basic Nissan Leaf. Take away the rebate, and the Equinox will go head-to-head with the likes of the base Hyundai Kona.

Volvo vs Tesla

With the tax rebate in place, both the Tesla Model Y and 3, and the Hyundai Ioniq 5 compete very favorably with the Mustang Mach-E. Remove the tax break and the Mach-E's value-for-money equation improves immeasurably. The current opposition will have to compete against the likes of the Hyundai Ioniq 6, the new Toyota BZ, and the Volvo EX30.

The cars currently excluded are made outside the USA, or major components like batteries come from other countries. Their level of affordability would depend on whatever tariffs survive the vagaries of TACO.

The battery belt

The EV economy goes beyond cars

Huge industries have risen on the demands of electrification and clean energy, and in terms of EVs, the battery belt. After the supply chain disruptions of COVID, manufacturers started investing heavily in battery development and manufacture. They found the ideal set of parameters in Georgia, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky.

The so-called battery belt offered the perfect mixture of lots of affordable land, road and rail infrastructure, and skilled labor at affordable prices. These states were also seen as home to emerging R&D hubs, essential to high-tech industry.

Money and jobs

By 2023, more than $90-billion had been invested in this belt, and over 70,000 jobs were been created. When EV sales fall, as they will in the short term, or rise less slowly in the medium term, it will affect the battery belt, the billions invested in it, and the tens of thousands of jobs created to support its growth.

The battery belt runs through red states, and when politics do not align with the local economy, politics is usually the loser. We will see.

EVs not affected by the BBB

EVs are still more expensive on average than gas cars, but the gap is narrowing as EV battery prices fall. Just over 20 EV models currently qualify for the tax break, but there are now nearly 70 EV models in the US market, up from 34 in 2022. Over 60% of US buyers have a favorable view toward EVs, especially with purchase prices and cost of ownership falling rapidly. People are buying EVs, even when there is no tax incentive.

The trend is toward more expensive models, with fewer than a third costing less than the average price. So the rich get the nice cars, while the less wealthy get it in the shorts.

Global competitiveness

While the US is doing the equivalent of playing Age of Empires in reverse, EV market share is rocketing globally. China is by far the biggest car market in the world, and around half of new cars sold there are EVs. The Chinese EV industry is not staying in China, with Europe rapidly seeing (and buying) Chinese EVs. The rest of the world is following suit, with Chinese EV sales booming as near as Mexico.

People are buying Chinese EVs not because they are cheaper, which they are, but because their value proposition is so good. The best of Tesla can probably hold its own in EV technology, but not in the tech-price equation anymore.

By moving away from EVs and the infrastructure that supports its growth, the US has opted out of the biggest thing in automotive history since the Model T. American ingenuity has always started in the home market, from where it went to conquer the world. When the home market is throttled by ideology-driven policy, the US will lose the race.

US drivers want EVs, and they will get them. They just won't be made with US technology.",https://static0.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cybertruck-feature-jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:04:18.502223

Through its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Grant program, FEMA awarded Forest City $2.6 million for improvements to the town’s water and sewer systems.
Princeville Mayor Bobby Jones told CPP that the town continues to draw BRIC funds to work on the project.
Other communities, like Salisbury in Rowan County, are actively searching for alternative funding sources to complete their BRIC projects.
The city intends to apply for FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which unlike BRIC is a post-disaster relief program.","Dozens of North Carolina communities are in limbo after FEMA canceled more than $200 million worth of grants for flood-mitigation projects earlier this year in the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Grant program, also known as BRIC.

For Forest City in Rutherford County, the now defunct grant program was meant to be a safety net. Flooding along the Second Broad River exposed the area’s vulnerability to heavy rainfall five years ago, when rising water smashed debris into a main line and cut off running water to Forest City and the nearby towns of Ellenboro and Bostic.

Repair work following the storm revealed more problems.

Erosion along the river left Forest City’s sewer system and raw water intake at risk of flood damage, but the town didn’t have the money to fix it. Federal emergency management officials told town officials that they would be a good fit for a new grant program aimed at pre-disaster mitigation.

Through its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Grant program, FEMA awarded Forest City $2.6 million for improvements to the town’s water and sewer systems. The project was well into the planning and design process when the federal government revoked the grant.

FEMA announced the end of the BRIC program and canceled all applications from fiscal years 2020 through 2023 on April 4, calling the program created during President Donald Trump’s first term “wasteful and ineffective” in press releases.

In total, 72 North Carolina communities with active BRIC-funded projects worth about $225 million were affected.

Town officials across the state told Carolina Public Press that the mitigation projects they view as essential to keeping their communities safe are now caught in a federal political battle in Washington.

“I don't consider water and sewer projects to be political or woke,” Town Manager Janet Mason said.

Neither did a bipartisan group of 80 members of Congress, which released a letter addressed to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson shortly after the grant program’s termination, urging them to reverse the decision.

“BRIC funds are spurring communities across the country to strengthen their resilience to extreme weather, and forgoing these critical investments will only make it harder and more expensive for communities to recover from the next storm,” the letter read.

Instead, the legislators suggested that FEMA and Congress work together to improve the grant program’s application review and funding distribution processes.

Sen. Thom Tillis and Rep. Chuck Edwards, both North Carolina Republicans, helped craft the letter. Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat representing the northeastern part of the state, and Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat representing Charlotte, were the other two members of North Carolina’s Congressional delegation to add their signatures.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to CPP’s request for a comment on pushback from lawmakers and local governments over the ending of the BRIC program.

Meanwhile, the communities with active BRIC-funded projects have been left to wait as the future of those funds is litigated in court. North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined 19 other U.S. states in suing Noem and Richardson last month, arguing that FEMA’s termination of the grant program was illegal.

The lawsuit has three components.

First, it argues that a 2006 federal law protecting FEMA from being dissolved also prevents the government from “substantially reducing FEMA’s mitigation functions.”

Secondly, the complaint states that FEMA’s refusal to spend funds directed towards the BRIC grant program by Congress violates the legislature’s power of the purse, as granted by the Constitution.

Lastly, it claims that Richardson and his predecessor Cameron Hamilton, who was removed from his position as acting FEMA administrator on May 8, did not have legal authority to end the BRIC program because neither were ever confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

Those plaintiff states won a small victory on Aug. 5 when a United States District Judge placed an injunction on preventing the federal government from spending the BRIC funds until the court gives a final decision.

As noted in the lawsuit, FEMA had planned to return about $882 million of the BRIC funds to the U.S. Treasury and another $4 billion to its Disaster Relief Fund, which is reserved for post-disaster spending.

While many BRIC-funded projects in North Carolina have been put on pause as the federal money is withheld, some projects which have begun construction using already-obligated funds continue to advance.

Such is the case with Princeville, a low-lying community in Edgecombe County which was awarded $11 million to develop a 53-acre plot of land outside of the floodplain which encompasses much of the town.

Princeville Mayor Bobby Jones told CPP that the town continues to draw BRIC funds to work on the project.

Other communities, like Salisbury in Rowan County, are actively searching for alternative funding sources to complete their BRIC projects.

Salisbury was previously awarded $22.5 million through BRIC to relocate its existing water treatment facilities to a location more resilient to flooding. Utilities director Jason Wilson told CPP that the site of the new facilities is shovel-ready, which the city hopes makes it an attractive candidate for other grant programs.

The city intends to apply for FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which unlike BRIC is a post-disaster relief program. Salisbury is eligible to apply since Rowan County was included in the federally declared disaster area following Hurricane Helene.

The City of Lumberton is also searching for a new source of funding for stream restoration, wetland preservation and trail construction projects, which it received a $1.9 million BRIC grant for several years ago.

The Robeson County city, which sits on the Lumber River, has been working since 2016 to develop land it bought from property owners following Hurricane Matthew into an expansive public trails system.

Deputy City Manager Brandon Love told CPP that he’s optimistic that the city will find an alternate source of funding to keep the project moving forward, but it’s nonetheless a disappointing development after years of planning.

“Getting caught up in the politics of things going on in Washington is hitting home here at the local level,” Love said, “and that’s unfortunate.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6b933b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1258x660+0+6/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2Fe7%2Ff21b6b3442b8affbbe1e072651b1%2Fscreenshot-2024-12-17-100215.png,N,,2025-08-31 14:06:11.152029

The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.
The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state.
Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.
Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the power to implement a penalty but has not done so since it was given that authority in 2023.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Assn. recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state. It created an independent division at the commission to oversee the oil and gas industry and provide guidance to the state on its energy transition.

Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.

“When Governor Newsom signed this legislation two years ago, he promised that we would utilize the new transparency tools to look under the hood of our oil and gas market that had been a black box for decades,” spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in a statement. “We did exactly that.”

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission has not determined what would count as an excessive profit under the policy.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at UC Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting toward more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/340e6c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3515x1845+0+248/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2F47%2Fb5ccf6a04d8da0ea84ab0e889574%2F2fe26bac33774cb1bc9e9287d3e5e9f1.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:05:26.373760

,Clean Energy ,2025-08-31 17:00:57+00:00,www.nytimes.com,"Chevron's Boss Says the World Will Need Oil for a 'Long, Long Time' - The New York Times","Jordyn Holman, www.nytimes.com, jordyn-holman",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/31/business/chevron-oil-mike-wirth.html,"The International Energy Agency has predicted that global demand for oil and gas could peak by the end of the decade.
Chevron’s profits have drifted downward along with oil prices, which many analysts expect will continue falling.
Even if they are, once oil demand reaches a level where it’s no longer growing, it’s unlikely to drop off quickly.
When the world stops using oil and gas, we’ll stop looking for it.
Our company is built to work through cycles, because it’s the nature of the energy business.","“We don’t create demand, we meet demand.”

That’s how Mike Wirth, the chief executive of Chevron, describes the way his company works. So long as the world is using oil and gas, Chevron and others have a responsibility to provide those fuels affordably and reliably, he said, “because it advances human progress.”

Chevron, the second-largest oil company in the United States behind Exxon, pumped a record amount of oil and gas last quarter, about 3.4 million barrels a day. President Trump has promised to make it easier for oil companies to get permits for even more drilling. Chevron also recently completed a $53 billion acquisition of Hess after prevailing in a protracted legal battle with its rival Exxon.

But not all is well. The International Energy Agency has predicted that global demand for oil and gas could peak by the end of the decade. Oil prices have fallen as plentiful supplies meet weaker demand, in part because of the economic turmoil generated by Mr. Trump’s trade war. Chevron’s profits have drifted downward along with oil prices, which many analysts expect will continue falling.

Mr. Wirth, who joined Chevron more than 40 years ago and has led the company since 2018, is making changes that he says will set the company up for the future. Last year, he moved Chevron’s headquarters to oil-rich Texas from California, where it was based since its founding in the 1870s. This year, the company announced it would lay off up to 20 percent of its work force, or around 9,000 people, by the end of 2026.

Even if they are, once oil demand reaches a level where it’s no longer growing, it’s unlikely to drop off quickly. It’s more likely to stay at a plateau.

So demand is going to be around for a long, long time. Oil production is what’s known as a depletion business. As we produce barrels, they can’t be produced again. You have to invest in new supply, even if demand’s not growing.

We are investing in new technologies, like hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, lithium and renewable fuels. They are growing fast but off a very small base. We need to do things that meet demand as it exists and then evolve as demand evolves.

Will it ever make sense for Chevron to stop looking for places to drill and focus its efforts on renewable energy sources?

One day, I’m sure it will make sense to do that. Probably a long time from now. When the world stops using oil and gas, we’ll stop looking for it.

But to stop beforehand runs the risk of creating a lot of adverse consequences in terms of the world not having the energy that it needs.

President Trump is eager for energy prices to fall. Is that a good thing for Chevron?

Our company is built to work through cycles, because it’s the nature of the energy business. Prices go up, prices come down, you don’t know when they’re going to do either one.

We have to maintain a healthy portfolio and a strong balance sheet to navigate cycles.

We don’t really run the business based on today’s price or the short-term price. We run it based on a long-term view of markets.

Can you point me to a policy from the Trump administration that has had an impact on your business, good or bad?

I’ll give you a very specific one, and it’s a change from the prior administration.

The United States has tremendous offshore resources in the Gulf of America. Under President Biden, his administration was reducing the number of lease sales and the quality of acreage that was available.

The Trump administration has reversed that and has returned regular lease sales to their program.

That’s a policy change that will ensure that there is a regular flow of exploration opportunities for our industry to go out and see what we can find. That’s a good thing for our economy.

What does Chevron do better than Exxon?

The difference is in the culture of the companies. We put a real premium on partnership. We put a premium on diversity and inclusion. We put a premium on getting the best out of our work force and using that to deliver solutions for communities, governments and customers.

In our industry, strategies are easy to copy. Assets you can buy, technologies you can license. Cultures are harder to build, and they are a differentiator.

Speaking of culture, you moved Chevron’s headquarters to Texas from California. What does that do to the company’s culture?

I don’t think culture is tied to where a company’s headquarters are. It’s really tied to the values of the company.

We’ve got employees in a hundred different countries around the world, and so our culture doesn’t live in a place, it lives in our people and behaviors.

You are cutting 20 percent of the work force. What is it like, as a chief executive, to lay off so many people?

In a commodity business, costs always matter. We have to stay competitive, and the most difficult thing we do is downsize our work force.

The way we protect the most jobs for the most people is by remaining competitive. Companies that don’t remain competitive at some point either don’t exist anymore, or they get acquired by somebody else, or an activist investor comes in and changes things. We have to take control of our own future.

At a time when there’s a discussion about preventing climate change and serving shareholders, how do you want to be remembered as the chief executive of Chevron?

As somebody who was able to balance out all these competing interests.

If you look at some of the European companies in our industry, they have lost a lot of relevance because they embarked on a strategy that said, “We’re going out of the oil and gas business.” It turns out the world is not out of the oil and gas demand business.

These companies took themselves out of being competitive. Their shareholders are unhappy about that. At any public company, but certainly in an industry like ours, we have be very mindful of all of these competing interests. We’re not engaged in idealism. We’ve got to be pragmatic and real.

Do you see the oil and gas industry as a contributor to climate change?

Human activity is a contributor to climate change. We supply energy that is used. If humans did not consume energy or consume oil and gas, we wouldn’t be in business.

But is Chevron able to provide more options or push customers in a different direction?

We’re trying to do that today, with renewable fuels that come from renewable feedstocks, and we’re going to start up one of the world’s largest green hydrogen projects later this year. We’re investing in lithium technology. We’re trying to create choices.

These technologies are more expensive than the current technologies, and so they need to find customers.

Tell me about your upbringing and your parents. You’re from Colorado, and your dad was an executive at Coors.

My dad was not actually on the brewing side. He was a ceramic engineer and was involved in making porcelain products.

My mother was an artist. I had this right brain, left brain upbringing. I wanted to be a journalist at one point, actually. But I was also very good at math and science, and I think that came from my father.

He was a big influence on my career path.

What’s a piece of advice from him that you still reflect on?

It was more of an example that he set. I worked in a factory one summer — graveyard shift from 11 at night until seven in the morning. It was part of the business that made ashtrays, which were distributed to bars and had the Coors logo on them.

My dad had a habit of walking the shop floor. He knew what people’s kids were doing. He knew who won the high school football game on Friday night. Everybody there felt like they knew him. He was just known as Dave.

That was an important lesson for me. Treating everybody with respect and decency was the key to his success, not being a Ph.D.

I’ve heard you are known for writing personalized notes to co-workers.

It’s a simple way to take the lesson that I learned from my father.

When I visit our operations around the world, people prepare for the visit. They explain to me what they’re doing, and they take a lot of time to help me understand their part of the business.

A simple note that thanks them for what they did and acknowledges the specific content that we talked about, says that “I see you, I see what you do, I value what you’re doing, I appreciate it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/31/multimedia/31biz-corneroffice-chevron-pcfv/31biz-corneroffice-chevron-pcfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:04:35.277415

These shifts bring new challenges and opportunities for the state, which has long been a hub for EV manufacturing. As federal incentives diminish, the cost of electric vehicles may rise, making it more difficult for consumers to embrace this cleaner mode of transportation. Georgia’s evolving role in this industry will impact the broader US market, while the push for sustainable travel faces significant hurdles. Understanding these changes is crucial for buyers, manufacturers and policymakers alike.

Federal Policy Shifts and Their Impact on Georgia’s EV Industry

On July 4, the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act marked a turning point for the U.S. electric vehicle market. One of the most notable provisions of the bill is the removal of federal tax credits for EV purchases, effective by the end of September. This policy change has shaken the industry, casting uncertainty on future growth prospects, especially in states like Georgia, which have heavily invested in EV manufacturing. Tax breaks for American battery manufacturers will also expire by 2030, further complicating the financial landscape for the EV industry.

The elimination of these incentives is already having a noticeable impact. Research conducted by Atlas Public Policy revealed that more clean energy projects were cancelled in the first quarter of 2025 than in the previous two years combined. Cancellations and downsized projects have amounted to approximately $14 billion in lost investments, including a significant $1 billion factory planned for Statesboro, Georgia. These setbacks suggest that the momentum in Georgia’s EV sector may be slowing, putting the state’s ambitious goals at risk.

State Leadership’s Response and Optimism

Despite these challenges, Georgia’s state officials and industry leaders remain confident in the future of the state’s electric vehicle sector. Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols emphasized that Georgia’s efforts to establish a strong EV industry were not entirely dependent on federal support. While acknowledging the role tax credits played in stimulating the industry’s growth, he asserted that Georgia’s focus is shifting toward creating a self-sustaining supply chain for EVs.

The state’s commitment to building an independent EV ecosystem is central to the long-term vision. Skye Golann, Policy Manager at the Electrification Coalition, stated that developing a robust American supply chain for critical minerals, such as lithium, will be essential for the future of Georgia’s EV industry. These minerals, which are required for battery production, are still largely processed overseas, particularly in China. However, efforts are underway to mine and process these materials domestically, especially in states like Nevada and North Carolina.

The Role of Federal Incentives in the EV Growth Boom

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in 2022, played a pivotal role in accelerating EV adoption. With provisions for tax credits, subsidies and incentives for EV purchases and related infrastructure, the IRA spurred investment in EV batteries, charging stations and critical minerals. As a result, the industry saw a three-fold increase in investments in key areas such as battery production and refining. In Georgia, federal support helped establish several major EV-related facilities, including a $178 million grant for Solvay Specialty Polymers’ battery-grade polyvinylidene fluoride plant and a $80 million award to Blue Bird for its electric school bus manufacturing plant.

These federal incentives have been crucial in driving both local and national growth in EV adoption. In 2023, a record 1.3 million EVs were sold in the U.S., fueled by incentives such as the $7,500 credit for new EV purchases and the $4,000 or 30% tax break for used EVs. However, with the federal tax credits now on the chopping block, the affordability of EVs may take a hit, particularly as the average transaction price for EVs remains significantly higher than for gas-powered vehicles. According to Cox Automotive, the price gap between EVs and traditional cars currently stands at around $10,000.

The Pricing Challenge and Its Impact on Buyers

As the federal incentives phase out, Georgia’s EV market may face a new set of challenges. The price of electric vehicles remains the biggest barrier to adoption. Despite the growing number of affordable EV options, the higher initial cost of EVs compared to their gasoline counterparts continues to discourage many potential buyers. The average EV price has remained elevated, with the latest data from Cox Automotive showing that EVs still cost $10,000 more than comparable gas-powered vehicles.

The removal of federal incentives could further exacerbate the affordability issue. According to Stephanie Streaty, Director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, these price differences make it harder for many consumers to consider making the switch to an electric vehicle. With tariffs, interest rates and other headwinds, the market may struggle to reach its full potential without the support of these critical incentives.

The Future of Battery Manufacturing and the Domestic Supply Chain

Battery production plays a central role in the success of the electric vehicle industry and Georgia is positioning itself to become a major player in this sector. However, challenges remain in developing a domestic supply chain for the materials required to produce lithium-ion batteries. The U.S. is home to just 1% of the world’s lithium reserves, meaning that the country remains heavily reliant on imports, particularly from China.

General Motors (GM) and Hyundai are already taking steps to build out their operations in the U.S., including in Georgia. GM, for instance, has announced plans to co-manufacture six new EV models with Hyundai, focusing on electric vans for the North American market. Meanwhile, Hyundai has committed to bringing more suppliers to the U.S. to reduce reliance on overseas production.

However, even as manufacturers shift their focus to domestic production, many battery-related projects in Georgia have already been delayed or cancelled. Notably, in January, Freyr Battery, a Norwegian company, called off its planned battery manufacturing plant in Newnan, Georgia. Similarly, Aspen Aerogels suspended construction of a plant in Statesboro, opting instead to expand operations in China. These setbacks underscore the challenges the state faces as it attempts to build a competitive domestic supply chain.

Conclusion: Navigating Challenges and Seizing Opportunities for Sustainable Travel

As federal policies evolve, Georgia’s electric vehicle industry is at a crossroads. While state officials and industry leaders remain optimistic about the sector’s long-term potential, challenges such as the elimination of tax credits and reliance on overseas battery production could slow down progress. However, the state’s continued investments in EV manufacturing, combined with efforts to develop a domestic supply chain for critical minerals and battery components, offer hope for the future.

For U.S. buyers, these policy changes mean that the affordability and accessibility of electric vehicles may take a step backward. The removal of federal tax credits is expected to increase the cost of EVs, making it harder for many consumers to embrace sustainable travel. However, with the rise of rebates, dealer discounts and the eventual growth of domestic manufacturing, the shift towards cleaner, greener transportation is likely to continue—albeit at a more gradual pace.

As Georgia strives to become a leader in the EV revolution, its success will depend on overcoming these obstacles and seizing opportunities for innovation. For now, the road ahead is uncertain, but with continued commitment to sustainability and resilience, Georgia’s electric vehicle industry may still have the potential to drive the future of sustainable travel in the U.S.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Travel-in-the-US.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:04:21.843085

When Democratic legislators on Capitol Hill began crafting the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, they were intent on wielding the federal government’s power to create industrial momentum via investment in areas such as renewable energy, U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper said.

Now, if temporarily, that momentum has been lost.

“The IRA, we knew, was an unprecedented effort to push this country in the direction of renewable energy and long-term sustainability, and it’s to a big part been derailed,” he said.

The Democrat representing Colorado met with food manufacturing and restaurant owners, solar power stakeholders and city officials in Durango on Friday outside Peak Food & Beverage in Bodo Industrial Park.

Hickenlooper, standing under a 114-panel solar array installed by Shaw Solar on Peak Food & Beverage’s roof, championed renewable energy as path to long-term sustainability.

He also wagged his finger at the Trump administration’s and Republican efforts to rollback the IRA’s federal funding for renewable energy programs, warning federal funding freezes and canceled grants will slash millions of jobs and inflate energy prices around the country.

The momentum created by federal investments most often first benefits large urban areas, overlooking rural communities. That’s why the IRA included the Rural Energy for America Program, Hickenlooper said, so that rural America would not be left behind in what he described as a “great transition” from costly coal mining operations to renewable energies such as wind and solar power.

He said in an interview with The Durango Herald withholding federal funding from renewable energy initiatives hurts red states at which two-thirds of IRA renewable energy investments were aimed, and it’s in the self-interest of U.S. House representatives in those states to claw back funding.

“It’s their small businesses in their red states that are at risk,” he said. “And either they’re going to step up to the plate and get it done and reclaim a lot of those investments the federal government was making in their states, or they’re going to turn their backs.”

If representatives choose the latter option and snub their constituents, the voters should replace them, Hickenlooper said.

La Plata Electric Association CEO Chris Hansen said the recent federal policy changes are making solar energy projects 40% more costly than they were just several months ago.

“We are striving every day to deliver affordable electricity, affordable energy for our members, that’s going to get tougher,” he said.

The Trump administration’s tariffs have impacted the costs of all energy sources, not just renewables like solar, wind and batteries, he said. Steel, aluminum, copper and other vital elements of the energy economy are more expensive.

“A recent analysis shows that by the middle of next decade, this policy change and the tariffs that go with it could increase bills by about $280 per year per family,” he said. “Think about that for a moment. Adding about $300 to everybody’s electricity bills.”

That hurts low-income families most, he said.

Stakeholders say federal funding benefited their operations

Tailwind Nutrition CEO and founder Jeff Vierling said REAP funding allowed Tailwind to install a 55 kilowatt solar array on its sports food product manufacturing facility.

The solar array generates more electricity than the facility consumes, pumping more electrical power back into the grid. But that’s just where the benefits start, he said.

Tailwind’s retail partners such as REI require it to meet annual carbon emission reduction targets; its customers value outdoors, recreation and being environmentally conscious, making renewable energy important to its brand; and Tailwind wouldn’t have been able to afford the solar array without funding from REAP.

Tailwind’s energy costs are monumentally down as well, Vierling said. Its electricity bill in June this year was $286 compared with $1,541 in June 2024.

“That’s quite a bit of savings, and that savings that we’re realizing on a monthly basis, we’re putting right back into growing Tailwind, growing jobs here in the community,” he said.

Peak Food & Beverage CEO and co-founder Kris Oyler said his 40%-employee-owned company pays its 275 employees a living wage between $24 an hour to an average of $27 and rents space to small-business tenants. Although the company activated its solar array in March, Oyler expects to save about $8,000 in utility expenses annually.

“That helps our economic viability in the industry,” he said. “The restaurant industry typically has very low margins, so anywhere where we can save, I tell my team, look for nickels and pennies whenever they can.”

Peak Food & Beverage is in a better position to pay its workers a living wage, and keeps its renters’ utility costs down because of federal funding opportunities such as REAP, he said.

Durango Solar Works owner Derek Wadsworth said despite setbacks such as the Trump administration’s federal funding freeze, solar energy continues to trend toward sustainable growth. But federal support “is about to vanish.”

He said renewable energy, particularly solar and battery storage, are “deployable, employable and affordable.”

Durango Solar Works added approximately 2 megawatts, or 5 million kilowatt-hours, to the grid in 2024. When one considers all the contributions by other solar installers, which have continued to become more common over the past two decades, renewable energy’s transition from small scale to large scale becomes clear, he said.

The solar industry provides jobs with living wages directly and indirectly, supporting other businesses in concrete excavation, heat pumps and other electricians, he said.

And, he added, although solar infrastructure isn’t free, its fuel source – sunshine – is.

“We all thrive when energy is cheap,” he said. “Solar and storage are currently offering some of the lowest energy sources in the world. Maybe it isn’t the right solution everywhere, but it certainly works really well here in Colorado.”

Hickenlooper said the federal rolling back of renewable energy support is a “reckless effort to abandon so many of the investments we’ve been making over a long period of time.”

He said he’s hopeful Democrats can still work with moderate Republicans in a bipartisan effort to restore investments into win, solar and other renewable energies. But that requires keeping pressure on elected officials.

“Make no mistake, there has been a tipping point. This great transition is not going to go back, and efforts to slow it are economically costly,” he said.

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast.
Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.
President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office.
More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""

In May, the DOJ filed lawsuits against New York and Vermont, arguing that state laws requiring oil companies to contribute billions of dollars into funds to pay for damage caused by climate change were unconstitutional.

The legal challenge against New York alleges that the state’s “superfund” law is a “transparent monetary-extraction scheme” designed to fund the state’s infrastructure projects with money from out-of-state businesses.

“The Superfund Act is a brazen attempt to grab power from the federal government and force citizens of other States and nations to foot the bill for its infrastructure wish list,” the DOJ wrote in the 29-page complaint.

In both lawsuits, the Justice Department cited a Jan. 20 executive order signed by President Donald Trump declaring a national energy emergency to speed up permitting of energy projects, roll back environmental protections, and withdraw from an international pact to fight climate change. DOJ lawyers allege that the state climate change laws imperil domestic energy production.

New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, signed by then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2019, requires the state to reduce its excess greenhouse gas emissions and authorizes it to seek up to $75 billion in damages from fossil fuel companies. Regulations for the new law have yet to be issued, which prompted a lawsuit from green groups seeking the state to post them.

New York is also facing a lawsuit filed by 22 Republican attorneys general who argue that the law will do little to blunt the impact of climate change while passing on the costs to the state’s consumers in the form of higher energy bills. The outcome of that case is still pending.

NEW YORK BUSINESS GROUPS BACK TRUMP’S GAS PIPELINE EXPANSION

Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said New York has “overstepped its authority in trying to impose crippling financial penalties on the world’s largest energy providers” and said the court must act to prevent further damage to the fossil fuel industry.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of clean energy technologies, a surprising hero may be emerging from an unlikely source: mining waste. These byproducts and leftover materials from extraction processes contain significant quantities of critical minerals essential for renewable energy systems, batteries, and other clean technologies. What was once discarded as an environmental liability is increasingly recognized as a valuable secondary resource that could strengthen domestic supply chains while reducing environmental impact.

Research from the Colorado School of Mines demonstrates remarkable potential: extracting even small percentages of minerals from existing mine waste could replace significant portions of current U.S. imports for clean energy materials, potentially transforming the global mining waste for clean energy supply chain.

What Makes Mining Waste Valuable for Clean Energy?

Mining waste contains abundant quantities of minerals crucial for clean energy applications. When mining companies extract targeted minerals like copper and gold, they typically focus on separating these specific materials while discarding the rest as tailings or waste rock. However, these ""leftovers"" frequently contain substantial concentrations of other valuable minerals.

The strategic value of mining waste lies in its accessibility. These materials have already been excavated, crushed, and partially processed—eliminating the most resource-intensive and environmentally disruptive steps of mining. By developing advanced extraction methods for these pre-processed materials, companies can access critical minerals with significantly lower energy requirements and environmental impacts.

Furthermore, utilizing existing mining waste solutions reduces the need for new land disturbance, minimizes habitat destruction, and presents opportunities to remediate legacy mining sites while extracting valuable materials—effectively turning environmental liabilities into assets.

How Abundant Are Critical Minerals in Mining Waste?

Surprising Mineral Concentrations in Existing Waste

A comprehensive analysis of thousands of ore samples from 54 active U.S. hard rock metal mines revealed remarkable concentrations of critical minerals in mining waste. According to Elizabeth Holley and colleagues at the Colorado School of Mines, extracting just 1% of certain minerals from mining byproducts could replace all current U.S. imports of those materials.

Many critical minerals exist in these waste repositories at concentrations comparable to primary ore deposits. In some cases, waste piles contain higher concentrations of certain minerals than the original targeted metals, presenting a compelling case for reprocessing these materials.

The abundance varies by mine type and mineral. Copper mine tailings frequently contain significant amounts of cobalt and molybdenum, while iron ore waste often holds rare earth elements and vanadium. These concentrations represent vast untapped resources sitting in plain sight.

Statistical Overview of Critical Minerals Recovery Potential

Critical Mineral Recovery Rate Needed to Replace Imports Primary Clean Energy Applications Rare Earth Elements 10-30% Wind turbines, EV motors Lithium 20-40% Batteries, energy storage Cobalt 15-25% Batteries, solar panels Nickel 30-50% Batteries, hydrogen production Copper 10-20% Transmission, solar panels, EVs Graphite 60-90% Batteries, fuel cells

While some minerals would require higher recovery rates to meet domestic demand, the potential remains significant. Even partial recovery could substantially reduce import dependencies and strengthen supply chain resilience for critical clean energy materials.

Why Is Mining Waste Reprocessing Gaining Momentum?

Supply Chain Security Concerns

Recent global disruptions have highlighted the vulnerability of critical mineral supply chains. Western nations face significant dependencies on a small number of countries for essential materials:

China controls approximately 60% of rare earth element processing globally

Over 70% of cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo

Indonesia dominates nickel production with nearly half of global supply

Supply disruptions during recent global crises exposed systemic vulnerabilities

These dependencies create economic and national security risks that mining waste recovery could help mitigate by establishing domestic sources of critical materials. As U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright noted, ""For too long, the United States has relied on foreign actors to supply and process the critical materials that are essential to modern life and our national security.""

Environmental Benefits of Waste Reprocessing

Reprocessing mining waste offers multiple environmental advantages compared to new mining operations:

Reduces the need for new land disturbance and habitat destruction

Decreases water consumption by up to 60% compared to primary mining

Lowers energy requirements by 40-75% for most minerals

Minimizes acid mine drainage and other pollution from existing waste piles

Creates opportunities for site remediation during reprocessing

By extracting additional value from already disturbed sites, mining waste recovery represents a more sustainable mining transformation to meeting mineral demands for clean energy technologies.

What Technologies Enable Mining Waste Recovery?

Innovative Extraction Methods

New technologies are transforming the economics and feasibility of recovering minerals from waste:

Advanced bioleaching uses specialized microorganisms to extract metals from low-grade waste

Electrochemical recovery systems can selectively remove specific metals from solution

Hydrometallurgical processes enable selective extraction without high-temperature processing

Machine learning algorithms optimize recovery rates and reduce chemical usage

Nanotechnology enhances separation efficiency for complex mineral mixtures

These technologies continue to advance, with ongoing research improving selectivity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. As extraction technologies mature, previously uneconomical waste resources become viable sources of critical minerals.

Carbon Capture Integration

Some mining wastes offer an additional benefit beyond mineral recovery—they can sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere:

Magnesium and calcium-rich mining tailings naturally absorb CO₂ through mineral carbonation

Enhanced mineral carbonation techniques accelerate this process

Studies show that some nickel mine tailings can capture more carbon than the mine's operations emit

This dual-purpose approach creates carbon-negative mineral recovery operations

By combining mineral recovery with carbon sequestration technology, mining waste reprocessing could contribute to both the supply of clean energy materials and climate change mitigation efforts.

How Economically Viable Is Mining Waste Recovery?

Cost-Benefit Analysis

The economics of mining waste recovery are increasingly favorable due to several factors:

Rising critical mineral prices improve recovery economics (lithium prices increased 400% from 2020-2023)

Processing costs continue to decline with technological improvements

Environmental compliance costs for waste storage are avoided

Government incentives and funding support development of domestic supply chains

Transportation costs are minimized by using existing mine infrastructure

As demand for critical minerals continues to grow—with projections indicating a tripling of demand by 2030 and quadrupling by 2040 to meet clean energy transition goals—the economic case for mining waste recovery strengthens further.

Case Study: Successful Waste Recovery Projects

Several projects demonstrate the economic viability of mining waste recovery:

Rio Tinto's Kennecott Copper Mine (Utah) – Recovers tellurium, gold, and silver from copper processing waste, generating significant additional annual revenue

Phoenix Tailings (Massachusetts) – Extracts rare earth elements from iron ore tailings using carbon-free processes powered by renewable energy

Jervois Mining's Idaho Cobalt Operations – Reprocessing historic mine waste to recover cobalt for EV batteries while remediating environmental issues

These operations showcase how companies can create new revenue streams while addressing environmental concerns through innovative waste reprocessing.

What Government Initiatives Support Mining Waste Recovery?

U.S. Federal Programs and Funding

The U.S. government has implemented several programs to accelerate mining waste recovery:

Department of Energy committed nearly $1 billion for unconventional mining efforts in 2024

$250 million specifically targeted for recovering minerals from mining byproducts

Critical Minerals Innovation Hub established to develop new extraction technologies

Inflation Reduction Act provides tax incentives for domestic critical mineral production

Defense Production Act authorities activated to support critical mineral supply chains

These initiatives reflect growing recognition of mining waste's strategic importance for domestic supply chain security and clean energy transition.

International Approaches

Other countries are also pursuing mining waste recovery strategies:

European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act includes targets for recovering minerals from waste

Australia's Critical Minerals Strategy prioritizes recovery from existing mines

Canada's Critical Minerals Innovation Fund supports waste reprocessing projects

Chile requires new copper mines to include plans for reprocessing tailings

This global momentum demonstrates broad recognition of mining waste's potential as a resource rather than merely an environmental liability.

What Challenges Must Be Overcome?

Technical Limitations

Despite the potential, significant challenges remain:

Complex mineralogy makes selective extraction difficult

Some critical minerals exist in ultra-low concentrations

Energy requirements for processing fine-grained materials can be substantial

Water management in processing operations requires careful planning

Scaling laboratory successes to commercial operations involves engineering challenges

Ongoing research and development efforts focus on addressing these limitations through improved extraction methods, process optimization, and innovative approaches to mineral separation.

Regulatory and Permitting Hurdles

Regulatory frameworks often impede waste reprocessing:

Mining waste classified as hazardous material in some jurisdictions

Permits for reprocessing can be as complex as new mine permits

Liability concerns for disturbing stabilized waste facilities

Unclear ownership of historic mining wastes

Lack of specific regulatory pathways for waste reprocessing

Streamlining regulatory processes specifically for waste reprocessing projects could accelerate adoption while maintaining necessary environmental safeguards.

How Could Mining Waste Transform the Clean Energy Supply Chain?

Potential Impact on U.S. Mineral Independence

Mining waste recovery could significantly reduce U.S. import dependence:

Potential to supply 25-40% of domestic critical mineral needs by 2030

Could eliminate imports for certain minerals like manganese and vanadium

Would create resilience against supply disruptions and price volatility

Enables faster scaling of domestic clean energy manufacturing

By developing domestic sources of critical minerals from existing waste, the U.S. could reduce geopolitical vulnerabilities while accelerating clean energy deployment.

Long-term Sustainability Benefits

Beyond immediate supply chain benefits, mining waste recovery contributes to long-term sustainability:

Creates circular economy for mineral resources

Reduces lifecycle environmental impacts of clean energy technologies

Transforms environmental liabilities into economic assets

Provides model for global adoption of sustainable mining practices

Supports just transition for traditional mining communities

This approach aligns environmental and economic objectives, demonstrating how resource efficiency can support both sustainability goals and economic development.

What Does the Future Hold for Mining Waste Recovery?

Emerging Research Directions

Research continues to improve mining waste recovery potential:

Developing mineral-specific extraction techniques

Creating modular, mobile processing units for remote sites

Integrating artificial intelligence for data-driven mining operations

Exploring zero-waste recovery systems

Investigating biological remediation combined with mineral recovery

These research efforts promise to expand the range of recoverable minerals and improve the economics of waste reprocessing.

Industry Transformation Potential

The mining industry itself may be transformed by waste recovery:

Shift from single-mineral to multi-mineral extraction business models

Integration of waste recovery into initial mine planning

Development of specialized waste recovery companies

Creation of mineral recovery parks where multiple companies process different elements

New revenue streams from carbon credits for CO₂ sequestration

This transformation could reshape mining economics and practices, creating a more sustainable and efficient industry aligned with clean energy transition goals.

How Can Mining Waste Recovery Be Accelerated?

Policy Recommendations

Several policy changes could accelerate mining waste recovery:

Create streamlined permitting pathways specifically for waste reprocessing

Establish tax incentives for critical minerals recovered from waste

These policies would address key barriers to widespread adoption while supporting industry development.

Investment Opportunities

The sector presents various investment opportunities:

Technology companies developing specialized extraction processes

Mining companies diversifying into waste recovery

Environmental remediation firms expanding into mineral recovery

Infrastructure development for processing facilities

Specialized equipment manufacturing for waste processing

As Brian McNulty at the University of British Columbia notes, the ""opportunity is vast"" and could ""energize people in government as well as industry to take a closer look at what we're mining.""

FAQs About Mining Waste and Clean Energy Supply Chains

What are the most valuable minerals found in mining waste?

Mining waste contains numerous valuable minerals for clean energy applications, with the most economically significant being copper, nickel, cobalt, lithium, rare earth elements, manganese, and vanadium. The specific concentration varies by mine type, with copper mine tailings often containing significant cobalt and molybdenum, while iron ore waste frequently contains rare earth elements and vanadium.

How does mining waste recovery compare to recycling electronics?

Both mining waste recovery and electronics recycling contribute to circular material flows, but they address different parts of the supply chain. Mining waste recovery accesses minerals that were previously uneconomical to extract during original mining operations, while electronics recycling recovers minerals from end-of-life products. Mining waste typically contains lower concentrations of minerals but exists in much larger volumes, making it complementary to electronics recycling efforts.

Could mining waste recovery eliminate the need for new mines?

While mining waste recovery can significantly reduce the need for new mines, it cannot completely eliminate it. Current waste streams contain substantial amounts of critical minerals, but growing demand for clean energy technologies will likely require some new primary production. However, waste recovery can reduce the environmental footprint of mineral production and extend the timeline for developing new mines.

What role can mining waste play in carbon sequestration?

Certain types of mining waste, particularly those rich in magnesium and calcium silicates, naturally absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through a process called mineral carbonation. This process can be accelerated through various technologies, potentially allowing mine sites to become carbon sinks rather than sources. When combined with mineral recovery operations, this creates a dual benefit of supplying critical minerals while reducing atmospheric CO₂.

How does the energy required for waste processing compare to new mining?

Processing mining waste typically requires 40-75% less energy than extracting the same minerals from virgin ore. This efficiency comes from the waste already being crushed and partially processed, eliminating the most energy-intensive steps of mining. Additionally, waste processing facilities can more easily be powered by renewable energy due to their smaller scale and flexibility in location.

Transforming Liabilities into Strategic Assets

Mining waste represents a significant opportunity to strengthen clean energy supply chains while addressing environmental challenges. By developing and deploying advanced recovery technologies, the United States and other countries can reduce their dependence on imported critical minerals, minimize the environmental impact of resource extraction, and accelerate the transition to clean energy.

The transformation of mining waste from environmental liability to strategic asset demonstrates how innovative approaches can simultaneously address economic, environmental, and security challenges. With continued investment in research, supportive policy frameworks, and commercial-scale demonstration projects, mine reclamation innovation could become a cornerstone of sustainable critical mineral supply chains for the clean energy transition.

As demand for critical minerals continues to grow—with battery metals alone contributing 85% of total demand growth over the past two years—mining waste recovery offers a pragmatic path forward that balances supply security with environmental stewardship.

The federal Department of Energy has again extended the operational life of units 3 and 4 of the Eddystone Generating Station.

The order runs through Nov. 26. The previous extension expired on Aug. 28. The plant was due to be retired by Constellation Energy in May.

The units can produce a combined 760 megawatts.

Ensuring these units remain operational minimizes the risk of generation shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages, the government said.

“With unprecedented energy demand and resource retirements outpacing new generation additions, the country is facing an energy emergency. Today’s order proves that the Trump administration is dedicated to confronting this critical issue,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “This administration considers power outages and soaring energy costs to be unacceptable.”

As outlined in DOE’s Grid Reliability Evaluation, power outages could increase by 100 times in 2030 if the U.S. continues to take reliable power offline, the DOE said.

According to the administration, in a December 2024 filing at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, PJM Interconnect stated that its preliminary analysis shows “substantial increases” in load additions and that “its resource adequacy concerns are increasing at an extraordinary pace.”

There are some who don’t see the need for the plant remain open, according to Canary Media, which states that it is “Clean energy journalism for a cooler tomorrow.”

“Advocates fear that these directives, taken together with recent executive orders and other DOE moves, signal the Trump administration’s commitment to keeping every fossil-fuel plant running, no matter the consequences.

“In total, just over 38 gigawatts’ worth of power plants are slated to close between now and the end of 2028, more than two-thirds of which is coal.

“Blocking all planned closures of fossil-fueled power plants would be disastrous for efforts to decarbonize the U.S. power grid — and also for consumers, who are already navigating fast-rising power bills. It could cost utility customers billions of dollars each year to prop up this unnecessary infrastructure, according to an August report from research firm Grid Strategies.”",https://www.delcotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25153685755115-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-08-31 13:02:46.105369

Jorge Piñón, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Institute, said that solving Cuba’s energy crisis would take between three and five years and up to $8 billion in investment.
This is an issue seen across many of Cuba’s power plants, including the Lidio Ramón Pérez and Máximo Gómez thermal plants.
From January to May this year, Cuba’s power plants combined were running at an overall average daily capacity of around 34 percent.
The government has long talked about diversifying Cuba’s energy mix, with significant potential to develop its solar, wind, and sugarcane biomass resources.","Cuba has been experiencing an energy crisis that has led residents to experience almost daily blackouts and gas cuts. Years of underinvestment in Cuba’s transmission network and power plants have led them to run below capacity, with the country’s energy supply falling far below its demand.

In addition to localised power outages, in the last eight months, Cuba has experienced four nationwide blackouts. In May, Cuba’s electricity demand rose to 3.05 GW, compared to 2.58 GW in March, as the supply stood at around 1.9 GW. This means that on average, the government can meet between 50 to 70 percent of Cuba’s energy needs.

The regular blackouts have led people across the country to invest in charcoal stoves, rechargeable batteries and fans, as well as other vital products to use during outages when confronted with soaring temperatures, which many can barely afford.

In March, when Cuba’s national electrical grid collapsed, most of the island’s population of 10 million was left without power, including those in the capital of Havana. Popular tourist hotels had to rely on generators, while many had no access to power at all. The regular blackouts prompted anti-government demonstrations in 2021, 2022, and 2024, and the problem persists.

Jorge Piñón, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Institute, said that solving Cuba’s energy crisis would take between three and five years and up to $8 billion in investment.

The crisis comes from years of underinvestment and mismanagement of Cuba’s energy infrastructure, which has placed a significant burden on the country’s existing electricity grid, with little public funds to invest in improvements or in the development of renewable energy projects. Cuba’s National Electric System was developed after 1959 and has been poorly maintained and updated since, due to years of political and economic instability. This has led to issues that can normally be easily fixed, such as transmission line failures, causing widespread outages.

In 2024, the Antonio Guiteras oil-fired power plant ground to a halt, and instead of backup systems coming online to provide power, the outdated systems were unable to detect the system faults, which spurred a nationwide blackout.

In addition to years of underinvestment and a lack of maintenance, Cuba has long relied on substandard fuel, which has strained the system. The Caribbean country depends heavily on domestic, poor-quality heavy crude oil, which is corrosive because of its high sulphur content, adding to the rapid ageing of the country’s power plants.

Cuba’s thermal power plants, powered by crude oil or fuel oil, have become increasingly less reliable in recent years and now run below capacity due to issues like fuel shortages and corrosion. It was not only last year that the 330 MW Antonio Guiteras plant broke down, as the facility has long been difficult to keep running due to the inability of the operator to acquire the parts needed to repair it. This is an issue seen across many of Cuba’s power plants, including the Lidio Ramón Pérez and Máximo Gómez thermal plants. From January to May this year, Cuba’s power plants combined were running at an overall average daily capacity of around 34 percent.

Cuba imports fuel, but its trade links are far from stable. It has relied on neighbouring Venezuela for oil for years, but heavy sanctions on Venezuelan energy in recent years by the United States have led to underinvestment in the South American country’s crude supply, resulting in unstable export volumes.

In recent months, Mexico has sent higher levels of crude to Cuba, with state-owned Pemex shipping an all-time high of 39 shipments of crude and refined products to Havana at a value of over $850 million between May 29 and June 27. This value is similar to that of the total amount of oil shipped from Mexico to Cuba over the previous two years, at around $1 billion.

China has increased support for Cuba in recent years to help alleviate the burden on the government to fix the ongoing energy crisis. China is developing 92 solar parks that could provide over 2 GW of clean electricity, over half of which is expected to be operational by the beginning of 2026. This supports the Cuban government’s goal of achieving an energy mix of 24 percent renewables by 2030. China is also helping the Caribbean Island to modernise its grid by introducing photovoltaic technology, to eventually reduce Cuba’s heavy reliance on fossil fuels.

The government has long talked about diversifying Cuba’s energy mix, with significant potential to develop its solar, wind, and sugarcane biomass resources. However, a lack of investment, inadequate policies and complex bureaucracy have led to severe delays in development in the past. Now, without modernisation, the grid is not stable enough to add new large-scale renewable energy connections. Therefore, foreign investment in improvements to Cuba’s transmission infrastructure and renewable energy sector could finally support a transformation in the coming years.

Public, media and expert amnesia about nuclear power’s ineffectiveness is a driving factor in its resurgence

By Michael Turton / Contributing Reporter

In the run-up to the referendum on re-opening Pingtung County’s Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant last month, the media inundated us with explainers. A favorite factoid of the international media, endlessly recycled, was that Taiwan has no energy reserves for a blockade, thus necessitating re-opening the nuclear plants. As presented by the Chinese-language CommonWealth Magazine, it runs: “According to the US Department of Commerce International Trade Administration, 97.73 percent of Taiwan’s energy is imported, and estimates are that Taiwan has only 11 days of reserves available in the event of a blockade.”

This factoid is not an outright lie — that would be too easy to spot. Instead it is an abuse of reason. Industrial use accounts for over half of Taiwan’s electricity demand. Most of that, along with a considerable chunk of Taiwan’s commercial demand, would collapse in the event of a blockade. What is left of residential demand (less than 20 percent of demand on a good day) and a handful of shops and factories could run for months on coal and renewables, as Ko Yun-ling (柯昀伶) and Chao Chia-wei (趙家緯) pointed out in a piece at Taiwan Insight earlier this year.

This construct thus presented to readers a simple morality play: Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) policy bad! Nukes good! Energy security! Many writers reinforced this by connecting the nuke plant shut-downs to DPP policy and not to the fact that spent fuel pools were full and the plants had reached their planned lifetimes.

Writing on the referendum, the well-known site Domino Theory cited Chao, research director at the Taiwan Climate Action Network, who argued a blackout in 2017 “increased support for nuclear power by fostering anxiety about Taiwan’s energy supply.” The blackout occurred “even though all three nuclear plants were operational at the time.”

NUCLEAR UNRELIABLE

Years have passed since the closure of the plants in the north, and the public has forgotten how nuclear power actually functioned. Chao’s comment shows how public forgetting, even expert forgetting, is an important factor in the resurgence in local support for nuclear power. In fact, the unreliability of the nuclear plants caused the blackout. The reason the electricity system was operating at its margin was that reactors were offline. A reactor at the Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant had been offline for three years at that point.

As the redoubtable Timothy Ferry observed in the News Lens in October of that year: “This past June 10, following the closure of the Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant and prior to the restart of Kuosheng [Nuclear Power Plant] reactor-1, nuclear power fell to as low as 3 percent of Taiwan’s power generation when maintenance problems at the Ma-anshan plant took one of its reactors offline for weeks.”

A 2016 piece by Ferry predicted thin power reserves in the coming summers because reactors were out of service.

“Data provided by the Atomic Energy Council shows that since 2002, the nation’s three nuclear power plants have experienced a total of 29 trigger events,” the Taipei Times editorialized in August of 2017.

“In contrast to the international concerns about Taiwan’s energy security,” the Financial Times described, speaking of the current referendum, “the domestic debate has centered on air pollution and economic growth.”

Hardly surprising, given the fearmongering about electricity, a staple of Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) propaganda since the early 2000s. The educational system is a weeding out system, and it instills in people a visceral fear of being weeded out of the international economy, a fear reinforced by the nation’s lack of international recognition. Contextualizing nuclear power as an economic growth driver appeals to that fear.

“Taiwanese have long heard that nuclear power is the cure-all to the nation’s energy problems,” the 2017 editorial cited above pointed out. The recent referendum was driven by that magical thinking.

Proponents leveraged fear by pointing out how Taiwan needs power to drive the AI boom, with the unspoken corollary that Taiwan would be weeded out if there was no AI boom. Never mind that it will be years before any nuclear power plant can be up and running again, yet the AI need is already materializing. The obvious move is to ramp up renewables, which now supply around 13 percent of Taiwan’s power. But instead, the Taiwan People’s Party referendum, which was supported by the KMT, has the nation talking about nuclear power. That diversion is its entire purpose.

Moreover, the “pollution” claims about nuclear power conceal how “emissions-free” nuclear power is used to maintain Taiwan’s inefficient, heavily-subsidized, high carbon economy, as I have written before. For example, in 2008, during the debates over the now-dead Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, a Taiwan News editorial observed that “environmentalists estimate that over 83 percent of the alleged annual carbon dioxide reduction of 18 million tons claimed for Nuclear Four could be realized simply by vetoing plans by the Formosa Plastics Group to build a steel refinery on the Yunlin coast”.

LOSS OF REWARDS

Etta Lee (李若慈), a masters student at National Taiwan University (NTU), last year did fieldwork in Hengchun Township (恆春) in Pingtung County that explored local support for the nearby nuclear power plant. On Facebook she observed: “When central and local policy debates focus on technology and safety, for most residents it is less about supporting extension or restarting than about worrying about the economic consequences of the suspension of nuclear plants — such as reduced jobs, cancellation of rewards or loss of local infrastructure resources that politicians fear.”

Locals, she notes (especially in the Kenting peninsula where there is little industry and tourism is in dire straits), are responding pragmatically to the risks and uncertainties of their economic existence “in a highly dependent and non-choice structure, rather than a positive identification of nuclear energy itself.” Fear is a powerful motivator.

The Hengchun peninsula has a large population of indigenous community. That too is an old pattern with nuclear power. Everyone is familiar with how the indigenous people on Taitung County’s Orchid Island (Lanyu, 蘭嶼) were tricked into accepting low-level nuclear waste. In 2012, then-Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator (now Vice President) Hsaio Bi-khim (蕭美琴) was alerted by locals to drilling in Hualien County’s Sioulin Township (秀林). Hsiao discovered that Taipower was looking for potential sites for geological disposal of Taiwan’s high level nuclear waste. Taipower had not bothered to seek permission or even to inform the locals of the drilling program. The township’s residents are largely indigenous.

Etta Lee also collected local stories about similar trickery in the development of the Ma-ashan plant. The locals were told that the site was ideal for an international port, one that would have spanned the entire end of the peninsula. Plans for the port were even posted on local bulletin boards. Then one day it suddenly became a nuclear power plant, and the international port was given to Taichung.

WHY MA-ANSHAN?

Why was the referendum about Ma-anshan? Because it is about as far from Taipei as one can get and still be in Taiwan. There was no reason restarting the northern nuclear power plants could not have been included. Distance from the colonial core was an important part of the appeal of the referendum, an appeal echoed in the proposals following its failure to store nuclear waste on the islands off of China.

Moreover, had the northern reactors been included, attention would have been drawn to the KMT’s role in ensuring their closure, and to local residents’ objections to the nuclear power plants and nuclear waste storage. Finally, as I noted a few months ago, there was little threat a successful referendum could actually result in re-opening the plant. Years will pass before a site for storing spent fuel is identified, storage constructed, the fuel removed, safety evaluations conducted and the plant re-started.

David Reid in 2011 wrote for this paper on the Fourth Nuclear Plant in New Taipei City’s Gongliao District (貢寮), noting that hundreds of billions of New Taiwan dollars had been spent on the plant with no electricity generation in sight. The plant was mothballed in 2015.

“What if that same amount of money had been invested in renewable energy projects beginning from 1997?” he asked. “These projects would have begun to generate power in a much shorter time frame,” he answered, while also driving development of a local renewable energy industry.

Nuclear power not only crowds out spending on renewables, it crowds out discussion and development of them.

For the KMT the referendum was a success. Foreign commentators dutifully forwarded its construction of Taiwan’s energy policy and its criticisms of the DPP, masked as “reporting.” Observers were quick to point out that it might make DPP President William Lai (賴清德) soften his stance on nuclear power, as if he hadn’t been indicating that since the fall of 2023 when he was a presidential candidate. The referendum was overwhelmingly supported but failed to pass, committing the KMT to nothing.

At least, until the next KMT-inspired performative referendum on nuclear power.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/09/01/p12-250901-002.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 13:02:49.792189

In short, dismantling ZEV policies doesn’t just affect consumers; it reshapes the supply-demand balance in carbon markets.","With the federal carbon tax now repealed, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has turned his attention to another flagship Liberal climate policy: the Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate. The mandate requires automakers to steadily increase the share of electric vehicles in their sales—20% by 2026, climbing to 100% by 2035.

Poilievre has stated that scrapping the policy will be a priority for the Conservative Party this fall, framing it as a matter of affordability and consumer choice. This move is not surprising. ZEV mandates are highly visible, consumer-facing policies, and that makes them politically vulnerable.

A Familiar Political Playbook

This is another major Liberal climate policy the Conservatives have targeted, following the federal fuel charge, which Mark Carney repealed following the election. Both were framed not specifically as environmental measures, but as affordability issues. While abstract carbon pricing mechanisms or industrial regulations can feel distant, gas prices and the availability of affordable vehicles impact voters more directly, making this framing more tangible and effective.

The ZEV mandate is also under pressure from other directions. Canada’s auto sector faces headwinds from global tariffs and federal EV rebates expired earlier this year. Without incentives, EV adoption and supply in Canada may slow, making it more challenging to meet targets and mandates. Automakers, meanwhile, are lobbying for looser rules or delayed targets, given challenges to the sector from trade tensions with the U.S.

ZEV Mandates in the U.S.

ZEVs are also subject to a political tug-of-war south of the border. From the outset of his second term, President Trump pledged to eliminate California’s ZEV mandates, and within months, congressional actions and the “One Big Beautiful Bill” effectively repealed key state authorities and ended federal EV tax credits of up to USD 7,500, which will expire on 30 September. The result has been a slowdown in EV sales and new legal battles, with California working to override the gap through state rebates, mandates, and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS).

Why ZEV Mandates Matter for Carbon Markets

While ZEV mandates are also framed as consumer or affordability issues, they also impact carbon markets, given that transportation is a major source of emissions. If ZEV adoption slows, the sector’s emissions will remain higher for longer. That, in turn, may increase demand for compliance credits in regulated carbon markets.

In California, weaker EV adoption could mean upward pressure on California Carbon Allowance (CCA) prices and on credits under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), given slower emissions reductions compared to the target. In Canada, a rollback of the ZEV mandate could similarly tighten compliance markets by making it harder to meet overall reduction goals. In short, dismantling ZEV policies doesn’t just affect consumers; it reshapes the supply-demand balance in carbon markets.",https://www.clearbluemarkets.com/hubfs/Blog%20images/Blog%20images-Oct-18-2024-02-11-54-2389-PM.png,N,,2025-08-31 13:02:17.735831

Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.

And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.

Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.

Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.

“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”

States scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.

But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.

“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”

Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.

State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.

For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.

But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.

“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.

Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.

Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.

“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”

Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.

State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.

Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.

“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.

Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.

O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.

Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.

Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.

Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.

In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.

O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”

New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.

Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.

“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Now Badenoch has said that requirements to work towards net zero are a burden on oil and gas producers in the North Sea which are damaging the economy and which she would remove.
Badenoch said it was ""absurd"" the UK was leaving ""vital resources untapped"" while ""neighbours like Norway extracted them from the same sea bed"".
Her plan echoes US President Donald Trump's pledge to ""drill, baby, drill"" and embark on new oil and gas exploration.
In 2023, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak granted 100 new licences to drill in the North Sea which he said at the time was ""entirely consistent"" with net zero commitments.","Kemi Badenoch has said her party will remove all net zero requirements on oil and gas companies drilling in the North Sea if elected.

The Conservative leader is to formally announce the plan to focus solely on ""maximising extraction"" to get ""all our oil and gas out of the North Sea"" in a speech in Aberdeen on Tuesday,

She will claim that net zero measures mean households end up ""paying the price through higher energy bills"".

The Labour government has committed to banning new exploration licences. A spokesperson said: ""We'll take no lectures from Kemi Badenoch. Every family and business paid the price of the Conservatives' failure to secure the UK's energy.""

Exploring new fields would ""not take a penny off bills"" or improve energy security and would ""only accelerate the worsening climate crisis"", a government spokesperson warned.

Badenoch signalled a significant change in Conservative climate policy when she announced earlier this year that reaching net zero would be ""impossible"" by 2050.

Successive UK governments have pledged to reach the target by 2050 and it was written into law by Theresa May in 2019. It means the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Now Badenoch has said that requirements to work towards net zero are a burden on oil and gas producers in the North Sea which are damaging the economy and which she would remove.

The Tory leader said a Conservative government would scrap the need to reduce emissions or to work on technologies such as carbon storage.

Badenoch said it was ""absurd"" the UK was leaving ""vital resources untapped"" while ""neighbours like Norway extracted them from the same sea bed"".

Her plan echoes US President Donald Trump's pledge to ""drill, baby, drill"" and embark on new oil and gas exploration. It is a reversal of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which channelled billions of dollars into clean energy.

In 2023, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak granted 100 new licences to drill in the North Sea which he said at the time was ""entirely consistent"" with net zero commitments.

Since then, major energy companies such as BP have U-turned on the level of investment in renewables to focus on increasing oil and gas production in order to boost profitability.

Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, a research and campaign group, said Badenoch's plan was ""reckless"" and would not ""bring down energy bills"".

""These rules are the bare minimum to needed hold the industry to account, and removing them will simply mean more emissions, more environmental harm and more handouts to oil and gas giants at the nation's expense,"" she said.

Reform UK has said it will abolish the push for net zero if elected.

But Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron said scrapping requirements to reduce emissions ""is nothing short of irresponsible environmental vandalism"".

He said the UK ""should be setting our sights on leading the world in clean energy, in off shore wind, instead of falling back to a dependency on fossil fuels"".

Research shows that 2024 was the first calendar year where the average temperature exceeded 1.5°C.

This made it the hottest year since records began in 1850, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is managed by the European Commission and uses data from the European Union's space programme.

The UK was one of 200 countries to sign the Paris Agreement who agreed to ""pursue efforts"" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C and keep them ""well below"" 2.0C above those recorded in pre-industrial times.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/468a/live/43964620-85fc-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:05:05.225120

In Missouri and Illinois, five coal plants have been exempted, and in Pennsylvania, all 12 of the coal plants seeking approval have been approved.
Then in July, Trump exempted chemical companies for two years from Biden’s 2024 HON Rule, a set of regulations that control hazardous air emissions from chemical plants called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.
But owners of the chemical plants should not act so surprised, said Neil Carman, a former regulator for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
Carman pointed out that the heads of chemical companies have been in talks with Trump’s EPA since the election.","This story was originally published by Capital & Main.

For Donna Thomas, smokestacks are a typical sight from her home in Fort Bend County, Texas. Since she was a child, she has seen the coal and natural gas-powered W.A. Parish Generating Station puff clouds of haze during the day and light up brightly at night. The facility — which has been around since 1958 — is both part of the background and all she thinks about.

Thomas is not alone. For decades, residents have expressed concerns over the pollution emitted from the Parish coal plant — a separate facility from the natural gas plant — and called for its closure. The plant, located about 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston, is ranked by Texas environmental regulators as one of the worst polluters in the state for certain hazardous emissions. These include mercury, a toxic heavy metal particularly harmful for children and pregnant people.

This year, mercury has been top of mind for environmental activists and residents like Thomas. In April, President Donald Trump announced an exemption for companies from implementing stricter Biden-era mercury regulations for two years. Of the 163 eligible coal plants, 11 are in Texas and six have been approved, including Parish’s operator, NRG Energy. In Missouri and Illinois, five coal plants have been exempted, and in Pennsylvania, all 12 of the coal plants seeking approval have been approved.

Then in July, Trump exempted chemical companies for two years from Biden’s 2024 HON Rule, a set of regulations that control hazardous air emissions from chemical plants called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The Trump administration determined the exemptions are in the country’s best interest and represent a burden on industry, and that the technology is not available to meet stricter regulations. Companies like NRG agree.

However, critics say the Biden administration’s 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards — called MATS for short — and the HON Rule were long overdue and the two-year delay in implementing them is merely a tactic to protect industry profit margins at the expense of public health.

Moreover, critics point out that the MATS delay may be giving companies the freedom to ignore toxic air emissions rules until the Trump administration repeals the Biden-era regulations altogether. In June, the Environmental Protection Agency under Trump proposed a rule to eliminate the 2024 MATS rule completely.

The two rules together have set off alarm bells for experts and environmentalists in Texas, home to one of the world’s largest petrochemical sectors and 11 coal-powered plants. The exemptions will run from 2027 — when the Biden rules were supposed to take effect — to 2029.

“We know these rollbacks are not good for anyone, especially for those that are community fenceline,” said Thomas, also the founder and president of the Fort Bend Environmental — a grassroots organization focused on environmental justice. “We have around 1,000 homes within 3 miles of Parish, so that’s going to affect all of them.”

A two-year delay

The EPA has been working on stricter environmental regulations for chemical plants since the early 1990s. Only in 2020 did Biden’s EPA begin drafting new rules in earnest.

But owners of the chemical plants should not act so surprised, said Neil Carman, a former regulator for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

“The chemical industry has known for decades that this was all coming, but they don’t like rules, because it means they have to put on more pollution control and they have to do more leak inspections,” said Carman, now the clean air director for the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club. “These plants will always tell you, ‘Safety first, safety first,’ but then you run into this thing called money.”

Of the 79 chemical facilities in Texas requesting exemptions, 15 have been approved, including 13 along the Gulf Coast and the so-called petrochemical corridor.

Carman pointed out that the heads of chemical companies have been in talks with Trump’s EPA since the election. In March, the administration announced that companies could apply for exemption from MATS, HON, and seven other sets of emissions standards.

That same month, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin met with Dow Inc. Chairman-CEO Jim Fitterling to discuss regulations imposed by the Biden administration, according to public records and emails obtained by the Sierra Club.

In one email sent on March 17, Dow reps asked to discuss “clarity” on the EPA’s recent announcement that it will reconsider the HON rule and “Dow has met with the Office of Air and Radiation regarding an extension of the current compliance deadline, which is impossible to meet.”

In May, Zeldin met with Fitterling and other chemical company CEOs to discuss the industry at large. Then in July, Trump announced the exemptions for HON, including for two chemical plants in Louisiana and one in Seadrift, Texas, operated by Dow and its subsidiary Union Carbide.

In a statement to Capital & Main, a Dow spokesperson said that “safety and integrity are at the core of both companies’ operations” and the “extensions are appropriate and necessary to address the technical challenges and to ensure the continued safe and efficient operation of these facilities.”

Carman doesn’t buy it. He worked as an environmental regulator in Texas for 12 years. Even then, he said, companies never seemed to be able to find the budget to limit their emissions and chemical leaks. For him, it’s still the cost.

“A lot of these are old plants and so when they go in and do all this work,” Carman said, “they have to find a place where they’re going to put in new controls and they have to engineer it. They have to design it all. It’s months of planning, but these rules were out there. They knew they were coming. They just want two more years of delay.”

Limiting mercury

When the EPA implemented the 2012 MATS rule, mercury emissions dropped 86 percent — or 4 tons — in five years.

In 2024, Biden’s EPA approved a rule to strengthen MATS by tightening the emissions standards for mercury by another 70 percent and reducing pollutants discharged through wastewater from coal-fired plants by more than 660 million pounds per year.

The rule could prevent as many as 11,000 premature deaths, 2,800 cases of chronic bronchitis, and 130,000 asthma attacks, according to the EPA under Biden.

However, in April, Trump approved the exemptions for 47 coal-powered plants across the nation. As of mid-August, 70 are now exempted, including Parish.

“These rules were just so critically important to people’s health,” said Surbhi Sarang, senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund. The Trump administration “was doing this process that was just not transparent. I mean, there was no process. Whereas in rulemaking, there’s public comment. This is just like a presidential action that was kind of taken in a vacuum and then announced.”

In response to the exemption, Erik Linden, senior director of communications at NRG, said the time is needed and will be used to evaluate the technology for air quality systems and monitoring equipment for compliance.

“All existing MATS emission controls will be properly maintained and remain in service,” Linden said of the current MATS rules that began in 2012. The exemption would give NRG until 2029 to implement the changes.

However, in July, Trump’s EPA proposed eliminating Biden’s rule entirely by the end of the year. Interested parties had three weeks to submit comments, and the Environmental Defense Fund’s request for an extension was denied.

“Rulemaking usually takes 12-18 months if not longer,” Sarang said. “They’re moving very quickly.”

All of this is alarming for residents living near industry. With the extent of the changes to environmental regulations coming down from the Trump administration, there’s a lot for Thomas, the Parish generating station neighbor, to process. But she hasn’t given up. Increasingly, Thomas is talking to her neighbors and fellow residents about fighting back.

This means sending letters to representatives in Texas and in Washington, D.C. Thomas said it pays to be loud.

Parish is “going to do the same thing it’s been doing,” Thomas said. “If the EPA does not put a stop to these [emissions] getting out, then everyone is going to pay for this with their lives and in their water and in their air.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/coal-creek-station.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-08-31 12:05:02.840153

Patterson, Nora Doyle-Burr, Sruthi Gopalakrishnan Concord Monitor, Geoff Hansen Managing Editor",,,,,https://vnews.com/2025/08/31/solar-funding-clawback-new-hampshire/,"Solar advocates in New Hampshire — backed by the congressional delegation — are denouncing a Trump White House decision to claw back $48.5 million already promised to the state to fund solar energy projects for low-income residents.
What was called the Solar for All program aimed to expand access to onsite solar power systems and community solar arrays, specifically targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities across the state.
High energy costs hit low-income households the hardest, according to Weeks.
Similarly, New Hampshire Housing planned to use this funding to install community solar on workforce housing projects.
The state Department of Energy, as the lead applicant, planned to expand community energy programs across the state for communities not covered by its partners.","Solar advocates in New Hampshire — backed by the congressional delegation — are denouncing a Trump White House decision to claw back $48.5 million already promised to the state to fund solar energy projects for low-income residents.

What was called the Solar for All program aimed to expand access to onsite solar power systems and community solar arrays, specifically targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities across the state.

“The effect of the decision to revoke NH’s Solar For All grant will simply be that the affordable housing in New Hampshire is less affordable,” said Sam Evans-Brown, executive director of Clean Energy NH. “These grant dollars were going to be used to provide significant savings to people at a time when electric bills are skyrocketing.”

Phil Coupe, co-founder of ReVision Energy, the state’s largest solar installer, said President Donald Trump’s administration energy policy is “explicitly designed to harm the renewable energy industry while propping up a declining fossil fuel industry.”

ReVision has been responsible for several publicly funded installations in the state, including arrays for the towns of Exeter, N.H., and Jaffrey, N.H., in Kingston, N.H., for energy-provider Unitil Corp., and other commercial enterprises, such as Blasty Bough Brewing Co. in Epsom, N.H.

The state of New Hampshire even touted the Solar for All program, exclaiming on a website page as recently as June the benefits it would bring to low-income households. That page on the New Hampshire Department of Energy website has since disappeared with a “Page Not Found” notation.

As of this writing, the Solar for All page remains posted on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website.

Noting an award amount of $43,510,000 for New Hampshire, the EPA described the project as follows: “The New Hampshire Department of Energy (NHDOE), The New Hampshire Community Loan Fund, and New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority have jointly designed a comprehensive and complementary approach to bring the benefits of residential-serving community solar to those least able to afford this new technology.“

The Solar for All program was wrapped into the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, initiated by Democrats in Congress and ultimately signed by then-President Joe Biden, also a Democrat.

The current Republican majority in Congress, at the behest of Trump, eliminated the funds as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), even as states such as New Hampshire were gearing up for installations for qualified homeowners.

In a social media post on X (formerly known as Twitter), EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said: “In some cases, your tax dollars were diluted through up to FOUR pass-through entities, each taking their own cut off the top! The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

Dan Weeks, ReVision’s vice president of business development, called the move a disappointing “11th-hour clawback.”

“It is the latest in a series of attacks from Washington on the cheapest, most abundant energy resources we have, which will only serve to raise energy costs for all Americans while putting countless electricians and other energy professionals out of work,” Weeks said.

High energy costs hit low-income households the hardest, according to Weeks.

“Although more and more homes and businesses are investing in solar to lower their energy costs, low-income folks and renters have been generally locked out because of the upfront cost and state opposition to shared community solar,” Weeks said.

“The federal Solar for All program was starting to change that, with $43 million in funding for New Hampshire already approved by Congress and awarded to the state to provide thousands of low-income families access to rooftop and community solar,” he added.

Evans-Brown questioned the legality of clawing back previously-approved funds.

“The congressional record established during the debates over the OBBBA clearly shows that Congress did not intend for that bill to retroactively claw back funds that had already been obligated,” he said. “This means that instead of going towards a program that would have enhanced energy independence and affordability, your tax dollars will now go towards expensive and unnecessary legal battles.”

Several states and organizations have indicated they are going to challenge the clawback in court.

In a joint statement, the state’s two U.S. representatives and two U.S. senators — all Democrats — said: “This unlawful action would directly contradict our shared goal of lowering costs for American households.”

According to the statement from U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas (1st CD), U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander (2nd CD), U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, and U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, several organizations within the Granite State were poised to deploy the money in various energy-saving projects.

They said the Community Loan Fund planned to use this funding to support energy projects for up to 20 resident-owned manufactured home communities. Similarly, New Hampshire Housing planned to use this funding to install community solar on workforce housing projects. The state Department of Energy, as the lead applicant, planned to expand community energy programs across the state for communities not covered by its partners.

Their comments were contained in a letter to EPA chief Zeldin.

“These projects were designed to reduce costs for low-income households and would reduce utility bills for those households by 20 percent or more,” the delegation said. “These organizations are already preparing to put this money to work and are incurring costs to do so. By rescinding these grants, the Administration would force costs onto nonprofits and deny low income households much-needed relief from increasing energy costs.”

Weeks said ReVision remains “committed to expanding solar access however we can. We wish the federal government would make good on its promises to help scale this vital work for citizens in need.”

In his blog post statement, ReVision’s Coupe said most Americans remain committed to clean energy alternatives.

“Innovations in solar panel manufacturing, cutting-edge battery storage technologies, electric transportation, and heat pump efficiency are continuing domestically and abroad, illuminating the fact that the clean energy genie is out of the bottle and even magical thinking and extreme political acts by the fossil fuel-funded Trump administration are incapable of putting it back in,” said Coupe.

Zeldin recently toured the state as part of his advocacy for the Constitution Pipeline project, which would link natural gas supplies in Pennsylvania to Northeast markets. It was first proposed in 2012 but canceled in 2020 because of opposition and permitting obstacles in New York and elsewhere.

“I hope that New York and other states will take a look at it again, because all of us are facing energy prices that are too high, so we want to have more supply so that we can reduce people’s costs,” Ayotte said during Zeldin’s visit.

The minerals left behind from previous mining activities in already established mines could provide all the raw material required to build clean energy technologies, according to the study.
However, the study showed that this “waste” is often full of other useful materials, including dozens of critical minerals.
Critical minerals can be described as ‘critical’ if they are considered to have a role in a country’s strategically important economic sectors.
The IEA predicts that demand for critical minerals will need to triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040 if we hope to achieve net-zero emissions.","The United States is racing to develop its critical minerals industry to reduce reliance on China for metals and minerals, even through controversial actions such as deep-sea mining activities. However, a recent study suggests that it may be easier for the U.S. to access critical minerals than once thought, by developing new operations in existing mines.

An analysis of active U.S. mines, published in New Scientist in August, shows that accessing the leftover ore discarded in many U.S. mines is packed with a wide range of critical minerals. The minerals left behind from previous mining activities in already established mines could provide all the raw material required to build clean energy technologies, according to the study. Even if just a fraction of these minerals is recovered, it could help meet the growing U.S. demand for critical minerals without the need for imports or the development of new, environmentally damaging mines.

However, accessing these minerals could be challenging, according to the authors. This is because, at present, most mining activities focus on extracting specific types of minerals, such as copper and gold, rather than accessing the full array of metals and minerals that may be available. Mining for copper and gold requires excavating the ore, crushing it, and then separating the main product using a range of metallurgical processes. The excess rock and metal are typically discarded as mining waste. However, the study showed that this “waste” is often full of other useful materials, including dozens of critical minerals.

Critical minerals can be described as ‘critical’ if they are considered to have a role in a country’s strategically important economic sectors. This varies country to country depending on the most common applications. Many emerging critical mineral markets are closely linked to the expansion of the renewable energy sector, which relies heavily on various metals and minerals for equipment and operations.

Demand for critical minerals increased significantly in 2024, with lithium demand rising by 30 percent, while the demand for nickel, cobalt, graphite, and rare earths rose by between six and eight percent. Higher demand was largely driven by energy applications such as electric vehicles, battery storage, renewables, and grid networks, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). While for battery metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and graphite, the energy sector has contributed 85 percent of the total demand growth over the past two years. The IEA predicts that demand for critical minerals will need to triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040 if we hope to achieve net-zero emissions.

To conduct the study, Elizabeth Holley and her colleagues at the Colorado School of Mines assessed thousands of ore samples and production data, representative of mines from across the U.S., to estimate the volume of other minerals present in 54 active hard rock metal mines, which could be extracted. The study showed that extracting just one percent of certain minerals from mining byproducts could replace all current U.S. imports. However, some minerals would need an extraction rate of between 10 and 90 percent to meet the U.S. demand, and others, such as gold, platinum, and palladium, would likely still need to be imported, even if they are recovered at 100 percent from mining byproducts.

New mining operations focusing on enhanced mineral recovery from existing mines could significantly reduce the U.S. reliance on metal and mineral imports, a move that President Trump has supported since coming into office. Trump has stated plans for new mining activities, and even the controversial launch of deep-sea mining operations, to reduce the U.S. dependence on China for its minerals and strengthen the domestic supply chain.

In August, the U.S. Department of Energy announced almost a billion dollars in funding for unconventional mining efforts, with $250 million focused on recovering minerals from mining byproducts. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said, “For too long, the United States has relied on foreign actors to supply and process the critical materials that are essential to modern life and our national security.”

The study shows that investment in better extraction practices from active mines could reduce the financial and environmental burden of the domestic critical mineral industry while providing vast quantities of essential minerals. Brian McNulty at the University of British Columbia in Canada said the “opportunity is vast” and “Hopefully it energises people in government as well as industry to take a closer look at what we’re mining.”

While there is huge potential to improve mining extraction processes, significant investment needs to be made in research and development to make this possible. The expertise and equipment must be improved to use mines to their full potential, which could ultimately lead to huge long-term savings, as well as less damage to the environment.

“Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,” Fine said.
They test water quality, take photos of underwater vegetation, count birds and more, seeking to spot any big changes that may require action.","Seen from the air, a Florida freshwater spring is a bit of liquid heaven, luring humans and wildlife to enjoy its aquamarine cool. With at least 1,000 of them — more than any other state — the springs serve as beaches for large swaths of central and northwestern Florida far from the ocean, with teenagers backflipping from docks and snorkelers peering into the crystalline depths.

But these treasures are under threat from agricultural pollution, rapid development and climate change.

Some places, such as fast-growing Zephyrhills, have paused some construction as it struggles to stay within limits on the drinking water it can withdraw from a vast underground aquifer. Zephyrhills is home to Crystal Springs, source of the bottled water named after the town and several other brands.

“We really had to do something,” said Steven Spina, a member of the town council. “A lot of residents thought it was a good thing. People were happy to see us take a breath.”

Covering an estimated 100,000 square miles, the underground Floridan Aquifer is the source of 90% of the state's drinking water. Because of the porous nature of the bedrock, millions of gallons of water find their way to the surface in the form of clear, clean springs that, in turn, feed into rivers.

The highest concentration of springs are in Central and North Florida, including most of the 30 “first magnitude” springs — those that discharge at least 65 million gallons of water every day. All but four are considered polluted.

“We just have too much pollution going into the ground and too much water coming out of the ground,” said Ryan Smart, executive director of the nonprofit Florida Springs Council. “And when you get that combination, you end up with springs that are no longer blue and vibrant and full of life.”

Agriculture, development are main threats

In rural Florida, runoff from fertilizers and pesticides used in farm fields is a major part of the problem. Fertilizers containing phosphates and nitrogen promote algae blooms that can suffocate a spring. Livestock waste contributes, too.

“When that algae covers everything, then you lose all of the seagrasses. The seagrasses are the forests of the water,” Smart said. “Then you begin to lose the biodiversity. And it even puts our drinking water at risk.”

ALSO READ: Pollution, overpumping and hurricanes are taking a toll on Crystal River's springs

Elsewhere in Florida, rampant development is the threat. With over 1,000 people moving to Florida every day, more housing subdivisions are sprouting, along with the roads, strip malls, restaurants, golf courses and everything else that comes with them.

That means more paved surfaces that keep rainwater from percolating down into the aquifer and more pollutant-laden runoff from lawn fertilizers, parking lots, ever-widening roads and sometimes septic tanks. It also means more and more people, many of whom enjoy tubing, paddleboarding, kayaking and swimming in the springs.

It gets so busy in summer at some springs located in state and local parks that entry is halted by late morning. At Ichetucknee Springs State Park north of Gainesville, the daily limit of 750 tubers on the upper river is often reached within an hour after the park opens.

Kaelin Gibbs, on vacation in June with his family from Georgia, was swimming in the Blue Hole Spring along the Ichetucknee River.

“This is simply incredible; the water is cool and clear,” said Gibbs. “We’ve been to Florida’s beaches and to Orlando. There is no comparison to how beautiful this spring is.”

But that's in peril, said Dennis Jones, a Republican former legislator deeply involved in springs issues. He said the volume of permits being issued for water use isn't sustainable.

“You cannot keep taking water out of the aquifer because it’s not an endless supply,” Jones said.

Phosphate mining has also taken a toll on springs. Their operations require a great deal of water, which reduces water pressure available for springs. Some have died almost completely from mining and other factors, including White Sulphur Springs in North Florida, which was a sacred place for Native Americans and later a tourist resort that attracted famous visitors such as Henry Ford and Theodore Roosevelt.

A more subtle threat to the health of springs involves Earth's changing climate. It is altering rainfall patterns around the globe, threatening the balance that feeds Florida's springs.

In addition, some springs along the coasts are facing an intrusion of saltwater, according to the Southwest Florida Water Management District. Four major springs are becoming increasingly brackish because of sea level rise and declining rainfall.

""As a result, freshwater vegetation has a hard time surviving in this saltier environment and unwanted vegetation moves in,"" the district said in a website post.

State laws to protect springs remain stalled

Florida spends billions every year on water quality projects, including about $800 million this year for Everglades restoration work. State funding for springs runs about $50 million a year, according to state documents.

Two state efforts at improving springs' quality, both about a decade old, remain bottled up in court and administrative challenges. One would strengthen rules for permits to draw water from the major springs. The other would enhance rules to reduce the amount of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphates that goes into springs that are considered impaired.

Jones said lobbying by powerful agricultural interests and related political pressures have blocked progress on the nitrogen reduction plan that was expected to take about 20 years.

ALSO READ: Advocacy group's lawsuit claims Florida is failing to protect springs and waterways

“We’ve burned up almost 10 years and they haven’t got on stage one. We got more nitrates now than when we started,"" Jones said.

In Congress, Republican U.S. Rep. Randy Fine recently filed a bill that would create a Florida Springs National Park across several counties, centered around the Ocala National Forest. Fine said in a statement the designation would protect the springs and increase funding.

“Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,” Fine said.

Bottling companies get cheap permits for water

It costs bottling companies just $115 for a permit allowing them to withdraw millions of gallons of water in perpetuity. But they do pay local taxes.

Blue Triton, the company that bottles Zephyrhills water, pays about $600,000 a year in taxes for things like schools, public safety and so forth, Spina said.

“They are one of our largest taxpayers,” he said.

Though they have challenges, Florida's freshwater springs have energetic friends, too.

Michelle Jamesson loves the springs; she grew up swimming in one and is determined to help protect them for future generations. She volunteers for SpringsWatch Citizen Science Program, coordinating and working with other volunteers for monthly tests on the Wekiva River, north of Orlando.

DeCharge is currently operating a pilot program in New York and Los Angeles, with further expansion into Washington, D.C., Maryland, Virginia, and other areas on the horizon.

How does it work? DeCharge lets property owners install its chargers. The property owners set prices and stand to benefit financially from real-time payments and long-term revenue sharing, per the report.

DeCharge's business model addresses a critical need: as of early 2025, only 183,000 public charging ports were available in the U.S., well short of the 1.2 million needed by 2030, according to Department of Energy estimates cited by E+E Leader.

Additionally, the platform uses decentralized blockchain for payments and AI for various other tasks, such as load balancing and pricing optimization.

Without the resources of a giant corporation or a municipal government, DeCharge is seeking new and innovative solutions to doing business in the EV market in ways that will hopefully not just appeal to the early adopters, but also newer EV users.

For Fleet Managers, Sustainability Managers and Finance Managers, this announcement is significant. All-solid-state batteries are widely seen as the next step in electric vehicle (EV) technology, offering higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety compared to today’s lithium-ion batteries. However, bringing ASSBs to mass production at a commercially viable cost remains a key challenge.

Why this matters for fleets

A breakthrough in electrode production is central to reducing the cost of solid-state batteries and speeding up their availability in commercial vehicles. Nissan’s collaboration with LiCAP focuses on dry electrode technology, which eliminates the costly drying and solvent recovery stages used in traditional battery manufacturing.

By removing these steps, the dry electrode method could:

Lower battery costs, making EVs more financially attractive for fleet procurement.

Cut environmental impact, aligning with sustainability targets and emissions reduction plans.

Simplify manufacturing, potentially leading to faster scale-up of production capacity.

For fleets, the potential outcome is more affordable EVs with longer driving ranges, higher durability, and faster charging – all critical factors in reducing downtime and improving total cost of ownership.

LiCAP’s technology advantage

LiCAP brings its proprietary Activated Dry Electrode® technology, which offers improved production efficiency and better performance compared to traditional solvent-based methods. This addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in scaling up ASSB production – maintaining efficiency at high volumes.

Nissan’s roadmap

Nissan opened its ASSB pilot production line in January 2025 and has committed to launching its first EVs equipped with in-house developed solid-state batteries by fiscal year 2028. The partnership with LiCAP is expected to accelerate this timeline by solving key manufacturing hurdles.

For fleet operators planning long-term replacement schedules, this signals that solid-state EVs may be on the market within the next vehicle cycle – offering lower running costs and longer lifespans. Finance Managers in particular should note the potential impact on residual values as next-generation battery technology enters the fleet market.

What it means for sustainability goals

Solid-state batteries are expected to offer higher energy density, which translates into longer driving range without increasing battery size. For organisations with sustainability targets, the shift to solid-state will support deeper emissions reductions, especially in applications where vehicles cover high daily kilometres.

Nissan’s move to reduce environmental impact in the production process itself – by cutting solvents and drying requirements – adds another layer of sustainability benefits.

Key takeaway for fleets

Nissan’s partnership with LiCAP is not just an R&D milestone – it’s a signal that the next leap in EV technology is moving closer to commercialisation. Fleet Managers should factor solid-state timelines into medium-term planning, as the technology could reshape both procurement decisions and cost models before the end of the decade.",https://fleetevnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nissan-X-Trail-e-Power-STL-hybrid-drive-mode-button.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:04:27.177419

Pursuant to the SPA, EQT will purchase the LNG on a free-on-board basis at a price indexed to Henry Hub, Sempra said.

The Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project is strategically positioned to help meet global energy demand and has attracted strong interest from prospective LNG buyers. In July 2025, Sempra Infrastructure signed a definitive 20-year SPA with JERA Co., Inc. for 1.5 Mtpa of LNG offtake. Earlier this month, Sempra Infrastructure expanded its strategic alliance with ConocoPhillips with a 20-year SPA for 4 Mtpa of LNG offtake from the proposed project. Future phases are also in the early development stage.

In September 2023, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted project approval, followed by an export authorization from the U.S. Department of Energy in May 2025, allowing LNG exports to countries without a free-trade agreement with the United States. All major permits for the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project have been secured.

Further advancing the project, Sempra Infrastructure also previously announced that Bechtel had been selected to deliver the engineering, procurement and construction of the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 facility. With continued momentum in the project’s development, Sempra Infrastructure continues to target making a final investment decision on the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project in 2025.

Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 is expected to include two liquefaction trains capable of producing approximately 13 Mtpa of LNG, which could increase the total liquefaction capacity of the Port Arthur LNG facility from approximately 13 Mtpa for Phase 1 to up to approximately 26 Mtpa. Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, which is currently under construction, is expected to achieve commercial operations in 2027 and 2028 for trains 1 and 2, respectively.

For Guinea, the symbolism of the Kaleta station appearing on national currency is not accidental.","Guinea’s journey from crippling energy shortages to becoming a regional electricity exporter has been symbolically enshrined on its 20,000-franc banknote. The image of the Kaleta Hydropower Station, now central to the country’s power supply, captures more than just infrastructure, it tells the story of a nation reshaping its energy future through hydropower and international cooperation.

For decades, Guinea’s vast rivers earned it the title of the “Water Tower of West Africa.” Yet paradoxically, over 70 percent of its electricity was generated from costly and polluting fuel oil. The fragile grid imposed daily blackouts, stifled industrial growth, and left communities dependent on the noisy hum of diesel generators after sunset.

This reality began to change in August 2015 when the Kaleta Hydropower Station was commissioned on the Konkouré River. Built by the China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), the 240-megawatt facility added 1.125 billion kilowatt-hours of clean energy annually, meeting nearly half of the country’s power deficit at the time. A modern transmission network was simultaneously constructed, extending electricity access beyond Conakry to 11 prefectures, many of which received reliable power for the first time.

In 2021, the momentum was reinforced by the commissioning of the larger Souapiti Hydropower Station, also developed by CWE upstream. Together, Kaleta and Souapiti now generate 690 megawatts, supplying over 80 percent of Guinea’s electricity demand. Their impact has been profound: the nation’s reliance on fuel oil has been drastically reduced, and Guinea has transitioned from a power-deficient country into a net exporter of renewable energy. Neighboring countries such as Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone are now being supplied with Guinean electricity.

Local voices testify to this transformation. “Before Kaleta was built, power outages were common in our community. We experienced them almost daily, sometimes lasting for hours,” recalled Alhassane Bangoura, a translator who worked on the project and later joined the operations team. Today, he and other Guinean technicians maintain the facility independently, thanks to extensive training provided by Chinese engineers.

At the height of construction, more than 1,500 local jobs were created. Beyond employment, a deliberate skills-transfer program was established. Nearly 100 Guinean trainees were sent either to China or to local universities for specialized study. Those who first trained at Kaleta went on to mentor new recruits at Souapiti, ensuring continuity and building local technical capacity. This emphasis on knowledge sharing was described by CWE’s market development director, Chen Qiuhan, as essential for long-term sustainability: “Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.”

The projects have had visible social ripple effects. Rural communities have been electrified for the first time, small enterprises now operate with greater efficiency, and children study under steady lighting rather than candle flames. Equipment donations and community engagement programs have reached thousands of residents, while cultural exchanges between Chinese engineers and Guinean locals deepened trust during construction.

Hydropower’s growing role in Guinea also aligns with broader continental trends. Africa is estimated to hold 12 percent of the world’s hydropower potential, however, less than 10 percent of that capacity has been harnessed. In Guinea, the Konkouré River alone is expected to host multiple future projects that could cement the country as an energy hub in West Africa.

Environmentalists have, however, raised important questions. While hydropower is renewable, it is not without ecological costs. Reservoirs alter river ecosystems, affect fish populations, and can displace communities. In Guinea’s case, concerns around resettlement and biodiversity loss accompanied both Kaleta and Souapiti, reminding stakeholders that sustainability must balance energy access with environmental stewardship.

Nevertheless, the projects have been hailed as milestones in Africa-China cooperation in infrastructure and green energy. For Guinea, the symbolism of the Kaleta station appearing on national currency is not accidental. It signals the pride of a nation once shackled by power shortages, now positioning itself as a driver of energy integration in West Africa.

As night falls over the Konkouré valley, the lights from Kaleta glitter across the landscape, illuminating homes, schools, and factories.

Jeep brand sales saw a 2% increase.","The U.S. car industry has had its share of struggles since its heyday.

General Motors used to control about 50% of the U.S. car market and, along with Ford and Chrysler, the Detroit Big 3 held about 85% of the U.S. market through the 1960s.

Even through the 90s, the Big 3s market share was above 70%, and it didn't dip below 50% until 2008.

However, over the last 17 years, automakers from Japan and Korea have successfully toppled Detroit's dominance.

Ford and GM sales combined represented at least 50% of U.S. sales every year until 2001, and fell below 33.3% for the first time in 2012.

While there are numerous reasons for the decline, one of the most obvious is that U.S. cars have a reputation for lacking in quality.

Consumer Reports recently ranked car brands on their reliability using data from its annual reliability surveys.

Consumer Reports Top 5 reliable auto brands:

Subaru

Lexus

Toyota

Honda

Acura

The first U.S. car company to make the list is GM Brand Buick at 11. Ford checks in at 13, Chevy at 16, and Tesla at 17.

Stellantis doesn't rank until Jeep makes an appearance at 19.

Stellantis recalls another 219,000 vehicles due to rearview camera issue

Stellantis has a new CEO focused on retaking the company's place as one of the country's top automakers. But its latest recall won't help it turn things around.

Chrysler parent company Stellantis STLA is recalling 219,577 Ram ProMaster vans and Dodge Journey vehicles in the U.S. due to an issue with the rearview camera that could diminish the driver's view, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Saturday.

Earlier this summer, Chrysler issued a voluntary recall of 250,651 Pacifica and Voyager minivans model years 2022-2025.

Recalls are a recurring problem for Chrysler. Last year, the brand recalled more than 211,000 SUVs and pickup trucks due to a software malfunction that could disable the vehicles' electronic stability control systems.

Chrysler also recalled 67,180 300s due to another side airbag issue that could cause the device to rupture.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa commits to the U.S. market with latest moves

Antonio Filosa, Stellantis' new CEO, has recommitted to the U.S. market by moving the CEO's office back to Michigan and plans to invest billions in U.S. manufacturing.

The new direction couldn't come at a better time.

Stellantis reported that total first-quarter 2025 U.S. sales decreased 12% year-over-year, despite a 16% increase in Ram brand sales and a 1% increase in Chrysler brand sales. Jeep brand sales saw a 2% increase.

The company reported total sales of 293,225 vehicles in the first three months of the year.

The good news for those people was that their choices for Tesla alternatives are now better than ever. There's the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, the Kia EV6, and the value-packed Chevrolet Equinox EV, just to name a few of the top of my head.

Much to their consternation, however, there are still ways the Model Y runs circles around everything else. Yes, even now. And that's especially true with the Model Y's Juniper update—the car you see tested here in this video.

Since Tesla does not do press loaners like other automakers do, I rented this Model Y off Turo for a week. It's a Long Range, Dual-Motor All-Wheel-Drive model, the one packing a 75-kilowatt-hour battery and good for an EPA-rated 329 miles of range. And thanks to a raft of improvements inside and out, the Model Y is now a significantly better car than it's ever been—one with a nicer interior, better technology, more overall comfort, more range, more striking looks, and packing the best adaptive high beams I have ever tested in my career. All that and a bag of chips for around $45,000, before any incentives or tax breaks, as long as those last.

As you'll see in the video above, the Model Y remains the total package EV. Maybe it's not the fastest-charging EV these days. Nor is it the fastest, period. And there are many areas where rivals are beginning to outpace it, if they have not already. But can you find all of those things rolled into one car that's as good as this one, at this price point? The answer is not really.

Yes — but in moderation | Opinion,"The McClatchy California Editorial Board, David McNew",,,,,https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/editorials/article311777957.html,"Thanks to electric vehicles, demand for oil has been steadily declining in California.
Gavin Newsom introduced a plan in July that would fast-track oil drilling in California — allowing thousands of additional wells in Kern County, which is already producing 75% of the state’s crude oil.
But the sudden threat of high prices should not trigger a major expansion of California oil drilling.
It makes no sense, for example, for California to export state-produced oil to neighboring states like Nevada and Arizona.
“We’ve continued to have conversations with Valero,” Siva Gunda, vice chair of the California Energy Commission, told a state Assembly committee.","Thanks to electric vehicles, demand for oil has been steadily declining in California. But for now — and for at least another decade or two — cars in our state continue to run primarily on gasoline.

That’s creating a supply-and-demand problem that’s been driven home by current circumstances. Two major refineries — a Phillips 66 facility in Southern California and a Valero plant in Benicia — are scheduled to close in less than a year.

The closures set off alarm bells ringing loudly enough to inspire our eco-friendly governor who normally rants about “Big Oil” to act.

Gavin Newsom introduced a plan in July that would fast-track oil drilling in California — allowing thousands of additional wells in Kern County, which is already producing 75% of the state’s crude oil. The proposal is expected go to the state Legislature in September.

This is coming from a governor who once set a goal of phasing out oil production statewide by 2045.

Now Newsom is being accused of giving up on the “green utopia” and caving to Big Oil in an attempt to better position himself for a run for president.

The governor, however, sees it as a balancing act.

“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one’s naive about that,” Newsom said at a press conference. “So it’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.”

He’s got the basic idea right, but shortcutting environmental review to speed up production could have damaging consequences. And given that Donald Trump has declared a de facto war on clean energy, what we need now is a climate hero willing to push back on the president, rather than someone introducing a watered-down version of “drill-baby-drill.”

This it the wrong time for the governor to retreat — or even appear to retreat — from his commitment to clean energy. This should strictly be about how to decrease our dependence on oil in the best way possible.

Gas for $8.43 a gallon?

Nobody wants to see a huge spike in gas prices, certainly not to the $8.43-a-gallon level that USC business professor Michael Mische has predicted.

But the sudden threat of high prices should not trigger a major expansion of California oil drilling. Not when there are other solutions.

It makes no sense, for example, for California to export state-produced oil to neighboring states like Nevada and Arizona.

And it may make sense — at least on a temporary basis — to allow the import of less-expensive, conventional gasoline from other states rather than relyingonly the cleaner-burning, California blend. Some environmental experts say that will have a minimal effect on air quality.

“Even some advocates of the cleaner formulation a few decades ago argue that the benefits are likely now much smaller as engine technology has improved,” writes Severin Borenstein, faculty director of Energy Institute at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. “It is possible that the clean air benefits of our special formulation are no longer large enough to justify the costs.”

Also, expanding the network of EV chargers — and making sure they are well maintained — would encourage drivers to go electric, reducing the demand for gasoline. So would backfilling the tax credits canceled by Trump.

What is the plan?

The major thrust of Newsom’s 10-year plan, which is based on recommendations from the California Energy Commission, is to fast track permitting of new oil wells in two ways:

One, which focuses entirely on Kern County, calls for certifying a county zoning ordinance and its accompanying environmental impact report. That would shield the county from legal challenges from environmental groups that oppose the EIR, which allows the blanket permitting of new wells — as many as 2,700 per year — rather than requiring a review of each one individually.

The other proposal, called plug-to-drill, would streamline permitting of new wells throughout the state, with a catch: Petroleum companies would have to agree to properly plug and abandon two existing wells for every new one they drill.

State officials also are working to stabilize refinery capacity. The Energy Commission has been negotiating to prevent the Benicia plant from closing next April, but there has been no public indication of how that’s going.

“We’ve continued to have conversations with Valero,” Siva Gunda, vice chair of the California Energy Commission, told a state Assembly committee. “They’re confidential in nature.”

Allow limited new drilling

The Newsom proposal also includes a total ban on fracking, codifying an earlier ban that took effect in 2024. That’s a huge plus.

Plug-to-drill also has benefits. It would help clean up the orphan wells that past oil drillers left behind, creating a toxic nightmare for some disadvantaged communities like Arvin in Kern County, where releases of flammable gases triggered evacuations several years ago.

Orphan wells — so called because there is no one on the hook to bill for the cleanup — can continue to leak methane and volatile organic compounds like benzene and toluene. California has a program to cap them, funded by state, federal and industry dollars, but it’s a long, slow and expensive process.

Plug-to-drill could lead to hundreds more wells being capped, while boosting the crude oil supply by a relatively modest amount, spread throughout various parts of the state.

Plug-to-drill would not override local jurisdictions.

AB 3233, which was signed into law last September and allows counties and cities to “limit or prohibit oil and gas operations or development,” would remain in effect.

Several agencies, including the city and county of Los Angeles, have either passed prohibitions on new drilling or are considering it.

Start closing the book on Big Oil

While some amount of new drilling may be necessary, the residents of Kern County who have suffered ill effects from oil wells located practically in their back yards deserve to be assured that any future oil development will undergo proper review.

That won’t happen if the state swoops in and approves a drilling plan drafted by a county board that’s obviously pro-industry, rather than allowing a court to decide whether the latest iterations of the zoning ordinance and EIR are adequate.

Gov. Newsom does have a duty to ensure that California has an adequate and reasonably affordable supply of gasoline. This cannot lead to slowing California’s transition to zero-emission energy sources.

It’s time to start closing the book on Big Oil, rather than starting a whole new chapter — something state lawmakers should keep in mind when considering the governor’s plan.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/qgdjgq/picture293342179/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/US-NEWS-CALIF-OIL-INDUSTRY-GET.JPG,N,,2025-08-31 10:59:23.452277

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast.
Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.
President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office.
More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""

By Jon Caldara

Disclosure: Gov. Jared Polis wrote much of this column.

The epitaph on Jared Polis’ gubernatorial gravestone will simply read, “He knew better, but would not stand up to his own party.”

For seven years, our hyperprogressive legislature has sent him one industry-killing bill after another. And he kept signing them, even when he knows they are bad policy, economically devastating, and even if they go against his strongest-held convictions.

One such strongly held conviction is his faith in technology.

In the tech world, the man’s no slouch. As much as I’d like to tease Polis for just being a rich kid who got richer putting his momma’s greeting-card company online, the fact is he made fortunes many times over in varied tech ventures. And most importantly, he understands what the coming artificial intelligence revolution can bring for humanity in general, but also the endless opportunities it could bring Colorado in particular.

So then why did he agree to make Colorado the first state in the nation to effectively stamp out AI development by signing Senate Bill 24-205? This law will repel AI companies from providing us their services or locating here. The AI revolution could skip Colorado.

SB-205 was designed by the “we see oppression even before it exists” crowd. They are going to stamp out discrimination from — get this — software code. Starting next year, the law outlaws “algorithmic discrimination” in AI with ridiculously costly compliance regulations.

Polis clearly laid out why 205 is terrible law in what read like a veto statement. But, since he can’t veto much of anything, he crapped all over the bill in — get this — his bill-signing statement.

So, let’s let his own words explain why he shouldn’t have signed it.

Polis noted laws against discrimination focus on intentional efforts, writing, “This bill deviates from that practice by regulating the results of AI systems use, regardless of intent.”

He’s right. A baseball bat can be used in a hate crime, but the bat manufacturer didn’t intend it for that. There are already myriad laws, regulations and codes against discrimination. If AI is used to discriminate, shouldn’t we employ all that existing legal enforcement first?

The law doesn’t target outcomes — it regulates computer code that doesn’t even exist yet. Liberals used to say code is speech and therefore protected. Those liberals are extinct.

Polis goes on to say the new law will, “create a complex compliance regime for all developers and deployers of AI” through “significant, affirmative reporting requirements.”

Again, he is right. One reason the internet turned into the economic super engine it is was early on the feds had a “hands off the internet” policy to let the industry first develop. Now Colorado is the first state with a “hands all over AI” policy while it is in its infancy. Those hands will strangle this baby.

Small, innovative AI developers will be the first driven out of Colorado. It’s confusing how the left hates big business yet builds regulatory regimes that only big businesses can afford to navigate. Add it to the list of how progressives hate the little guy.

Polis knew this law is an economy killer: “I am concerned about the impact this law may have on an industry that is fueling critical technological advancements across our state for consumers and enterprises alike.”

“Government regulation that is applied at the state level in a patchwork across the country can have the effect to tamper innovation and deter competition in an open market. To that end, the important work of protecting customers from discrimination and other unintended consequences of nascent AI technologies is better considered and applied by the federal government.”

Again, he’s right. Ironically, Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill had a 10-year “hands off AI” moratorium — a smart move Polis supported. But leave it to Republicans to strip it out.

Polis understands why what he signed is horrid. That’s why he included a call for fixing, delaying or repealing SB24-205 in the upcoming special session.

For the sake of Colorado, free speech and a better future where America isn’t at the mercy of China’s AI, I hope Polis spends the political capital needed to fix his obvious regret.

He built his fortune online, but now he’s logging off Colorado’s AI future.",https://completecolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/7ef93286df6aa0a174533988bffcea70.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 11:00:07.376498

And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.

Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states' plans to transition to wind and solar power.

Following President Donald Trump's moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.

""Every month counts,"" said Patty O'Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. ""(The tax credits) are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that's currently in the pipeline.""

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.

But it's unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don't meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers' electricity bills.

""There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of (state regulators') financial analysis,"" said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. ""If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.""

Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government's clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don't produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.

State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.

For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O'Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.

But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.

""Quite a lot is at risk,"" said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.

Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don't already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.

Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.

""We're making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,"" said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. ""We're focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.""

Toor said the state is hoping to advance ""multiple gigawatts"" of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.

State officials and industry leaders said it's hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.

Some states, including California, have created a streamlined ""one-stop"" permitting process through a single state agency, O'Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.

""When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,"" he said.

Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.

O'Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.

Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those ""interconnection queues"" have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.

Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That's equivalent to roughly 13% of the state's electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.

Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission's authority to override permit denials from local authorities.

In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.

O'Boyle noted that California's transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such ""surplus interconnection.""

New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.

Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.

""Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,"" said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

Zeldin, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for failing to adopt water quality protections concerning toxic and cancer-causing chemicals in Florida’s waters.1

Water quality criteria for dozens of toxic chemicals that affect human health are supposed to be reviewed and updated by state environmental protection agencies, like the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), every three years in order to keep pace with updates in scientific research and new information. These toxic pollutants include known carcinogens like benzene and other chemicals found in fumigant pesticides and industrial solvents. However, many of Florida’s water quality criteria have remained woefully outdated since the 1990s.

“Florida has the largest recreational fishery in the United States and the second largest seafood industry. It only makes sense to protect Florida waters and Floridians from toxic chemicals that accumulate in our fish,” says Lisa Rinaman, St. Johns Riverkeeper.

In January of 2022, the Environmental Defense Alliance and Waterkeepers Florida sent a petition to EPA urging the agency to make a determination that new and revised water quality criteria in Florida are necessary to protect human health and meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act. After months of dialogue, EPA issued a determination on December 1, 2022 acknowledging that Florida’s 1990s-era human health criteria for priority toxic pollutants did not protect Florida’s people and waterways, and asserted that new and revised water quality criteria are needed. Specifically, EPA identified 40 priority toxic pollutants regulated by Florida that needed updated criteria, and 37 additional priority toxic pollutants that Florida had no criteria for, despite Clean Water Act requirements.2

EPA gave FDEP 12 months to adopt new and revised water quality criteria, but that time lapsed with no action. As a result, on December 1, 2023, EPA published a proposed rule to establish new and revised human health water quality criteria for 73 priority toxic pollutants in the state of Florida.3 These rules were scheduled to be finalized in late 2024 or early 2025, but were not promulgated when President Donald Trump issued an executive order instructing all federal agencies not to promulgate new rules. In response to this inaction, the Environmental Defense Alliance and Waterkeepers Florida have filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville Division) against Administrator Zeldin to compel him to finalize those rules as the Clean Water Act requires.

“The goal of the Clean Water Act is to ensure that all U.S. waterways are ‘fishable and swimmable,&rsquop; but lax enforcement from our state and federal environmental protection agencies has prevented that goal from becoming a reality” says Waterkeepers Florida Chair, Jen Lomberk. “Floridians deserve water that is clean and safe enough to swim in and fish from.”

Miami Waterkeeper, Dr. Rachel Silverstein, who has been involved in this effort since 2016 added, “The people of Florida deserve to be protected from exposure to toxic chemicals — especially after decades of living with unacceptably high levels of cancer-causing and neurotoxic pollutants. This is a much-needed action to protect Floridians, our water, and our wildlife.”

David Ludder, attorney for the Environmental Defense Alliance added, “The executive order issued by President Trump does not supersede or suspend the requirements of the Clean Water Act. Among those requirements is a congressional mandate that the Administrator of EPA promulgate water quality criteria no later than 90 days after EPA publishes proposed criteria determined to be necessary to protect fishing and shellfishing uses of waters.”

“Ford’s Mach-E balances features, range and access to rapid charging, plus U.S.-assembled vehicles qualify for a $10,000 loan interest deduction from 2025 to 2028,” Fix noted, highlighting its adaptable financing advantage for 2025 shoppers.

Chevy Bolt EV

Fix rates the Chevrolet Bolt EV highly for budget-friendly pricing, dependable range, and enhanced reliability from recent battery recalls and replacements, per YallaMotor’s reliability scores and real-world feedback. Owners routinely praise its low running costs, fast charging, and practicality for those who value efficiency and affordability, especially with used models now often under $25,000 and still eligible for tax credits depending on ongoing policy updates. “Bolt EV’s durability and low repair frequency set it apart, providing a smooth entry into electric driving for cost-conscious motorists,” Lauren observed, emphasizing its value proposition for buyers looking to maximize utility and minimize expense.

Tesla Model 3

Lauren Fix says the Tesla Model 3 deserves a spot for its excellent range, advanced technology and bargain pricing after Tesla’s aggressive price cuts and depreciation in 2025. Car and Driver ranks the Model 3 as its top electric sedan and hatchback for 2025, noting swift acceleration, comfortable interiors and access to the widespread Tesla Supercharger infrastructure, further supporting Fix’s assessment.

“Tesla’s price drops and new-vehicle tax credit loss after September make used Model 3s the smartest pick for tech-savvy drivers,” Fix said.

Nissan Leaf

Fix calls the Nissan Leaf one of the best options for those seeking affordable, reliable EVs with a robust battery warranty, especially as new incentives fade in 2025. Car and Driver’s 2025 review notes its cheap running costs, roomy interior and hatchback practicality, though buyers should consider its relatively modest range and slower charging rates compared to newer competitors.

“Leaf offers outstanding affordability for short commutes, backed by an eight-year/100,000-mile warranty and a record of reliability,” Lauren explained, reinforcing its reputation for budget-friendly urban electric driving.

Conclusion The expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit and the OBBBA’s policy shifts mark a pivotal moment for investors.","The federal tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs), offering up to $7,500 for new models, is set to expire on September 30, 2025. While the IRS has provided a narrow window for buyers to secure the credit by entering binding contracts and making payments before the deadline, the broader implications of this expiration—and the policy shifts reshaping the EV landscape—demand a strategic reevaluation of investment opportunities in EV infrastructure and battery technology.

The Urgency of Policy-Driven Market Shifts

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law in July 2025, has accelerated the phaseout of federal EV tax credits, creating a sense of urgency for investors. The OBBBA terminates the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit (Section 30D) and the Used Clean Vehicle Tax Credit (25E) for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025, while also phasing out incentives for EV infrastructure by June 30, 2026 [1]. This abrupt policy shift has already triggered a $6 billion cancellation of battery manufacturing projects and raised concerns about the U.S. losing its competitive edge in the global EV race [2].

However, the OBBBA is not a complete retreat from clean energy. Energy storage projects collocated with solar and wind facilities retain eligibility for tax credits until 2032, with a 40% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for storage systems meeting domestic content thresholds [3]. This creates a critical window for investors to capitalize on grid-scale battery storage, which is essential for stabilizing renewable energy grids and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Long-Term Viability of Green Energy Sectors

Despite the OBBBA’s restrictions, the long-term viability of green energy sectors hinges on technological advancements and state-level incentives. For instance, California’s $55 million Fast Charge California Project offers up to 100% of installation costs for DC fast chargers, prioritizing equitable access in disadvantaged communities [4]. Similarly, states like Oregon and Colorado have introduced robust rebates and tax credits for EV purchases, with Oregon’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program offering up to $7,500 in combined incentives [5]. These state-level programs mitigate the loss of federal support and underscore the importance of diversifying investment strategies across federal and state channels.

Battery technology remains a cornerstone of this transition. While the OBBBA eliminates the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit, which previously supported domestic battery production, grid-scale energy storage retains partial reprieve through extended ITCs [6]. This shift signals a pivot from transportation-focused battery demand to grid applications, where companies can leverage existing manufacturing capabilities to meet evolving energy needs.

Strategic Investment Opportunities

Energy Storage Infrastructure: With the OBBBA extending tax credits for energy storage until 2032, investors should prioritize projects that pair storage with solar and wind facilities. The 40% ITC for storage systems, coupled with a 12-month grace period for construction, provides a clear incentive for rapid deployment [3].

State-Level EV Incentives: Investors should monitor state programs like California’s CALeVIP and Oregon’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which offer direct financial support for EV adoption and infrastructure. These programs are less vulnerable to federal policy shifts and provide stable returns [4][5].

Battery Supply Chain Resilience: While the OBBBA introduces foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions, domestic battery manufacturers can still benefit from grid-scale storage demand. Companies that adapt their supply chains to meet MACR thresholds (material assistance cost ratios) will gain access to tax credits and long-term contracts [6].

Conclusion

The expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit and the OBBBA’s policy shifts mark a pivotal moment for investors. While federal support for EVs is waning, the transition to a low-carbon economy remains inevitable, driven by declining battery costs and state-level innovation. By focusing on energy storage, grid-scale applications, and state incentives, investors can navigate the post-deadline landscape and position themselves for long-term gains in the green energy sector.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-31 10:59:35.282979

Along 4.5 miles of the Grand Calumet River alone, the program has cleaned up some 2 million cubic yards, enough to fill up more than 600 Olympic-size swimming pools.
On the Far South Side of Chicago, the Grand Calumet becomes the junction where the Calumet River and the Little Calumet meet, the latter of which eventually flows into the Cal-Sag Channel.
Industry, however, is not the only threat to these ecosystems along the Grand Calumet River; so are invasive species such as the purple loosestrife.
The same has been said of the invasive common reed along the Grand Calumet system.","Just north of the clamor on the Indiana Toll Road in East Chicago, an inconspicuous side street leads to Roxana Marsh on the Grand Calumet River. Songbirds chirp and great blue herons rest by the water in this hidden urban oasis.

Across from the marsh, a chemical plant interrupts the natural landscape. Buildings like it have dominated life in the region since heavy industry moved in from Chicago in the 1800s; today, 75% of East Chicago is zoned for industry. The impact has reverberated along the river ecosystem, once considered one of the world’s most contaminated waterways.

It didn’t catch fire like Cleveland’s infamously polluted Cuyahoga River did in 1969, said Emily Stork, regional ecologist from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, who was leading a recent tour for educators in the Calumet Region.

But, she added, it has suffered some of the worst industrial abuses in the Great Lakes basin.

“It was a very messed-up river,” Stork said.

The Grand Calumet River’s 13 miles meander across northwest Indiana, flanked by old and new industries, such as steel mills, meatpackers and oil refineries, which dumped a noxious mix of heavy metals and chemicals into its waters before federal regulations. Over the last 15 years, more than two-thirds of the waterway has been slowly brought back to life through concerted efforts to remove or cap toxic muck.

The Great Lakes Legacy Act — which aims to address areas of concern in the basin where longtime industrial contamination has caused environmental degradation — has funded 34 remediation projects across the region since 2004, removing or capping almost 7 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment. Along 4.5 miles of the Grand Calumet River alone, the program has cleaned up some 2 million cubic yards, enough to fill up more than 600 Olympic-size swimming pools.

But there’s still a long way to go.

Flowing west from Miller Beach in Gary, the river splits between Hammond and East Chicago — most of its waters heading north to drain into Lake Michigan through the Indiana Harbor, the rest flowing toward Illinois. On the Far South Side of Chicago, the Grand Calumet becomes the junction where the Calumet River and the Little Calumet meet, the latter of which eventually flows into the Cal-Sag Channel.

Joel Perez, project director for the southern Lake Michigan rim at The Nature Conservancy, who was part of the Calumet tour, grew up nearby and recalls the overgrown brush and the auto tires that used to litter the marsh.

“That really sucked — living next to this body of water (that) I couldn’t use,” Perez said.

Despite advances in recent years, the waterway remains a work in progress; the remediated sites still need care and maintenance, and almost 4 miles of the river have yet to be addressed. A project for the second half of the east branch is in the design phase and will include closing the Gary Sanitary District’s Ralston Street Lagoon after a cleanup and containment plan that began 14 years ago. The U.S. EPA estimates all necessary actions will be completed between 2027 and 2030, and that the waterway will be delisted as an area of concern possibly by 2031.

Even as the federal agency faces budget cuts — with the Trump administration proposing to slash it by 55% for the next fiscal year — the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which houses the legacy act, has not been targeted for elimination. The initiative also tends to garner bipartisan support in Congress; the U.S. Senate passed a bill in December to reauthorize it for five more years and eventually increase its funding from $475 million to $500 million.

Toxic sediment

The pollutants that were pumped into the river, unregulated for decades, pose the biggest threat to its ecosystem. But so does the accumulation of sediment, which can significantly reshape physical habitats and the life they sustain, Stork said. For instance, Roxana Marsh used to be a pond, but industrial sediment made it shallow.

Tall, dense invasive common reeds were then able to move in and stifle native plants. It made the area inaccessible to migratory birds that had long used the place as a rest stop.

“Even if birds wanted to use it, they would have gotten sick,” Stork said.

So much sediment had accumulated that, had it been removed in its entirety, that section of the river would have been an unnatural 15 feet deep — and wouldn’t have been able to support life at the bottom, according to Stork.

“Man, this must’ve been something before industry came in,” said Dan Martin, a Chicago schoolteacher, as he looked out onto the marsh during the recent tour.

That beauty is slowly coming back. At the marsh, remediation returned 19 acres of habitat to birds such as black-crowned night herons, bald eagles and sandpipers. Most visitors to this and other restored portions of the river are birdwatchers who are familiar with the area’s salience in the region’s migratory corridor.

Driving east from the marsh, Stork passed a stretch of the river not yet remediated, between Indianapolis Boulevard and Kennedy Avenue. Nearby, a former DuPont chemical plant is undergoing a U.S. EPA-required $26.6 million cleanup by current and former owners. Also nearby, a USS Lead Superfund site, where lead and arsenic are the main contaminants, is being cleaned up.

On another 5 miles along the eastern stretch of the river, the U.S. EPA enforced a cleanup project in the 2000s that had U.S. Steel remove almost 800,000 cubic yards of sediment next to the corporation’s Gary Works facility.

Some industries and local companies proactively participate in projects like the remediation along segments of the river, each of which requires collaboration among several agencies and stakeholders and can be yearslong, multimillion-dollar endeavors.

“We have to take it one bite at a time,” Stork said.

Typically, the U.S. EPA supplies two-thirds of the funding for legacy act projects, but these also need support from local sponsors such as nonprofits including The Nature Conservancy or state agencies such as the Department of Natural Resources. In northwest Indiana, at least $191 million in federal and nonfederal funds have been spent to date for cleanup of the Grand Calumet over the past 15 years.

Black-eyed Susans sprout from where power line poles meet the ground, replacing artificial turf that the Northern Indiana Public Service Co. had previously installed.

“It looks like a bad haircut,” Stork laughed.

The utility company is working with project partners to bring the area back to life. For instance, it collaborated with the U.S. EPA and state agencies to remove 14,600 cubic yards of contaminated sediment and cap another 30,000 cubic yards from a 0.4-mile stretch of the river that ends at the Illinois state line. Invasive vegetation was also removed and replaced by native shrubs and trees.

The first remediated section on the river’s east branch, the Seidner Dune and Swale Nature Preserve in Hammond, is managed by the Shirley Heinze Land Trust and The Nature Conservancy after a multiagency acquisition and restoration project.

“Stepping here is like stepping back in time,” Stork said.

The landforms at the preserve are remnants of glaciation. The dunes were once beach ridges from when Lake Michigan’s meltwater reached farther inland.

Dune and swale systems are globally rare; this topographic variation — upland in the dunes, lowland in the swales — combines with the region’s unique confluence of biomes — particularly oak savanna, prairie and wetlands — to pack a lot of biodiversity into the preserve’s 42 acres. According to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, almost 300 species of plants have been identified on-site, including several rare ones with strict habitat requirements.

A wild turkey flapped its wings, taking off as the group of educators walked a 1-mile loop trail that once was a railroad bed. A wildfire blew into the preserve in March, Stork said, killing woody invasives, scorching shrubs and clearing the way for wildflowers to bloom.

“It really opened this up,” said Alexis Dalton, conservationist and manager of natural areas at the Lake County Parks and Recreation Department in Indiana.

Another threat

Vibrant wildflowers dotted the landscape, hues of violet, lilac and indigo dominating the view. They were verbena, blazing stars and purple loosestrife.

Stork walked into the tall grasses and rooted out one of the latter.

“I just did remarkably well there,” Stork said with a laugh. Being a perennial plant, the deep roots of the purple loosestrife normally complicate its removal.

A mechanical hum grew louder toward the western end of the property, where a Resco Products refractory plant stands in stark contrast to the surrounding wetlands.

Industry, however, is not the only threat to these ecosystems along the Grand Calumet River; so are invasive species such as the purple loosestrife. A single one of these plants can produce 1 million to 3 million seeds each year, which can stay in the riverbank without germinating for up to two decades.

“We’re never going to run out of it,” Stork said.

The same has been said of the invasive common reed along the Grand Calumet system. Scientists believe it originated in Eurasia and was accidentally introduced to North America in the late 18th or early 19th century via ship ballast water, establishing itself along the Atlantic Coast and spreading across the rest of the continent in the 20th century. Nowadays, it is the most common type of reed in North America, and, in the Midwest, it has displaced native reeds from wetland habitats near roadsides and waterways with heavy human traffic.

The reeds once blocked the view of the Grand Calumet from the dune and swale, but on the southern side of that section of the river, most have been removed. Yet, across the water, a seemingly impenetrable wall of the invasive plants sways in the wind, several feet tall.

Even after remediation, the consequences of human activity make the area a priority for restoration and conservation work.

“The project never ends,” said Jessica Fernandez, crew lead at The Nature Conservancy.

For instance, at Roxana Marsh, project partners have now turned their efforts toward improving accessibility for the general public, given that the area is still somewhat tucked away.

The recent immersive tour of the area was another effort between the conservancy, the state and the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant to share the region’s recovery and success story with educators and equip them to teach their students about it.

The ecosystem’s substantial improvements should be celebrated, Stork added.

“For these communities to have this much natural habitat, with this now clean river, is a very big upgrade,” she said. “It’s in their backyard and they don’t know that (restoration) happened.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ctc-l-calumet-restoration-20_232061496.jpg?w=1024&h=645,N,,2025-08-31 10:01:10.907773

The prime minister called for a clear timeline for TEDA’s expansion and indicated the possibility of granting the company new industrial areas in emerging urban centres, including New Alamein City and the New Administrative Capital.

He said these plans were reinforced in talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who reiterated Beijing’s support for Chinese firms investing in Egypt.

Egypt is particularly keen to attract companies working in renewable energy, electric vehicles (EVs), battery manufacturing, and water desalination, Madbouly added.

TEDA, operating in Egypt since 2008, has so far attracted 200 companies, channelled $3 billion in investments, contributed $300 million in taxes, and created more than 10,000 jobs.

Zhu Difu described Egypt as a model of successful cooperation and confirmed the company’s intention to expand its SCZone footprint, building on its track record in energy, petrochemicals, electronics, textiles, and advanced industries.

He also reviewed ongoing energy projects developed in collaboration with Egypt’s Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, highlighting opportunities to expand into water desalination as the zone broadens its scope.

The TEDA Egypt-China Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone, located in Ain Sokhna at the southern entrance of the Suez Canal, is strategically positioned to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe.

Water desalination and renewable energy

Separately, Madbouly announced plans to increase Egypt’s desalination capacity to 10 million cubic metres per day within five years, up from the current 1.4 million cubic metres per day, while localizing plant components.

He met with Ni Chen, Chairman and General Manager of China Energy Engineering Corporation (CEEC), to discuss the country’s renewable energy and energy storage ambitions.

Madbouly said Egypt aims to generate 42 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030 and is counting on CEEC’s support to localise renewable energy components.

Ni Chen outlined plans to invest $1 billion over five years to establish Egypt as a regional hub, expand into seawater desalination, and continue joint energy generation projects, with technologies increasingly produced locally.

CEEC has operated in Egypt since 2009, completing 14 projects and relocating its regional headquarters to Cairo.

Ni Chen praised Egyptian government support and highlighted the company’s readiness to scale up investments in renewable energy, desalination, and energy storage.

Ni Chen announced that the company plans to expand into seawater desalination in Egypt alongside its existing renewable energy and energy storage projects, while confirming ongoing consultations with the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy on joint generation initiatives and pledging to localize its technologies within the country.

The meetings underscore Egypt’s ongoing effort to bolster industrial and green technology partnerships with Chinese investors, positioning the SCZone as a gateway for advanced industries and a hub for regional trade, manufacturing, and sustainable development.

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast.
Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.
President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office.
More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""

They can skip the two-year queue for high-voltage grid connections—regardless of whether these projects are for gas, wind, solar, geothermal, or even new-age nuclear.

“Our grid isn’t short on opportunity — it’s short on time,” said Carson Kearl, Enverus senior analyst for energy and AI. “These grid interconnections are up for grabs for new power projects when these coal plants roll off.

“The No. 1 priority for Big Tech has changed to [speed] to energy, and this is the fastest way to go in a lot of cases,” Kearl told Fortune.

American coal power plunged from 50% of the nation’s grid as recently as 2005 down to just 16% and falling today, courtesy of the shale gas drilling rush and the rise of renewables. But coal still represents more than half of the grid’s carbon emissions. While wind and solar power are emission-free, switching to new gas plants still represents a 60% emissions reduction from coal.

In the last two decades, as more coal plants closed, U.S. power emissions plummeted 40%, accounting for more than 75% of the nation’s total decline in carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The energy research firm Enverus estimates that at least 70 gigawatts of retired coal power capacity—enough to power 50 million homes, or almost 100 data centers—can be converted to clean (or cleaner) power sources.

Power generator and utility owner Xcel Energy (No. 319 on the Fortune 500) is in the process of converting old coal plants to both gas-fired and renewable power from Minnesota to Texas. And many more projects are on the way in the years to come, said Xcel chairman and CEO Bob Frenzel.

“Tech is looking for speed, they’re looking for electricity and, in some cases, we have both,” Frenzel told Fortune. “We’ve been able to use those interconnections quite successfully to repower with more efficient and more clean energy resources.”

Switching to wind, solar, gas, nuclear, and more

Most new power construction in the U.S. is currently concentrated on solar, wind, and accompanying battery energy storage, but the Trump administration’s war on renewables—just when the country needs more power—means wind and solar tax credits expire after 2027.

The clean energy projects underway largely will get built—some utilizing coal interconnections—but much more coal-to-gas switching will occur to meet the needs of AI, especially in gas-rich regions such as Pennsylvania, Texas, and Colorado.

“We as an industry are racing to meet the needs of this new critical national security asset,” Frenzel said of the AI boom. “We’re excited about the opportunity, but it’s going to take an all-hands approach to get it done.

“After [renewable tax credits expire], we as a country must commercialize other assets. Gas is a great bridge fuel, and we’re going to continue to use a lot of gas,” Frenzel added.

In the 2030s, new nuclear and geothermal power facilities will come online, he said, but those generation sources require more development time and permitting hurdles.

In Sherburne County, Minnesota, Xcel is retiring its legacy coal plant, taking the first unit offline last year and fully closing it by 2030. In its place, Xcel is developing an array of solar, wind, and battery power. The project includes the longest-duration battery storage in the country, a 100-hour battery system developed by Form Energy. The goal is to power a data center hub there, Frenzel said. Xcel and Meta are working together on a Minnesota project. Amazon also recently bought adjacent land, although its plans are currently paused.

In the Texas Panhandle, Xcel just converted its Harrington coal plant to gas-fired power. Up next, is the nearby Tolk coal facility also slated for a switch to gas. Xcel plans to build about 2 gigawatts of new wind and solar power in the area to meet oil and gas industry electrification needs, as well as for the transformation of a crypto mining site into a data center complex, Frenzel said.

Likewise, Xcel is almost finished converting its Pawnee coal plant in Colorado to gas-fired power. Xcel’s Hayden coal plant in Colorado is slated for closure in 2028, and geothermal power is under consideration for that site. Xcel is working with data center developer QTS in the state.

In a more unique twist on coal-to-gas switching, the Intermountain coal plant in Utah is switching to gas, but it’s also utilizing a green hydrogen blend with the gas to make it burn cleaner. And some coal-to-gas involves using battery storage as well. The AES Petersburg coal plant in Indiana is switching to a gas-fired and battery storage combo complex.

Elsewhere in the country, even coal-to-nuclear plans are underway. Bill Gates’ TerraPower is developing a next-generation nuclear plant slated to open by 2030 on an expedited schedule—in a partnership with Sabey Data Centers—utilizing the interconnections of the Naughton coal and gas plant, which will start closing next year.

Still, even as coal plant retirements were moved up in recent years, some are being pushed backwards again toward their original closure dates now that the grid is being strained and the Trump administration is championing coal power.

For instance, Maryland’s last coal plant, Brandon Shores, was slated to close this year, but will now stay up until 2029 as a power bridge for the AI boom. Likewise, the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan was extended from its May closure date until at least November.

The Trump administration’s orders to keep “beautiful clean coal” alive are only temporary. The plants are still going to close; they just received stays on their execution dates.

The “clean coal” phrasing was part of a lobbying and marketing push for more modernized—and less dirty—coal plants about 15 years ago, but the language has largely disappeared outside of the White House as coal continues to be replaced by renewables and cleaner, cheaper gas.

The coal lobbying group, Americans for Balanced Energy Choices, rebranded in 2008 as the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. They gave up on that in 2019, changing to the more succinct and generically named America’s Power. Since then, utilities and railroads have left the group, leaving its membership only to coal companies.

Big Appalachian gas opportunity

In July, about 85 miles west of Homer City in Pennsylvania, it was announced by the project’s developers that the old Bruce Mansfield coal plant, padlocked in 2019, would be converted to gas-fired power as the new Shippingport Power Station to help fuel the AI revolution.

That same day, the developers also publicized the largest natural gas producer in the Appalachia region, EQT, would supply both the Shippingport and Homer City projects with a combined 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of gas supplies.

“Just to put this in perspective, that’s enough natural gas to power two of New York City. Scale matters,” EQT CEO Toby Rice told Fortune. “Homer City and Shippingport are just the first steps of multiple steps in multiple projects, because I do believe that cluster effect is real. They already have connections to the grid, which is a huge fast pass.”

EQT is ready to help lead an AI tech boom in Pennsylvania and the broader Appalachia region with the advantage that it’s home to the largest natural gas field in the country, the Marcellus Shale. And EQT has its own pipeline business to connect directly to data centers as needed.

Rice is leading the charge to make natural gas as clean as possible, through improved technology and upcoming carbon capture and storage projects. It incudes a marketing push—after all, “natural gas” sounds much nicer than “methane.” “People need to understand the natural gas decarbonization train has not slowed down,” he said.

Rusty Hutson, the CEO of gas producer Diversified Energy agrees. Methane is the product, he said, and the producers don’t want to waste the gas in emissions. “We want to sell it. At the end of the day, going through a pipeline and going through a meter is much more beneficial to us than any emissions are,” Hutson told Fortune.

While EQT will focus on drilling new wells to feed the AI beast, Diversified operates more mature gas wells that are often unwanted by the biggest players.

“Data centers, especially in the Appalachian basin, are going to be a huge demand on natural gas,” Hutson said. “We can’t afford to lose any production because other companies are focused on the drill bit and not really on existing wells and existing operations. That’s where we come in to maintain and produce those wells in an efficient manner to keep them in production for longer.”

As Rice and Hutson argued, the trend is much bigger though than an Appalachia story. Enverus’ Kearl said the AI race may very well be won or lost based on how rapidly old coal plants can be repowered to other generation sources nationwide.

“Repowering isn’t just a cost play—it’s a political and logistical shortcut to growing 24/7, low-carbon power,” Kearl said.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22447599/GettyImages-2158433068-e1756391445997.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:06:02.435007

A federal tax break for consumers who buy or lease electric vehicles will disappear after Sept. 30. However, consumers may have a little bit of wiggle room on that time frame, according to a new document released by the Internal Revenue Service.

The tax credits, worth up to $7,500, were scrapped as part of a Republican tax and spending measure passed in July. The law says consumers don't qualify for a tax break if the EV is ""acquired after"" Sept. 30.

Some observers initially thought that meant an EV had to be ""placed in service"" by that date — meaning that consumers had to be in physical possession of the car.

However, the IRS clarified that's not the case.

watch now

If a taxpayer acquires an EV by having a ""written binding contract in place"" and makes a payment on or before Sept. 30, they'd be entitled to claim the federal tax credit when they eventually take possession of the vehicle — even if that's after Sept. 30, the IRS said in a set of answers to frequently asked questions issued Aug. 21.

""This means that if you can't drive off in the clean vehicle of your dreams by Sept. 30, there is still hope,"" said Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, a nonprofit advocating for a quicker transition to electric cars.

The IRS update applies to used, new and leased EVs, according to the IRS document. They correspond with sections 25E, 30D and 45W of the tax code, respectively.

""You can order the vehicle from the dealer or manufacturer, sign the contract, put down a deposit by Sept. 30 and take possession of it later,"" Malmgren said.

Making a payment might also mean making a vehicle trade-in, Malmgren said.

Of course, the vehicle and consumer would still need to meet certain eligibility criteria to qualify for a federal tax credit.

Consumers can still receive the tax credit as an instant rebate when taking possession of the vehicle, Malmgren said, instead of waiting to file their annual tax return next year.

Aside from getting the money more quickly, there's an additional benefit: Consumers who choose to get the tax credit at the point of sale don't need to have a tax liability in order to get the funds.

Taxpayers should ensure they get a time-of-sale report from the dealer when picking up their EV or within three days of picking it up, according to the IRS.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108190440-1756150645100-gettyimages-2164804485-20240729-a7407660.jpeg?v=1756150674&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-08-31 10:59:42.959145

There is a place in Peru where it seems time stopped decades ago. It is called Pampa Clemesí and, although it is right next to the largest solar plant in the country, its neighbors are still living in the dark!! Literally. Less than a kilometer away from a plant that generates clean energy for half the country, there are houses that do not even have a plug. Not one.

Bathed in light… but not electric.

The plant in question is the Rubí Power Plant, a huge complex of solar panels that began installation in 2018 and that, in 2024, officially became the largest solar generator in Peru. It produces about 440 GW a year. With that, entire cities are supplied. But Pampa Clemesí, 600 meters away, still uses flashlights and candles at night, that energy is not for them…

Promises that never arrive

The company responsible, Orygen, says it has invested in a plan to electrify the area. Some panels have even been donated to the neighbors. But without batteries or converters, those panels are not much use, they have the materials but not the means. And here lies the paradox: electricity travels hundreds of kilometers to Lima or Arequipa, but it does not cross the 600 meters that separate the plant from the town!

Moquegua, the region where all this is, is one of the sunniest places on the planet. Ideal for solar energy. Peru knows this and that is why renewables are growing at a good pace: only in 2024, growth was 96%. Even so, that has not brought development for everyone. On the contrary: technological progress goes one way, and the basic needs of towns like Pampa Clemesí go another, creating a major gap in the Peruvian population.

The challenge of renewables

It is especially sad because Peru is not only a country that bets on renewables, but also the second largest producer of copper in the world, a key material for all this. Where does that copper go? To export. Where do the investments go? To wherever there are profits. Areas with small populations, like Pampa Clemesí, are not on that priority list.

Orygen insists that it is part of the state plan to electrify the town and that it has already invested 800,000 dollars in a first phase. But the reality is completely different, the houses are still without light, without refrigerators, without the possibility of charging a phone or turning on a radio. Nothing. And meanwhile, from their windows, the neighbors see the plant lit up every night as if it were a city. A shining mirage that is useless to them. How unfair!

And of course many of us think that the energy transition is worthless if it leaves out the most vulnerable, you can produce all the gigawatts in the world, but what good is it if that energy does not serve to give every house in the world a simple plug?

Energy transition but not for everyone.

Energy poverty is real, and not only in remote areas of Africa or Asia, also in Latin America, also in Peru, also in a town that lives in the shadow (or rather the glow) of a plant that symbolizes the future… The future of who? In their case, it only confirms that they remain trapped in the past year after year while the world moves forward.

Renewable energy is necessary, yes, but it also has to be fair. If not, we will be changing technology but not the model and we will be condemning the same people to the same fate. And that is a difference that, for places like Pampa Clemesí, means everything.",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5d41d1a0-5e4e-11f0-abc2-f594647315a9.jpg-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-31 08:59:14.888170

AI power demand Braverman’s Eco Wave Power is already thinking ahead, having identified dozens more sites in the United States that could be suitable for similar projects.","SAN PEDRO, United States (AFP) — Floating blue paddles dance on the waves that lap a dock in the Port of Los Angeles, silently converting the power of the sea into useable electricity.

This innovative installation may hold one of the keys to accelerating a transition away from fossil fuels that scientists say is necessary if the world is to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

“The project is very simple and easy,” Inna Braverman, co-founder of Israeli start-up Eco Wave Power, told AFP.

Looking a little like piano keys, the floaters rise and fall with each wave.

They are connected to hydraulic pistons that push a biodegradable fluid through pipes to a container filled with accumulators, which resemble large red scuba tanks.

When the pressure is released, it spins a turbine that generates electrical current.

If this pilot project convinces the California authorities, Braverman hopes to cover the entire 13-kilometer (eight-mile) breakwater protecting the port with hundreds of floaters that together would produce enough electricity to power 60,000 US homes.

Supporters of the technology say wave energy is an endlessly renewable and always reliable source of power.

Unlike solar power, which produces nothing at night, or wind power, which depends on the weather, the sea is always in motion.

And there is a lot of it.

Tough tech

The waves off the American West Coast could theoretically power 130 million homes — or supply around a third of the electricity used every year in the United States, according to the US Department of Energy.

However, wave energy remains the poor relation of other, better-known renewables, and has not been successfully commercialized at a large-enough scale.

The history of the sector is full of company shipwrecks and projects sunk by the brutality of the high seas. Developing devices robust enough to withstand the fury of the waves, while transmitting electricity via underwater cables to the shore, has proven to be an impossible task so far.

“Ninety-nine percent of competitors chose to install in the middle of the ocean, where it’s super expensive, where it’s breaking down all the time, so they can’t really make projects work,” Braverman said.

With her retractable dock-mounted device, the entrepreneur believes she has found the answer.

“When the waves are too high for the system to handle, the floaters just rise to the upward position until the storm passes, so you have no damage.”

The design appeals to Krish Thiagarajan Sharman, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

“The Achilles heel of wave energy is in the costs of maintenance and inspection,” he told AFP. “So having a device close to shore, where you can walk on a breakwater and then inspect the device, makes a lot of sense.”

Sharman, who is not affiliated with the project and whose laboratory is testing various wave energy equipment, said projects tend to be suited to smaller-scale demands, like powering remote islands.

“This eight-mile breakwater, that’s not a common thing. It’s a rare opportunity, a rare location where such a long wavefront is available for producing power,” he said.

AI power demand

Braverman’s Eco Wave Power is already thinking ahead, having identified dozens more sites in the United States that could be suitable for similar projects.

The project predates Donald Trump’s administration, but even before the political environment in Washington turned against renewables, the company was already looking beyond the US.

In Israel, up to 100 homes in the port of Jaffa have been powered by waves since December.

By 2026, 1,000 homes in Porto, Portugal should be online, with installations also planned in Taiwan and India.

Braverman dreams of 20-megawatt projects, a critical capacity needed to offer electricity at rates that can compete with wind power.

And, she said, the installations will not harm the local wildlife.

“There’s zero environmental impact. We connect to existent man-made structures, which already disturb the environment.”

Promises like this resonate in California, where the Energy Commission highlighted in a recent report the potential of wave energy to help the state achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.

“The amount of energy that we’re consuming is only increasing with the age of AI and data centers,” said Jenny Krusoe, founder of AltaSea, an organization that helped fund the project.

“So the faster we can move this technology and have it down the coastline, the better for California.”",https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250831__72VG2C3__v1__HighRes__UsEnvironmentEnergyOceans.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 08:59:19.721080

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast.
Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.
President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office.
More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2250+0+113/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9c%2F40%2F97cbef974be09cc587e87281a2b3%2Fap23345773091464.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 08:59:27.887232

He also issued a day-one executive order temporarily halting all onshore and offshore wind project permitting.
“The only way that dying industry can stay alive is by having unfair advantages, and the Trump administration appears willing to be the avenue by which it gets those advantages.” The Trump administration is reportedly planning on attempting to block yet another offshore wind project—the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, which was approved by the Biden administration in December.
Just weeks ago, the DOI announced it was canceling authorization of the Lava Ridge onshore wind project in southern Idaho, which was also approved last December.
On Friday the Department of Transportation announced it would be canceling $679 million in federal funding supporting the development of 12 offshore wind projects.","Donald Trump has made no secret of his personal distaste for wind energy, issuing attacks on the renewable resource, without evidence, as either the “most expensive form of energy” or “driving the whales crazy.”

Meanwhile, his administration has taken its campaign against wind to a new phase. The acting head of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop work order last week to the developer of Revolution Wind, a 704-megawatt offshore wind project off the coast of Rhode Island. The project was fully permitted, and construction was 80 percent complete. It was expected to start operating in 2026, delivering clean electricity to power more than 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Environmental advocates say the administration’s August 22 directive is unprecedented and even illegal.

“There’s no basis in the law to stop construction on a project that has been fully permitted,” Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at Conservation Law Foundation, told Sierra. She called the Trump administration’s explanation for its stop work order “very thin,” noting it included a vague reference to national security concerns that appears to be unexplained.

All offshore foundations had been installed and 45 out of the 65 turbines had already gone up when the stop work order was issued for Revolution Wind, according to project developer Orsted. The company said in a statement that it is “evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,” including through potential legal proceedings.

The order marks the second time the Trump administration has tried to block development of an offshore wind project. In April, the Department of the Interior issued a stop work order for Empire Wind located offshore of New York, though in that case construction was just beginning. The halt was then lifted in May and development has since resumed.

Elected officials in southern New England, including the governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut, slammed the Trump administration’s move and said they would fight to reverse the order.

“Stopping this work just before the finish line—that is an attack on our economy,” said Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee. The project was supporting over 1,000 union jobs and nearly $1.3 billion in investment in the state.

It was also expected to provide a critical source of reliable and affordable power at a time of rising electricity demand. Blocking it will likely lead to rising electricity prices for consumers and greater risks of supply shortages and interruptions to the power grid. “Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” ISO New England, the region’s grid operator, said in a statement.

Without offshore wind, states in the region will have an even more difficult time meeting their statutory greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, slowing progress in the fight against climate change. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha warned that if Revolution Wind is stopped, the state’s signature climate law mandating 45 percent emissions reductions by 2030 is “dead in the water.”

President Trump, who dismisses climate science and has called climate change a hoax, launched a full-scale assault on renewable energy starting on his first day back in office in January. He declared a national energy emergency that deliberately excluded solar and wind. He also issued a day-one executive order temporarily halting all onshore and offshore wind project permitting.

“Solar is the way of the future, as is wind, and they are both now competitive if not outcompeting fossil fuels [on a cost basis]. The only way that dying industry can stay alive is by having unfair advantages, and the Trump administration appears willing to be the avenue by which it gets those advantages.”

In July, the Department of the Interior announced a memorandum increasing federal review processes and adding more red tape to assessments of solar and wind projects. “This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest-growing sources of electric power,” Jason Grumet, CEO of American Clean Power Association, a clean energy trade group, said in response. The DOI also announced an order ending the so-called preferential treatment for these energy sources, which includes a directive for the Trump administration to consider revoking permits for already-approved solar and wind projects that are facing legal challenges.

Daly said it is “entirely unprecedented” for the federal government to try to revoke authorizations or block already-permitted projects, mainly because it is so brazenly unlawful. Yanking back permits risks creating regulatory instability and chaos that could threaten all kinds of development, she explained. The move to try to stymie the completion of Revolution Wind, Daly said, is solely “meant to serve fossil fuel companies” that supported Trump’s presidential bid to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.

“Solar is the way of the future, as is wind, and they are both now competitive if not outcompeting fossil fuels [on a cost basis],” Daly told Sierra. “The only way that dying industry can stay alive is by having unfair advantages, and the Trump administration appears willing to be the avenue by which it gets those advantages.”

The Trump administration is reportedly planning on attempting to block yet another offshore wind project—the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, which was approved by the Biden administration in December.

Just weeks ago, the DOI announced it was canceling authorization of the Lava Ridge onshore wind project in southern Idaho, which was also approved last December. On the same day it made that announcement, August 6, the agency announced its completion of an expedited environmental review for a major Utah coal project.

“All of these actions are making it clear that there is not an energy emergency. There’s a fossil fuel emergency for the people who make billions of dollars off the destruction of communities and the planet.”

In addition to ramping up and expediting fossil fuel leasing, the administration is also forcing coal plants that were scheduled to shut down to remain operating. The Department of Energy has now issued several emergency orders to keep uneconomic and polluting coal-fired power plants online. Those orders come at the same time the administration is actively trying to shut down solar and wind, which have become the cheapest sources of electric power.

On Friday the Department of Transportation announced it would be canceling $679 million in federal funding supporting the development of 12 offshore wind projects. In a press release, the DOT referred to these wind projects as “doomed.”

“All of these actions are making it clear that there is not an energy emergency. There’s a fossil fuel emergency for the people who make billions of dollars off the destruction of communities and the planet,” Patrick Drupp, director of climate policy for the Sierra Club, told Sierra. “It’s only going to harm Americans, both with their health and their pocketbooks.”

The moves by the Trump administration to obstruct renewables and bolster fossil fuels come at a time when the planet is facing a climate emergency, scientists warn. The 10 hottest years in recorded history have all occurred in the last decade, with 2024 registering as the hottest year yet and the first full year in which global average temperatures exceeded 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. It is very likely that the 1.5° temperature mark will continue to be breached over the next five years, the World Meteorological Association reported in May. Scientists have warned that exceeding 1.5°C risks unleashing even more devastating—and potentially irreversible—climate change impacts and that every increment of warming avoided matters in terms of mitigating the societal and ecological harms.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-31 08:59:40.103196

Xcel Energy, a major utility company, has been at the forefront of this transition, converting coal plants into gas-fired and renewable energy facilities.
The shift to natural gas is also being accelerated by developments in the Appalachian region, where EQT Corporation is playing a key role.
The Trump administration’s pro-coal stance has temporarily extended the operational lifespans of some retiring coal plants, such as Maryland’s Brandon Shores and Michigan’s J.H.
Meanwhile, coal industry groups have shifted their messaging from “clean coal” to more generic branding, reflecting the industry’s diminishing influence as renewables and gas gain traction.","The AI data center boom is prompting a resurgence in the repurposing of retired coal plants across the United States, as developers and utilities convert these aging facilities into hubs for renewable and natural gas-powered energy generation. With electricity demand projected to surge by up to 60% through 2050 to support AI infrastructure, the race to repower these plants is intensifying due to their preexisting grid interconnections, which allow for faster deployment than new projects. This trend is being driven by the need for speed and reliability in energy supply, as highlighted by Enverus senior analyst Carson Kearl: “Our grid isn’t short on opportunity — it’s short on time” [1].

Coal has played a dominant role in U.S. electricity generation for decades, but its share has steadily declined from over 50% in 2005 to just 16% today, largely due to the rise of shale gas and renewables. Despite this decline, coal still accounts for more than half of the nation's electricity-related carbon emissions. Converting coal plants to natural gas is seen as a key transition strategy, offering a 60% reduction in emissions compared to coal. Enverus estimates that at least 70 gigawatts of retired coal capacity—enough to power 50 million homes—can be repurposed into cleaner energy sources [1].

Xcel Energy, a major utility company, has been at the forefront of this transition, converting coal plants into gas-fired and renewable energy facilities. For instance, the company is repowering the Harrington coal plant in Texas to gas-fired generation and is also developing new wind and solar projects in the region. In Minnesota, Xcel is decommissioning the Sherburne County coal plant and replacing it with a mix of solar, wind, and battery storage, including a 100-hour battery system from Form Energy. These projects align with the broader goal of supporting data center growth, with Xcel and Meta already collaborating on a joint initiative [1].

The shift to natural gas is also being accelerated by developments in the Appalachian region, where EQT Corporation is playing a key role. The company is supplying natural gas to projects such as the Homer City Energy Campus and the Shippingport Power Station, both of which are being repurposed from former coal facilities. EQT's CEO, Toby Rice, emphasized the significance of the Mountain Valley Pipeline in enabling the AI power boom by transporting gas from the Marcellus Shale to markets in the Southeast and beyond [2]. This infrastructure is critical for meeting the rising energy demands from data centers and other AI-driven operations.

While renewable energy remains the long-term objective, current regulatory and policy uncertainties—such as the expiration of wind and solar tax credits after 2027—have led to an increased reliance on natural gas as a “bridge fuel.” Companies like Xcel Energy are leveraging this interim period to build scalable and flexible energy solutions. However, the industry also anticipates a future where new nuclear and geothermal facilities can contribute to the grid, albeit with longer lead times. In the meantime, gas-powered projects, combined with battery storage and hydrogen blends, offer a pragmatic solution to meet the urgent energy needs of the AI era [1].

The Trump administration’s pro-coal stance has temporarily extended the operational lifespans of some retiring coal plants, such as Maryland’s Brandon Shores and Michigan’s J.H. Campbell facilities. These extensions are not seen as permanent but rather as short-term adjustments to support the transition period. Meanwhile, coal industry groups have shifted their messaging from “clean coal” to more generic branding, reflecting the industry’s diminishing influence as renewables and gas gain traction. Despite this, coal companies are adapting by focusing on gas production and decarbonization efforts, including carbon capture and storage, to remain relevant in the evolving energy landscape [1].

“Data centers, especially in the Appalachian basin, are going to be a huge demand on natural gas,” Hutson said.","Switching to wind, solar, gas, nuclear, and more

Most new power construction in the U.S. is currently concentrated on solar, wind, and accompanying battery energy storage, but the Trump administration’s war on renewables—just when the country needs more power—means wind and solar tax credits expire after 2027.

The clean energy projects underway largely will get built—some utilizing coal interconnections—but much more coal-to-gas switching will occur to meet the needs of AI, especially in gas-rich regions such as Pennsylvania, Texas, and Colorado.

“We as an industry are racing to meet the needs of this new critical national security asset,” Frenzel said of the AI boom. “We’re excited about the opportunity, but it’s going to take an all-hands approach to get it done.

“After [renewable tax credits expire], we as a country must commercialize other assets. Gas is a great bridge fuel, and we’re going to continue to use a lot of gas,” Frenzel added.

In the 2030s, new nuclear and geothermal power facilities will come online, he said, but those generation sources require more development time and permitting hurdles.

In Sherburne County, Minnesota, Xcel is retiring its legacy coal plant, taking the first unit offline last year and fully closing it by 2030. In its place, Xcel is developing an array of solar, wind, and battery power. The project includes the longest-duration battery storage in the country, a 100-hour battery system developed by Form Energy. The goal is to power a data center hub there, Frenzel said. Xcel and Meta are working together on a Minnesota project. Amazon also recently bought adjacent land, although its plans are currently paused.

In the Texas Panhandle, Xcel just converted its Harrington coal plant to gas-fired power. Up next, is the nearby Tolk coal facility also slated for a switch to gas. Xcel plans to build about 2 gigawatts of new wind and solar power in the area to meet oil and gas industry electrification needs, as well as for the transformation of a crypto mining site into a data center complex, Frenzel said.

Likewise, Xcel is almost finished converting its Pawnee coal plant in Colorado to gas-fired power. Xcel’s Hayden coal plant in Colorado is slated for closure in 2028, and geothermal power is under consideration for that site. Xcel is working with data center developer QTS in the state.

In a more unique twist on coal-to-gas switching, the Intermountain coal plant in Utah is switching to gas, but it’s also utilizing a green hydrogen blend with the gas to make it burn cleaner. And some coal-to-gas involves using battery storage as well. The AES Petersburg coal plant in Indiana is switching to a gas-fired and battery storage combo complex.

Elsewhere in the country, even coal-to-nuclear plans are underway. Bill Gates’ TerraPower is developing a next-generation nuclear plant slated to open by 2030 on an expedited schedule—in a partnership with Sabey Data Centers—utilizing the interconnections of the Naughton coal and gas plant, which will start closing next year.

Still, even as coal plant retirements were moved up in recent years, some are being pushed backwards again toward their original closure dates now that the grid is being strained and the Trump administration is championing coal power.

For instance, Maryland’s last coal plant, Brandon Shores, was slated to close this year, but will now stay up until 2029 as a power bridge for the AI boom. Likewise, the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan was extended from its May closure date until at least November.

The Trump administration’s orders to keep “beautiful clean coal” alive are only temporary. The plants are still going to close; they just received stays on their execution dates.

The “clean coal” phrasing was part of a lobbying and marketing push for more modernized—and less dirty—coal plants about 15 years ago, but the language has largely disappeared outside of the White House as coal continues to be replaced by renewables and cleaner, cheaper gas.

The coal lobbying group, Americans for Balanced Energy Choices, rebranded in 2008 as the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. They gave up on that in 2019, changing to the more succinct and generically named America’s Power. Since then, utilities and railroads have left the group, leaving its membership only to coal companies.

Big Appalachian gas opportunity

In July, about 85 miles west of Homer City in Pennsylvania, it was announced by the project’s developers that the old Bruce Mansfield coal plant, padlocked in 2019, would be converted to gas-fired power as the new Shippingport Power Station to help fuel the AI revolution.

That same day, the developers also publicized the largest natural gas producer in the Appalachia region, EQT, would supply both the Shippingport and Homer City projects with a combined 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of gas supplies.

“Just to put this in perspective, that’s enough natural gas to power two of New York City. Scale matters,” EQT CEO Toby Rice told Fortune. “Homer City and Shippingport are just the first steps of multiple steps in multiple projects, because I do believe that cluster effect is real. They already have connections to the grid, which is a huge fast pass.”

EQT is ready to help lead an AI tech boom in Pennsylvania and the broader Appalachia region with the advantage that it’s home to the largest natural gas field in the country, the Marcellus Shale. And EQT has its own pipeline business to connect directly to data centers as needed.

Rice is leading the charge to make natural gas as clean as possible, through improved technology and upcoming carbon capture and storage projects. It incudes a marketing push—after all, “natural gas” sounds much nicer than “methane.” “People need to understand the natural gas decarbonization train has not slowed down,” he said.

Rusty Hutson, the CEO of gas producer Diversified Energy agrees. Methane is the product, he said, and the producers don’t want to waste the gas in emissions. “We want to sell it. At the end of the day, going through a pipeline and going through a meter is much more beneficial to us than any emissions are,” Hutson told Fortune.

While EQT will focus on drilling new wells to feed the AI beast, Diversified operates more mature gas wells that are often unwanted by the biggest players.

“Data centers, especially in the Appalachian basin, are going to be a huge demand on natural gas,” Hutson said. “We can’t afford to lose any production because other companies are focused on the drill bit and not really on existing wells and existing operations. That’s where we come in to maintain and produce those wells in an efficient manner to keep them in production for longer.”

As Rice and Hutson argued, the trend is much bigger though than an Appalachia story. Enverus’ Kearl said the AI race may very well be won or lost based on how rapidly old coal plants can be repowered to other generation sources nationwide.

“Repowering isn’t just a cost play—it’s a political and logistical shortcut to growing 24/7, low-carbon power,” Kearl said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/j3MZc_def9wzTTG7HO7mGw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/82b3da3501aba17615f78c6d995d0d77,N,,2025-08-31 08:59:46.786703

It did so against the wishes of state officials who resented the federal effort to address nitrate pollution in drinking water.

State regulators had already deployed their strongest platitudes to address the problem. Hit the bricks, federales.

So, after Iowa regulators delisted seven river segments from our lengthy tally of impaired waters in 2024, the EPA stepped in to put them back on the list due to high nitrate concentrations. The segments included the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers which supply drinking water to Des Moines, the Cedar River north of Cedar Rapids and the Iowa River near Iowa City.

The nerve of these federal bureaucrats, telling Iowa its water is dirty and unsafe. Iowa Department of Natural Resources Director Kayla Lyon complained the EPA was holding Iowa to “a very high standard.” I mean, it’s only drinking water.

But in July, the EPA, now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump Enterprise, told Iowa they can remove the segments from the impaired waters list. This, even after high nitrate levels forced Des Moines to order water usage limits to help its nitrate removal system clean up contaminated water before it reached the taps of 600,000 people.

So, the EPA is no longer here to help. Thankfully, we’ve still got Congress.

But Republicans who control the U.S. House are trying to make changes that would weaken the Clean Water Act. The bill is called the PERMIT Act, Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today. Stop them before they acronym again.

The legislation cleared a House committee and could be debated on the House floor as early as next week.

That would be perfect timing. Just after Iowans are advised over the holiday weekend to avoid swimming at several state park beaches by the DNR.

“This is all weakening amendments to the federal Clean Water Act, and it really isn't what people want. People actually want clean safe water. The President said that that's what he wanted, clean safe water,” said Nancy Stoner a senior attorney with the Environmental Law & Policy Center.

“They don't want more toxins in their water. They don't want more pesticides, they don't want more sewage, they don't want more, you know, heavy metals. They don't want any of that, and they didn't vote for that. And yet, that's what Congress is considering, Stoner said.

The legislation would slash protections for ephemeral streams and wetlands, which can help filter and hold back runoff during periods of heavy precipitation. Climate change is spawning more of those. But there would be no penalty for burying them so the land can be developed or farmed.

The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers would have the unrestricted power to remove any body of water from federal protection. They don’t have to tell the public why they’ve been removed. What could go wrong?

Under the bill, according to a summary from the group Beyond Pesticides, the EPA would have to consider the cost of pollution cleanup, so “safe water” might just be too expensive to mitigate. It would also curtail the EPA’s ability to update pollution standards based on the newest technology.

States and Tribes would lose the authority to review the local effects of federal projects, including dams and pipelines.

General pollution permit rules would exempt pesticides, agricultural runoff and fire suppression chemicals from accountability. There also would be no penalty or liability for failing to report pollution discharges. That includes contamination by PFAS, or “forever chemicals.” The public, apparently, doesn’t need to know.

Also, the Endangered Species Act will no longer be considered in the permitting process.

So, it’s quite a bill. And it’s got a list of supporters longer than an impaired stream, according to a list prepared by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

It includes the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Cattleman’s Beef Association, National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, National Milk Producers Federation, National Pork Producers Council, National Turkey Federation, United Egg Producers and the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.

Don’t forget the American Cement Association, National Asphalt Pavement Association and the Associated General Contractors of America. The road builders are backing the bill, as is the American Mosquito Control Association.

The Fertilizer Institute supports the bill along with something called Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment.

You’ll be surprised to hear supporters argue the bill “cuts red tape, streamlines reviews, and provides greater regulatory certainty” under Clean Water Act permitting processes. Oh, and the ‘reforms” are common sense. They always are.

The Environmental Law and Policy Center sees the bill differently.

“The PERMIT Act poses genuine threats to human health by creating a system that makes it easier for polluters to discharge forever chemicals, pesticides, and toxic pollutants into the waters Americans use for drinking, fishing, and recreation,” the group contends.

Fourteen Iowa groups sent a letter to members of Iowa’s House delegation urging them to vote against the bill, including the Environmental Law & Policy Center, Food & Water Watch, Iowa Alliance for Responsible Agriculture, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, Iowa Environmental Council, Iowa Faith and Climate Network, the Iowa Groundwater Association and the Iowa Wildlife Federation.

It’s likely my congresswoman, Ashley Hinson, will back the bill, along with the entire Republican delegation. It was Hinson who warned the EPA would inspect farm puddles if the agency expanded the list of Waters of the U.S. under federal protection. The puddle police were a figment of her imagination.

They’ll also try convincing Iowans how this power grab strengthens the Clean Water Act. Who are you going to believe, a member of Congress or radical socialist water drinkers?

Don’t believe them. We should urge Hinson and others to oppose the bill. But more importantly, we need to make sure our delegation understands we know what they’re doing. And we will be holding them accountable.

So, we’ll get no help from the EPA, and our state government bowed to the polluters years ago. But Iowans are starting to get the picture, and they’re not pleased. They also suspect nitrate pollution has something to do with Iowa’s high and growing cancer rate.

We have some of the dirtiest surface water in the nation. There’s plenty of bipartisan blame to go around. Common sense is now far less sensible and hardly common under a president who cares as much about the environment as he cares about truth. Iowa Republicans have pledged undying allegiance to our dear leader.

We live on the banks of an endless river impaired by greed, pollution and lies. It truly is our golden age.

Just days before Labor Day, a holiday designed to celebrate the importance and power of American workers in the United States, the Transportation Department cancelled $679 million in funding for offshore wind projects, and the Department of Energy announced it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee to complete infrastructure for an offshore wind project in New Jersey.

These cancellations reflect President Donald J. Trump’s apparent determination to kill off wind and solar power initiatives and to force the United States to depend on fossil fuels. He refers to climate change as a “hoax,” says that windmills cause cancer, and falsely claims that renewable energy is more expensive than other ways to generate power. Former president Joe Biden made investing in clean energy a central pillar of his administration; Trump often seems to construct policies mostly to erase the legacies of his predecessors.

Reversing the shift toward renewable energy not only attacks attempts to address the crisis of climate change and boosts the fossil fuel industry on which some of Trump’s apparent allies depend, but also undermines a society based on the independence of American workers. In 2023, about 3.5 million Americans worked in jobs related to the renewable energy sector, and jobs in that sector grew at more than twice the rate of those in other sectors in what was a strong U.S. labor market. The production of coal, which Trump often points to as an ideal for American jobs, peaked in 2008. Between then and 2021, employment in coal mining fell by almost 60% in the East and almost 40% in the West, leaving a total of about 40,000 employees.

Another cut last week sums up the repercussions of the administration’s attack on renewable energy. On August 22 the Interior Department suddenly and without explanation stopped construction of a wind farm off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island that was 80% complete and was set to be finished early next year. As Matthew Daly of the Associated Press noted yesterday, Revolution Wind was the region’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm. It was designed to power more than 350,000 homes, provide jobs in Connecticut and Rhode Island, and enable Rhode Island to meet its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2033.

The Board of Directors of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut expressed their dismay at the decision, noting that Revolution Wind employed more than 1,000 local union workers and is part of a $20 billion investment in “American energy generation, port infrastructure, supply chain, and domestic shipbuilding and manufacturing across over 40 states” by Ørsted, a Danish multinational company.

“Stopping this fully permitted, important project without a clear stated reason not only seriously undermines the state’s efforts to work towards a carbon neutral energy supply but equally important it sends a message to investors from all over the world that they may want to rethink investing in America. The message resulting from the President’s action is a lack of trust, uncertainty, and lack of predictability,” they wrote.

Connecticut governor Ned Lamont and Rhode Island governor Dan McKee, both Democrats, are working together to save the project. In a statement, Lamont said: “We are working closely with Rhode Island to save this project because it represents exactly the kind of investment that reduces energy costs, strengthens regional production, and builds a more secure energy future—the very goals President Trump claims to support but undermines with this decision.”

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” McKee said. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

The Trump administration launched this attack on renewable energy at a time when electricity prices are bouncing upward. According to Ari Natter and Naureen S. Malik of Bloomberg, electricity prices jumped about 10% between January and May and are projected to rise another 5.8% next year. Trump has tried to blame those rising costs on renewable energy, but in the country’s largest grid, which stretches from Virginia to Illinois, nearly all the electricity comes from natural gas, coal, and nuclear reactors.

More to the point is that the region also has the world’s highest concentration of AI data centers, driving power demand—and costs—upward. At the same time, according to Natter and Malik, the infrastructure for transmission is too outdated to handle the amounts of electricity the data centers will need.

Trump’s cuts are adding stress to this already overburdened system. Over the next decade, they are projected to reduce additions to the electric grid by half compared to projections from before his cuts. In July, Ella Nilsen of CNN reported that cuts to renewable power generation, as well as to the tax credits that encouraged the development of more renewable power projects, are exacerbating the electrical shortage and driving prices up.

The Trump administration claims that relying on fossil fuels will jump-start the economy, but higher costs for electricity are already fueling inflation, and in the longer term, more expensive power will slow economic growth. In contrast, China has leaped ahead to dominate the global clean energy industry. Cheaper electricity there is expected to make it more attractive for future investment.

Renewable energy is crucial to addressing the existential crisis of climate change, but as former president Joe Biden emphasized, developing the sector was also key for building a strong middle class. Well-paying jobs, in turn, help to protect democracy.

Historically, a system in which local economies support small businesses and entrepreneurs promotes a wide distribution of political power. In contrast, extractive industries support a system that concentrates wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals. The extractive systems in the pre–Civil War American South, where cotton concentrated power and wealth, and later in the American West, where mining, cattle, and agribusiness did the same, nurtured political systems in which a few men controlled their regions.

As president of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO Chrissy Lynch said in July after the Republicans passed the budget reconciliation bill cutting clean energy tax credits: “Working families shouldn’t have to purchase energy from billionaire oil tycoons and foreign governments or let them set the price of our energy bills.”

Her observation hit home earlier this week, when Joe Wallace, Costas Paris, Alex Leary, and Collin Eaton of the Wall Street Journal reported that the comments of Russian president Vladimir Putin and Trump at their meeting in Alaska on August 15 in which they talked about doing more business together were not vague goodwill. ExxonMobil and Russia’s biggest energy company, Rosneft, have been in secret talks to resume a partnership to extract Russian oil, including in the Arctic, that had been severed by Russia’s attack on Ukraine in 2022.",,N,,2025-08-31 13:02:27.749522

According to EY, 70% of businesses will prioritise electrification, energy costs and emissions within the next three years.
“Successfully navigating accelerating business energy growth will drive energy prosperity and define the economic and energy transition winners of tomorrow,” says Greg Guthridge, EY Global Industrials & Energy Customer Experience Transformation Leader, in EY’s report.
“Progress is slow because of barriers including the high cost of financing, complex regulations and challenges working with energy providers,” says EY.
Tailored partnerships and smarter solutions could enable this underserved group to actively participate in the energy transition.","Global electricity demand is forecast to double by 2050, with businesses expected to account for around 75% of this growth.

This surge is driven by factors such as the expansion of data centres, increased electrification, onshoring of manufacturing and large-scale investments in emerging technologies.

EY’s latest research asks how this growing demand can fuel long-term prosperity and what shape the business energy transition will take.

EY’s Navigating the Energy Transition research programme spans five years and includes insights from nearly 100,000 residential consumers and more than 2,400 energy leaders and decision makers from medium to large businesses.

Electrification ambitions and rising expectations

The study covers eight countries across various stages of energy transition and renewables deployment.

The findings highlight growing ambition.

According to EY, 70% of businesses will prioritise electrification, energy costs and emissions within the next three years.

However, most say that traditional account management is no longer enough.

EY’s data reveals that 71% of businesses now have energy strategies but many are waiting to collaborate with energy specialists to execute them.

Businesses are increasingly willing to pay more for rapid access to renewable energy, particularly through on-site generation and battery storage.

Around 70% of those surveyed plan to invest in both areas within the next three years.

The shift in expectations is also evident in the way businesses view their relationship with energy providers.

Customised services, transition support and digital tools are in high demand, especially as energy consumption becomes more central to operations.

“Successfully navigating accelerating business energy growth will drive energy prosperity and define the economic and energy transition winners of tomorrow,” says Greg Guthridge, EY Global Industrials & Energy Customer Experience Transformation Leader, in EY’s report.

The report also outlines the complexity of today’s business energy needs. For mid-sized firms in particular, the energy landscape is difficult to navigate without targeted support.

Addressing the “neglected middle” of the business energy transition

Mid-sized businesses, which form a large portion of employment and GDP, express similar energy ambitions to their larger counterparts but often lack the confidence and capability to act.

EY’s data shows they are 20% less likely to have clear energy plans in place.

More than two-thirds of these businesses are exploring options including on-site renewables, battery storage, demand response, electrification of equipment and EVs.

However, progress is limited by challenges around financing, regulation and insufficient engagement from energy providers.

“Progress is slow because of barriers including the high cost of financing, complex regulations and challenges working with energy providers,” says EY.

This presents a growth opportunity for providers willing to offer sector-specific services and support.

Tailored partnerships and smarter solutions could enable this underserved group to actively participate in the energy transition.

Data centres and digital tech

Digital infrastructure is emerging as a core force behind demand.

The acceleration of generative AI development, alongside ongoing electrification, is pushing electricity consumption to levels not seen in decades.

EY finds that 71% of businesses want artificial intelligence to support energy decision-making, including advice and insights on deploying smarter systems.

This reflects a broader appetite for digital platforms that provide real-time control, automated reporting and optimisation.

“Data centres are multiplying, electrification is accelerating and manufacturing is ramping up, all driving electricity demand to levels not seen in decades,” says Greg.

“Rising energy demand and infrastructure investments are impacting affordability and raising important questions about who should pay for it.”

Examples of smarter systems in action include AES, a US utility operating in 15 countries.

AES works with Siemens to run Fluence, an industrial-scale battery storage company.

It also invests in Uplight, a cloud-based energy platform for residential and business customers.

Sign up for their newsletter here.

Since 2022, Republican lawmakers in Congress and state attorneys general have sent letters to major banks, pension funds, asset managers, accounting firms, companies, nonprofits, and business alliances, putting them on notice for potential antitrust violations and seeking information as part of the Republican pushback against “environmental, social and governance” efforts such as corporate climate commitments.

“This caused a lot of turmoil and stress obviously across the whole ecosystem,” said Denise Hearn, a senior fellow at the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. “But everyone wondered, ‘OK, when are they actually going to drop a lawsuit?’”

That came in November, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other Republican AGs, accusing three of the biggest asset managers on Wall Street—BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street—of running “an investment cartel” to depress the output of coal and boosting their revenues while pushing up energy costs for Americans. The Trump administration’s Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission filed a supporting brief in May.

The overall pressure campaign aimed at what’s known as “ESG” is having an impact.

“Over the past several months, through this [lawsuit] and other things, letters from elected officials, state and federal, there has been a chilling effect of what investors are saying,” said Steven Maze Rothstein, chief program officer of Ceres, a nonprofit that advocates for more sustainable business practices and was among the earliest letter recipients. Still, “investors understand that Mother Nature doesn’t know who’s elected governor, attorney general, president.”

Earlier this month, a US District Court judge in Tyler, Texas, declined to dismiss the lawsuit against the three asset managers, though he did dismiss three of the 21 counts. The judge was not making a final decision in the case, only that there was enough evidence to go to trial.

BlackRock said in a statement: “This case is not supported by the facts, and we will demonstrate that.” Vanguard said it will “vigorously defend against plaintiffs’ claims.” State Street called the lawsuit “baseless and without merit.”

The Texas attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

The three asset managers built substantial stakes in major US coal producers, the suit alleges, and “announced their common commitment” to cut US coal output by joining voluntary alliances to collaborate on climate issues, including the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and, in the case of two of the firms, the Climate Action 100+. (All of them later pulled out of the alliances.)

The lawsuit alleges that the coal companies succumbed to the defendants’ collective influence, mining for less coal and disclosing more climate-related information. The suit claimed that resulted in “cartel-level revenues and profits” for the asset managers.

“You could say, ‘Well, if the coal companies were all colluding together to restrict output, then shouldn’t they also be violating antitrust?’” Hearn asked. But the attorneys general “are trying to say that it was at the behest of these concentrated index funds and the concentrated ownership.”

Index funds, which are designed to mirror the returns of specific market indices, are the most common mode of passive investment—when investors park their money somewhere for long-term returns.

The case is being watched closely, not only by climate alliances and sustainability nonprofits, but by the financial sector at large.

If the three asset managers ultimately win, it would turn down the heat on other climate alliances and vindicate those who pressured financial players to line up their business practices with the Paris agreement goals as well as national and local climate targets. The logic of those efforts: Companies in the financial sector have a big impact on climate change, for good or ill—and climate change has a big impact on those same companies.

If the red states instead win on all counts, that “could essentially totally reconstitute the industry as we understand it,” said Hearn, who has co-authored a paper on the lawsuit. At stake is how the US does passive investing.

The pro-free-market editorial board of The Wall Street Journal in June called the Texas-led lawsuit “misconceived,” its logic “strained” and its theories “bizarre.”

The case breaks ground on two fronts. It challenges collaboration between financial players on climate action. It also makes novel claims around “common ownership,” where a shareholder—in this case, an asset manager—holds stakes in competing firms within the same sector.

“Regardless of how the chips fall in the case, those two things will absolutely be precedent-setting,” Hearn said.

Even though this is the first legal test of the theory that business climate alliances are anti-competitive, the question was asked in a study by Harvard Business School economists that came out in May. That study, which empirically examines 11 major climate alliances and 424 listed financial institutions over 10 years, turned up no evidence of traditional antitrust violations. The study was broad and did not look at particular allegations against specific firms.

“To the extent that there are valid legal arguments that can be made, they have to be tested,” said study co-author Peter Tufano, a Harvard Business School professor, noting that his research casts doubt on many of the allegations made by critics of these alliances.

Financial firms that joined climate alliances were more likely to adopt emissions targets and climate-aligned management practices, cut their own emissions and engage in pro-climate lobbying, the study found.

”The range of [legal] arguments that are made, and the passion with which they’re being advanced, suggests that these alliances must be doing something meaningful,” said Tufano, who was previously the dean of the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford.

Meanwhile, most of the world is moving the other way.

According to a tally by CarbonCloud, a carbon emissions accounting platform that serves the food industry, at least 35 countries that make up more than half of the world’s gross domestic product now mandate climate-related disclosures of some kind.

In the US, California, which on its own would be the world’s fourth-largest economy, will begin requiring big businesses to measure and report their direct and indirect emissions next year.

Ceres’ Rothstein notes that good data about companies is necessary for informed investment decisions. “Throughout the world,” he said, “there’s greater recognition and, to be honest, less debate about the importance of climate information.” Ceres is one of the founders of Climate Action 100+, which now counts more than 600 investor members around the world, including Europe, Asia, and Australia.

For companies that operate globally, the American political landscape is in sharp contrast with other major economies, Tufano said, creating “this whipsawed environment where if you get on a plane, a few hours later, you’re in a jurisdiction that’s saying exactly the opposite thing.”

But even as companies and financial institutions publicly retreat from their climate commitments amid US political pressure, in a phenomenon called “greenhushing,” their decisions remain driven by the bottom line. “Banks are going to do what they’re going to do, and they’re going to lend to the most profitable or to the most growth-oriented industries,” Hearn said, “and right now, that’s not the fossil fuel industry.”",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wall-street-1152x648.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 05:59:34.061489

This frozen spot, fondly referred to as “The Great Land,” hides a colossal mine that could be the global heart of none other than hydrogen. The Great Land’s official state flower is the “Forget-Me-Not,” and we can without a doubt confirm that it will never be forgotten after this major discovery, as it could potentially change the future of the renewable energy industry forever. Earth’s future is suddenly looking a whole lot brighter.

The importance of hydrogen in the renewable energy industry

We have been relying on carbon-heavy sectors for as long as time can tell. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, within the United States, the primary carbon-heavy sectors are:

Manufacturing, mining, and construction industries

Power and heat production

Transportation

Agriculture

Waste management

These sectors are culprits of extreme carbon emissions and are great contributors to climate change. If these sectors do not become decarbonized soon, achieving the global mission of net-zero will be near impossible, and we can start saying goodbye to sustainable development for the ever-increasing global population. This is where hydrogen’s importance in the renewable energy industry comes in.

According to CNBC, not only is hydrogen essential in decarbonizing carbon-heavy sectors, but it also plays a fundamental role in energy storage in these ways:

Power intermittency

Hydrogen can store high amounts of power from renewable sources

Long-term storage

Can store power for extended periods

Grid stabilization

Power plants can utilize stored hydrogen to produce power during peak demands or when renewable output is low

This frozen spot’s colossal mine could be the global hydrogen heart

The frozen spot in America, the Great Land, is none other than Alaska. And its colossal hydrogen mine could change our future. One thing that must always be considered is the type of hydrogen. It is the world’s most mysterious energy source, as it is polluting in one country, and non-polluting in another. According to the company, Granite Creek Copper Ltd., this potential hydrogen reserve is a clean source.

This clean source of hydrogen is called geological hydrogen, also referred to as white hydrogen. According to Metal Tech News, white hydrogen is produced naturally by a process that comprises iron-rich rock formations. Granite Creek and Cornell University have partnered to research the potential of white hydrogen.

“Our team looks forward to this collaboration with Granite Creek on strategies to stimulate geologic hydrogen production, with an emphasis on exploring the ultramafic resources in Alaska.” – Greeshma Gadikota, a Cornell associate professor

Geological hydrogen is the best color of hydrogen

In general, hydrogen is combined with other elements in hydrocarbons, water, and other forms. Splitting hydrogen from natural gas or water usually utilizes vast amounts of energy, is expensive, and results in carbon emissions, which defeats the purpose, as per Metal Tech News. Hydrogen is thus categorized with colors, which represent the respective carbon footprints. White hydrogen is the best type.

Grey hydrogen

Obtained by splitting natural gas for chemicals, fertilizers, and steel. It costs $2 per kg and has a high carbon footprint.

Green hydrogen

Obtained by splitting water molecules with renewables, thus has a low carbon footprint. It costs $7 per kg, making it too expensive for global supply.",https://www.ecoportal.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Depositphotos_2194194_L.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 10:00:55.895380

Samsung SDI has committed to completing the transition by October, with mass production planned for later this year.

Highlights at the expo include the new models of its power grid ESS solution, the Samsung Battery Box 1.7 and SBB 2.0. The SBB is an all-in-one ESS solution housed in a 20-foot container containing battery cells, modules and racks ready for direct connection to the grid. Both new models contain batteries produced in the US, making them eligible for tax incentives available to US clients under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Showcased for the first time at the exhibition, the SBB 1.7 delivers approximately 17 percent higher energy density compared to its predecessor, the nickel-cobalt-aluminum-based SBB 1.5. Meanwhile, the prototype of the SBB 2.0, showcased here for the first time ever, features more cost-effective lithium iron phosphate battery cells.

Both SBB models incorporate Samsung SDI’s enhanced safety technology through Enhanced Direct Injection impregnation fire prevention, which sprays fire-extinguishing agents directly onto battery modules to prevent thermal propagation between cells.

In addition, Samsung SDI plans to display other innovative ESS products and technologies, including a new uninterruptible power supply product that won an innovation award at The Smarter E Europe 2025, Europe’s largest energy exhibition held in Munich last May, along with its advanced thermal propagation suppression safety technology.

A Samsung SDI spokesperson stated, “We will unveil locally tailored ESS battery products and innovative technologies for the rapidly growing US market. With high-performance and highly efficient ESS batteries, we will accelerate our penetration of the US market.”

The federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, is set to expire on September 30, 2025. For buyers on the fence about going electric, this is the final boarding call. The tax credit has been a lifeline for making electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable. But once it’s gone? Prices will rise, and the total cost of ownership will shift dramatically.

Chevrolet Leads the Charge

Mercury Insurance, a leading auto insurer in California, just dropped its annual list of the most affordable EVs to insure. And guess who’s at the top? Chevrolet. The Blazer EV and Equinox EV take the first two spots, making them the most budget-friendly EVs to insure in 2025.

Why does this matter? Insurance is a major factor in the total cost of owning an EV. While EVs are often cheaper to operate (think lower fuel and maintenance costs), their insurance premiums can be a dealbreaker. EVs cost, on average, 49% more to insure than gas-powered cars. But Chevrolet’s models buck the trend. The Blazer EV, for instance, costs about $2,765 annually to insure, saving drivers $312 compared to the national average for SUVs.

Mercury’s Top 10 List

This year marks the 10th anniversary of Mercury’s list, and it’s more relevant than ever. With federal tax credits on the chopping block, budget-conscious buyers need every edge they can get. Here’s the full list of the most affordable EVs to insure for 2025 and 2026:

Chevrolet Blazer EV

Chevrolet Equinox EV

Nissan Leaf

Kia Niro EV

Ford F-150 Lightning

Hyundai Kona EV

MINI Cooper SE

Hyundai IONIQ EVs (all models)

Fiat 500e

Subaru Solterra/Toyota bZ4X

Chong Gao, Director of Product Management R&D at Mercury Insurance, emphasized the importance of this year’s list: “With federal EV tax credits set to expire in the near future, now is the time to get into an EV for consumers who are interested in one. These EVs are great choices for consumers who are looking to save on the total cost of car ownership equation.”

Why Are Some EVs Cheaper to Insure?

Not all EVs are created equal when it comes to insurance costs. Factors like repair expenses, safety records, and claims history play a big role. For example, vehicles with expensive, hard-to-replace parts (like Tesla’s falcon-wing doors) drive up premiums. On the flip side, models like the Blazer and Equinox are designed with affordability in mind, making them standout choices for cost-conscious drivers.

The Bigger Picture: What Happens After the Tax Credit Ends?

The EV market is at a critical juncture. Analysts predict a short-term sales surge as buyers rush to claim the tax credit. But after September 30, 2025? A slowdown. Without the tax credit, EVs will become less accessible for many buyers. Dealerships may struggle to move inventory, and some are already offering deep discounts to clear their lots.

But is this the end of the EV revolution? Not at all. Long-term growth is still expected, albeit at a slower pace. Automakers are investing heavily in innovation, rolling out cheaper, more efficient models. And with states like California pushing for zero-emission mandates, EVs are here to stay.

Why Act Now?

If you’re considering an EV, the time to act is now. Lock in the tax credit. Choose a model with low insurance costs—like the Chevy Blazer or Equinox. And don’t forget: even after the credit expires, EVs still offer lower operating costs and environmental benefits.

Final Thoughts

The federal tax credit’s expiration is a turning point for the EV market. It’s a challenge, but also an opportunity for savvy buyers. Chevrolet’s affordable insurance rates, combined with the last chance to claim the tax credit, make this a moment to seize. The future is electric.

Some 200 patients have participated in tango workshops offered over the past 15 years at Ramos Mejia Hospital to study the impact of the dance on the symptoms of this incurable neurodegenerative disease, organizers told AFP.

""One of the main problems of the disease is gait disorder, and the tango, as a walking dance, works on starting and stopping steps, and strategies for walking,"" said neurologist Nelida Garretto.

The results have been encouraging. Many patients find ways to alleviate symptoms such as the motor blocks that ""freeze"" their gait, said neurologist Tomoko Arakaki.

""A patient told us that when she freezes, she tries to do the 'figure eight' -– one of the classic tango steps -- with her feet, and this enables her to get out of the freeze,"" Arakaki added.

Dancing the tango helps build a ""sensory pathway"" that helps with walking, she explained.

""We know that Parkinson's requires pharmaceutical treatments. Tango is used to rehabilitate the motor part. With music, you can get out of complex situations,"" she said.

Beltran, 66 and diagnosed with Parkinson's two years ago, had never danced the tango. She joined the workshop on the advice of doctors.

""If it's to stop the advance, I have to do it, I have to dance for my life,"" she said.

In addition to tremors, stiffness, difficulty with balance and speech problems, Parkinson's leads to social isolation and depression. The tango workshop can help in these areas.

Beltran reported that dancing boosts her stability and her mood. ""Tomorrow I'm sure I'll feel better because today I danced tango,"" she said.

Patients dance with partners not suffering from Parkinson's, and under the guidance of dance therapists like Manuco Firmani, a professional tango dancer who has been involved with Parkinson's rehabilitation since 2011.

Emilia, 86, did not want to give her last name because she is dancing against the wishes of her son, who worries over the two-hour bus trip she takes to reach the studio in central Buenos Aires.

""For me this is the happiness of every Tuesday"" said the retired teacher with a frail, bent body and whispery voice, for whom tango evokes memories of her youth.

""Every year we conduct specific evaluations to analyze the benefits of tango,"" revealed neurologist Sergio Rodriguez. ""We have measured improvements in cognitive skills, motor skills, gait and balance.""

Walking is at the core of the Argentine tango, specialists say. But that's not the only reason it is an effective rehabilitation method for Parkinson's patients.

Tango also requires dancers to follow rhythms, to move in a set direction and to interpret the physical cues of their dance partner.

""There are many simultaneous messages that must be resolved, which is very positive for this disease,"" said Garretto.

At the end of class, there is applause and ""an air of satisfaction"" in the room, remarked dance therapist Laura Segade.

""After all, who can take away what they've danced?""

Britain's energy operator is betting on an age-old technology to future-proof its grid, as the power plants that traditionally helped stabilize it are closed and replaced by renewable energy systems.

Spinning metal devices known as flywheels have for centuries been used to provide inertia -- resistance to sudden changes in motion -- to various machines, from a potter's wheel to the steam engine.

Grid operators are now looking to the technology to add inertia to renewable-heavy electricity systems to prevent blackouts like the one that hit Spain and Portugal this year.

In an electricity grid, inertia is generally provided by large spinning generators found in coal-fired and gas power plants, helping maintain a steady frequency by smoothing fluctuations in supply and demand.

But renewable energy sources like solar and wind power don't add inertia to the grid, and usually cannot help with other issues, such as voltage control.

Flywheels can mimic the rotational inertia of power plant generators, spinning quicker or slower to respond to fluctuations.

Without rotating turbines, ""the system is more prone to fluctuations than it would be otherwise"", explained David Brayshaw, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading in England.

""As we get to ever higher levels of renewables, we're going to have to think about this more carefully,"" Brayshaw told AFP.

Flywheels and batteries

The Iberian Peninsula, which is powered by a high share of renewables, went dark on April 28 after its grid was unable to absorb a sudden surge in voltage and deviations in frequency.

Spain's government has since pointed fingers at conventional power plants for failing to control voltage levels.

It could serve as a wake-up call similar to a 2019 outage which plunged parts of Britain into darkness following a drop in grid frequency.

That blackout prompted UK energy operator NESO to launch what it called a ""world-first"" program to contract grid-stabilizing projects.

Flywheels and batteries can add synthetic inertia to the grid, but engineering professor Keith Pullen says steel flywheels can be more cost-effective and durable than lithium-ion batteries.

""I'm not saying that flywheels are the only technology, but they could be a very, very important one,"" said Pullen, a professor at City St George's, University of London and director of flywheel startup Levistor.

In the coming years, Pullen warned the grid will also become more unstable due to greater, but spikier demand.

With electric cars, heat pumps and energy-guzzling data centers being hooked onto the grid, ""we will have more shock loads... which the flywheel smooths out"".

Carbon-free inertia

Norwegian company Statkraft's ""Greener Grid Park"" in Liverpool was one of the projects contracted by NESO to keep the lights on.

Operational since 2023, it is a stone's throw from a former coal-fired power station site which loomed over the northern English city for most of the 20th century.

But now, instead of steam turbines, two giant flywheels weighing 40 tons (40,000 kilograms) each whirr at the Statkraft site, which supplies one percent of the inertia for the grid needed in England, Scotland and Wales.

Each flywheel is attached to a synchronous compensator, a spinning machine that further boosts inertia and provides voltage control services in the Liverpool region.

""We are providing that inertia without burning any fossil fuels, without creating any carbon emissions,"" said Guy Nicholson, Statkraft's zero-carbon grid solutions head.

According to NESO, 11 other similar synchronous compensator and flywheel projects were operational in Britain as of 2023, with several more contracted.

'Not fast enough'

The government is ""working closely with our industry partners who are developing world-leading technology, including flywheels, static and synchronous compensators, as we overhaul the energy system"", a Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson told AFP.

But, ""we aren't building them fast enough to decarbonize the grid"", warned Nicholson.

Britain aims to power the grid with clean energy 95 percent of the time by 2030, before completely switching to renewables in the next decade.

""At the moment... we can't even do it for one hour,"" said Nicholson.

Even when there is sufficient solar and wind energy being generated, ""we still have to run gas turbines to keep the grid stable"", he explained.

Still, Britain and neighboring Ireland seem to be ahead of the curve in procuring technology to stabilize renewable-heavy grids.

""In GB and Ireland, the system operators are leading by contracting these services,"" Nicholson said. ""On the continent, there hasn't been the same drive for that.""

“I think these things are driven by events. So, the Spanish blackout will drive change.""

For nearly two centuries, the white ferries gliding over the Bosphorus Strait have provided an iconic link for countless passengers travelling between Istanbul's European shores and its Asian side.

Despite the increasingly congested waters and competition from the Turkish megacity's bridges and undersea metro line, the ferries remain very popular.

The main operator Sehir Hatlari carries at least 40 million passengers a year.

""Any view of Istanbul must include Maiden's Tower, a ferry and a seagull,"" smiled Adil Bali, a specialist on the history of Istanbul's ferries, referring to a tiny rocky outcrop at the southern entrance to the Bosphorus.

""It is one of the few cities in the world that can be crossed by sea, so the ferries are indispensable here.""

Their arrival in 1843 transformed the simple fishing villages lining the shores of the Bosphorus into popular holiday destinations where wooden palaces were later built overlooking the water, boosting trade.

Until the first Bosphorus bridge was opened in 1973, the only way to cross between Istanbul's Asian and European sides was by boat -- and today, the experience remains an essential part of the city's charm.

At the helm of the Pasabahce, the flagship of Sehir Hatlari's 30 vessels, Captain Ekrem Ozcelik said the waters had become increasingly crowded.

""There's a lot more traffic on the water,"" he said of the tankers, containers and cargo ships that pass through the strait linking the Black Sea to the Aegean via the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles.

There are also cruise ships and private yachts navigating what is one of the world's busiest waterways, where 41,300 vessels passed in 2024, official figures show -- an average of 113 per day.

""Navigating the waters of Istanbul requires a certain amount of experience,"" Ozcelik said of the strait's powerful currents, whose waters can get particularly tricky when strong southwesterly winds can whip up three-meter (10-foot) high waves.

Born into a family of sailors and fishermen, Ozcelik said his boyhood dream was to one day don the white cap and uniform of a captain.

Now 52, he enjoys the freedom of sailing and the kudos of his profession.

""Being a captain in the heart of Istanbul is a source of great pride.""

And even more so on the Pasabahce, which recently escaped being decommissioned and instead underwent a two-year restoration, returning to the Bosphorus in 2022 on its 70th birthday.

""It's harder to maneuver than the others. It's heavier and turning corners is complicated,"" admitted first officer Semih Aksoy, 36.

But he added he wouldn't change the iconic ferry for the world, with its trademark wooden tables and old-world air of faded luxury.

""This ship has a unique beauty, a special feel to it.""

With its nine-man crew, the Pasabahce mainly sails the 20-minute route between the Asian district of Kadikoy and Besiktas on the European side.

But even that relatively short trip can be tricky, said Burak Temiz, a 24-year-old sailor.

""This summer, people were jumping into the water from Maiden's Tower for hours.

""And then there are the fishing nets,"" he told AFP, adding that the ferry's bows had even been grazed by jet skis in the crowded waters.

All the other ferries have a six-man crew, and dozens more staff work at the city's 53 ports, many of whom are known by regulars.

Ibrahim Bayus, a 62-year-old engineer born on Buyukada, the largest of the nearby Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara, recalls the familiarity of the ferries.

""As a boy, I often forgot to bring money but the captain knew me,"" he smiled.

With the service only suspended for snow, fog or a violent storm, Captain Ozcelik recalls when three students on Buyukada came to beg for his help.

""Traffic had been suspended but they told me if they couldn't take their exams, they would fail the entire year. So I took them to Kadikoy. And they all passed,"" he smiled.

And they still come to visit him.",https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2025-08/1181436_0.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-08-31 09:00:13.526304

Washington (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday fired at least eight employees who signed a letter criticizing the agency’s leadership under Administrator Lee Zeldin and President Donald Trump.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,” an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,” spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees. Officials expect total staffing to go down to about 12,500, a reduction of more than 3,700 employees, or nearly 23%, from staffing levels when Trump took office in January.",https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 03:58:54.211289

And a new study published by the Cox Automotive firm adds a little water to the mill. A few days ago, it published its Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, an indicator based on prices observed at wholesale auctions in the United States. Values ​​that do not directly reflect prices for an individual but constitute a reference for used car professionals, scrutinized in particular for the evolution of residual value. In August, the overall index shows relative stability in used car prices. But the evolution by segment confirms a striking fact: electric cars depreciate faster than hybrids or thermal cars.

One-off rebound in the USA and underlying trend in Europe

While in the study data, electric vehicles recorded a +4.2% increase in value compared to August 2024, compared to only +0.9% for non-electric vehicles, which can be explained by the imminent end of tax credits in the USA, which artificially supported demand. In the long term, the depreciation of electric vehicles is much stronger. And European data confirms this. In July 2025, according to Cox Automotive Europe, electric vehicles less than two years old retained on average only 49% of their new price, compared to 68% for hybrids. For comparison, in 2022, the two technologies still displayed comparable residual values, close to 90%. The gap has therefore widened by around twenty points in just a few years, with the races having separated since January 2023.

The hybrid, a reassuring compromise

Cheaper to buy and more balanced in terms of running costs, hybrids are emerging as a haven in the used vehicle market. For Philip Nothard, Insight Director at Cox Automotive Europe, this resistance can be explained: “Hybrid vehicles offer an alternative and cost-effective solution for buyers concerned about sustainability but still hesitant about the range or infrastructure constraints of electric vehicles.” A trend that is reflected in sales: since the beginning of the year, registrations of plug-in hybrids have increased by 31.5%, and those of conventional hybrids by 6.5%. The Cox Automotive study, whether it covers the United States or Europe, highlights the same phenomenon. Residual value remains the Achilles heel of the electric vehicle and constitutes one of the obstacles to its adoption, while the hybrid is establishing itself as a more reassuring and more sustainable compromise for the used vehicle market.",https://autojosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/new_ev6_autojosh_6jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 03:58:49.715146

Five years since the height of the crisis — with water levels now 6 inches below average — most Michigan communities still allow home construction perilously close to the shore.
The high water crisis forced local leaders to rethink those lax policies, said Herasanna Richards, a legislative associate at the Michigan Municipal League.
But, five years later, only a few of the state’s 387 coastal communities appear to have followed through.","Kathy and Tom Brickley knew erosion would be an immutable part of owning a property on Lake Michigan when they moved into their dream cottage 15 years ago.

For the first decade, the erosion caused by waves wearing away at beaches and dunes in annual cycles was manageable.

Then the water started rising.

Extreme rainfall and reduced evaporation during the 2010s caused the Great Lakes to rise to record-breaking levels by 2020, swallowing up beaches and digging away at the dunes behind them, threatening waterfront homes like the Brickleys’, which is in Berrien County.

“Plenty of sleepless nights,” Tom Brickley recalled while looking out at the water on a recent afternoon.

Back then, dramatic footage of homes tumbling into the water spurred calls to reform state and local policies that leave Michigan residents vulnerable when the waters rise.

Lawmakers gathered testimony, sought federal funding and considered creating a task force to combat coastal erosion. Local governments looked to replace outdated zoning rules that let people build too close to the shore. Experts suggested fixes, from giving property owners an incentive to move their homes farther inland to banning seawalls that ultimately worsen erosion.

But the political will for change seemed to recede with the water.

Five years since the height of the crisis — with water levels now 6 inches below average — most Michigan communities still allow home construction perilously close to the shore. Bills aiming to curb construction on coastal dunes or make it easier for homeowners to protect their homes with temporary barriers have failed to gain traction in the Legislature.

“The reality is that most townships have not implemented coastal erosion plans,” said Mark Breederland, who helps communities implement shoreline protection practices through Michigan Sea Grant.

The end result is that many communities that faced crisis during the last high-water event will be no better protected when the waters inevitably rise again.

“The state knows they’re probably not as prepared as they should be for the next cycle,” Breederland said. “But nobody knows when that will be, or how severe it will be.”

The high water also highlighted the divide between homeowners determined to protect their shores and experts who point out that the only long-term solution to erosion is retreating.

“The concept of giving the property to the grandchildren and having it go on is just not realistic in the Great Lakes or along the ocean,” said Guy Meadows, the director of the Great Lakes Research Center.

Short-term barriers criticized

The Brickleys made it through the erosion crisis with the help of large sand-filled tubes placed at the edge of their property to keep waves from scouring out their lawn.

Now they’re fighting with the state over whether those tubes can remain in place now that the waves pose no immediate danger.

Amid the crisis, thousands of waterfront property owners received state permits to fortify their shores with sand tubes, seawalls and riprap.

“Everybody’s breathing a sigh of relief,” Kathy Brickley said. “However, we all know that eventually the water is going to go back up.”

It provided short-term protection for those properties, but in the long run will only worsen erosion by deflecting wave energy onto neighboring shores. Those defenses can also block public access to the shoreline by burying beaches under an artificial barrier.

“Armoring is, at best, a temporary type of fix that ultimately will fail,” said Wendy Rampson, the director of programs and outreach for the Michigan Association of Planning.

Long-term fixes

Planning experts said the long-term solution is to strengthen shoreline development policies to keep people from building homes dangerously close to shore.

Along the vast majority of Michigan’s 3,288-mile coast, state law allows property owners to build right up to where water regularly reaches, called the “ordinary high water mark.”

About 250 miles of shoreline designated by the state to be at high risk of significant erosion or sensitive coastal dunes are more tightly regulated. There, property owners need prior approval from the state for activities like building a deck, installing a fence or expanding a driveway.

Outside those lands, any additional regulation is up to local governments, which have historically taken a hands-off approach.

The high water crisis forced local leaders to rethink those lax policies, said Herasanna Richards, a legislative associate at the Michigan Municipal League.

But, five years later, only a few of the state’s 387 coastal communities appear to have followed through. The planning association's Rampson put it at “maybe a dozen.”

Among them is Saugatuck Township, on the Lake Michigan shoreline, which restricts the size of new shoreline homes and requires them to be far enough inland so it would take 60 years of erosion for the waves to reach them.

Lax development policies worked in an earlier era, when Michigan’s coast was dotted with small cottages that could be easily moved inland if erosion worsened, said Saugatuck Township Manager Daniel DeFranco.

But the unmovable mansions that have proliferated along the shoreline in recent years often come with “invasive building practices” that destabilize bluffs, DeFranco said.

In Chikaming Township, near Bridgman, officials banned hard armoring and implemented a 150-foot setback for new shoreline developments.

“We didn’t want to become a community of solid, hardened shoreline,” said Chikaming Township Supervisor David Bunte.

One possible reason other communities have not followed suit: Short-staffed local governments may hesitate to take on the time-consuming and logistically and politically complex process.

In Lake Charter Township, where the Brickleys have their cottage, the local government doesn’t have a specialized setback for lakefront lots, instead using a standard 25-foot setback from the ordinary high water mark unless a lot is in an area tightly regulated by the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.

That hasn’t seemed to cause any issues, said Building Administrator Rich Kubsch, particularly because there are only one or two undeveloped lots on the lakefront where the setback would apply.

“It’s just not something that comes up a lot,” Kubsch added.

Over the past five years, EGLE has doled out $4 million to dozens of communities and organizations interested in better protecting their coastlines.

But not every community that engages with the program sees the process through to completion, said Adam Arend, the coastal community development coordinator for EGLE.

“Sometimes we’re able to capture a moment in time where the community is really interested,” Arend said. “And sometimes communities are just less interested and more focused on other issues.”

But after three days of travel, the driver came back to find that a rear door had been keyed.

""Someone had to go to a lot of effort to be purposefully damaging,"" the original poster wrote. ""I really don't get it.""

Electric vehicles have become more common on roads around the world. In 2020, fewer than 3.5 million EVs were sold globally, according to the International Energy Agency. This year, that number is expected to surpass 20 million.

But with that growth has come an increase in EV vandalism, which could deter people from switching from dirty fuel-burning, gas-powered cars. In one particularly brazen act, cameras caught a security guard urinating on a Tesla Model Y.

EV charging stations have also become popular targets for vandalism, as thieves sever the charging cables in an attempt to steal the copper within.

Some critics claim that EVs aren't any better for the environment than gas-powered vehicles (spoiler alert — they are). They often point to mining for EV battery materials and the pollution it causes, which, in reality, is a fraction of what's generated by digging for fossil fuels.

Some commenters were quick to blame fossil fuel supporters for much of the vitriol directed at EVs and their drivers.

""Oil and gas people hate electric cars,"" one wrote. ""They see them as the enemy, threatening their livelihood.""

Sales of the upgraded hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) model came to 6,767 units in the June-August period, far surpassing the 1,500 units recorded by the first-generation model during the first three months after its release in 2018, according to the company.

The new model boasts a driving range of up to 720 kms on a single charge and a high-efficiency powertrain with a maximum motor output of 150 kilowatts, reports Yonhap news agency.

To promote hydrogen cars, Hyundai Motor provided 32 Nexo SUVs as protocol vehicles for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Energy Ministerial Meeting held in the southern port city of Busan last week.

""The rising sales of the Nexo, along with its use at international events, indicate hydrogen mobility is gradually becoming part of everyday life,"" a company official said.

Meanwhile, Hyundai Motor Group has decided to increase to $26 billion its investment commitment to the United States over the next four years, with a focus on steel, automobiles and robotics.

The investment, which was unveiled following President Lee Jae Myung's first summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, marks a sharp rise from the $21 billion pledge made in March.

""Through the investment, Hyundai Motor Group will respond to U.S. government policies and expand business opportunities in various areas to bolster its future competitiveness in areas including the mobility sector,"" the company said in a release.

Under the plan, Hyundai will build a steel plant in the U.S. state of Louisiana with an annual production capacity of 2.7 million tons, providing quality low-carbon steel for key strategic industries.

She expects there will be money left over after the laboratory improvement expenses to cover GEPA's operations for several years.
Redirecting the money will still require U.S. EPA approval.
GovGuam sought alternative ways to cover the agency's operational costs and was able to tap into U.S. EPA grant funding.
Lastimoza said GEPA provides vital services to the community that must be continued.","The Guam Environmental Protection Agency has enough federal grant funding in the bank to cover it's operations for the next three to four fiscal years, if it's allowed by the U.S. EPA to redirect the money, according to GEPA administrator Michelle Lastimoza.

She said the Trump administration cut off any further grant funding for GEPA beginning with fiscal year 2026, so the money in the bank may be the last GEPA receives for the foreseeable future.

""Four years ago, we were awarded a non competitive $45 million grant over five years, which is the Emerging Contaminant Small Disadvantaged Community grant from U.S. EPA,"" Lastimoza said, ""What we have in our accounts right now is three years of that five year grant with the expectation of year four coming next month.""

Lastimoza said GEPA will have about $35 million left, with the money intended to upgrade laboratory facilities to monitor for emerging contaminants such as heavy metals , or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, also known as ""forever chemicals.""

Lastimoza said the money is also meant to fund a new headquarters building but if the financial situation warrants it, they will ask to shift the funding elsewhere.

""Let's say that FY 26 rolls around and we don't have the funding to continue operations, we will redirect those funds, and still maybe upgrade our current laboratory so that we're not building a new building,"" she said.

""But we would request to redirect, to continue to fund salaries and operations for as long as we can, provided that emerging contaminant money goes towards laboratory capacity,"" Lastimoza added.

She expects there will be money left over after the laboratory improvement expenses to cover GEPA's operations for several years. It's annual budget is roughly $4 million for salaries, benefits, utilities, supplies, vehicle maintenance and equipment.

Redirecting the money will still require U.S. EPA approval. If it is denied GEPA will have to fall back on local funding, and Lastimoza said she has discussed that potential with Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero.

""I've spoken to the governor on whether or not we would request to go back to general funding if it came to that,"" Lastimoza said, ""Of course, we would have to prepare our budget, and we would have to go before the legislature.""

Lastimoza said the agency used to be funded by the general fund until it was stopped about fifteen years ago because of the government of Guam's severe financial constraints at the time.

GovGuam sought alternative ways to cover the agency's operational costs and was able to tap into U.S. EPA grant funding. That has covered operations ever since, until the Trump administration decided to eliminate the funding for fiscal year 2026.

In the meantime, Lastimoza said they are looking into other sources of funding such as increasing their fees.

""So we're looking at our fee schedule and adjusting it to make it more congruent to the work that's done,"" she said, ""For example, one permit in our solid waste program is $25 for five years no matter how many vehicles that company has to collect, whether it's like a fleet of one or a fleet of ten.""

Other potential revenue sources have been eyed, but have yet to push through.

""I know that in the past, legislation has been discussed about allocating funds from the use tax that would go into our environmental trust fund, and ... create a more sustainable local source of funding for Guam EPA, but that didn't pass,"" Lastimoza said.

""Maybe we need to work with our oversight (chairperson) to change language that wasn't acceptable. So that's still something that we'd like to pursue, is whether or not we could get a portion of the use tax,"" she said.

Lastimoza said GEPA provides vital services to the community that must be continued. It's many varied environmental regulatory responsibilities include monitoring for safe drinking water, hazardous waste and pesticides, polluted beaches, and emergency response to oil spills and leaks.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postguam.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/2a/82a5af91-899f-48c8-9f17-4c0bc8cf3638/686b2e80b541d.image.jpg?crop=1500%2C788%2C0%2C106&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-08-31 02:58:12.732855

Her legislation would have required Edison and other investor-owned utilities to make a plan to remove decommissioned power lines across the state.
He said he was so “passionate” about SB 256 that he traveled to Sacramento earlier this year to speak in support of it, in particular the provision that would have required the removal of decommissioned power lines and infrastructure.
“Without this bill, I can’t think of another bill that really successfully addresses this specific issue of the decommissioned lines.
So it’s just extremely disappointing.” Pérez noted that utilities that had previously called for rejecting the bill formally withdrew their opposition in recent weeks.","A state bill that would have required Southern California Edison and other investor-owned utilities to take steps to avoid causing catastrophic wildfires died in Sacramento on Friday.

Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez’s (D-Pasadena) district includes Altadena, which was devastated by the Eaton fire in January.

She introduced SB 256 earlier this year to make power infrastructure more safe and less prone to starting wildfires, citing reporting in the Los Angeles Times about some investigators and experts’ concerns that a decommissioned power transmission line in Eaton Canyon may have been the fire’s ignition site.

That reporting also revealed that Edison knew that some of the electrical towers under investigation were long overdue for critical upkeep and were classified as an “ignition risk” in company records.

Her legislation would have required Edison and other investor-owned utilities to make a plan to remove decommissioned power lines across the state.

It would have also boosted “California’s electrical infrastructure and wildfire resilience by improving wildfire mitigation planning, enhancing emergency response efforts, undergrounding power lines, and requiring closer collaboration between utilities, emergency services and local communities to prevent wildfires,” according to an email from Jerome Parra, a spokesperson for the senator.

Pérez called the bill, which she wrote, her top legislative priority this year, and said its failure was “disappointing” given the stakes of the issue.

“I’m very frustrated because, when are we going to have accountability? When are we actually going to start reducing fire risk and ensuring utilities are reducing fire risk?” Pérez said in an interview.

Pérez also cited reporting in The Times in which Edison International Chief Executive Pedro Pizarro acknowledged that “the possibility that an idle, unconnected Southern California Edison transmission line somehow reengerized on Jan. 7 is ‘a leading hypothesis’ for what started the destructive Eaton fire.”

Brian Leventhal, a spokesperson for Edison, provided a brief statement on behalf of the company.

“We worked with the senator’s office, withdrew our opposition, and remain neutral,” he said.

Nic Arnzen’s home in Altadena was one of thousands destroyed during the Eaton fire. As vice chair of the Altadena Town Council and president of the Altadena Coalition of Neighborhood Assns, Arnzen represents many residents who lost loved ones, belongings and livelihoods to the fast-moving blaze.

He said he was so “passionate” about SB 256 that he traveled to Sacramento earlier this year to speak in support of it, in particular the provision that would have required the removal of decommissioned power lines and infrastructure. He too was dismayed to learn that it had died Friday before even a committee vote.

“I’m a person who lost our home, everything in our home, and I went up there because I believed that of all the bills … this got to the core of the issue,” Arnzen said in an interview. “Without this bill, I can’t think of another bill that really successfully addresses this specific issue of the decommissioned lines. So it’s just extremely disappointing.”

Pérez noted that utilities that had previously called for rejecting the bill formally withdrew their opposition in recent weeks. So she said she was “shocked” by its failure to move forward.

Pérez, who began her first term barely a month before the Eaton fire destroyed much of her district, said she had been told by veteran lawmakers that her legislation would be a “tough fight” given how powerful and influential utilities are. Given that there was no formal opposition to the bill, she said she is concerned that utilities engaged in “shadow lobbying” behind the scenes to ensure that legislators did not support it.

“The cost is negligible, there’s no registered opposition, I made it my No. 1 priority. Tell me what went on here,” she said. “I’m at a loss for words.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0788a0a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+266/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2F41%2F3b0818ea49f697702ba9411a4d00%2Fla-photos-1staff-808095-la-me-sylmar-converter-station-power-grid-19-als.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 00:58:39.380934

Energy security is national security.
Ditch the subsidies that make us weaker, and embrace the home-harvested energy that strengthens the economy and national security.
Putting Americans and the country’s security ahead of the fantasies of controlling the weather by limiting the gas of life is the right direction for our country.","Many Americans are fed up with watching the country stumble into an energy crisis dressed up as a climate crusade. Energy security isn’t some abstract concept — it’s the backbone of the nation’s strength, and we are risking it all chasing net-zero pipe dreams.

Common sense and numbers don’t lie. We can’t sacrifice reliable, homegrown power for unreliable wind, solar and batteries that cost a fortune and leave us vulnerable. It’s time to wake up before the lights go out and our energy costs skyrocket.

Let’s talk about China. While activists trip over themselves to “save the planet,” Beijing is playing a different game. In 2023, it added 500 terawatt-hours of new electricity generation, mostly from coal.

China is not slowing down. It knows cheap, reliable energy fuels its economy and global ambitions. Meanwhile, under the Joe Biden administration, we were stuck with energy policies that drove up our bills and made our grid shakier than a house of cards in a windstorm. Thankfully, the One Big Beautiful Bill ends $500 billion in wind and solar subsidies, just not fast enough.

Wind and solar? They sound great until you look at the real world. They aren’t just expensive; they’re destabilizing. Ask Californians about their sky-high electricity rates and shortages, or Texans about their blackout nightmares. When the wind stops or the sun sets, so does electricity.

We’re funding China’s coal empire by buying its solar panels, turbines and batteries. China uses more than half of the world’s 9 billion tons of coal, and it is building hundreds of coal plants that will last 50 years. India and Indonesia are doing the same.

The good news? The corporate green facade is starting to crack. Big Oil, Shell, BP and others used to play along, trumpeting climate pledges to keep the activists happy. Now, they’re backing off.

Shell is cutting wind and solar targets to focus on oil and gas profits. BP is slashing wind projects because the math doesn’t add up. Even Exxon is backing away from the net-zero hype. These aren’t eco-villains; they’re businesses realizing that gutting hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas and coal is economic suicide. Why don’t many of our politicians get it?

America has more coal than China. We’re sitting on enough to power industries for generations, yet we’re paying through the nose for electricity. Why? Because we’ve vilified coal and bet on “green” tech that comes from China.

Subsidizing solar panels and wind turbines made with low-cost coal, low labor costs, sometimes using slave labor, and few environmental protections isn’t just bad business; it’s bankrolling an authoritarian regime that’s building its military at an amazing clip and polluting the world.

Our tax dollars are propping up a regime that crushes dissent and eyes global control, all while many worry about “sustainability.”

We should protect our environment. But we have taken our eye off real conservation in favor of attempting to regulate the gas of life, carbon dioxide, out of existence. Carbon dioxide makes plants grow much better, greens our Earth, and is a gas that we each exhale about two pounds a day.

Energy security is national security. We need to lean into what works: coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear, sources that keep the lights on and the factories humming and transportation moving all the time, not just when the wind blows (32 percent of the time) and sun shines (20 percent of the time).

We must stop funneling money to China for tech that doesn’t deliver. Ditch the subsidies that make us weaker, and embrace the home-harvested energy that strengthens the economy and national security.

Net-zero might make for nice headlines, but in a world where power means survival, it’s a luxury we can’t afford. We’ve got the resources and the know-how to lead; let’s stop pretending and start acting like it.

Americans want electric grids that don’t flicker, where energy bills don’t take ever more from our wallets, and where we’re not at the mercy of rivals who don’t play fair. That starts with an energy policy grounded in reality, not fantasies. We are choosing strength over slogans and building a future that’s powered by us, for us.

Putting Americans and the country’s security ahead of the fantasies of controlling the weather by limiting the gas of life is the right direction for our country.

“The Administration is blatantly lying about the sourced facts of our dissent letter, and are now blatantly retaliating and infringing on our constitutional rights.,” says Michael Pasqua, an EPA employee who helps manage the safety of drinking water in Wisconsin and a signatory of the declaration.

During the first Trump administration—noted for the scandal-ridden tenure of Scott Pruitt as the EPA’s administrator between late February 2017 and early July 2018—the agency rolled back more than 100 environmental rules. Now that Trump has returned to office, the administration has moved to cut back federal solar and wind power initiatives, as well as more environmental rules. Across science agencies, the administration has fired employees and advisory panel members, stopped grants and issued policies at odds with scientific findings. In July Zeldin moved to revoke the “endangerment” finding that serves as the linchpin for U.S. climate regulation under a 2007 Supreme Court decision.

In response to such moves across science agencies, hundreds of EPA, NASA, National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation staffers have signed on to public letters of dissent, rare rebukes from traditionally reticent federal employees. The letters follow the administration moving to remove tens of thousands of federal employees from agencies. In February Trump mistakenly said during a cabinet meeting that the EPA would likely cut 65 percent of its staff because “a lot of people weren’t doing their job.” (White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers later corrected Trump to clarify that the agency was planning to cut 65 percent of its spending.)

More recently, in August, Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers released a “Katrina Declaration,” raising the alarm to Congress about spending restrictions, cuts to disaster prevention programs and “censorship” of climate and environmental science at the agency. Those moves all raised the chances of a disaster like 2005’s Hurricane Katrina catastrophe, which took an estimated 1,833 lives, they wrote.

Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,' an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,' spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.

The EPA ""has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,' she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of one of the agency's largest unions said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees.

The union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of unlawfully undermining the Trump administration's agenda.

The Trump administration and EPA's retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,' said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined up to and including being fired included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel and a whole host of other jobs, Chen told the Associated Press. They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public."" In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA's capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

This isn’t just about British households or American politics—it’s about how we respond to one of the defining challenges of our time, and the dangerous consequences of getting it wrong.

The Inconvenient Truth About Energy Economics

The data tells a clear story that political rhetoric cannot obscure. UK energy bills have indeed risen sharply, but the primary culprit isn’t the whir of wind turbines—it’s the volatility of fossil fuel markets. When Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent natural gas prices soaring globally, countries heavily dependent on gas-fired power plants felt the shock immediately. The UK, despite its impressive wind capacity, still relies on gas for roughly 40% of its electricity generation and nearly 85% of home heating.

The economic reality is stark: onshore wind now costs approximately $26-50 per megawatt hour globally, while natural gas power generation ranges from $45-74 per MWh—and that’s before factoring in the price volatility that can double or triple costs overnight. The International Renewable Energy Agency reports that renewable electricity generation capacity added in 2023 will save the world at least $11 billion annually in fuel costs.

Meanwhile, wind power has provided something invaluable during this crisis: stability. Long-term contracts for wind energy, typically locked in at fixed prices for 15-25 years, have shielded consumers from some of the worst price spikes. Had the UK built even more renewable capacity over the past decade—matching Denmark’s achievement of generating over 50% of electricity from wind—households would be facing significantly lower bills today, not higher ones.

The Hidden Costs of Energy Dependence

What Trump’s analysis conveniently omits is the staggering cost of energy insecurity. The UK spends approximately £40 billion annually on energy imports, money that flows directly to fossil fuel exporters rather than supporting domestic jobs and economic growth. Compare this to Denmark, which not only meets its own electricity needs with wind but exports surplus power to neighboring countries, generating revenue rather than hemorrhaging it.

The employment picture tells an equally compelling story. The global wind industry now employs over 1.4 million people, with jobs that cannot be outsourced—wind turbines must be maintained where they’re installed. In contrast, oil and gas employment has been declining for decades due to automation and cyclical downturns, shedding over 200,000 jobs in the U.S. alone since 2014.

Energy as Geopolitical Weapon

The recent energy crisis exposed a truth that military strategists have long understood: energy dependence is a national security vulnerability. Russia’s weaponization of natural gas supplies demonstrated how autocratic regimes can hold democratic nations hostage through energy blackmail. Putin’s ability to manipulate European energy markets was possible only because those markets remained tethered to fossil fuel imports.

NATO’s former Supreme Allied Commander, Admiral James Stavridis, has called renewable energy “a national security imperative,” noting that every solar panel and wind turbine reduces dependence on unstable regimes. The Pentagon’s own assessments identify climate change as a “threat multiplier” that exacerbates conflicts and instability worldwide—conflicts that inevitably disrupt fossil fuel supplies and spike energy prices.

Countries that have achieved high renewable energy penetration—like Costa Rica, which runs on nearly 100% renewable electricity, or Norway, which generates 95% of its power from hydroelectric sources—demonstrate remarkable resilience to global energy shocks. They’ve effectively insulated their citizens from the price manipulation and supply disruptions that plague fossil fuel markets.

A Global Pattern of Misdirection

This blame-shifting isn’t unique to the UK or Trump’s rhetoric. Across the world, as energy costs have risen due to geopolitical instability and fossil fuel market manipulation, politicians have found it easier to point fingers at solar panels and wind turbines than to acknowledge their own failures to diversify energy supplies fast enough.

In Germany, critics blamed the country’s renewable transition for industrial challenges, conveniently ignoring how Russian gas dependency—not solar installations—created the real vulnerability. When winter energy prices spiked 300% in 2022, it was due to reduced Russian imports, not increased renewables capacity. German renewable energy actually prevented costs from rising even higher.

In Texas, wind turbines were scapegoated for the February 2021 grid failures that left millions without power. The reality? Natural gas wells and pipelines froze, accounting for nearly twice as much lost capacity as frozen wind turbines. Coal plants also failed en masse due to inadequate winterization—a finding confirmed by multiple independent investigations.

The pattern extends globally. In Australia, renewable energy has been blamed for grid instability despite the Australian Energy Market Operator confirming that coal plant failures caused the majority of supply interruptions. In South Africa, politicians blamed solar installations for grid problems while ignoring decades of underinvestment in coal infrastructure maintenance.

The Technology Reality Check

Critics often attack renewables with outdated assumptions about grid stability and intermittency. Modern grid management systems, powered by artificial intelligence and advanced weather forecasting, can now predict wind and solar generation with 95% accuracy up to 72 hours in advance. Battery storage costs have plummeted 85% since 2010, making large-scale energy storage economically viable.

The grid stability argument falls apart under scrutiny. Studies by grid operators worldwide consistently show that renewable energy integration improves rather than degrades system reliability. Wind and solar installations respond to grid disturbances in milliseconds—far faster than traditional fossil fuel plants that require minutes or hours to adjust output.

Real-world examples abound: South Australia, which generates over 70% of its electricity from renewables, has actually improved grid reliability since transitioning away from coal. The state that was once mocked for blackouts now exports its expertise in renewable grid integration globally.

The Accelerating Climate Bill

While politicians argue over quarterly bill fluctuations, the physical world continues delivering increasingly expensive climate bills. The summer of 2024 brought record-breaking temperatures, devastating floods, and unprecedented wildfires across multiple continents. Hurricane damage alone in 2024 exceeded $100 billion in the United States. European floods caused over €40 billion in damages.

These aren’t future costs—they’re present-day economic realities. The insurance industry, guided by actuarial science rather than political convenience, has been raising premiums and withdrawing coverage from climate-vulnerable areas for years. Lloyd’s of London estimates that climate change adds $23 billion annually to global catastrophic losses.

The stranded asset risks are mounting rapidly. Carbon Tracker estimates that $1.3 trillion in oil and gas assets could become worthless as the world transitions to clean energy. Coal plants are already being retired early across the globe as they become uneconomical compared to renewables. The International Energy Agency projects that demand for fossil fuels will peak before 2030—leaving countries that fail to diversify their energy systems holding increasingly worthless infrastructure.

International Competition and Economic Leadership

Perhaps most dangerously, the wind power blame game distracts from a crucial geopolitical reality: the clean energy transition is happening with or without Western leadership, and China is winning the race. China now manufactures over 60% of the world’s solar panels, 50% of wind turbines, and 70% of lithium batteries. Chinese companies are rapidly expanding across Africa, Latin America, and Asia, building the energy infrastructure that will define the next century’s economic relationships.

While American and European politicians debate whether renewables cause high energy bills, Chinese renewable energy companies are creating facts on the ground. China installed more solar capacity in 2023 than the entire world had built by 2017. This isn’t just about environmental leadership—it’s about economic and technological dominance in the industries that will define the 21st century economy.

The European Union recognizes this challenge, announcing the Green Deal Industrial Plan with hundreds of billions in clean energy investments. The United States responded with the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate investment in American history. Countries that continue relitigating whether renewables are economically viable risk being left behind in a technological revolution that’s accelerating regardless of their participation.

The Working Family Case for Wind Power

Beyond the macro-economics and geopolitics lies a simple truth that resonates with working families worldwide: renewable energy democratizes power generation. Unlike oil wells or gas deposits that concentrate wealth in the hands of a few resource owners, wind and solar can be deployed almost anywhere, keeping energy dollars in local communities.

Rural communities hosting wind farms receive hundreds of millions in annual lease payments, property taxes, and local jobs. In Iowa, where wind generates over 60% of electricity, rural landowners earn more than $25 million annually in wind lease payments while continuing to farm around the turbines. These aren’t temporary construction jobs—they’re permanent positions maintaining infrastructure that will operate for 25-30 years.

The distributed nature of renewable energy also provides resilience that centralized fossil fuel systems cannot match. When Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico’s centralized grid in 2017, communities with distributed solar and battery systems maintained power throughout the crisis. Microgrids powered by renewables are increasingly recognized as essential infrastructure for climate resilience.

Conservative Arguments for Energy Independence

The case for renewable energy shouldn’t be viewed through a partisan lens. Conservative principles of national strength, economic independence, and technological leadership all point toward accelerating the clean energy transition.

Energy independence has been a bipartisan American goal for decades, yet the country continues importing millions of barrels of oil daily from regions of questionable stability and values. Wind and solar offer true energy independence—powered by resources that cannot be manipulated by foreign adversaries or cartel pricing.

The military case is equally compelling. Forward operating bases powered by solar microgrids reduce vulnerable fuel supply convoys—a leading cause of military casualties in recent conflicts. The Department of Defense has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, not from environmental activism but from operational necessity.

Fiscal conservatives should embrace technologies that eliminate ongoing fuel costs forever. Once built, wind and solar installations generate electricity at near-zero marginal cost for decades, providing long-term price certainty that fossil fuels cannot match.

The Path Forward: Investment, Not Obstruction

Rather than relitigating the false choice between economic prosperity and environmental protection, we need leaders who understand that energy security and climate action are the same fight. The solution to volatile energy bills isn’t fewer wind turbines—it’s more of them, paired with expanded grid storage, improved transmission infrastructure, and policies that accelerate rather than obstruct the clean energy transition.

The UK’s recent experience offers a crucial lesson for the world: countries that bet their energy future on fossil fuels will continue experiencing the price volatility and supply insecurity that come with that choice. Those that invest boldly in renewables will enjoy the twin benefits of lower costs, enhanced security, and a more stable climate.

The numbers are overwhelming. The International Energy Agency’s latest scenarios show that achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 requires global clean energy investment to triple to $4 trillion annually by 2030. This isn’t a cost—it’s the largest economic opportunity in human history, creating tens of millions of jobs while avoiding trillions in climate damages.

Countries and regions that position themselves at the forefront of this transition will reap enormous economic benefits. Those that resist it will find themselves increasingly isolated, economically disadvantaged, and vulnerable to the growing costs of climate change and energy insecurity.

A Choice That Defines Our Future

President Trump’s wind power claims will fade from headlines, but the choice they represent will define the coming decades. We can continue allowing political convenience to override scientific evidence and economic reality, or we can acknowledge what the data has long shown: renewable energy isn’t the cause of our energy challenges—it’s the solution.

The wind isn’t responsible for high energy bills. Our failure to harness enough of it is. Every day we delay is another day we remain vulnerable to the price shocks, supply disruptions, and climate damages that are the true legacy of fossil fuel dependence.

The transition to clean energy is not a future possibility—it’s a present reality happening at unprecedented speed. The only question is whether we’ll lead it or be left behind by it. The answer will determine not just our energy bills, but our economic prosperity, national security, and the planet we leave for future generations.

The choice is ours, but time is not unlimited. The wind is blowing—literally and figuratively. The question is whether we’ll catch it or let it pass us by.",https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/blogs/uploads/users/image-11733199174-400x400.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 23:58:06.262496

It’s essential to be aware that not all vehicles qualify for the tax credit.
Notably, leasing new EVs offers a significant advantage; all leases qualify for the $7,500 tax credit, regardless of the buyer’s tax circumstances.
Models like the Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla Model 3 are popular among used car buyers.","As the end-of-summer holiday car shopping season approaches, many buyers are racing to take advantage of the federal electric-vehicle tax credit, which is set to expire at the end of September. This urgency could lead to increased activity over the Labor Day weekend and throughout the month. However, prospective buyers are urged to prepare thoroughly before visiting any dealership.

To maximize your chances of securing the best deal on an electric vehicle (EV), understanding several intertwined factors is crucial. This includes assessing eligibility for tax credits, defining budget limits for monthly payments, and determining the total purchase cost.

### Tax Credits and Eligibility

The recent changes in tax policy have led to the tax credit for new and used EVs expiring by the month’s end. Originally introduced under the Biden administration, this credit enabled buyers to save up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on specific used models. These credits are designed to provide a substantial discount at the point of sale, making it imperative for interested buyers to act quickly.

It’s essential to be aware that not all vehicles qualify for the tax credit. Factors influencing eligibility include battery sourcing, production location, and vehicle pricing. Buyers should refer to a list of qualifying EVs and be mindful of IRS income thresholds, which limit eligibility for certain purchasers. The tax credits are capped at $80,000 for vans, SUVs, and trucks, and $55,000 for other types of vehicles. For budget-conscious buyers, the credit is available for used EVs priced below $25,000, but eligibility is restricted by income.

Some dealerships will handle the application process for tax credits directly at the sale, while others may require buyers to manage the paperwork on their own. It’s advisable for shoppers to verify the experience and willingness of dealers to facilitate this process.

Notably, leasing new EVs offers a significant advantage; all leases qualify for the $7,500 tax credit, regardless of the buyer’s tax circumstances. However, this benefit will also disappear after the end of September.

### The Benefits of Leasing

Currently, leasing is seen as more advantageous than purchasing for new EVs. Many manufacturers offer enticing “lease specials,” but buyers should scrutinize these deals for hidden costs. While low advertised monthly payments can be attractive, they often require substantial upfront payments, which can negate the benefit. It is often recommended to either make minimal upfront payments or none at all to avoid risking that amount if the leased vehicle is in an accident.

Before heading to the dealership, potential lessees should compare advertisements and calculate the “effective monthly payment” to better evaluate costs against the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP). For example, comparing the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the Kia EV6 illustrates significant differences in total lease costs, highlighting the importance of thorough analysis.

### Considerations for Hybrid and Plug-in Models

For those who may not have access to home charging or prefer a transitional vehicle, hybrids and plug-in hybrids could be more suitable. While fully electrified vehicles are generally more favorable for leasing, hybrid models might present better purchasing options. The Honda Civic Hybrid, for instance, offers competitive pricing but leasing may not be as financially prudent given its strong residual value.

### Exploring the Used Car Market

With numerous compelling choices in the used EV market, shoppers can find excellent deals, particularly in the $30,000 to $35,000 range. The tax credit applies to EVs priced under $25,000, provided they are at least two years old. Models like the Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla Model 3 are popular among used car buyers.

When seeking used EVs, potential buyers should pivot their strategy compared to new car shopping, as dealers may be less flexible on pricing. Focusing on value rather than seeking the highest discount can lead to better outcomes.

### Final Thoughts

As deadlines loom and potential price hikes due to tariffs are anticipated, there has never been a better time to consider buying or leasing an EV or hybrid vehicle. Detailed price comparisons and a willingness to explore options beyond local markets can yield significant savings. With an informed approach, buyers can navigate these changes and emerge successfully with their next vehicle purchase.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tips-for-Car-Buyers-Ahead-of-Electric-Vehicle-Tax-Credit.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 11:00:03.310386

The New York Post first reported the pocket rescission.","MAKASSAR, Indonesia: At least three people were killed by a fire started by protesters at a council building in eastern Indonesia’s Makassar city, a local official told AFP Saturday, after demonstrations across the country following the death of a motorcycle taxi driver hit by a police vehicle.

The country was rocked by protests across major cities including the capital Jakarta on Friday, after footage spread of a gig motorcycle driver being run over by a police tactical vehicle in earlier rallies over low wages and perceived lavish perks for lawmakers.

Protests in Makassar descended into chaos outside the provincial and local city council buildings, both set on fire and vehicles set ablaze as protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails.

Three people were killed as a result of the fire at the Makassar city council building, its secretary Rahmat Mappatoba said.

“They were trapped in the burning building,” he said, accusing protesters of storming the office to set the building on fire.

“This is beyond our prediction, usually during a demonstration, protesters only threw rocks or burn a tire in front of the office. They never stormed into the building or burned it.”

Two of the victims were staff at the local council and another was a civil servant. Two died at the scene while one died in hospital.

At least four people were injured in the fire and are being treated at hospital, the official said.

The fire has since been extinguished. Images showed the provincial council building ablaze overnight.

Protesters at the South Sulawesi provincial council building tried to knock down the gate and storm in.

In the capital Jakarta, hundreds massed outside the headquarters of the elite Mobile Brigade Corp. (Brimob) paramilitary police unit they blamed for motorcycle gig driver Affan Kuniawan’s death, throwing firecrackers as police responded with tear gas.

A group of protesters tried to tear down the gates of the unit, notorious for its heavy-handed tactics, and pulled a sign from the building’s facade in chaotic scenes.

Police said they had detained seven officers for questioning in connection with the driver’s death.

The protests were the biggest and most violent of Prabowo Subianto’s presidency, a key test less than a year into his rule that forced him to quickly urge calm, order an investigation and visit the family of the slain driver.

He has pledged fast, state-driven growth but he had already faced protests for widespread government budget cuts to fund his populist policies including a billion-dollar free meal program.

Protests also spread to other major cities on Friday in Indonesia, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in Java and Medan in North Sumatra province.

SEOUL: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met with the families of soldiers killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine and offered condolences for their “unbearable pain,” state media said Saturday.

Pyongyang has not confirmed the number of its soldiers that died fighting for Russia, though Seoul estimates around 600, with thousands more wounded.

South Korean and Western intelligence agencies have said the North sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia in 2024 — primarily to the Kursk region — along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems.

Kim delivered a speech to the families on Friday, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported, after meeting with only some of them last week at another public ceremony awarding honors to the soldiers.

“I thought a lot about other martyrs’ families who were not present there. So, I had this meeting arranged as I wanted to meet and console the bereaved families of all the heroes and relieve them of their sorrow and anguish even a little,” Kim said in his speech, according to KCNA.

He pledged to erect a monument in the capital as well as a new street for the bereaved families, while the state would give full support to the troop’s children.

“My heart breaks and aches more at the sight of those little children,” he said.

“I, our state and our army will take full responsibility for them and train them admirably as staunch and courageous fighters like their fathers,” he added.

North Korea only confirmed it had deployed troops to support Russia’s war in Ukraine in April and admitted that its soldiers had been killed in combat.

At the ceremony last week, images released by KCNA showed an emotional Kim embracing a returned solider who appeared overwhelmed, burying his face in the leader’s chest.

The leader was also seen kneeling before a portrait of a fallen soldier to pay his respects and placing medals and flowers beside images of the dead.

In early July, state media again showed a visibly emotional Kim honoring flag-draped coffins, apparently of the deceased soldiers returning home.

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has told House Speaker Mike Johnson that he won’t be spending $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

Trump, who sent a letter to Johnson on Thursday, is using what’s known as a pocket rescission — when a president submits a request to Congress to not spend approved funds toward the end of the fiscal year, so Congress cannot act on the request in a 45-day timeframe and the money goes unspent as a result. It’s the first time in nearly 50 years a president has used one. The fiscal year draws to a close at the end of September.

The letter was posted Friday morning on the X account of the White House Office of Management and Budget. It said the funding would be cut from the State Department and the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, an early target of Trump’s efforts to cut foreign aid.

If the White House standardizes this move, the president could effectively bypass Congress on key spending choices and potentially throw into disarray efforts in the House and the Senate to keep the government funded when the next fiscal year starts in October.

The use of a pocket rescission fits part a broader pattern by the Trump administration to exact greater control over the US government, eroding the power of Congress and agencies such as the Federal Reserve and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others. The administration has already fired federal workers and imposed a historic increase in tariffs without going through Congress, putting the burden on the judicial branch to determine the limits of presidential power.

A White House official, who insisted on anonymity on a call with reporters to discuss the move, declined to say how the administration might use pocket rescissions in the coming years or what the upper limits of it might be as a tool. The official expressed confidence the administration would prevail in any legal challenges and said a goal of the proposed spending cuts was to make the cleanest case possible for these types of clawbacks.

Winding down USAID

Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X that USAID is essentially being shuttered and congratulated White House budget director Russ Vought for managing the process.

“USAID is officially in close out mode,” Rubio said. “Russ is now at the helm to oversee the closeout of an agency that long ago went off the rails.”

The 1974 Impoundment Control Act gives the president the authority to propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Congress can within 45 days vote on pulling back the funds or sustaining them, but by proposing the rescission so close to Sept. 30 the White House argues that the money won’t be spent and the funding lapses.

What was essentially the last pocket rescission occurred in 1977 by Democratic then-President Jimmy Carter, and the Trump administration argues it’s a legally permissible tool despite some murkiness as Carter had initially proposed the clawback well ahead of the 45-day deadline.

Pushback against pocket rescissions

The move by the Trump administration drew immediate backlash in parts of the Senate over its legality.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a statement that the Constitution “makes clear that Congress has the responsibility for the power of the purse” and any effort to claw back funds “without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.”

“Instead of this attempt to undermine the law, the appropriate way is to identify ways to reduce excessive spending through the bipartisan, annual appropriations process,” Collins said. Congress approves rescissions regularly as part of this process.”

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York warned that Trump’s use of the pocket veto could undermine the normal funding process and risk “a painful and entirely unnecessary shutdown.” After all, any budget agreements reached in the Senate could lack authority if the Trump White House has the power to withhold spending as it sees fit.

Schumer said in a statement that Republican leaders have yet to meet with Democrats on a path to fund the government after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 just as Trump tries an “unlawful gambit to circumvent the Congress all together.”

“But if Republicans are insistent on going it alone, Democrats won’t be party to their destruction,” Schumer said.

‘No exceptions’

Eloise Pasachoff, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on federal spending issues, has written that the Impoundment Control Act allows rescissions only if Congress acts within 45 days, meaning the the White House alone cannot decide to not spend the funds.

“This mandatory language admits no exceptions, indicating that Congress expects the funds to be used as intended before the end of the fiscal year if it does not approve the proposed rescission,” Pasachoff wrote in an academic paper last year.

What’s in the funding?

The funds in the pocket rescission package include $3.2 billion in development assistance grants, $520 million for the United Nations, $838 million for international peacekeeping operations and $322 million to encourage democratic values in other countries.

Trump had previously sought to get congressional backing for rescissions and succeeded in doing so in July when the House and the Senate approved $9 billion worth of cuts. Those rescissions clawed back funding for public broadcasting and foreign aid.

The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as foreign populations lose access to food supplies and development programs.

In February, the administration said it would eliminate almost all of USAID’s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance abroad. USAID has since been dismantled, and its few remaining programs have been placed under State Department control.

The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court on Wednesday to stop lower court decisions that had preserved foreign aid, including for global health and HIV and AIDS programs, that Trump has tried to freeze. But on Friday, the administration withdrew its appeal to the Supreme Court, after a favorable appeals court ruling late Thursday.

That included a discussion on how the the city should approach Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), which give cities the opportunity to buy renewable energy production elsewhere to offset some of their own carbon footprint. The board largely supported continuing to purchase credits, but some members disagreed on where the city should buy them.

The board also discussed future agenda items and what kind of policies it wants to develop and recommend to City Council. All members in attendance offered ideas, and, after some back and forth, they agreed to pare down the list to a series of top priorities at the Sept. 25 meeting.

At that meeting, Evanston Transportation and Mobility Coordinator Sarah FioRito will update the board on public transit, and at the October meeting, Senior Project Manager Bridget Nash will give an update on the city’s Stormwater Master Plan.

The future of RECs

RECs are certificates showing that a utility plant generated one megawatt of electricity from renewable energy, such as solar or wind power. By buying RECs, municipalities like Evanston pay utilities for generating electricity from renewable sources, even if they don’t necessarily get that energy themselves.

Cara Pratt, the city’s sustainability and resilience manager, said Evanston has been buying RECs since 2012, applying them to the electricity that Evanstonians get through MC Squared. The purchases have largely funded wind power generated by Midwestern utilities, according to Pratt.

Board member David Karnes said he would favor branching out beyond that, so “we get more bang for our buck in cheaper markets.”

Gennifer Geer, another board member, said she was worried that “by buying RECs from a state with less sustainability-friendly policies,” Evanston would be “encouraging that type of policy,” mentioning Texas as an example. Board member Gul Agha, though, responded that “the money isn’t going to Texas.”

“What it’s doing is subsidizing the cost for renewable energy,” he said.

Future agenda items

Toward the end of the meeting, board co-chair Paula Scholl summarized some of the policy recommendations that came up at previous meetings and some ideas of her own.

Most notably, she mentioned a presentation on the environmental justice work that the Gichigamiin Indigenous Nations Museum has been doing, a discussion of how the city can better “infuse” climate goals into city operations, having the city’s new forestry supervisor Tom Ianetti talk about his plans and weighing in on the Envision Evanston zoning code rewrite.

At their last meeting before departing for college, Jexa Edinberg said they’d like to see the board build relationships with natural area stewards and also in District 65 schools.

Board member Anusha Kumar said she wants the board to look into subsidies to help middle- and low-income homeowners make their houses more energy efficient.

Agha added that he’d like to see the City Council adopt two new environmental policies — a food composting mandate and a requirement that developments that need zoning approval show their projected carbon footprint.

Geer said she would like a composting ordinance, too, plus a lakefront protection ordinance, an idea that’s been discussed for the past 15 years but never adopted. She also suggested an update to the 2009 Evanston Multi-Modal Transportation Plan.

Pratt replied that this was something FioRito and the city’s Bureau of Capital Planning and Engineering has been quietly working on, and that FioRito could discuss it at next month’s meeting.

Olin Wilson-Thomas, an Evanston Township High School student and board member, said he’d like to look into getting rid of parking minimums, an item discussed before he was appointed to the board. He also encouraged bike and transit infrastructure improvements.",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9807-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 23:01:37.411884

As part of the resolution, EGLE said it would hold several discussions, including an informational meeting with the community surrounding the Stellantis facility.
Air quality info ‘something I can take back to my community’ Grant, who lives on Beniteau Street, directly across from the Stellantis Mack plant, said she gained some useful information from the session.
Grant said she didn’t know much about the air quality issues on the east side.
For other attendees, such as Duane Daniels, the EGLE meeting didn’t offer much new information.","When Jameella Grant moved into her home on Detroit’s east side a few years ago, she said she was happy to find a quiet and affordable place to rent.

What she didn’t expect was the lingering cough she developed.

On Wednesday, Grant and other east side residents listened as staff members from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy’s Air Quality Division broke down the state agency’s air quality enforcement, monitoring, and permitting processes in a community learning session.

The event comes nearly a year after an informal resolution with the Environmental Protection Agency of a 2021 civil rights complaint against the state regulator that found EGLE violated the EPA’s Title VI protections when it approved a permit for the Stellantis Detroit Assembly Complex – Mack.

As part of the resolution, EGLE said it would hold several discussions, including an informational meeting with the community surrounding the Stellantis facility.

The agreement does not include an admission of wrongdoing or future actions beyond holding conversations and providing summaries of the conversations to the EPA.

EGLE staff told Planet Detroit ahead of Wednesday’s meeting at the Wayne County Community College District’s Eastern Campus that it is one of many steps the agency has planned to improve communication and transparency with residents and advocacy groups.

“Although it’s tied with some of these Title VI events that happened in the past, we are looking at this through the lens of how we can actually make this productive for us here at EGLE, but mostly for community members,” said Jenifer Dixon, planning and policy coordinator at EGLE’s Air Quality Division.

Air quality info ‘something I can take back to my community’

Grant, who lives on Beniteau Street, directly across from the Stellantis Mack plant, said she gained some useful information from the session.

“It was very detailed,” she told Planet Detroit. “I didn’t know what to expect, but once I got here, I was like, ‘OK, I needed this, and this is something I can take back to my community and my block club.’”

The community event included resource tables run by community organizations such as JustAir and Detroit Area Disaster Recovery Group, as well as representatives from Detroit’s Office of Sustainability and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

Grant said she didn’t know much about the air quality issues on the east side. Before moving to Beniteau, she lived for nearly two decades in Warren.

“When you’re living across Eight Mile, you don’t think about that kind of stuff,” she said. “They do talk about it, but I really didn’t pay attention.”

When she developed a persistent cough, Grant said she started seeing an ear, nose, and throat doctor.

“At first I was like, it’s allergies, and that’s what they kept saying,” said Grant. “But I’m like, it’s three years later, I am still coughing, what is wrong?”

Most of the Stellantis Mack plant’s violations are for odors, which can cause headaches, nausea, and irritation, and can suggest there may be harmful airborne chemicals. The facility has received eight violations from EGLE since it began operation as an assembly plant in 2021.

For other attendees, such as Duane Daniels, the EGLE meeting didn’t offer much new information. The disabled combat veteran has lived on Bewick Street, less than 1 mile from the Stellantis plant, for more than a decade.

Daniels came to the meeting with concerns around the city’s community benefits agreement with Stellantis. The automaker is providing roughly $5 million in home repair grants for residents living near the Mack Avenue facility, but some residents like Daniels were excluded due to an income requirement, he said.

Every resident, Daniels said, is paying the price for the automaker’s emissions.

“If a person comes down with an injury from the polluter, from Stellantis, they have to pay with their own health insurance. They’re not getting reimbursed. So how come they don’t have a fund for the people in the impact zone?”

Robert Shobe, a longtime Beniteau Street resident, attended Wednesday’s meeting. He’s been a vocal advocate against Stellantis and the noxious fumes coming from its factory, but in the months since the Title VI resolution between the EPA and EGLE, he said he’s mostly kept himself indoors.

“There’s more things going on with me than there had been, but I stay out of that air most of the time,” Shobe said. He has an air purifier in his house, and avoids doing too much yardwork in the summer, but said he still finds himself experiencing “issues with my eyes and my throat on a daily basis” on top of living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.

“They haven’t resolved the situation,” he said. “The only thing they’ve done is create more pollution, and they’re allowing them to put something in the stack like Febreze, to keep you from smelling the actual scent.”

Stellantis spokesperson Jodi Tinson told Planet Detroit that numerous local, state, and federal agencies tested the air in the neighborhood and found it “meets all health-based screening standards and is well below the levels that are considered harmful” in federal standards and Michigan Air Toxics Screening Levels.

Ambient air data collected at an onsite monitoring station shows the neighborhood’s air is “consistent with other areas of the city,” Tinson said.

A second regenerative thermal oxidizer was installed at the auto plant in 2023, Tinson said, adding that EGLE has conducted inspections based on odor complaints and has not confirmed a nuisance odor.

“The company is monitoring for odors to confirm the system is addressing this concern and also has not detected any nuisance odors.”

The neighborhood is being disregarded, Shobe told Planet Detroit.

“This neighborhood has been starved of city support and things of that nature for years.”

Zero Waste Detroit director: East side air quality needs attention

During a Q&A session, attendees asked about EGLE’s staffing numbers as well as the status of supplemental environmental projects on Detroit’s east side.The projects are voluntary agreements made between the state and a facility after an air quality violation is issued.

Jenine Camilleri, air quality enforcement supervisor at EGLE, said a project is in the works in Southeast Michigan at Southeastern High School, and agreements are being negotiated with Edward C. Levy Co.’s plant in Southwest Detroit and a cremation facility in the suburbs.

“I think it really does come down to when we start those negotiations, if a company is interested in doing a supplemental environment project,” said Camilleri. “We’re seeing that that is happening probably just as much now as ever.”

As a teenager, Deb Stewart Anderson attended Southeastern. Now she’s partnering with Henry Ford Health and Wayne State University’s Center for Urban Responses to Environmental Stressors to install air monitoring sensors in the vicinity of her alma mater.

“I don’t think that the east side gets the attention that Southwest and other parts of the city get, but it’s a Detroit problem,” said Stewart Anderson, executive director of Zero Waste Detroit, a coalition of community organizations advocating for waste reduction and universal curbside recycling.

“We’re trying to come together to get some solutions and to advocate for better air.”

EGLE’s Air Quality Division is approved by the Michigan Legislature to have as many as 225 full-time employees, up from 190 a few years ago, said Dixon, planning coordinator for the division. The extra staff is especially important, she said, for engaging local communities like Detroit, where the local team as of this year is fully staffed.

“There’s a lot going on here, and we need more staff to do this work,” said Dixon.

“When that (Detroit) office was not fully staffed, we were not able to do the work that we needed to do to be responsive to the community. When they had complaints, when they had concerns, doing inspections was harder.”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP22284778913296-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 23:01:11.540853

Washington (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday fired at least eight employees who signed a letter criticizing the agency’s leadership under Administrator Lee Zeldin and President Donald Trump.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,” an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,” spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees. Officials expect total staffing to go down to about 12,500, a reduction of more than 3,700 employees, or nearly 23%, from staffing levels when Trump took office in January.

A 2024 report released by the Department of Energy found that data centers accounted for 4.4% of all U.S. electricity consumption in 2023.
Why does the energy crunch matter?
If electricity demand outpaces the growth in supply, it means higher prices for everyone, from factory owners to consumers.
What's being done about the energy crunch?","Renewable-energy executives have warned that unprecedented moves by the federal government could grind new cleaner-energy projects to a halt just as the U.S. struggles to meet growing electricity demand, CNBC reported.

""I don't think everybody realizes how big the crunch is going to be,"" Kevin Smith, CEO of solar and battery developer Arevon, told CNBC. ""We're making that crunch more and more difficult with these policy changes.""

What's happening?

After years of electricity demand in the U.S. remaining relatively flat due to gains in energy efficiency, demand for power has begun to increase sharply, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.

Electricity-hungry data centers, particularly those behind energy-intensive AI models, have been the major drivers of increased demand.

A 2024 report released by the Department of Energy found that data centers accounted for 4.4% of all U.S. electricity consumption in 2023. That figure was expected to grow to between 6.7% and 12% by 2028.

At the time of the report's publication, experts expressed confidence that these growing energy needs could be met using cleaner, renewable sources of electricity.

""The United States has seen an incredible investment in artificial intelligence and other breakthrough technologies over the last decade and a half, and this industrial renaissance has created greater demand on our domestic energy supply,"" Jennifer Granholm, who was Secretary of Energy at the time, said in 2024, per the DOE.

""We can meet this growth with clean energy,"" Granholm continued.

However, with the federal government announcing a new, more stringent review process for renewable-energy projects, industry experts have begun to question whether the U.S. will be able to increase electricity production fast enough to meet rising demand, according to CNBC.

Why does the energy crunch matter?

If electricity demand outpaces the growth in supply, it means higher prices for everyone, from factory owners to consumers. The result could be significantly slower economic growth overall.

Renewable-energy projects are important because they typically can be brought online much more quickly than power plants using coal or natural gas.

For example, a massive new solar and battery-storage array that helps to power the City of Los Angeles took just two years from the time shovels hit the ground until the project was brought into service.

By comparison, the world currently is experiencing a severe backlog of the turbines used in natural-gas-powered facilities, leading to wait times as long as seven years, according to S&P Global.

Additionally, cleaner, renewable-energy power plants are responsible for far less heat-trapping, health-harming pollution overall than their nonrenewable counterparts, which are powered by dirtier, extracted fuels like coal and natural gas.

What's being done about the energy crunch?

Unless the federal government begins embracing renewable sources of energy, the U.S. might not be able to meet rising demand for electricity.

To encourage political change, you can use your voice, contact your elected representatives, and vote for pro-environment candidates.

Further, regardless of the policies coming out of Washington, D.C., you can make a difference by driving an EV and installing solar panels on your home. Home solar can reduce your electricity bill to practically zero while also lowering planet-heating pollution.

With federal tax incentives for home solar ending Dec. 31 and credits for EVs ending on Sept. 30, it's important to act soon if you want to take advantage. Solar can take up to three months to complete on time, but if you're interested in getting quotes before it's too late, EnergySage has a comparison shopping tool for local solar installers that's a great way to find one that still has installation slots available.

So, it might stand to reason that Tesla stock has had a torrid time of it, too, right?

Not necessarily!

The carmaker’s stock price is down 14% so far in 2025. But over the past year, it is up – and not just by a little bit.

A 68% gain means that Tesla stock is worth slightly over two-thirds more than it was one short year ago.

That represents more than half of the total 134% gain seen over the past five years.

With sales falling and profits set to suffer from the end of US tax credits, increased electric vehicle market competition, and falling sales volume, can Tesla really justify its stock market capitalisation of $1.1trn?

Given the stock price, the answer to that question seemingly depends on who you ask!

The current bull case for Tesla

Looking on the positive side, there is still a lot to like about the company.

Sure, first-half sales showed a bad decline. But that could be down to temporary production line closures for retooling and the Tesla boss’s high-profile political involvement. As both factors recede into the rear-view mirror, maybe sales can grow.

Energy generation and storage revenue showed a 7% year-on-year decline in the most recent quarter. But the long-term trend in this business remains positive, with the footprint of the equipment deployed to date growing over time. Tesla has a compelling technological capability in this area.

The company says volume production of its truck and self-driving taxi is ‘slated’ for 2026 and self-driving taxi trials are ongoing in the US (albeit with a Tesla employee in each car).

In other words, the core car business could rebound from a bad start to the year, power generation and storage continues to demonstrate its long-term potential, and new business areas are moving closer to commercialisation.

The bear case, at a $1.1trn market cap

Still, what does all that add up to in terms of an investment case?

Much of it is speculative – and, in my view, ought to be valued accordingly.

The car business is huge and I do think that with the right management effort it can be returned to sales growth. But sales are not the only issue it faces.

Profitability is under threat on multiple fronts, from the end of US tax credits to pricing pressure growing as rivals offer cheap models to try and build market share.

The power generation and storage business has demonstrated strong long-term potential, in my view. At 12% of Tesla’s most recent quarterly revenue, I do not see it as a rounding error, but I also do not think it is core to the investment case.",https://www.fool.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tesla-Building-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 21:59:16.413203

The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association called the action a “major step” toward renewable fuel adoption, especially for producers in Iowa who have several B30 incentive programs.

The adoption means that farmers can use the higher-blend fuel in their agricultural equipment like tractors and combines, which typically use the heavy-duty engines. Previously, John Deere rated the tier-4 engines for B20, or 20% biodiesel, fuel blends.

IRFA executive director Monte Shaw said in a news release that John Deere “has always been a leader in promoting renewable fuels.”

The tier rating is a system designed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate and reduce emissions.

Pierre Guyot, senior vice president of John Deere Power Systems, said the company is committed to growing its use of renewable fuels.

Lower-tier John Deere engines are rated for higher fuel blends, up to 100% biodiesel.

“We believe strongly in the role that renewable fuels play in supporting the agriculture economy and are excited to offer our customers — including those who grow the very crops used to make renewable fuels — the opportunity to leverage higher blends of fuels like biodiesel in their own equipment,” Guyot said in a press release.

In 2024 Iowa, the nation's top maker of biodiesel, produced an estimated 350 million gallons, and the industry had an estimated economic contribution of $2.2 billion, according to IRFA. In May, Iowa gained a first-of-its-kind biodiesel pump at a station in Urbandale to fuel PepsiCo trucks with B99 fuel.

Iowa offers a 10-center-per-gallon tax credit to fuel retailers who sell B30 or higher blends. In addition to the state program, the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association offers a biodiesel fuel credit to farmers who fill up with biodiesel blends.

Ford’s joint venture battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee were the next targets in this organizing push.
It was the first auto assembly plant election the union had won in the South since the 1940s.
Ford, however, has balked at agreeing to neutrality at its joint ventures or folding its battery plants into its master contract with the UAW.
He left after five years to work at BOSK because it was closer to home and he thought battery plants are the future.","Kentucky battery plant workers at the BlueOval SK Battery Park (BOSK) in Glendale have voted to join the United Auto Workers (UAW). The workers make batteries to power Ford’s all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck and E-Transit cargo van.

On August 27 at 10 p.m., an unofficial tally showed 526 yes and 515 no votes, with forty-one challenged ballots. There were 1,200 eligible voters; turnout was over 90 percent. The UAW called the vote “a major step forward for workers who stood up against intense company opposition and chose to join the UAW.”

“We’re feeling pretty confident, I think we’re gonna win,” said battery worker Halee Hadfield via text message on August 23. “Things are really ramping up across the whole plant and people are pissing off the plant managers by simply wearing shirts, hats, and buttons with the UAW logo on them.”

Disputed Votes

The outcome of the election will ultimately hinge on the forty-one challenged ballots. The union called those ballots “illegitimate” and called on Ford to “drop their anti-democratic effort to undermine the outcome of the election.”

Maintenance and production workers were eligible to vote. But the status of Safety Emergency Response Team (SERT) employees was left in limbo: election rules agreed to by the company and the UAW permitted them to vote but said their eligibility would be decided after the election. Their ballots are being challenged by the union.

“The challenged ballots are not part of the group of workers who built their union from the bottom up,” the UAW said in a statement. “They deserve to have their own union, in an appropriate bargaining unit with a representative of their own choosing.”

Southern Organizing Push

“I’m just under thirty years old, and I’ve been trying to organize my entire adult life,” said Derek Doherty, a production operator, who has tried to organize with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the Teamsters at previous jobs. “It’s just been beautiful,” he said about the union drive. “Everybody knows what we’re here for and why we’re doing it.”

Hadfield had predicted a win by 57 percent. “Unfortunately, a lot of people bought the company’s bullshit,” she said the night of the vote count.

Shortly after the successful 2023 stand-up strike against the Big Three automakers, the UAW committed $40 million to new organizing with the intent of doubling the union’s membership by aggressively organizing 150,000 nonunion workers, especially in Southern auto manufacturing and newly built battery plants.

Ford’s joint venture battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee were the next targets in this organizing push. And the UAW’s latest effort to breach one more citadel in the South comes with big potential obstacles, as Ford will appeal the contested ballots, and this may give the Trump administration an opportunity to influence the outcome through the National Labor Relations Board.

Union Experience

Hadfield and many of her coworkers were union members at previous jobs. For four years, Hadfield was a member of the Communications Workers of America’s industrial division, IUE-CWA, at the General Electric–Haier Appliance Park in Louisville, an hour’s drive from the BlueOval plant.

Others had the protection of UAW contracts at auto parts suppliers or Ford’s Kentucky Truck and Louisville Assembly Plants, or they have family who were Teamsters at UPS or grocery workers at Kroger.

The battery park is a joint venture between Ford and South Korea’s SK On, an affiliate of South Korea’s second-largest conglomerate.

In July, the UAW joined forces with the militant Korean Metal Workers’ Union in hopes of changing BOSK’s status as “the only union-free company among the joint ventures between Korean battery manufacturers and U.S. automakers,” according to the Korea Times.

SK On and Ford’s partnership involves creating twin electric battery manufacturing facilities in Kentucky and in Stanton, Tennessee. The Stanton plant is slated to start production in 2025 after a pause last year. The Kentucky battery park became fully operational on August 19. The facility is expected to eventually employ over five thousand workers.

“Whatever the powertrain is, we’re going to be there,” UAW president Shawn Fain said earlier in the month at a rally. “We’re not going to run from [technological] advances. We have to embrace it and figure out how we make it work for working-class people, not just for business or just for the rich.”

The union notched a big win in its new organizing push in auto in April 2024, when 4,300 workers at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted to join the UAW. It was the first auto assembly plant election the union had won in the South since the 1940s.

Wins and Losses

A month later, however, the union fell short of winning an election at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama. It has not filed for any elections at other Southern assembly plants since, and the Volkswagen workers are still fighting for a first contract.

Earlier this month, in another blow, workers at a Navistar engine plant in Huntsville, Alabama, voted 142 to 73 against joining the UAW following an aggressive anti-union campaign by management, including a personal visit to the plant by the parent company’s CEO and the reinstatement — days before the vote — of a health insurance plan the company had taken away last year. According to the union, those moves violated the neutrality agreement in its contract at other UAW plants and reversed course on its card-check certification agreement to recognize and negotiate with the union once a majority of employees sign up.

Battery plants have been a bright spot in the UAW’s organizing efforts. Workers at Ultium Cells, a joint venture in Ohio between GM and LG Energy Solution, joined the UAW through an election in December 2022 and won a first contract in June 2024. Ultium Cells workers at another plant in Tennessee joined the UAW through a card-check agreement last September, a victory clinched during the stand-up strike; GM agreed to recognize the union through a majority sign-up process as part of the agreement that ended the strike. At the Kokomo, Indiana, battery plant StarPlus Energy, a joint venture between Stellantis and the South Korean company Samsung SDI, the company agreed to recognize the UAW this May after a majority of the 420 workers signed cards to join the union.

Ford, however, has balked at agreeing to neutrality at its joint ventures or folding its battery plants into its master contract with the UAW. During the stand-up Strike, Ford CEO Jim Farley accused Fain of “holding the deal hostage over battery plants.”

Bitter Company Campaign

Since then, Ford has taken the gloves off. It launched a bitter anti-union campaign at BOSK, holding the vote back for nearly five months after finally agreeing to an election date in June and dispatching supervisors to harass union supporters wearing UAW shirts to chill the organizing drive. The UAW has filed four unfair labor practice charges, alleging that BOSK destroyed union materials, fired pro-union workers, and threatened to close the facility if workers voted to unionize.

One notable talking point, said Hadfield, is the company’s use of Donald Trump’s rollback of electric vehicle credits to claim its financial viability is in jeopardy. The company falsely claimed to have lost a $9 billion loan from the Department of Energy that it had already obtained under the Biden administration, Hadfield said.

BOSK workers’ starting pay is $21 an hour, compared to $26.32 for UAW Ford workers, whose earnings increase to over $42 an hour after three years. But it’s not just about dollars and cents.

Doherty, a production operator, started in late June and signed a union card on his first day at the plant. During mandatory training at a nearby facility, management painted a rosy picture, he said, claiming that there was no division between salary and hourly workers — “It’s just one big family.” But as soon as he arrived at the plant, he noticed the power managers wielded through favoritism and decided to join the organizing effort.

He described the company’s anti-union push as a typical assault on workers’ minds: lies and intimidation. “They’ll do the exact textbook definition of an unfair labor practice but then toss in one sentence that adds just enough of a caveat to make it slip by.” He described captive-audience meetings where workers were forced to sit through anti-union harangues from management.

Managers would shut down the line, he said, and then announce that there was a meeting going on, saying “It’s completely voluntary, but we really think you should go.” That’s not a real choice, said Doherty. “The line is shut down; everybody else is going. There’s not really much else to do in there.”

Hadfield said she and her coworkers are vocal about their union support, but they are less visible with their union gear. “Because of the retaliatory firings and people getting threatened with all kinds of bullshit, there are a lot of people who used to wear a red shirt that don’t anymore because they’re scared.”

In the course of the nine-month organizing push, BOSK management has fired three union organizing committee members. But workers remained committed to the organizing drive, saying the company has been the best organizer.

Company management also used recent internal divisions in the UAW to attempt to undermine support for the union. Flyers passed out by supervisors quoted opponents of the union’s aggressive organizing and bargaining strategies under Fain and attempted to sow fear among workers about the potential ramifications of a strike. One flyer concluded by asking: “In this unstable environment — with a history of hostility, layoffs, and financial corruption — is this the type of organization you want to trust with your livelihoods?”

Dangerous Slurry

Health and safety concerns loom large at the plant. A May Louisville Courier Journal investigation found that unsafe working conditions ranged from chemical exposures to blocked emergency exit doors to mold contamination to injury and respiratory illness. As Labor Notes reported last November, a big motivation to organize a union at BOSK, as it was at Ultium Cells, stemmed from safety concerns, especially exposure to hazardous powders from chemical leaks, electric shocks, explosions, and fires.

Rob Collette was previously a member of IUE-CWA at General Electric–Haier Appliance Park. He left after five years to work at BOSK because it was closer to home and he thought battery plants are the future. “The technology, the facility, the machinery,” he told Jacobin in March. “It’s blown my mind.”

Collette hired in while the plant was still under construction but tripped on construction debris and fractured his hip. The experience fortified his support for the union drive to fix the company’s negligence. “Nobody feels safe,” he said.

“Roughly three weeks in, I just mentioned to a coworker one day, ‘Golly, if we don’t get the UAW in here, I don’t know if I can stay,’” said battery worker Bill Wilmoth back in November.

“We started running into a myriad of safety issues,” said Wilmoth. “We are taken into a plant that is in construction, and we’re being asked to navigate that and never really given clear instructions on things like: What happens if there’s an emergency? How do we evacuate? How do we deal with the raw material chemicals?”

“Just today, there was an accident where a bunch of people got sprayed with electrode slurry,” said a worker on August 26 who we’ve granted anonymity to protect from company retaliation. When handling the electrode slurry, workers can come into contact with a hazardous solvent known as n-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP) used in the production of battery cells. “The NMP is the worst part of the slurry. It’s a nasty chemical that is definitely not good to breathe or get on your skin,” Greg Less, technical director at the University of Michigan Battery Lab, told me in 2023.

For Doherty, it feels as if managers are making things up as they go. “They’ll say we’re certified on something, and then the next day, say, ‘Actually, no, that certification isn’t good.’ All sorts of problems can and have arisen from that.”",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/29155247/GettyImages-2167257031.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 23:58:17.293933

During the 2025 edition of Intersolar South America, Sungrow unveiled its PV rapid shutdown solution, tailored for the Brazilian market.

The solution, consisting of an SR20D-M rapid shutdown (RSD) device, SR200T-BX RSD controller box and Sungrow inverters, ensures system safety by reducing module voltage to a safe level within 30 seconds, providing reliable protection for both individuals and property.

According to Brazil’s newly released standard, rooftop PV systems must lower DC voltage below 35 V within 30 seconds in case of utility power outages, fires or other emergencies. Previously, the country’s fire authority also emphasized the importance of rapid shutdown devices, urging the industry to enhance emergency response capability.

Sungrow’s new rapid shutdown solution ensures that rooftop arrays quickly enter a safe zone, creating a safe environment for emergency crews and maintenance teams.

In rooftop systems, if a panel is heavily shaded or develops a fault, shutdown devices activate a bypass mode, allowing the faulty panel to be isolated while the rest of the system keeps generating power.

The problem with conventional designs is that, during bypass, device temperatures can reach 180–190°C. This extreme heat goes well beyond the safe limit of electronic components, which leads to faster aging, seal failures or even cracks in the casing. Over time, that shortens a system’s lifespan and raises the risk of malfunctions.

Sungrow solves this issue with its patented Fault Heat Control (FHC) low-temperature bypass technology, which keeps the temperature under 120°C, about 33% lower than conventional solutions.

To handle Brazil’s diverse climates the devices feature C5 anti-corrosion protection and the industry’s leading IP68 rating (IP68 for SR20D-M, IP65 for SR200T-BX).

Global leaders and analysts say clean energy is pulling ahead, even as they urge faster action.","In 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter told the nation that energy choices would test its character. He called the effort the “moral equivalent of war.” His message was simple. Use less imported oil. Build new homegrown energy. Plan for the long term. That warning still reads true today.

What Carter Meant—And Why It Still Matters

Carter’s speech came after oil shocks and rising prices. He asked people to save energy and support new solutions. He pushed for a national plan. He said the task would be hard but necessary. The line about a “moral equivalent of war” became the headline. And it still echoes in this decade.

Where the World Stands Now

Today, renewables are the fastest-growing source of new electricity. Policy, markets, and tech all align. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects annual renewable additions to keep rising through 2030, led by solar and wind. In its outlook, yearly additions scale from about 666 GW in 2024 toward ~935 GW by 2030. Solar and wind make up most of it because they are cheap and quick to build.

Another global source, IRENA, counted the projects that actually came online in 2024. It found the world added ~582 GW of renewables that year. That total was about 20% more than in 2023. Different methods can explain the gap with IEA forecasts. But both show a sharp rise in clean power.

Costs Now Beat Fossil for New Build

Cost is the biggest story. Lazard’s 2025 LCOE+ report says renewables remain the most cost-competitive form of new power on an unsubsidized basis. That’s true even with supply chain bumps. And it matters as grids chase fast demand growth from data centers, EVs, and factories.

IRENA reaches the same point from a different angle. It reports that in 2024, about 91% of newly commissioned utility-scale renewable projects produced power at lower cost than the cheapest new fossil option. Falling battery prices also help balance solar and wind across the day.

From Targets to Steel in the Ground

Ambition means little without projects. Across North America and beyond, developers are moving from plans to sites. One example is O3 Energy. Since 2011, the firm has offered solar project development, financing, construction, asset management, and O&M. It focuses on heavy energy users and helps them cut bills and risk.

Good developers reduce headaches. They pick sites, manage interconnection, design systems, and line up capital. O3 Energy describes a time-tested process that aims to lower risk and keep schedules on track. For customers, that can mean faster payback and more control over future costs.

Why Execution Matters

Speed: Solar and wind can be built in months, not years.

Scale: Projects range from rooftops to utility-scale plants.

Price stability: Sun and wind are free, so there’s no fuel price shock.

Local value: Construction brings jobs and tax revenue.

Reliability: Grids Are Adapting

As clean energy grows, grids must adapt. They need more transmission, faster interconnection, and smarter software. Storage helps too. Batteries can shift solar from noon to evening. They can also respond within milliseconds to support frequency. With planning, regions are keeping reliability steady while adding lots of clean power.

What the Next Five Years Could Look Like

The IEA expects renewables to supply a much bigger share of power by 2030. The share grew to about 30% in 2023 and is forecast to reach about 46% by 2030. Most of that growth comes from solar and wind. Electrification then cuts emissions in transport, industry, and buildings.

Quick Snapshot: Then vs. Now

Topic 1977 2024–2030 Energy message Conserve. Cut oil imports. Plan ahead. “Moral equivalent of war.” Build renewables fast. Expand grids and storage. Electrify uses. Costs Fossil fuels set prices amid shocks. Renewables are the lowest-cost new build in many markets. New capacity Slow growth in clean power. IEA forecasts rising annual additions through 2030; IRENA counted ~582 GW added in 2024. Share of electricity Small and emerging. ~30% in 2023; ~46% expected by 2030. Developers Limited clean energy pipeline. Experienced firms like O3 Energy scale projects end-to-end.

Why This Shift Helps Households and Businesses

Lower long-run bills: No fuel costs. Less exposure to price spikes.

Faster builds: Meet new demand from AI, EVs, and industry sooner.

Cleaner air: Fewer pollutants near homes and schools.

Resilience: Storage and demand response can back up the grid.

Headwinds to Watch

Yes, challenges remain. Permitting can be slow. Supply chains can tighten. Geopolitics can push prices up. These risks are real. But the direction is clear. Global leaders and analysts say clean energy is pulling ahead, even as they urge faster action.

Deadline alert

California: Under SB 261, the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, covered entities are required to post their first biennial climate-related financial risk report to CARB’s public docket by January 1, 2026. For SB 253, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, CARB has proposed June 30, 2026 as the initial deadline for Scope 1 and 2 reporting.

California: for SB 54, the Extended Producer Responsibility Law, register with the Circular Action Alliance (CAA) by September 5, 2025, and report data for covered material sold or distributed in California in 2023 to CAA by November 15, 2025.

Canada: Phase 1 of reporting to the Federal Plastics Registry is due by September 29, 2025.

Please also see our ESG calendar for information about key reporting deadlines around the world.

Disclosures and voluntary reporting

Key points from CARB’s August 21 virtual public workshop on the California Corporate Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. In 2023, California passed SB 253, requiring large companies doing business in California to annually disclose their GHG emissions, and SB 261, requiring disclosure of material climate-related financial risks. Reporting requirements under those laws begin in 2026. The August 21 California Air Resources Board (CARB) workshop on the proposed fee regulation and implementation guidance for both bills featured a regulatory update from CARB staff outlining key aspects of the proposed regulations governing upcoming climate disclosure requirements, followed by an extensive public comment session with participation from various stakeholders. CARB staff opened the workshop with an overview of the regulatory process and key requirements under both measures, emphasizing that for the initial reporting cycle, good faith efforts and use of best available data will be accepted. Regarding potential fee structures, CARB is proposing a flat annual fee for each covered entity of $3,106 under SB 253 and $1,403 for SB 261. Entities subject to both laws pay both fees.

The public comment period was highly active, with over 90 stakeholders raising a range of questions and concerns in a tight timeframe. Commenters particularly sought clarification on parent vs. subsidiary liability; the feasibility of reporting deadlines; the definitions of “doing business in California” and “revenue” (earlier in the meeting, staff stated that CARB is already working to clarify the regulatory definition of the former); the frequency of fee assessment and how fees would apply to entities near the revenue threshold or with changing business status; whether existing sustainability or SEC filings could satisfy SB 261 requirements if they align with TCFD or IFRS standards; and whether only CARB-accredited verifiers could provide assurance. Going forward, CARB stated, it will continue refining regulatory definitions, fee structures, and reporting templates based on stakeholder feedback. Written comments are strongly encouraged and will be accepted through the newly opened public docket. Additional guidance and draft materials are expected in the coming months, with formal rulemaking and board consideration scheduled for late 2025.

Initiative launched to preserve, advance carbon accounting models that are widely used in disclosure reporting. On August 11, Stanford University’s Stanford Sustainable Solutions Lab and sustainability data provider Watershed announced Cornerstone, an initiative that will provide open access to the US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output model (USEEIO), EPA’s popular environmental-economic carbon accounting model of US goods and services, and Watershed’s own Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive (CEDA). Those two models are used by businesses around the world to calculate their Scope 3 emissions in order to comply with EU and California reporting requirements and to understand the impact of their operations – the USEEIO database is reportedly the third most viewed of more than 281,000 federal data sets on data.gov. EPA announced on August 8 that, starting in September, it would no longer update the USEEIO models. Watershed stated of Cornerstone that in the coming months the USEEIO and CEDA models will be merged into “a single global open multi-regional input output model” to “drive significant improvements in scope 3 measurements and expand beyond greenhouse gas pollution to assess regional air and water quality, water use, and waste generation” and “offer a durable common standard for companies, governments, and researchers.” Serving as Cornerstone’s technical director is Dr. Wesley Ingwersen, the architect of the USEEIO model, who joined Stanford after being suspended from EPA in June. Two other leading experts in emissions measurement, Dr. Steven Wright and Dr. Sangwon Suh, will serve as Cornerstone’s technical advisors.

Omnibus I in the news. The EU continues to advance Omnibus I, the set of proposed simplification measures that will streamline key reporting and compliance requirements of the bloc’s Green Deal – the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), EU Green Taxonomy, and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. Here are the latest developments:

The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) on July 31 released revised and simplified exposure drafts of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The standards set out in the ESRS are foundational to the CSRD. Among the revisions, mandatory datapoints as well as mandatory and voluntary disclosures have been greatly reduced, and the double materiality assessment has been refined, removing all voluntary disclosures and clarifying language. Overall, the revised ESRS are less than half the length of the originals. The public consultation on the simplified ESRA is open through September 29.

As it awaits the outcome of the Omnibus I reforms, on August 11 the European Banking Authority (EBA) released a no action letter recommending that regulators not prioritize the enforcement of new ESG Pillar 3 disclosure requirements for banks for now. The steady advance of the Omnibus I reforms has created, for the moment, an uncertain regulatory environment which, EBA stated, could place a “disproportionate compliance burden” on smaller financial institutions could face; banks in general could be subject to conflicting disclosure requirements. In July, the EBA proposed amendments that would simplify its guidelines on product oversight and governance arrangements for retail banking products. Its virtual public hearing on the proposed amendments takes place on September 21. Register for it here by September 8.

The European Commission has officially adopted the VSME Standard – a streamlined, updated version of reporting standards that will allow small and medium-sized enterprises that fall outside the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) to voluntarily report their disclosures. The VSME Standard is regarded as particularly useful for small businesses that are part of the value chain of larger entities, providing them with a compatible reporting format. The VSME Standard was developed by EFRAG.

Eight EU countries have adopted legislation to implement the “stop the clock” directive, which delays the implementation of key sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements set out in the EU’s Green New Deal as Omnibus I proceeds. The eight are Cyprus, Estonia, France, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Norway, and Poland. Ten others – Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Slovenia, and Sweden – have drafted but not yet adopted implementing legislation.

UK: FCA sustainability reporting framework to be “streamlined and enhanced.” In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is set to streamline and enhance its sustainability reporting framework after reviewing how firms have implemented climate-related disclosure rules. The review found that while the rules have improved firms’ consideration of climate risks and increased transparency, challenges remain, including the complexity and volume of disclosures, data limitations, and the need to make reports more useful for different types of investors. The FCA plans to simplify disclosure requirements, align reporting timelines across regimes like TCFD and SDR, and promote international consistency, all while maintaining high standards to prevent greenwashing and support investor trust. Additionally, the FCA is focusing on improving the sustainability-linked loans market by encouraging better-structured deals, stronger governance, and clearer standards, aiming to position the UK as a leader in sustainable and transition finance. Our alert tells you more.

ISS will update ESQS methodology in Q4. ISS Sustainability Solutions has announced that in Q4 2025 it will release updates to its Environmental & Social Disclosure QualityScore (ESQS) methodology. Companies and investors use the ESQS methodology to evaluate corporate governance practices in four areas: board structure, shareholder rights, compensation, and audit and risk oversight. An ISS press release states that among the changes being introduced, 35 new factors will be added to the ESQS, “including more detailed data points regarding Scope 3 GHG emissions, business ethics, as well as health and safety.” Nine other factors will be removed entirely, and two will be removed for certain industries “due to their decreasing relevance.” ISS will release more granular details about the updates in September.

Ltd, a Dublin-based company that operates the website and app for the fast-fashion e-commerce giant Shein, over environmental claims on Shein's platforms. The fine, AGCM stated on August 4, “is for the use of misleading and deceptive environmental messages and claims – known as greenwashing.” As we reported in October, the AGCM’s investigation looked at statements on Shein's website that ""convey an image of production and commercial sustainability of its garments through generic, vague, confusing and/or misleading environmental claims"" as well as statements emphasizing Shein’s commitment to decarbonization, sustainability, and recyclability. AGCM concluded this month that such statements were ""false or at least confusing.” Statements Shein made about its goal of reducing its GHG emissions, AGCM also found, were vague and misleading “and were even contradicted by an actual increase in Shein’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 and 2024.” Also on August 4, Shein announced it “is implementing targeted improvements across its supply chain” as part of its “ongoing work to address the environmental impact of its operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions where feasible.” That plan, the company stated, will include replacing some diesel trucks in its operations in China with 130 custom-designed electric vehicles as well as implementing measures to enhance its logistics.

Putative class action alleges a premium water brand’s claims of purity are false and deceptive. A putative class action case filed on August 11 charges that Mountain Valley Spring Water’s premium products are being falsely advertised as “purely sourced,” “Free of pollutants,” and “exceptionally healthful.” The complaint, brought by Florida consumer Jeffrey Nadel against Mountain Valley, Primo Water Corporation, and Primo North America, states that independent laboratory testing of Mountain Valley Waters in July 2025 “detected arsenic, uranium, and bromoform – all substances with EPA Maximum Contaminant Level Goals of zero, meaning there is no safe level for human consumption,” as well as “multiple contaminants for which the EPA has established Maximum Contaminant Level Goals.” Nadel stated that he has purchased Mountain Valley Spring water for years, paying its premium price because he believed the company’s statement that he was purchasing “the very best bottled water you can drink.” Instead, his complaint states, consumers of the premium waters were purchasing “water containing detectable carcinogens and disinfection byproducts.” Nadel is seeking class certification as well as a judgment against the defendants “for violations of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and all applicable state consumer protection statutes.” This case is in its earliest stages.

India: Parliamentary committee urges creation of ESG oversight body to combat greenwashing. In India, the parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance has called on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to create an ESG oversight body “for actively combating greenwashing through specialised forensic expertise.” Among the committee’s other recommendations, it also called for India’s Companies Act, 2013 to be amended to add ESG objectives to the fiduciary responsibilities of company directors. The committee’s report was tabled on August 4.

Sustainability: Regulatory

US rejects IMO’s net zero framework and global pricing mechanism for carbon emissions from ships. As we've previously reported, in April International Maritime Organization (IMO) member nations agreed to implement a global pricing mechanism for carbon emissions from ships and to legally binding targets for such emissions: a 20 to 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, a 70 percent reduction by 2040, and net-zero “by or around” 2050. The US did not take part in that agreement, leaving the negotiations before the vote occurred. This month, the US formally rejected the agreement. The August 11 joint statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that “the proposed framework is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organization,” then went on to warn any IMO members that persist in supporting the net-zero framework that the US will ”not hesitate to retaliate” against them. The draft regulations amending the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships’ Annex VI are set to be adopted in October during an extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee. Detailed implementation guidelines are expected to be approved in spring 2026, and the regulations are expected to enter into force in early 2027. Reuters report that many large shipping companies have already committed to achieving net-zero operations by 2050.

Plans to terminate Orbiting Carbon Observatories. The Trump Administration has reportedly asked NASA to formulate plans to terminate the Orbiting Carbon Observatories (OCO), the only federal satellite missions created specifically to monitor greenhouse gases. NASA reports that the termination of the OCOs is ""to align with the President's agenda and budget priorities"" in the proposed budget for FY2026. The equipment on the two OCO satellites is regarded as state of the art; the data the OCOs gather is extensively used by energy companies, businesses, the USDA, farmers, and private agricultural consulting companies both to understand the global distribution of CO2 and to measure plant growth and track crop yields. The OCOs have been funded by Congress through the 2025 fiscal year, which ends September 30. On August 8, NASA announced Research Opportunities for International Space Station Utilization “seeking submissions for partnerships for the continued operations and data collection of three Earth science missions” attached to the International Space Station – among them one of the OCO missions. The other OCO is free-flying; if that mission is terminated, the satellite would be abandoned to burn up in the atmosphere.

New White House AI Action Plan and EO aim to streamline environmental review and data center permitting. An Executive Order and accompanying Action Plan issued in late July aim to support AI development and the digital transformation by streamlining federal permitting and environmental review of new data centers that constitute “Qualifying Projects.” The Action Plan and EO specifically call for reducing or eliminating regulatory barriers to increasing US semiconductor manufacturing and electricity generation capacity, as well as modernizing electricity transmission. See our alert.

California legislator proposes reauthorization, some reforms to cap-and-trade program. As we reported in April, California Governor Gavin Newsom has urged the state legislature to extend the long-running cap-and-trade emissions program, a measure proposed and then signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006. Without further action, the program will expire in 2030. On August 19, Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin (D-Thousand Oaks) announced a proposal that would reauthorize the program and reform certain aspects of it. For instance, under the current program, free allowances are allocated to some participants in industries that are both energy intensive and trade exposed and thus at risk of leaving the state. Under Irwin’s proposal, the regulatory formula used to award free allowances would be redesigned to reflect more up-to-date trade data. Her proposal would also expand the use of purchased offsets. At this writing, whether Irwin’s proposal will be addressed in this year’s legislative session, which ends September 12, is unclear. In the decade leading up to 2024, California funded $28 billion in “climate investments” through the cap-and-trade program, broadly ranging from wildfire prevention and environmental restoration to low-carbon transit and electric vehicle rebates. The program also funds the California Climate Credit, which is applied to state residents’ electric and gas bills. Irwin’s proposal would alter the timing of that refund, too, moving it to the time of year when utility bills are highest.

SB 54 Advisory Board provides updates on implementing California’s EPR law for packaging. On August 15, the SB 54 Advisory Board met to update stakeholders on the progress of implementing California’s SB 54, the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act. The meeting included a detailed presentation on SB 54’s ongoing Source Reduction & Material Design Needs Assessment. The timeline for the assessment is aggressive: draft and final reports are due throughout the fall of 2025. The Advisory Board went on to provide an update on the status of rulemaking, recent regulatory changes, and the upcoming formal public comment period. Notably, proposed regulatory changes would clarify that only components of FDA/USDA-regulated materials with irreconcilable conflicts are excluded, not entire packages. Compostable plastics standards would also require full biological decomposition with no toxic residues. Local jurisdictions may now apply for exemptions or extensions at any time, even after a notice of violation, and penalties are paused during that review. Furthermore, the Covered Material Categories list and producer reporting guidance are being updated, with new versions expected soon.

Finally, the Circular Action Alliance (CAA), the producer responsibility organization tasked with overseeing industry compliance with SB 54, presented its plans for stakeholder engagement and program development, focusing on transparency and inclusivity. CAA is encouraging early producer engagement for data reporting and is finalizing interim agreements to facilitate compliance ahead of final regulations. Elements of the draft program plan, CAA said, will be brought to the Advisory Board for review and discussion before the full plan is submitted in June 2026, rather than presenting the entire plan at once.

Plastics treaty talks fail. Negotiations this month in Geneva to agree on an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution have collapsed. As we reported last month, the UN’s Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC) had convened this session in hopes of finalizing an agreement after the prior session, in Busan in December 2024, failed. As the World Economic Forum reported, “No agreement to reach stricter, enforceable rules to reduce plastic pollution was achieved after 10 days of negotiations by nations” because “consensus could not be reached on key issues, such as whether the treaty should impose caps on new plastic production or put its focus instead on waste management, reuse and improved design.” This is not the end for the treaty, however; negotiations are expected to resume in the future, although a date has not been set. DLA Piper was present at the Geneva meeting to represent the Environmental Law Institute, which has observer status in the negotiations.

European Commission opens public consultation for Circular Economy Act. On August 1, the European Commission (EC) opened a public consultation and call for evidence in support of the forthcoming Circular Economy Act. The EC states that the act, due for adoption in 2026, “aims to establish a Single Market for secondary raw materials, increase the supply of high-quality recycled materials and stimulate demand for these materials in the EU.” The consultation is part of the larger impact assessment process for the act, through which the EC is seeking a better understanding of “the bottlenecks and opportunities for the wider deployment of a circular economy.” The public consultation period is open until November 6, 2025, via the Have Your Say portal.

Sustainability: Litigation

Federal Court denies preliminary injunction against California’s SB 253 and SB 261. On August 13, the US District Court for the Central District of California issued an order in Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America et al. v. California Air Resources Board denying the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to halt enforcement of California Senate Bills 253 (the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act) and 261 (the Climate-Related Financial Risk Disclosure Program). The challenge, on First Amendment grounds, argued that the two laws’ disclosure requirements amount to compelled speech and are unconstitutional. The court’s analysis focused on several key issues. Applying different standards of review, the court found that SB 253 was reasonably related to substantial government interests, and that SB 261 was sufficiently tailored to the state’s objectives. The court also determined that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on their First Amendment claims against either law. Additionally, the court found that the balance of equities and the public interest weighed against granting an injunction, as enjoining the laws would delay California’s efforts to advance its climate and investor protection goals. The court’s order allows the state to move forward with implementation while this litigation proceeds. The plaintiffs have already filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit, and the court has set a briefing schedule for plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction pending resolution of the appeal. That motion will be heard on September 15, 2025. See some of our earlier coverage of this litigation here.

Vermont moves to dismiss Climate Superfund Law challenges. On August 15, the state of Vermont asked the US District Court for the District of Vermont to dismiss three lawsuits that seek to overturn Vermont’s Act 122, the Climate Superfund Act. One of the suits, brought in January by the US Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, charges that the Vermont law is preempted by the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), violates the Constitution’s Dormant and Foreign Commerce Clauses as well as Eighth Amendment protections against excessive fines, and that the law would harm other states through higher energy costs. That suit was joined by a coalition of 24 states led by West Virginia on May 1. The third suit, brought in May by the Department of Justice, points to President Donald Trump’s April Executive Order, Protecting American Energy From State Overreach, and alleges that the Vermont law is preempted by the CAA and the foreign affairs doctrine. Vermont’s motion to dismiss addresses these charges, arguing that Act 122 “does not conflict with federal law or policy, regulate fossil fuel emissions, or punish fossil fuel producers” and that it is a “valid exercise of Vermont’s traditional authority to raise revenue, protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, and mitigate environmental harms inside its borders.”

Administration’s lawsuit against New York Climate Superfund law will stay in the SDNY. The US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) has denied the state of New York’s request to move USA and EPA v. New York – the Administration’s constitutional challenge to New York’s Climate Superfund law – to a different venue. New York had sought to move the case to the Northern District of New York, which is already hearing a separate challenge to the law brought by 22 Republican-led states and two trade groups. On August 4, the court ruled that the case would remain in the SDNY for a number of reasons, most notably the government's right to proceed in its preferred jurisdiction. “The United States has selected this forum,” the court stated, “and on these facts, its choice is entitled to great deference.”

Lawsuit targets Oregon’s Plastic Pollution and Recycling Modernization Act. The National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors has sued Oregon’s Department of Environmental Quality, Environmental Quality Commission, and Attorney General, seeking to halt implementation of and invalidate Oregon’s Plastic Pollution and Recycling Modernization Act. The outcome of this litigation could have broad implications for the RMA and similar EPR laws in other states. Our alert explores the background of the case and its potential impacts for producers in the state and beyond.

City of Chicago v BP remanded to lower court. Also on August 4, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit denied attempts by the defendants in City of Chicago v BP P.L.C. et al to block the court’s May 2025 order remanding the case to Cook County Circuit Court. In this lawsuit, originally filed in March 2024, Chicago is alleging that, for decades, the fossil fuel industry knowingly concealed the link between fossil fuel use and climate change to drive fossil fuel consumption, violating numerous Chicago laws and leading to “an enormous, foreseeable, and avoidable increase in anthropogenic GHG emissions and accelerated global warming, bringing devastating consequences to the City and its people.” The complaint goes on to ask the court to hold the plaintiffs financially accountable.

Administration asks court to dismiss youth-led lawsuit over energy EOs. Also on August 4, the Trump Administration asked the US District Court for the District of Montana to dismiss Lighthiser v. Trump, a youth-led lawsuit charging that three of the President’s energy-related Executive Orders (EOs) will accelerate climate change, causing “irreversible harm” to the plaintiffs and violating their constitutional rights to life and liberty. As we reported in May, the plaintiffs, among them litigants who prevailed in the landmark Held v. Montana case, charge that the EOs “falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives.” They are asking the US District Court for the District of Montana to invalidate the EOs and order the President, as well as 11 federal agencies also named as defendants, not to enforce or implement them. The Administration’s August 4 brief argues that the court should dismiss the case because, among other things, the plaintiffs’ claims are nonjusticiable, the plaintiffs lack Article III standing (meaning they must be able to show a concrete, personal stake in the outcome of a case), and the plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege that their climate injuries are traceable to the three challenged executive orders. On August 13, the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming, as well as the Territory of Guam, asked the court to allow them to join the case as defendant-intervenors.

Charleston’s climate accountability suit is dismissed. On August 5, the Court of Common Pleas for South Carolina’s Ninth Judicial Circuit dismissed the City of Charleston’s climate accountability suit, originally filed in 2020, against two dozen energy companies. The court concluded that state tort law cannot be used to hold these multinationals accountable for damages caused by GHG emissions and that it lacked jurisdiction over the defendants. At this writing, the city is considering whether to appeal. The case is City of Charleston v. Brabham Oil Co.

DC Circuit rejects constitutional challenge to AIM Act. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has rejected a constitutional challenge to the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act. That act requires a substantial phasedown by 2036 in US production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) – fluorinated gases widely used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and other applications. The Act, the EPA states on its website, facilitates this goal in three ways: by “(1) phasing down HFC production and consumption through an allowance allocation program, (2) facilitating sector-based transitions to next-generation technologies, and (3) issuing certain regulations for purposes of maximizing reclamation and minimizing releases of HFCs from equipment.” The plaintiff argued, among other things, that the AIM Act unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to the EPA. The court noted in its August 1 ruling that to avoid a non-delegation claim, legislation “must contain an ‘intelligible principle’ to guide an agency’s action.” The Aim Act, the court concluded, “easily passes muster.” The case is iGas Holdings, Inc., et al., v. EPA.

Supply chain integrity

DHS adds 5 Chinese industries, including steel and lithium, as high priority sectors for UFLPA border enforcement. On August 19, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it is designating five additional Chinese sectors as high priorities for enforcement under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). Enacted in 2021, the UFLPA aims to “ensure that goods made with forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region [XUAR] of the People’s Republic of China do not enter the United States market.” It creates a rebuttable presumption that goods with any input from the Xinjiang Region in the People’s Republic of China or made by certain entities were manufactured in part or wholly by forced labor and, therefore, are prohibited from entry into the United States. To overcome the rebuttable presumption and receive an exception from US Customs and Border Protection, importers must meet a high evidentiary standard in demonstrating that the goods were not made with forced labor, among other requirements. The five new categories are steel, copper, lithium, caustic soda – which has numerous industrial applications – and red dates.

Australia: Consultation on strengthening the Modern Slavery Act. Australia’s Attorney-General has opened a public consultation process seeking input from the public on ways to strengthen the Modern Slavery Act 2018. The government’s press release on the consultation states that the Act is “a key pillar of Australia’s response to modern slavery. It requires certain large businesses based or operating in Australia to report on how they assess and address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains.” The consultation particularly seeks suggestions on enhancing the reporting framework for covered businesses,” to simplify and improve reporting, and address non compliance.” The consultation period closes on September 1.

Energy and natural resources

Wright: EPA is “reviewing” and planning “updated” National Climate Assessments, plus latest developments around the Endangerment Finding. During an August 5 appearance on the CNN program The Source, Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that the EPA is “reviewing” past versions of the National Climate Assessment (NCA) “and we will come out with updated reports.” The National Climate Assessment is a Congressionally mandated scientific report issued every four to five years summarizing the impacts of climate change on the US. Regarded as a pre-eminent source of scientific information, the NCA supports decision-making by governments, researchers, and businesses. In April, the Administration eliminated funding for the US Global Change Research Program, terminating the hundreds of scientists already working on the 2028 NCA. In July, the purpose-built website housing the 2023 NCA went dark. Relatedly, on July 23, the EPA proposed revoking the Endangerment Finding – the foundation for GHG regulation under the Clean Air Act and the backbone of US climate policy; that same day, the Department of Energy (DOE) released A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate, a report written by five contributors over two months that questions the severity of climate change.

Hundreds of veteran climate scientists have responded to these developments. Among their actions, during the week of August 4, the National Academy of Sciences announced it is fast-tracking a comprehensive, self-funded review of climate science findings since 2009, the year the Endangerment Finding was originally issued. In September, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society will issue a formal call for manuscripts on climate change in the US. Of note, the scientists involved in these and other similar efforts are not claiming their work will be sufficient to replace the National Climate Assessment.

On August 12, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists filed suit in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Secretary Wright, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA, and the DOE, alleging that they utilized an unlawful advisory committee that worked in secret for months to produce a report for DOE and EPA that would provide justification for their predetermined goal of rescinding the Endangerment Finding, arguing that federal law does not permit agencies to create or rely on such secret, unaccountable groups when engaged in policymaking. That case, in its earliest stages, is Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Wright.

On August 15, Dr. H. Christopher Frey, formerly the EPA’s Deputy Assistant Administrator for Science Policy, filed a “request for correction”– a formal mechanism calling on the DOE to remedy inaccuracies in the July 23 report that violate federal quality guidelines. In an article looking at legal concerns about the report, Dr. Frey noted that in their attempts to rescind the Endangerment Finding, “the Energy Department and the EPA seem to have run afoul of four laws in particular that may be tricky for the administration to get around.”

IEA: Electricity generation from renewables will overtake coal as soon as this year. As the global demand for electricity continues to expand, the International Energy Agency (IEA) states, electricity generation from renewable energy sources is forecast to overtake coal-fired generation as the world’s leading source of electricity as early as 2025 or by 2026. Natural gas and nuclear power will also play increasingly significant roles in electricity generation. The IEA’s forecast is set out in its Electricity Mid-Year Update 2025. The world’s growing demand for electricity, IEA concludes, will primarily be met by wind and solar photovoltaic energy, which it predicts will cover over 90 percent of the increase in global electricity demand in 2025; hydro power will modestly enhance renewables’ reach. Coal’s importance, the IEA states, will continue to slowly decline, while the US, India, and other Asian countries have increased their dependence on coal-fired generation, its use is shrinking in the EU and China. Alongside that shift, nuclear power generation is set to hit a new record in 2025, and will continue to rise in 2026, and multiple regions are switching from coal to gas to generate electricity. See the Electricity Mid-Year Update 2025 here.

Philippines to introduce Carbon Credit Policy. The Department of Energy (DOE) of the Philippines will launch a Carbon Credit Policy for its energy sector. In his announcement on August 18, Energy Undersecretary Felix William B. Fuentebella stated that the policy “will equip our energy sector with the tools to generate and manage carbon credits with integrity, ensuring every ton of reduced carbon dioxide is real and verifiable.” The policy advances the Philippines’ recent moves to advance its commitment to the clean energy transition, among them its 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Singapore to collaborate on carbon credits under Paris Agreement Article 6, which supports international cooperation to tackle climate change and unlock financial support for developing countries.

Germany: Cabinet approves two draft bills supporting climate goals. On August 6, Germany’s federal cabinet approved two draft bills to support the energy transition. The first, addressing Germany’s goal of eliminating fossil fuel-based heating by 2045, would accelerate the development of geothermal energy projects. The draft bill would streamline the current regulatory process and would classify geothermal plants, heat pumps, thermal storage, and district heating pipelines as of ""overriding public interest"" – the same classification already applied to wind and solar projects. The second draft bill approved by the cabinet would amend the Carbon Dioxide Storage Act to accelerate planning and approval for CO2 capture, transport, and storage projects. This measure particularly addresses the concerns of companies in hard-to-abate industries – such as cement and lime production – allowing them, with state approval, to store CO2 offshore, under the seabed, or inland. CO2 capture projects would also be reclassified as of “overriding public interest.” Both draft bills now go to the Bundestag.

Sustainability in financial services

Significant decline in banks’ fossil fuel project financing. Financing from Wall Street’s top six banks for fossil fuel projects has significantly declined so far this year compared to the same period in 2024, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF, a research division of Bloomberg LP. Reviewing data on investments made from January 1 to August 1, researchers found that this year the most prominent banks invested $73 billion in oil, gas, and coal projects, a decline of 25 percent over the same time frame last year. Bloomberg reporter Alastair Marsh observed, “The statistics suggest that, despite political headwinds, US banks may now be reducing emissions in response to the forces of capitalism.”

“Fair banking” Executive Order targets politicized debanking and reputational risk. President Donald Trump’s August 7 Executive Order “Guaranteeing Fair Banking for all Americans” broadly prohibits banks and other financial institutions from engaging in politicized or unlawful debanking – essentially, from restricting or denying credit, deposit, or other financial services to customers and potential customers based on political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities. Our alert sets out proactive steps supervised institutions may wish to consider in this evolving landscape.

China updates Green Taxonomy via new Catalog of Green Finance Endorsed Products. Aiming to boost liquidity in green finance, China has announced that it is updating its Green Taxonomy, consolidating formerly separate bond and loan market standards for economic activities into a single Catalog of Green Finance Endorsed Products. That catalog defines the economic activities that qualify as green or environmentally sustainable across a wide swathe of industries. Issued by the People’s Bank of China, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the catalog goes into effect on October 1.

CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Wyoming regulators will assume oversight for toxic coal ash storage and remediation at coal-fired power plants in the state — a role historically handled by federal regulators.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced his agency’s proposal to grant primacy of the Coal Combustion Residuals program to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality at a press conference Thursday at the Capitol.

“Wyoming has been trying very hard for years to be able to take primacy, to take control over its own destiny in overseeing coal combustion residuals,” Zeldin told a roomful of reporters, EPA staffers and a handful of Wyoming lawmakers. “One of the principles at the EPA is advancing cooperative federalism. It is our desire to improve our relationship with states [and] local governments.”

Zeldin was joined by a trio of Republicans — EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western (a former Wyoming lawmaker), Gov. Mark Gordon and Wyoming U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis — along with Wyoming DEQ Director Todd Parfitt. Each praised Zeldin and the rest of the Trump administration for putting states in charge of federal environmental programs and for rolling back federal regulations on fossil fuel industries — most of which were an overreach by Democratic administrations that stifle innovation and the U.S. economy, they said.

“I couldn’t believe that Lee Zeldin was willing to take the EPA on,” Lummis said. “What a heavy lift, because it had been used in this country to thwart economic activity and to second guess the experts in this deal, and it changed in a heartbeat. It changed the minute that Lee Zeldin became the administrator.”

Gordon concurred.

“You are a marvelous breath of fresh air,” he said. “We dealt with an administration that used regulation to frustrate progress, and I think, today, it is a remarkable moment to talk about how regulation, in Wyoming, is about doing things the right way.”

Coal ash

When power plants burn coal, heavy residues, known as clinker and slag, accumulate within the exhaust systems. It also produces a finer ash, most of which is captured via various filtration methods. All of those residuals are toxic. The substances are typically stored in coal ash ponds, and federal regulations — specifically, the Coal Combustion Residuals program — require that the sites be lined with materials to prevent seepage into surface waters or aquifers.

The program also requires monitoring to ensure containment.

There are only four active and two legacy coal ash sites in Wyoming that fall under the federal program, according to Wyoming DEQ. The only change in granting the DEQ primacy over the management of those sites, Parfitt told WyoFile, is that the state agency will add environmental stipulations to ensure protections.

Zeldin’s declaration on Thursday kicked off a 60-day public comment period on the proposal. The EPA will also hold a public hearing on Oct. 30 in Cheyenne. For more information about how to comment, and about the public hearing, go to the EPA’s Wyoming CCR permit program webpage.

The short answer is something, rather than nothing. Yes, the Earth is well past the 1.5 degree Celsius average temperature rise that was widely seen, and is, the tipping point for global warming and the consequent weather and ocean-rise factors from which there is no real return, at least for hundreds of years.

“California wildfires burn as much carbon into the atmosphere as cars and trucks and natural-gas turbines!” we are told. Well, let’s then work on dampening down wildfires while we’re at it. One thing that contributes to more of them is hot and dry wildlands.

“But India and China are big emissions cheaters,” we are told, “always with the new coal plants!” The idea that this should prevent us from leading the way in cutting back on the dirtiest form of energy production makes zero political or scientific sense.

“And California is just one state. Why get cracking on green energy here when they won’t in Wyoming” cry the do-nothings. Just because your neighbor lives a life of crime is no reason to become a jewel thief. There are other glamour professions.

“But the planet is old, and big. Puny humans can’t affect it.”: This is universally acknowledged by people who have studied the matter, i.e. scientists, and not just guys who make stuff up and then write a letter to the editor, that this is demonstrably not the case, and has not been since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when the world began to be choked by smoke and smog.

Bill McKibben, the Altadena kid turned Harvard Crimson editor turned New Yorker staff writer turned Vermont college professor, who in 1989 wrote the doomsday book “The End of Nature,” now acknowledges that though nature did “end” — humans, though part of nature, have affected the climate in ways that are not natural — we still have it within our power to mitigate the problem.

His new book, “Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization,” published this month, is undoomsday optimistic.

He notes that in our own state we have almost halved the use of natural gas in just the last two years, progress for California that can be modeled elsewhere.

Writing the book’s introduction during a Vermont rain last winter that should have been snow, he notes that “2024 was the hottest year on record — indeed, the paleoclimatologists said it had been the hottest year in the last 125,000.” The local hook: “Oh, and Los Angeles caught fire; among the least important results of that conflagration was that the home of my earliest memories, up against the Altadena hills, burned to the ground.”

What gives McKibben hope, he writes, is that within the last several years we crossed the point at which “producing energy from the sun dropped below the cost of fossil fuel.” It is no longer “the Whole Foods of power — nice, but pricey.” Photovoltaic cells and wind turbines as well are now “the Costco of energy, inexpensive and available in bulk.”

Problem is, of course, in this nation at least, that we live in the short term under the rule of a president who claims to believe, because he made it up, that “climate change is a hoax.” Not only that; as a headline that ran on the second day of his return to the Oval Office has it, “Trump Wants to Unleash Energy, as Long as It’s Not Wind or Solar.”

He doesn’t like the look of turbines off Nantucket, and he notes that the sun disappears at night. What, you think the Santa Barbara surfers like the looks of the oil derricks off Rincon?

Solar and wind aren’t the only answers. Responsible energy use by us all during the transition; battery research in our universities; sustainable building practices — all will help, until we rid ourselves of the president who said of solar on the campaign trail: “It’s all steel and glass and wires.

The administration of President Trump is creating unhealthy fish stocks in two ways — by deregulating fishing and by denying climate impacts on fish and habitat and increasing our nation’s focus on producing fossil fuels that continue to harm habitat, fish and fisheries.
Historically, we have opened and closed fisheries to make sure we maintain fish stocks at sustainable levels.
""Anglers are now targeting tautog, the water is clear, and they are starting to catch fish,"" Holland said.
Keeper fish are averaging 3 to 5 pounds.” Olson said: “No reports yet of keeper fish being caught in the Bay but some good reports from anglers fishing structure off Narragansett.""","The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management halted construction of the Revolution Wind offshore wind farm in Rhode Island, citing national security interests.

The project, which is 80% complete, has faced criticism from some fishermen while being supported by others for its potential to create jobs and contribute to clean energy.

Senator Jack Reed disputes the national security rationale, stating the Defense Department and Coast Guard were involved in the project's review.

Matthew Giacona, the acting director of the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, halted construction at Revolution Wind off Rhode Island on Aug. 22, because of “national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone.”

Revolution Wind is 80% built with 45 of 65 turbines installed. The project is estimated to cost more than $1 billion and, according to union officials, has generated about 1,000 jobs.

I see negative climate impacts on the water every day and they have been created by humans burning fossil fuels and are growing exponentially. I cancel charter trips 20% more often now due to high seas and storms.

The administration of President Trump is creating unhealthy fish stocks in two ways — by deregulating fishing and by denying climate impacts on fish and habitat and increasing our nation’s focus on producing fossil fuels that continue to harm habitat, fish and fisheries.

Deregulation is simple to understand. Historically, we have opened and closed fisheries to make sure we maintain fish stocks at sustainable levels. When we get close to a science-based quota, we close a fishery. And when we have enough fish in the water, we open it.

We need to leave enough fish in the water so they reproduce at sustainable levels or they will be fished into extinction. Hundreds of fish stocks have been protected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the federal fishing law of this nation that allows authorities to open and close fishing. The ability to do this effectively is being taken away by administration executive orders 14192 on deregulation and 14276 on seafood competitiveness.

These executive orders aim to deregulate seafood to enhance our nation’s trade balance by simply taking more fish. The answer to growing fish stocks is to support NOAA with full funding so it can conduct the proper science to meet changing ocean conditions, do appropriate stock assessments to identify the health and location of fish stocks and modernize its data systems to provide more robust fishing data. Eliminating these programs will worsen fishing conditions.

The warming Earth and oceans (the warmest ever) from sunlight and greenhouse gases have created massive and frequent wildfires, horrific storms, flooding, sea level rise, ocean acidification and warming waters that have had negative impacts on fish reproduction along with stock shifts.

We have an influx of warm-water fish here, too, with the danger of overfishing them. Large animals such as the 800-pound bluefin tuna caught this month at the mouth of Narragansett Bay, sharks of all types, whales and porpoises are feeding just a mile or two off our coast due to warm water attracting robust bait profiles, the food they like to eat.

“It’s not about national security,” said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Reed disputed the administration's rationale for stopping the work as the Defense Department and the U.S. Coast Guard were involved in reviewing the project with the Ocean Energy Management Bureau, as with all offshore wind development, to avoid conflicts with military operations and training.

Where’s the bite?

Freshwater fishing is still good. “Young anglers in our area are fishing local ponds at Melville and the Reservoir in Middletown with success,” said Chis Holland of Sam’s Bait & Tackle in Middletown.

Striped bass, bluefish. “We now have bait including Atlantic menhaden and peanut bunker in Greenwich Bay with anglers catching bluefish off Chepiwanoxet Point in Warwick,” said Tom Olson of Ponaug Bait & Tackle in Warwick. Declan O’Donnell of Breachway Bait & Tackle in Charlestown reported: “Striped bass action has been consistent at Block Island. Fish are still ranging from 20 to 40 pounds, with some larger ones up to 50 pounds. The best bites have been early in the morning and late in the evening, with soft plastics and eel imitations.” Chris Holland of Sam’s Bait & Tackle in Middletown said: “Now that the water has cleaned up from the storm, anglers are catching striped bass and bluefish out in front of Newport and Middletown. A mixture of bait and eels is working best for shore and boat anglers.” On Sunday, angler Matt Haczynski reported a great striped bass bite in the West Passage right at the mouth. “Birds diving and fish busting from sun-up till we left around 11 a.m.,” he said.

Bonito. “The bonito bite was excellent this past week around Block Island,"" O'Donnell said. ""These large schools seem to come and go. They should be around for a while and will start pushing closer to shore once bait leaves the ponds.""

Tautog. ""Anglers are now targeting tautog, the water is clear, and they are starting to catch fish,"" Holland said. ”We caught one 21-inch tautog fishing off Newport this Wednesday; all other fish were below the 16-inch minimum size."" O’Donnell reported: “Tautog fishing has been consistent around shallow rocky structures and wrecks in waters less than 30 feet. Keeper fish are averaging 3 to 5 pounds.” Olson said: “No reports yet of keeper fish being caught in the Bay but some good reports from anglers fishing structure off Narragansett.""","https://www.providencejournal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/NPRJ/85876171007-tom-richardson-bluefin-in-wind-farm-photo-d.jpeg?crop=4031,2267,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-30 20:02:40.340777

Looking Forward Houston, Los Angeles, and Portland, together with Seattle, Detroit, and Las Vegas, share a single concern.","This plunging numbers issue combines Las Vegas with Seattle, Portland, Detroit, Houston, and Los Angeles, the latter two having experienced a sharp drop in US tourism over the last months. The mix of soaring travel prices, inflation, and a drop in international tourists is vastly impacting these economically vibrant US cities, and, in particular, their tourism sectors. This situation creates a further strain on the already economically distressed cities, with the exact nature of their inflation exhibiting a constant and volatile decline in the value of visitor arrivals.

The sustained drop in tourists that Las Vegas, Seattle, Portland, Detroit, and Houston are experiencing underscores a broader challenge that these cities grapple with bolstered by reduced travel demand and increased costs. Collectively, these metropolitan areas possess unique tourism assets that set them apart, but are straining from elevating travel expenses, inflation, and a drop in international travel. This collective challenge is forcing these cities to adapt.

Changing travel patterns, reduced international arrivals, increased travel expenses, and shifting visitor preferences all contribute to this downturn. Attendant with these chronic visitor declines, cities need to rethink their tourism strategies to regain and sustain international and domestic tourism. Alleviating these recoverable pressures is a common challenge that could re-position these cities as prominent travel hubs in the US.

Las Vegas

Las Vegas received 3.09 million visitors in July, a 12% decline from the previous year. For a city built almost entirely on leisure, that is a considerable setback.

Hotel occupancy rates fell to 76.1%, a steep decline from more than 83% in July 2024. The average daily room rate fell to $154.76 and revenue per available room (RevPAR) dropped from $134.05 to $117.77, a steep decline of 12.1%.

Local analysts attribute the decline to a combination of spending correction and restrained spending. After years of record visitor numbers, travel demand is now normalizing. Inflation has reduced the disposable income available to travelers. Some are also avoiding Las Vegas because of Strip hotel rates that are widely deemed to be exorbitant.

This problem extends beyond hotels. The consistent inflow of visitors is vital for casinos, entertainment venues, and shopping malls. The reduced influx of visitors has a far-reaching impact on the economy of Las Vegas.

Places to Visit

The Las Vegas Strip: The heart of the city, lined with famous casinos, hotels, and entertainment venues. Don’t miss the iconic Bellagio Fountains, the Luxor Pyramid, and the Eiffel Tower replica at Paris Las Vegas.

Eat at world-renowned restaurants: Vegas has a thriving culinary scene, with celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Wolfgang Puck offering their signature dishes.

Seattle

Seattle documented the most significant decline among large US cities, with the number of international visitors down 27% year over year. This diminishment is particularly concerning because Seattle heavily depends on the Alaskan cruise season, which tends to bring in thousands of visitors during the summer. Additionally, Seattle boasts its own music festivals and cultural points of interest which, alongside the cruises, are likely to suffer due to the decreased number of visitors.

The increase in travel costs is one of the factors contributing to this decline. Seattle has one of the most expensive airfare and accommodation options in the US. This is bad for tourism, particularly for international tourists because, in addition to expensive travel, they have to deal with slower visa processing times.

Supplementing the aforementioned issues, the recovery of international travel, especially from countries like Japan and South Korea, is taking longer. These regions have historically contributed a lot to the tourism in Seattle, but that is no longer the case. Furthermore, Portland, Vancouver, and other Pacific Northwest cities are competing with Seattle for visitors. These other cities are more cost effective and less congested than Seattle.

Places to Visit

Space Needle: Seattle’s most iconic landmark offering breathtaking panoramic views of the city, the Puget Sound, and Mount Rainier.

Pike Place Market: One of the oldest farmers’ markets in the U.S., famous for its fresh seafood, local produce, and the iconic fish throwing tradition.

Tour the Seattle Great Wheel: Located on Pier 57, the Great Wheel offers views of the waterfront and the Olympic Mountains.

Portland

Portland, Oregon experienced an 18.3% drop in international tourism for the year ending July 2025. Portland has long been a beloved tourism city for its food scene, craft beer culture, and its proximity to hiking and outdoors attractions such as the Columbia River Gorge and Mount Hood. However, hiking and outdoor attractions coupled with a rise in the cost of visiting the city has resulted in a decline of tourists.

Increased inflation has substantially driven the prices of dining and accommodations in Portland. As a result, tourists looking to visit Portland for its affordable prices and uniquely crafted adventures are now visiting other similar places. Furthermore, the sharp decline in tourism brought by Canadian visitors is an important factor in the forecasted decline Portland is witnessing.

Additionally, image-related challenges stemming from safety issues and homelessness affect some regions of Portland’s downtown. These issues, which the city is working to mitigate, have resulted in negative media coverage of Portland, leading to a decrease in visitors to the city. Consequently, this is especially worrying for the local economy which is reliant on tourism to sustain businesses and employment, as the projected 18.3% decline is steep.

Places to Visit

Washington Park: A beautiful park home to Portland Japanese Garden, International Rose Test Garden, and the Oregon Zoo.

Powell’s City of Books: The world’s largest independent bookstore, spanning an entire city block.

Go brewery hopping: Portland has a thriving craft beer scene, with more than 70 breweries in the city.

Take a hike: The city is surrounded by stunning natural scenery, perfect for hiking and exploring, especially in places like Forest Park.

Detroit

Increasingly in recent years, Detroit has been in a recovery state with efforts to market itself as a cultural center enticing tourists with its rich music history, sports franchises, and ongoing urban revitalization projects. Regardless of everything in place, tourism declined by 17% in 2025, which may inhibit the city’s recovery and pose additional challenges to its economic revitalization.

This decline, in turn, is attributed to the weakening regional travel market. High regional driving and inflationary pressures in the United States is causing many visitors. to the Detroit area, to opt for cheaper and more convenient alternatives. Given how much Detroit depends on regional tourism, the city is exposed to the brunt of changes in travel patterns.

In comparison with other major U.S. cities, the international tourism numbers for Detroit are low. Efforts to diversify the tourism provided are there, and yet, the city fails to pull in visitors from other countries. With the projected 17.3% decline, sustaining tourism has become more difficult, and businesses in the city are likely to go into trouble, as tourists and visitors have become a rare sight in the coming year.

Take a Detroit River cruise: See the city from the water and enjoy the views of both the Detroit skyline and Windsor, Canada.

Houston

Visitor numbers are projected to decline by 20% in Houston. The city has always depended on business tourism and conventions, particularly from the energy and aerospace sectors, but these industries are still recovering from the pandemic. Houston also faces a drop in tourism because of a decrease in international travel, particularly from Mexico and other Latin American countries.

Corporate events and trade shows have always been a vital component of Houston’s tourism; however, the rise in hybrid and remote work models has decreased the demand for in-person meetings. An international visitor segment from Latin America, once a strong source of tourism, is also declining due to unresponsive visa systems and unencouraging travel conditions.

Weaker business travel, combined with a drop in international visitors, are the key drivers behind the anticipated decline in tourism to Houston. The city has a challenge to diversify and innovate in tourism marketing strategies; however, the primary focus will have to be on regional tourism to offset the international and business tourism losses.

Los Angeles

Los Angeles, famous for Hollywood, its beaches, and its entertainment options, is projected to experience a 10.5% decrease in tourism in 2025. While LA is still one of the most recognizable places to visit in the world, the cost of living and the rising cost of hotels and dining is inflating the budget a tourist requires to visit the city.

Like the cost for dining and attractions, hotel prices in Los Angeles have skyrocketed as well. Visitors now find no reason to spend a night in places like Hollywood and Santa Monica, because the prices are supersan mansion level. With the strong US dollar, Los Angeles is now a pricier option for international visitors, more so for those coming from European and Asian countries. In the United States, Los Angeles is now a dream city for most International tourists which is wishfully impossible to reach in terms of budget.

Los Angeles tourism sector’s 10.5% decline is particularly alarming because it has for a long time been one of the key economic engines of the area. These declines, if left unchecked, are a major economic risk for Los Angeles, especially in the tourism-reliant economic sectors.

Top Attractions:

The Hollywood Sign: One of the world’s most recognized landmarks, offering scenic views of Los Angeles.

Universal Studios Hollywood: A massive film studio and theme park offering thrilling rides and attractions.

The Getty Center: A cultural center housing an impressive art collection, gardens, and stunning architecture.

Spend the day shopping along Rodeo Drive or The Grove for luxury shopping experiences.

Why Are Visitors Staying Away?

The declines share common underlying reasons across all cities. The first is inflation. Families have increasingly less disposable income. Additionally, airfare, hotel, and dining costs have all surged.

The second is ageing demographics. Older travelers are visiting destinations less frequently, and a growing proportion of younger travelers opt for short, budget-friendly getaways or international destinations where their money has greater purchasing power.

The third is weaker international arrivals. Economic uncertainty coupled with a strong US dollar is dissuading foreign visitors. Cities such as Houston, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas rely heavily on international visitors, and the void created by their absence is stark.

The Ripple Effect on Local Economies

The decrease in tourism impacts more than just the hotels; local businesses suffer due to the decrease in customers. Stores have reduced sales. Restaurants have empty seats. Ride-share drivers have fewer rides. Revenue from taxes also declines, causing strain on public services.

For Las Vegas, tourism is the lifeblood that finances infrastructure, public services, and various entertainment outlets. For Seattle, cruise tourism sustains an entire cluster of businesses. In Detroit, tourism assists in alleviating an economy that still heavily relies on the auto industry. The absence of visitors is felt in a myriad of ways.

A Warning for the US Travel Industry

The July figures serve as a red flag for the entire US travel industry. It illustrates that fostering a stagnant assumption for growth in larger cities is misguided. Market shifts, demographic changes, and global demand fluctuations greatly impact them.

As travelers look for lower-priced options, smaller cities, national parks, secondary cities, beaches, and rural areas become easier to explore for budget-strapped families.

The struggle continues for larger cities as they try to devise a solution. Failing to employ the right pricing, marketing, or international engagement will cement a continued decline for the region.

In the first seven months of 2025, Las Vegas unites with Seattle, Portland, Detroit, Houston, and Los Angeles in facing a significant US tourism slump, as visitor numbers continue to plunge due to rising travel costs, inflation, and fewer international arrivals. These factors have collectively contributed to a sharp decline in tourism across these major U.S. cities.

Looking Forward

Houston, Los Angeles, and Portland, together with Seattle, Detroit, and Las Vegas, share a single concern. Each of these cities experienced a drop in visitors by double-digit percentages in July of 2025. The international visitor numbers are still lower, and the travel market is adjusting, indicating the reasons are quite straightforward.

In the near term, these urban tourism centers will depend on inflationary economies. Strong urban tourism recovery is possible in the near term if inflation eases and flight prices become more dependable. On the other hand, if the currently low demand continues, American cities will struggle with a long-term weak recovery.

Numbers concerning tourism are the primary concern, but research indicates it goes way beyond that. The fragile economies of the US depend on that the travel market reaches its optimal recovery in the shortest possible time, which is quite the concern in recent years. The numbers have shown that these declines have a direct effect on business, community, and the traveling industry.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/USA-35.jpeg,N,,2025-08-30 20:03:23.282493

Critics argue such policies risk overlooking the economic benefits of VMT, particularly in a post-pandemic era where travel patterns remain fluid [10].
However, EV growth strains road funding models.
Conclusion Post-pandemic VMT trends reveal a complex interplay of economic resilience, behavioral shifts, and policy interventions.
As infrastructure and energy sectors adapt to this new normal, investors must balance short-term recovery needs with long-term sustainability goals.","Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) has long served as a barometer of economic health and consumer behavior. Post-pandemic, the U.S. VMT rebound to 3.19 trillion miles in 2023—nearly matching 2019 levels—signals a nuanced recovery in mobility patterns, with far-reaching implications for infrastructure and energy sectors [1]. This article examines how VMT trends, shaped by macroeconomic dynamics and policy interventions, are reshaping investment landscapes.

VMT as a Leading Indicator of Macroeconomic Strength

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) projects total VMT to grow at 0.5% annually through 2050, lagging behind the 1.7% average U.S. GDP growth forecast [2]. This divergence reflects structural shifts: light-duty VMT, the largest component of travel demand, is expected to rise at 0.4% per year, while truck VMT (combination and single-unit) will grow faster (1.1% and 1.9%, respectively) due to e-commerce and supply chain demands [3]. These trends underscore a decoupling of VMT from traditional GDP correlations, driven by factors like remote work adoption and modal shifts (e.g., biking, public transit) [4].

The post-pandemic rebound also reveals behavioral shifts. Work-related trips declined, while nonwork trips (shopping, school drop-offs) surged during peak hours, straining infrastructure [5]. Traffic congestion, costing the average driver 43 hours in 2024, exacerbates operating costs, with deteriorated roads adding $1,400 annually per vehicle [6]. These pressures highlight the need for infrastructure modernization, even as VMT growth moderates.

Infrastructure Investment: Bridging the Funding Gap

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has allocated $591 billion since 2021, yet a $684 billion shortfall remains for roadways over the next decade [7]. State and local governments now fund 79% of infrastructure spending, with operations and maintenance accounting for 56.7% of expenditures [8]. This shift reflects the aging infrastructure backlog and the prioritization of upkeep over new projects.

Meanwhile, state-level policies are targeting VMT to meet climate goals. California’s 20% VMT reduction target by 2030 contrasts with more moderate goals in Washington and Colorado [9]. Critics argue such policies risk overlooking the economic benefits of VMT, particularly in a post-pandemic era where travel patterns remain fluid [10].

Energy Sector Dynamics: Fuel vs. Electric Vehicles

The energy sector faces a dual trajectory. While EV adoption is rising—EVs accounted for 6.7% of new vehicle sales in 2022—traditional fuel-based transportation still dominates [11]. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has spurred clean energy manufacturing, with quarterly investments tripling to $14 billion in Q1 2025, focusing on EV supply chains [12]. Public EV charging infrastructure expanded by 6.5% in Q2 2024, with DC fast chargers growing at 7.4% [13].

However, EV growth strains road funding models. Motor fuel tax (MFT) revenues are declining as fuel efficiency improves and EVs proliferate. Between 2019 and 2022, plug-in vehicle market share tripled to 6.7%, exacerbating the funding shortfall [14]. While EVs lack a ""rebound effect"" (unlike fuel-efficient vehicles, which induce more driving), their long-term impact on emissions remains limited due to the slow turnover of vehicle fleets [15].

Strategic Implications for Investors

For infrastructure investors, the key lies in aligning with state and local funding priorities, particularly in operations and maintenance. The IIJA’s $273.2 billion highway formula funding over five years offers opportunities in road resurfacing, bridge repairs, and smart mobility projects [16]. Energy investors should focus on EV supply chains and charging infrastructure, where IRA tax credits and private-sector partnerships are driving growth [17].

The energy transition also demands innovation in road funding. A shift from gas taxes to VMT-based fees could address declining revenues while incentivizing efficient travel. However, such reforms must account for equity concerns and the unique challenges posed by EVs [18].

Conclusion

Post-pandemic VMT trends reveal a complex interplay of economic resilience, behavioral shifts, and policy interventions. As infrastructure and energy sectors adapt to this new normal, investors must balance short-term recovery needs with long-term sustainability goals. The data underscores a critical truth: VMT is not just a metric—it is a lens through which to view the evolving American economy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 20:02:32.563416

It does not include a road usage charge.
In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections.
Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

However, the special session got off to a rocky start: The state Senate met as scheduled at 9 a.m., but the state House failed to reach the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, leaving the session in limbo as of late Friday afternoon.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are at risk, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting funding restrictions to allow the transportation department to spend more money on maintenance operations, including by redirecting dollars earmarked for public transit and efforts to combat climate change toward such operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.ktalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/08/68b2595c73b824.90454694.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 20:04:01.171471

California has adopted a goal to ban the sale of fossil-fuel-powered vehicles by 2035.

The delay was supported by Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA), which had called for the penalties to be delayed for 20 years, saying prices were determined by global oil markets and not the state’s policies.

The state’s Consumer Watchdog group faulted the change in direction by California officials. “By taking the penalty off the table, you are opening the market to the price spikes we suffered in 2022,” said Consumer Watchdog President Jamie Court in a letter prior to the vote.

California is isolated by the Rocky Mountains from the U.S. refining centers along the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Midwest. The state relies on what plants in that state and Washington can make as well as imports from Asian refineries.

Wood characterized the decision to rescind the Roadless Rule as “a solution in search of a problem.” “These are typically higher elevation areas, so they have steep slopes.
“Roadless areas are often these kinds of tendrils that snake off of wilderness areas,” Tom Wheeler, executive director of the Environmental Protection Information Center, told the Times-Standard on Thursday.
Wheeler said that while designated wilderness areas are often higher in elevation with limited ecological value, roadless areas represent a lot of critical habitat that has historically been inaccessible to the logging industry.","Last week, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced that the USDA had entered the next phase of its plan to rescind its 2001 Roadless Rule, beginning a public comment period that will last until Sept. 19. The rule establishes areas of the National Forest System managed according to regulations that generally limit timber harvesting and road building. Its rescission would open some 45 million acres spread across 36 states to timber harvest and road-building projects.

In a press release on the rescission process, Rollins described the rule as “burdensome, outdated, one-size-fits-all regulations that not only put people and livelihoods at risk but also stifle economic growth in rural America.”

Environmental groups contend that roadless areas have an outsized impact on protecting water quality and habitat for species such as salmon and trout. They also say that the roadless rule makes little economic sense — allowing for timber harvesting in mostly exceedingly remote, high-elevation areas ill-suited for logging and potentially putting the onus on the U.S. Forest Service to maintain roads in areas where the agency lacks the resources to do so.

Protecting species and water quality

Trout Unlimited President and CEO Chris Wood told the Times-Standard that, though they make up just 2% of the U.S. landscape, roadless areas “harbor about 25% of … imperiled species … (and) they also provide drinking water sources to nearly 60 million Americans.”

“It’s difficult to overstate their importance in terms of fishing and wildlife and water resources,” Wood said.

Wood characterized the decision to rescind the Roadless Rule as “a solution in search of a problem.”

“These are typically higher elevation areas, so they have steep slopes. They’re highly erosive. They’re hard to get to, so they’re very expensive to get to. The timber that remains there is very low value …” Wood said. “And so you’re talking about losing taxpayer money to get into really hard-to-access areas while compromising things like water quality and hunting and fishing. It just doesn’t make a lot of ecological or economical sense.”

While unsuitable for logging, roadless areas — including roughly 4.4 million acres in California — do have enormous benefits in terms of preserving species like salmonids and critically endangered and threatened species.

“Roadless areas are often these kinds of tendrils that snake off of wilderness areas,” Tom Wheeler, executive director of the Environmental Protection Information Center, told the Times-Standard on Thursday.

Wheeler said that while designated wilderness areas are often higher in elevation with limited ecological value, roadless areas represent a lot of critical habitat that has historically been inaccessible to the logging industry. ““These roadless areas are really important ecologically; roads have a pretty profound effect on biodiversity, and so these roadless areas are … habitat refugia for wildlife … These areas also have remnant old growth in a way that other areas of the forest don’t.”

Habitat preservation

In a press release, Wheeler added: “Roadless areas support old-growth forests, rare plant communities, and essential wildlife corridors for species such as the northern spotted owl, Pacific fisher, and Humboldt marten … Roadless areas serve as critical refugia and connectivity corridors for wildlife. Opening them to new roads and logging undermines what makes Humboldt great.”

Friends of the Eel River Conservation Director Scott Greacen told the Times-Standard that roadless areas along the Eel River watershed — which is suffering from a protracted salmonid population collapse — have been vital in preserving the remaining population of those fish.

“What we have, for example, in the Eel River watershed are some roadless lands up on the South Fork of the Van Duzen — the Little Van Duzen — that are a big part of the reason I think that we’ve still got summer steelhead in that drainage, because those forests are keeping cold, clean water coming regularly downstream to the steelhead and summer steelhead that are still in the Little Van Duzen,” Greacen said.

“And there’s a whole story there about how we have these two remnant populations of this fish, the summer steelhead on the Van Duzen and the middle Eel. We’re trying to bring them back on the upper main stem Eel with dam removal, but we really are hanging on to these remnant populations of this incredibly well-adapted fish that has unfortunately suffered a lot from human impacts. And you know, one of the places where there are populations that are hanging on is in the Van Duzen.”

Reasons behind roadless rules

Wood, who worked on the development of the 2001 Roadless Rule nearly 25 years ago, said that the Forest Service had developed its approach to roadless areas, in large part, because it had been saddled with an overly extensive pre-modern network of 270,000 miles of roads. That amount has subsequently increased to 380,000 miles, all subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.

“The Forest Service had an $8.6 billion maintenance backlog on its existing road system, that’s just roads across the National Forest System,” Wood said, “probably 98% of which were built to facilitate the harvest of timber … So the reason that we did the roadless rule, it was like, ‘Why are we spending so much money to build this road network we can’t afford to take care of? This doesn’t make sense.’ The height of conservativism is to make sure you take care of your investments before you make new ones, and that was basically the premise of the Roadless Rule, and that’s why I think it served us well for so long.

Greacen said that the 2001 adoption of the USDA’s Roadless Rule represented a realignment of the U.S. Forest Service’s values in the face of mounting maintenance costs as the service’s priorities began to shift from facilitating timber harvest and other areas of forest management to, increasingly, combating wildfires.

“Basically the decision was less that these areas need to not have roads in them as ‘we’re going to put an end to the assumption that we’re going to put a road in every part of every national forest’ because that’s too expensive and it doesn’t actually line up with the agency’s larger mission,’ which from the very beginning, was protecting water sources, among other things,” Greacen said.

Greacen said that the Roadless Rule, since its introduction, has become a sort of “political football,” with political opposition to the rule based less in the realities of economics and policy than it is in signaling an antagonism toward regulation in general.

Fire prevention

The Trump administration and the USDA contend that roadless rules have been a hindrance to wildfire prevention.

“For nearly 25 years, the Roadless Rule has frustrated land managers and served as a barrier to action — prohibiting road construction, which has limited wildfire suppression and active forest management,” said Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, in a press release on the rescission efforts.

That assertion is refuted by many experts, who note that roads are one of the primary vectors that cause wildfires and that mature forest in remote and difficult-to-access roadless areas is among the most resilient to fire.

“Roadless areas are some of the most wildfire-resilient landscapes in North America because they are the least degraded by industrial logging and road-building that would have converted fire-adapted native forests into fire-prone tree farms, and provided road access for human-caused ignitions from careless recreationists and sociopathic arsonists,” said Timothy Ingalsbee, executive director of Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology, in a news release. “We need to be more strategic and selective with the places we put young bodies to fight fires, and these should be near at-risk communities, not in rugged, remote wildlands. Tearing open roadless areas to industrial logging and road-building will do wildland firefighters no favors — just the opposite.”

Greacen noted that fire suppression, in part because it’s a complicated topic, has become “easy to demagogue” for Republican administrations seeking to advance extractive industry goals that have little to do with wildfire prevention. He said that while Roadless Rule rescission might not have an immediate and dramatic impact on national forest-goers, he sees it as part of a greater effort on the part of the current administration to erode protections on public lands.

“They’ve at least made representations that their intent is to dramatically increase the timber production on American public lands,” Greacen said. “We’ve heard the same rhetoric before, but you know, there are a lot of ways in which this administration is doing things that the far right and the right have been proclaiming their intention to do for a long time. And a lot of people kind of didn’t take them seriously after a while because they seemed so out of touch with reality, but here they are doing it.”

By doing this, the government would be able to treat projects involving fusion energy the same as other clean energy projects, such as solar or wind energy.
It's exciting news, as fusion energy is seen as a way to alleviate or solve many of the world's energy problems.
Fusion energy is created when two light atoms combine, forming a heavier atom, and could theoretically provide a virtually unlimited source of clean energy.
Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said in a statement: ""The future of fusion energy starts now.","Fusion energy is a step closer, at least in the U.K.

The country's government announced it would create a National Policy Statement to help clear the way for fusion energy projects. This makes the U.K. the first country to develop planning rules specifically for fusion energy.

According to World Nuclear News, prior to the new policy, any fusion projects in the U.K. were required to submit an application to begin work.

However, there was no formal guidance on which sites were appropriate, nor were there specific timelines for approval. That meant applications could take quite a while to be approved, which further delayed the development of fusion technology.

With the National Policy Statement, the government would introduce fusion energy into the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project system. By doing this, the government would be able to treat projects involving fusion energy the same as other clean energy projects, such as solar or wind energy.

As the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero explained, ""The introduction of a National Policy Statement will provide clarity to developers and streamline the planning process for fusion, giving applicants clearer guidance on where and how quickly projects can be developed.""

It's exciting news, as fusion energy is seen as a way to alleviate or solve many of the world's energy problems.

Fusion energy is created when two light atoms combine, forming a heavier atom, and could theoretically provide a virtually unlimited source of clean energy.

With such an abundant clean energy source, individuals, businesses, and cities could see a significant reduction in energy bills, saving money while also using resources more efficiently.

This type of clean energy might even help ensure people have enough clean water to drink and food to eat, as it can make it less expensive for governments and farmers to utilize technologies like water desalination or vertical farming.

With more diversified clean energy sources, the world could stop relying on dirty energy sources that are responsible for heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, which raise global temperatures. The result could be a cooler planet, as well as cleaner water and air, and reduced health issues in our communities.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said in a statement: ""The future of fusion energy starts now. We are ensuring the clean energy of the future gets built in Britain, supporting the creation of highly skilled jobs and driving growth into our industrial heartlands as part of our Plan for Change.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/n31JBS1VYRI19V7tJ2zaPw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/9d96e0be2e6fc072feb0bd59137838f2,N,,2025-08-30 19:03:11.257860

Almost $10,000 worth of tax credits for drivers looking to get hold of an electric vehicle will soon be unavailable.

What is the clean vehicle tax credit?

Drivers are set to lose out on $7,500 in tax credits and $4,000 in used EV credit on September 30.

Congress first approved the tax breaks for EV drivers in 2008, it was expanded in 2022 to cover leased vehicles.

A manufacturer cap of 200,000 vehicles was also implemented in the 2022 legislation change.

Now legislation approved by Congress on Thursday will see drivers lose their EV tax credits when buying or leasing a new car.

Still time to cash in

With Labour Day just around the corner the opportunity for car makers to roll out exciting promotions on new models is fast approaching.

Drivers will find the best deals on electric motors this year with motorists scrambling to lease an EV before the tax credits expire on September 30.

EV tax credit savings

The tax credit can save EV leaseholders an average of $208 a month spread across a 36-month lease.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, drivers of fully electric vehicles can save up to $2,200 per year on fuel.

The IRS is reportedly allowing consumers more wiggle room to claim the EV tax credit before it ends.

Eligibility for the credit was originally tied to a vehicle's delivery date.

However, this month the IRS issued a notice clarifying that consumers are eligible for credit if they sign a contract for a vehicle before September 30 and make a payment.

This can include putting money down or trading in a car and applies even if the vehicle isn't delivered until after the deadline.

How to qualify for the credits

It comes as President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill was recently signed into law and includes a clause that ends current federal clean-vehicle tax credits.

Anyone looking to capitalise on the tax credits before they are cut will need to confirm their income qualifies.

The purchase credit disappears once modified adjusted gross income tops $300,000 for joint filers, $225,000 for heads of household or $150,000 for single filers.

Only plug in vehicles count so mild hybrids will not be able to qualify for the tax credit.

Anyone hoping to get a tax cut will need to pick a vehicle from the approved list.

Final assembly of the motor must occur in North America for the vehicle to be eligible.

On top of this the sticker price must not exceed $80,000 for trucks, vans, and SUVs, or $55,000 for cars.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/08/2025-us-president-donald-trump-1018552869.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-08-30 18:01:36.037213

Colgate-Palmolive has outlined a clear approach to sustainability, social impact and environmental targets across its 2024 Sustainability and Social Impact Report.

With a footprint in over 70 countries and a portfolio of mass-market goods, the company places its manufacturing responsibilities at the centre of its climate and ESG strategies.

Its programme is structured around three core pillars: supporting communities, reaching homes globally and reducing environmental harm.

Strategy embedded across manufacturing and supply chain operations

Colgate-Palmolive manages ESG risks through its Enterprise Risk Management framework.

This process identifies climate transition and plastic transition as critical issues within its global operations. However, it notes that these risks also provide opportunities to create new industrial solutions, enhance reputation and reinforce compliance with responsible business expectations.

The company has established a cross-functional ESG Reporting Task Force. This internal group ensures Colgate’s data and policies align with current and incoming ESG disclosure requirements.

The structure supports real-time alignment between investor, customer and regulatory expectations and the company’s operational priorities.

Materiality assessments shape Colgate’s approach, ensuring its business goals reflect stakeholder input.

Across operations, sustainability is embedded in risk management protocols, procurement procedures and product innovation cycles.

Metrics are tracked using widely accepted sustainability frameworks, including progress against 14 of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Ann Tracy, Colgate-Palmolive’s Chief Sustainability Officer, says: “Our sustainability efforts also help to strengthen our business. We believe that some consumers favour brands from companies that act responsibly and will recognise our leadership in this space and choose our brands.

“We are proud of our progress so far, but there is more work to be done. We strive to be better for the people who use our products and drive value throughout our business. Getting this principle right will result in reducing our impact on the planet.”

Materials, emissions and process targets

The report highlights targeted achievements across Colgate’s packaging, energy and resource programmes.

One of the centrepieces of its industrial sustainability approach is packaging. The company manufactures a recyclable toothpaste tube, now used across more than 70 global markets.

In North America, 95% of tubes are converted to recyclable formats and, by the end of 2024, 93% of Colgate’s packaging was recyclable, reusable or compostable.

Material sourcing has also evolved, with virgin plastic reduced by 25% from a 2019 baseline. At the same time, 21% of packaging content in 2024 was made from post-consumer recycled materials.

These actions align with 2025 targets set through the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Global Plastics Commitment, which includes:

A one-third reduction in virgin plastic usage

25% post-consumer recycled plastic content in packaging

Elimination of problematic or unnecessary packaging

The company continues to secure renewable energy agreements, aligning with a net zero carbon emissions goal set for 2040.

It is also addressing the physical and transitional climate risks across its factories, warehouses and distribution systems. Strategic alliances with the U.S. Plastics Pact, The Recycling Partnership and startups have also supported operational improvements across waste and emissions performance.

This work supports Colgate’s broader framework which includes efficient design, responsible sourcing and promoting circular manufacturing systems. The business continues to encourage internal and external behavioural change to reduce its environmental footprint across product lifecycles.

2030 and 2040 environmental goals

Colgate has confirmed two major climate targets across the next 15 years.

By 2030:

Move from annually sourcing 35% renewable electricity in 2020 to 100%

Cut Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Purchased Goods and Services by 42% against 2020 levels

Reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in operations by 42% from 2020

By 2040:

Reach net zero carbon emissions across its entire value chain, excluding optional Scope 3 categories per the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net Zero Standard

Cut Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 90% from a 2020 baseline, excluding Scope 3 categories 9, 11 and 12 and optional emissions per SBTi Net Zero Standard

Ann wrote on LinkedIn: “At Colgate-Palmolive, we're committed to reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We are driving social impact, helping millions of homes and preserving our environment.”

Supply chain systems and external partnerships

Colgate targets sustainable sourcing through its raw material suppliers, with a particular focus on palm oil and soy.

The company uses certified material streams, satellite-based geospatial monitoring and supplier engagement programmes to ensure ethical, transparent sourcing. The aim is to build a conversion- and deforestation-free supply chain while improving resilience across its sourcing network.

Water stewardship is another area of focus, supported through Colgate’s involvement in the CDP Water Supply Chain Program and localised outreach such as webinars in water-stressed areas.

To this end, the company promotes best practice in water risk management among its suppliers, ensuring downstream accountability.

Human rights initiatives run alongside environmental goals. Colgate partners with the Fair Labor Association to enhance labour standards and enforce responsible recruitment practices in its Malaysian palm oil supply.

It is also a member of industry alliances like the Forest Positive Coalition and prioritises recycled content in pulp and paper purchasing to lessen environmental impact.

These actions embed ESG into the company's procurement processes and manufacturing footprint, providing both risk mitigation and improved economic resilience for supplier communities.

But momentum for EV charging in the Pittsburgh area will continue with or without the program, as businesses look to serve customers with convenient refueling locations.

The Trump administration halted the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program in February, saying it needed to be updated to align with current policy and priorities.

The roll out of the NEVI program had been slow, attracting critiques of being inefficient. Of the six projects awarded in Allegheny County, only one is complete.

The Biden administration set requirements to try to ensure that chargers would benefit disadvantaged communities and minority-owned businesses and be spaced evenly along major highways.

Now the Trump administration has thrown out those conditions.

Ryan McKinnon with the Charge Ahead Partnership, a business group, said he’s cautiously optimistic about the new guidance.

“Eliminating a million requirements that made it impossible for states to implement the program is overall good for clean energy,” McKinnon said.

He added that, while public funding is helpful, most charging is being driven by the private sector.

That’s true for Southwestern Pennsylvania, according to Sarah Olexsak, general manager of electrification solutions for Duquesne Light Company.

“When we think about what’s driving the growth of public charging stations in the Pittsburgh region it’s really being driven by our commercial customers,” Olexsak said.

Olexsak said small businesses are looking to build chargers as a way to attract customers. She also credited municipalities with building charging stations to serve their residents and visitors.

DLC offers a program through which it covers the cost of engineering and construction to ready a site for a charging station. The commercial customer then installs the charger, agrees to maintain it, and pays for the electricity to power it.

Olexsak said the utility has helped install more than 350 charging ports at 50 locations to date and has another 100 ports planned at ten sites.

However, Olexsak said incentives will remain important for encouraging future charging infrastructure to meet projected needs.

“Today we have about 700 public level two charging station ports in our territory. To support the number of EVs on the road in 2030, we still need to increase that by over six fold,” she said.

The number of EVs in the Pittsburgh region is expected to grow from 18,000 today to 50,000 by 2030, Olexsak said.

Pennsylvania has been at the front of the pack in contracting charging sites through NEVI. The state has obligated 90 projects, with 18 of them operational.

PennDOT spokesperson Zachary Appleby said the new federal guidance will have no effect on the previously contracted projects.

“Pennsylvania achieved full buildout of its Alternative Fuel Corridor in January 2025 and has been ready to move forward into the next stages of the NEVI program, but without federal guidelines, we were unable to move forward as quickly as we could have,” Appleby said.

Initial NEVI-funded chargers were placed in 50-mile intervals along major highways. The next phase of NEVI funding is slated to build community-focused charging stations.

Matt Stephens-Rich with the Electrification Coalition said NEVI-backed sites create a “core backbone of charging” that can support a larger network spread on secondary roads and in towns.

He said Pennsylvania’s plan for NEVI funds has acted as a market indicator, encouraging businesses to install their own chargers.

“ We still have a lot more to go as we continue to grow the EV market across America and also growing the charging to meet it,” Stephens-Rich said “We do expect to see additional private dollars also coming in as the market continues to grow and expand.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EV-charging.jpg?fit=1760%2C1320&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-30 19:01:42.148446

Hicks emphasized the dire implications on the climate change crisis as Wisconsin is already facing impacts such as historic floods, unsafe air quality and record-breaking temperatures.
“We need to meet the moment to address climate change and the position that we’re in right now,” Hicks underscored.

Under the new federal budget, tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act available to Wisconsin businesses, utilities and school districts are now ending much earlier than intended.

Casey Hicks, federal government affairs manager for the group Wisconsin Conservation Voters, said incentives for homeowners are being canceled even sooner than other entities, creating uncertainty which leads to project delays and cancellations.

“Without the tax credits, the grants, the incentives to help those projects along, we’re going to be in a bind where we have way more demand for energy because of things like AI data centers,” Hicks pointed out. “And not being able to meet that demand.”

A grant which would have helped low-income residents in Milwaukee make their homes more energy efficient is being revoked. Hicks noted now, utility rates for residents across the state are projected to increase by more than $450 a year by 2035. Supporters of the repeal argued the tax credits were costly and fueled by misguided policy.

Hicks explained Wisconsin has no natural resources of coal, oil or natural gas, which requires it to import energy, costing the state more than $14 billion a year. Hicks argued incentives which were supposed to continue under the Inflation Reduction Act would have accelerated the transition to clean energy, saved the state money and increased Wisconsin’s energy independence, while creating thousands of jobs.

“Because of this bill that was passed recently, Wisconsin could end up seeing about 11,000 jobs go away by 2030,” Hicks reported.

Hicks urged residents to voice their concerns to their members of Congress, all of whom supported the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Hicks emphasized the dire implications on the climate change crisis as Wisconsin is already facing impacts such as historic floods, unsafe air quality and record-breaking temperatures.

Conclusion The energy sector’s resilience in 2025 hinges on its ability to adapt to divergent regulatory and market signals.
Contrarian investors must balance exposure to oil and gas’s near-term volatility with the long-term tailwinds of the energy transition.","The energy sector in 2025 is navigating a paradox: regulatory shifts and market forces are pulling in divergent directions, creating both risks and opportunities for investors. Federal policies in the U.S. are prioritizing fossil fuels through streamlined production and infrastructure development, while state-level initiatives and corporate sustainability programs continue to drive renewable energy adoption [2]. Meanwhile, global demand for clean energy is surging, with solar and wind investments projected to outpace oil and gas for the first time [1]. This duality demands a nuanced, contrarian approach to investment, balancing short-term volatility with long-term structural trends.

Regulatory Divergence and Market Realities

Federal-level regulatory changes, such as the ""Unleashing American Energy"" Executive Order, have accelerated fossil fuel production and infrastructure projects, including LNG exports [2]. However, this contrasts sharply with state-level policies in California and New York, which are tightening emissions standards and incentivizing renewables [2]. The result is a fragmented regulatory landscape, where companies must navigate conflicting mandates. For example, the EPA’s proposed repeal of the 2009 Endangerment Finding threatens to undermine vehicle emissions standards and broader GHG regulations [3], while the One Big Beautiful Bill extends tax credits for carbon capture but shortens eligibility for clean hydrogen and biofuels [5]. These shifts create uncertainty for long-term project planning, particularly in renewables.

Market dynamics further complicate the picture. OPEC+’s 2.2M b/d output surge has led to a global oil supply surplus, pushing Brent crude to $67/bbl and squeezing energy stock valuations [1]. Meanwhile, renewable energy stocks like NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable Partners are benefiting from policy tailwinds such as the Inflation Reduction Act [2]. The energy transition is also reshaping demand: electricity consumption is surging, with 90% of global growth attributed to renewables, nuclear, and gas [3]. This trend is driven by data centers and AI infrastructure, which require stable, low-carbon power [4].

Contrarian Opportunities in a Dual-Track Sector

For investors, the key lies in identifying dual-track opportunities that hedge against volatility while capitalizing on structural shifts. In oil and gas, midstream operators like Enterprise Products Partners and Kinder Morgan offer fee-based revenue models insulated from commodity price swings [2]. Similarly, LNG exporters such as Cheniere Energy are well-positioned to benefit from rising global demand, particularly in Asia [1]. These companies provide resilience in a sector otherwise plagued by oversupply and regulatory uncertainty.

On the renewable side, energy storage and grid infrastructure are critical enablers of the transition. The U.S. energy storage market added 2 GW of capacity in Q1 2025, with installations expected to double by year-end [1]. Companies like Vestas Wind Systems and Brookfield Renewable Partners are leveraging AI-driven optimization to enhance efficiency and reduce costs [1]. Small-cap energy firms, such as Crescent Energy and Flowco, also present contrarian opportunities. Crescent has hedged 60% of its production using swaps and collars, while Flowco’s focus on production optimization reduces exposure to oil price fluctuations [3].

Innovation and Geopolitical Risks

Technological innovation is another frontier. Carbon capture and small modular reactors (SMRs) are gaining traction, particularly in China, which is projected to surpass the U.S. and Europe in nuclear capacity by 2030 [5]. Direct air capture (DAC) and long-duration energy storage are emerging as critical tools for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors [3]. However, geopolitical tensions—such as U.S. tariffs on Russian oil and potential sanctions on Iran—are fragmenting markets and amplifying volatility [1]. These risks underscore the importance of ESG-aligned portfolios and diversified energy procurement strategies [4].

Conclusion

The energy sector’s resilience in 2025 hinges on its ability to adapt to divergent regulatory and market signals. Contrarian investors must balance exposure to oil and gas’s near-term volatility with the long-term tailwinds of the energy transition. By prioritizing infrastructure, storage, and innovation-driven companies, investors can navigate uncertainty while positioning for a future where clean energy and traditional fuels coexist in a redefined global energy system.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 23:58:25.225523

The U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the reallocation of funds, part of a broader move to divert $679 million from 12 offshore wind initiatives across the country. This decision reflects a strategic pivot towards enhancing traditional energy sectors and strengthening maritime infrastructure, rather than pursuing what the administration terms ""fantasy wind projects.""

Maryland Governor Wes Moore voiced a strong commitment to advancing the state's clean energy initiatives. He recently participated in a groundbreaking ceremony for a new manufacturing facility at Tradepoint Atlantic, a move heralded as a vital step towards establishing Maryland as a frontrunner in the nation's offshore wind industry. The facility, developed by Ørsted, aims to produce components for wind turbines, significantly contributing to the broader supply chain along the U.S. East Coast.

The Tradepoint Atlantic complex at Sparrows Point, historically the site of a major steel mill, offers strategic advantages such as deep-water access, robust infrastructure, and extensive real estate, positioning it as an ideal location for offshore wind operations. The development is expected to create 125 union jobs during construction, offering benefits such as healthcare and secure employment conditions. This initiative aligns with several legislative measures signed by Governor Moore, aimed at quadrupling Maryland's offshore wind energy targets to 8.5 gigawatts by 2030, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting electric vehicle adoption through rebate programs.

The decision to cut funding aligns with a national trend under the Trump administration to shift focus from renewable to traditional energy sources, a move receiving critique for potentially stifling economic growth and renewable energy job creation. Nonetheless, Maryland officials remain determined to forge ahead with their vision for a sustainable energy future, underscoring the state's enduring commitment to clean energy projects despite federal pullbacks.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 19:01:51.561541

While the company's supporters cheered another end of quarter burst, overall production and sales again disappointed. Today, I wanted to circle back and provide more detail on why Q1's headlines were troublesome for Tesla, along with some updates on key headwinds that are getting stronger.

The curious Model S and X picture:

Tesla's two flagship vehicles saw their first year over year decline in quarterly deliveries, falling by more than 3,000 units. While management said that demand is strong, it only said that orders set a Q1 record, not an overall quarterly record. Additionally, while it was stated that vehicles in transit were up 68% sequentially, that's not a surprise given the production shutdown in Q4. In fact, take a look at the chart below.

(Source: Tesla quarterly production/delivery announcements on IR news page)

Did management note that S/X vehicles in transit were down nearly 600 vehicles over the end of the prior year period, a drop of almost 12.7%? Nope. What's really interesting is that vehicles in transit rose sequentially by 1,540 vehicles. If we add that to the 21,800 vehicles delivered, we get 23,340 total. However, Tesla produced 1,400 more than that in the period, meaning inventory levels are rising again. Add that to an extra 1,200 Model 3's in transit, and you can see why rising inventory could pressure cash flow, a key reason why many are skeptical of the company saying it doesn't need a capital raise outside of credit lines.

He says the proposed changes to the regulation are unnecessary.

EPA determined existing federal wastewater regulations under the Clean Water Act are effective and the burdens proposed changes would inflict on meat and poultry processors are unwarranted.

“The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) applauds the Trump administration and EPA Administrator Zeldin for taking a common sense approach on the Meat & Poultry Processing Rule,” says Duane Stateler, NPPC president and pork producer from McComb, Ohio. “As proposed by the previous administration, this rule—which provides no environmental benefits—would have been devastating to small- and medium-sized meat processors across the country and the livestock farmers who rely on them as markets for their animals.”

EPA’s action will save not only the nearly 100 local meat processors that EPA itself identified would have to close down but also the thousands of family farmers who rely on them to stay in livestock production, Stateler points out.

“It will help ensure affordable, nutritious American-grown pork can continue to be served on dinner tables across the country,” Stateler says.

Moving Forward

The decision closes the book on a nearly two-year comment and consideration process in which NPPC and other stakeholders have worked with EPA to better inform the agency’s decision and preempt unnecessary harm.

“Under the prior proposal, if it were finalized, major pork processors would have faced significant costs to install new waste water management systems,” explains Michael Formica, NPPC chief legal strategist. “During that period of construction, some plants would likely have needed to temporarily shut down. Others might have had to cut back on how many shifts they run.”

When activists are again successful at persuading a state to adopt anything different than Prop 12’s housing requirements, the wholesale revision of farm practices and contracts will start all over again.

Ohio EPA reports the red color in Carey Creek stemmed from a discharge of liquid manure that was pulled from an anaerobic manure lagoon on a nearby hog farm.

They survived the farm crisis of the 1980s, overcame industry challenges and quit their day jobs in the late 1980s to focus on building their dream — Brenneman Pork — into a legacy.

EPA’s internal analysis showed that dozens of facilities, likely small and medium-sized, would be forced to shut down because they would be unable to afford the cost of the technology required to comply, Formica says. Overall, the industry would have realized additional costs estimated at greater than $1 billion a year.

“Producers who rely on those processors would have then been without a market for their livestock,” Formica adds.

Unnecessary Expansions

The Meat and Poultry Products Effluent Guidelines and Standards was enacted in 1974 by the EPA and amended in 2004 to cover wastewater directly discharged by processing facilities. NPPC says the proposed amendment would have established more stringent technological requirements for controlling discharges from processors and significantly increased the scope of plants that were covered by the rules.

While the agricultural industry and the meat and poultry processing sectors support clean water efforts, EPA found these expansions were unnecessary.

NPPC says it appreciates EPA taking no action on the proposal, which would have disrupted packing capacity and livestock markets, in turn inflicting additional financial harm on producers and leading to further industry concentration and the loss of independent farmers.

The Meat Institute says the proposed rule would have also harmed the relationship between meat and poultry processing (MPP) facilities and publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs).

“Indirect discharging MPP facilities often make significant financial investments in maintaining and upgrading the POTW or shouldering major surcharges for the POTW’s continued operation and maintenance, which reduce public treatment costs for residential ratepayers and improve the quality of local and downstream waters,” the Meat Institute wrote in a statement.",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/237f470/2147483647/strip/true/crop/320x180+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffj-corp-pub.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F2017-11%2F320x180_71018B00-DJSPH.png,N,,2025-08-30 23:01:32.472787

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the power to implement a penalty but has not done so since it was given that authority in 2023.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission has not determined what would count as an excessive profit under the policy.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting towards more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/08/29/California_Gas_Prices_51698_c0-146-3515-2196_s1200x700.jpg?cea3c8d9ee6bca3f2cb1be60d37b6378821043d4,N,,2025-08-30 18:03:02.295502

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has closed its investigation into whether major truck manufacturers violated antitrust laws through the “Clean Truck Partnership” with the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The commission concluded the case after Daimler Truck, International Motors, PACCAR, Volvo Group, and the Truck & Engine Manufacturers Association provided binding commitments to avoid similar agreements in the future and maintain independent business practices.

The Commission’s swift action will put the Clean Truck Partnership squarely in the rearview mirror and prevent repeats of CARB’s troubling regulatory gambit.”

Following federal legislation revoking CARB’s regulatory waivers, the manufacturers disavowed the agreement and pledged not to enforce or recreate it. The Commission’s decision to close the case was unanimous.

Minister for Planning Sonya Kilkenny today announced the approval of the 400-megawatt Mt Fyans Wind Farm near Mortlake – the third largest wind farm to be approved by the Allan Labor Government in 10 years.

The wind farm will be made up of 81 turbines and set to create more than 100 jobs during construction, as well as 10 fulltime local jobs once the wind farm becomes operational.

Wind is the biggest contributor to renewable electricity generation in Victoria, with 21 percent of our state’s monthly electricity generation coming from wind farms in the first half of 2025.

Because of this investment in renewables, Victorians continue to benefit from some of the lowest energy prices in the country. Over the financial year Victoria’s wholesale price was $106 per megawatt – compared to $149 in New South Wales, $144 in Tasmania, $136 in South Australia and $125 in Queensland.

This project referred to a Planning Panel for consideration and included wide-ranging consultation with residents, community groups and government agencies. The panel recommended the project could proceed, with measures taken to protect local biodiversity, including bats and brolgas.

The project is located in the South-West Renewable Energy Zone, one of six areas identified as most suitable to host new renewable energy generation across Victoria through the Victorian Transmission Plan.

Victoria has met every renewable energy target it has set to date and is well on the way to meeting the next ones of 65 per cent renewable energy generation by 2030 and 95 per cent by 2035.

Delivering more renewable energy will provide a secure source of cheap renewable energy for homes, businesses and industry across the whole state and boost employment – 67,000 jobs will be required to deliver our energy transition by 2040 – a 60 percent increase from today.

With federal policy rollbacks hampering investment in homegrown clean energy, we need to look for areas where Maine can make progress now to bring down electricity prices and curb climate pollution.

One of the most promising and proven solutions is time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates, which encourage electricity use when the grid is less busy, empowering customers to save and keeping expensive fossil-fuel power plants offline.

Here’s how it works.

The cost of electricity fluctuates over the day and seasons of the year. The most expensive times are when consumer demand is high; it’s basic economics. This summer, for example, wholesale prices have exceeded $1,000/MWh, more than 2,000% higher than average prices. These true costs are hidden from consumers by an antiquated practice of averaging prices across all hours, an approach that unfairly shifts costs to those causing the least impact on our shared electricity grid.

Well-thought-out TOU rates can fix this and save working families in Maine money in three ways.

Advertisement

First, they would reduce the stress on our regional electricity system, bringing down costs for everyone. Our grid — all the poles, wires and substations that we pay for through our electricity bills — is sized to match maximum demand for electricity, even if that peak period is only a few hours a year.

Incentivizing use during off-peak times keeps expensive infrastructure upgrades at bay and makes more efficient use of the capacity we already have. New England’s grid operator found that reducing peak loads would save roughly $10 billion across the region, with nearly a billion of that coming to Maine.

Second, creating a more flexible grid with solutions like TOU rates will deliver additional savings from our local transmission and distribution systems. Maine’s recent Pathways to 2040 study found that these Maine-based approaches could reduce grid growth by 35-55% by 2050, with huge implications for costs savings to Maine homes and businesses over the next 25 years.

Third, it’s not just poles and wires but the electricity itself that gets more expensive — and more polluting — as demand increases. In New England’s electricity market, the least expensive power plants come online first. The last resource to be fired up is the most expensive and sets a uniform price paid to all generators. By shifting use away from peak times, we use those expensive resources more rarely, lowering market prices across the board.

As a bonus, the most expensive generators are also the most polluting. By relying less on these outdated coal- and oil-fired clunkers, we reduce climate pollution and improve air quality.

Because TOU rates have been around for decades, there’s a wealth of information about the scale of benefits at stake. One recent program in Maryland saved customers an average of 5-10% off their electricity bills by reducing summer peaks. This included lower-income people who responded similarly to higher-income households to shift their electricity usage and save money.

Maine’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) is considering a TOU proposal now, and it should make this a priority so we can deliver savings to families and businesses across the state. Maine’s TOU rates should be simple and clear, with a higher price during an evening window and a lower price the rest of the time, with good outreach and education to let people know how to save money on their bills by doing laundry and running the dishwashers outside those hours.

Any time changes in electricity rate structures are proposed, people have questions. And to be clear, there are important details to work out. But because TOU has been implemented effectively elsewhere, we have confidence the PUC can address these questions while moving forward and bringing these cost savings to bear quickly.

Effective TOU rates can offer Maine families short-term savings, while suppressing rates system-wide over the long term. If we’re serious about addressing affordability while achieving Maine’s Climate Action Plan, well-designed time-of-use rates are a foundational policy and too important an opportunity to pass up.",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/08/Biden_Electrical_Grid_Money_81447_da0721-1724367833.jpg?w=1000,N,,2025-08-30 19:01:59.476003

Around 1.5 million German homes, many of them apartments, are registered as using balcony solar panels — although many more might be unregistered.
Demand is now growing in Spain and some other European countries, while the U.K. government announced last month it's studying the potential for allowing balcony solar panels for apartments.
But balcony plug-in solar isn't necessarily the solution he'd like to see.
O'Brien says integrating solar panels into construction not only centralizes the power generation but addresses any safety concerns around people affixing panels to their balconies themselves.","Want to lower your electricity bill and help power your home with an abundant renewable energy source — the sun?

OK, maybe you don't have a rooftop where you can install $20,000 to 30,000 worth of solar panels, get the permits and hire a crew to put them in.

But there's a simple, affordable solution for people who own houses or condos, or are renting an apartment.

Plug-in balcony solar panels are a do-it-yourself clean energy solution that not only help power appliances and devices in homes but lower electricity costs at a time when the cost of power — along with everything else — is rising.

They've become popular in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, as well as in the U.S. While these plug-and-play units aren't readily available in Canada, and could face bureaucratic hurdles in getting approved, solar energy proponents say there's likely to be consumer interest and calls for Canada to get on board.

""We're about to find out what that pent-up demand is,"" said Phil McKay from the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA).

How do they work?

You may have seen portable 100-watt solar panels at your local hardware store that you can take with you camping or to a cabin in order to charge your cellphone or other small devices.

Plug-in balcony solar kits are somewhat similar, says Kevin Chou, co-founder of San Francisco Bright Saver, which aims to bring this technology to a wider North American market.

The difference is that with balcony solar, you're able to power small appliances, lights and other household electrical items from a lightweight panel you can install yourself on a balcony or the side of your home.

A plug-in balcony solar unit that can generate up to 800 watts can cost between $2,000 to $2,300 US, but a 200-watt kit sells for as low as $400.

As Chou explains, the panels connect to an inverter, much like your typical rooftop photovoltaic solar panels, except that it's much smaller and plugs directly into a standard wall outlet.

""It just pushes electricity into that plug at a slightly higher pressure than the rest of the electricity coming in from the grid, so that you're using the electricity from your solar panels first,"" Chou said. Any unused power is absorbed into the power grid.

Some newer and costlier kits also have batteries that can store electricity for later use.

Chou says the power from these systems isn't significant enough to address all your home energy needs.

In Canada, the average detached home uses approximately 13,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per year, while an apartment or condo in a highrise building might use around 5,900 kWh per year, according to Statistics Canada.

But depending on where you live and and your overall power costs, he says balcony solar can shave some money off your monthly bill.

In northern California, where Chou lives, it can work out to $30 to $50 US off per month.

Big in Germany

Chou says he was inspired to try to develop a market for plug-in balcony solar units in North America following their success in Germany in recent years.

Balkonkraftwerk, as it's known in German (translation: balcony power plant), grew in popularity after the country began to move away from its reliance on cheap Russian oil following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which increased the cost of power for residents.

Around 1.5 million German homes, many of them apartments, are registered as using balcony solar panels — although many more might be unregistered.

McKay says they're not contributing a huge amount of solar power to Germany's grid, ""but what it's doing is impacting millions and millions of people's homes"" by saving as much as 30 per cent on power bills, according to some estimates.

Demand is now growing in Spain and some other European countries, while the U.K. government announced last month it's studying the potential for allowing balcony solar panels for apartments.

A red state greenlit balcony solar. Why not Canada?

Germany's Balkonkraftwerk success story also caught the eye of Utah lawmaker Raymond Ward, a Republican state representative who successfully passed legislation earlier this year to allow the use of plug-in solar panels, a first anywhere in the U.S.

Given the political environment in the U.S. and divisiveness over climate change, it might come as a surprise that a red state like Utah is leading the charge. Ward says it was a matter of offering residents an opportunity to save money, and his legislation gets ""the government out of their way.""

He says it wasn't that plug-and-play solar units were prohibited, but rather that the regulations only covered rooftop solar panel systems, which weren't allowed to be plugged directly into an existing electrical system and had a contract with the local utility.

""That makes sense if you're going to cover your whole roof with them and expect the utility to pay you some money for that power,"" Ward said. ""But it doesn't make sense if you're just buying something little and plugging it in and not asking [the utility] for anything.""

Utilities got on board, he says, once they realized they wouldn't have to compensate customers for the power they were generating.

Part of the challenge, he said, was certification. The units, as a whole, are not UL-certified, the standard certification for electronics in the U.S. But the individual components are, which has given some companies the green light to sell their plug-in solar kits in Utah and some other parts of the country.

UL is also recognized certification in Canada, but the Canadian Standards Association (CSA Group) certifies most electronics for use in this country.

CSA Group confirmed to CBC News that balcony solar units ""are not evaluated or certified as standalone products"" and that ""the complete plug-in configuration falls outside the scope of our current certification frameworks.""

There's also the challenge of getting provinces, municipalities and utilities on board.

CBC News reached out to various provincial and municipal governments, as well as utility providers, and found many had not yet considered the potential use of DIY plug-in solar panels or regard it as being similar to rooftop solar installations that require permits and licensed contractors to install.

Alberta, however, could provide an opportunity. A spokesperson for the province's Ministry of Affordability and Utilities says balcony plug-in solar technology would fall under existing micro-generation regulation, which allows generators capable of producing less than 150 kilowatts of electricity to be connected to the grid.

Better integration

Liam O'Brien, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, sees value in giving people a ""tangible connection"" to energy resources.

But balcony plug-in solar isn't necessarily the solution he'd like to see.

He's more in favour of solar being integrated into buildings when they're constructed or renovated — something that's happened in some places in Canada, including an apartment building in Toronto and at a student residence at Halifax's Saint Mary's University.

O'Brien says integrating solar panels into construction not only centralizes the power generation but addresses any safety concerns around people affixing panels to their balconies themselves.

It's also a better use of space, he says, and could save developers money on other material costs while offering a cheaper power source to residents.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7618976.1756307884!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/plug-in-solar-panel-baltimore-home.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-30 19:02:05.831573

Climate-related fiscal risks further complicate the picture: property values in high-risk areas are declining, straining tax bases and increasing borrowing costs for infrastructure projects [10].
In conclusion, the 2025 federal-state conflicts have created a landscape of heightened geopolitical and economic risk.
While municipal resilience strategies offer pathways to stability, their success hinges on navigating federal policy shifts and global trade dynamics.","The 2025 U.S. economic landscape is defined by a volatile interplay between federal and state policies, particularly in the realm of tariffs and fiscal strategies. As the Trump-Vance administration’s “Liberation Day” tariffs—imposing baseline 10% duties on imports and higher rates on key trading partners—have taken effect, the economy faces a dual challenge: short-term inflationary pressures and long-term structural risks. The average effective tariff rate (AETR) has surged to 18.6%, the highest since 1933, contributing to a 1.8% rise in consumer prices and a 0.5 percentage point drag on real GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 [1]. These policies, while generating $2.8 trillion in projected government revenue over a decade, have also disrupted global supply chains, with retaliatory tariffs from China and Mexico reshaping trade flows [2].

Geopolitical volatility has intensified as a result. The Federal Reserve, now adopting a “neutral” monetary stance, has struggled to balance inflation control with labor market stability, as job creation weakened by 1.4% in the first half of 2025 [3]. Financial markets have mirrored this uncertainty, with the S&P 500 and VIX volatility index experiencing swings akin to the 2008 crisis and early 2020 pandemic [4]. Deloitte’s Q2 2025 forecast outlines three scenarios: a baseline of sustained high tariffs leading to slower GDP growth, an upside of reduced trade tensions boosting economic activity, and a downside of escalating conflicts triggering a 1.7% GDP contraction in 2026 [5].

Amid this turbulence, municipal resilience strategies have emerged as critical buffers. The National Adaptation and Resilience Planning Strategy, launched in 2025, emphasizes collaboration between federal, state, and local actors to address climate and economic risks [6]. However, federal devolution—shifting disaster preparedness and infrastructure responsibilities to states and municipalities—has created fiscal strain. At least 25 states introduced climate adaptation legislation in 2025, focusing on wildfire resiliency and flood preparedness, yet critics warn that under-resourced local governments may struggle to meet these demands [7].

Case studies highlight the stakes. Sanctuary cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, initially targeted for funding cuts under Trump’s immigration policies, secured legal victories preserving billions in federal grants [8]. Meanwhile, cities such as Detroit and Dallas have pivoted to reshoring strategies, incentivizing domestic manufacturing to offset tariff-driven supply chain disruptions [9]. Climate-related fiscal risks further complicate the picture: property values in high-risk areas are declining, straining tax bases and increasing borrowing costs for infrastructure projects [10].

For investors, the implications are clear. Municipal bonds with strong credit fundamentals—particularly in water, sewer, and electric utilities—remain attractive, but caution is warranted in sectors exposed to tariff volatility, such as manufacturing and agriculture [11]. The expiration of federal programs like the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) in 2026 threatens to exacerbate fiscal gaps, particularly in urban centers [12]. Defensive strategies, including low-volatility equities and quality-focused portfolios, are gaining traction as hedging mechanisms against policy uncertainty [13].

In conclusion, the 2025 federal-state conflicts have created a landscape of heightened geopolitical and economic risk. While municipal resilience strategies offer pathways to stability, their success hinges on navigating federal policy shifts and global trade dynamics.

The goal of the Reactor Pilot Program is to expedite the testing of advanced reactor designs that will be authorized by the Department at sites outside the national laboratories.

The program represents an important step toward streamlining nuclear reactor testing and unleashes a new pathway toward fast-tracking commercial licensing activities. Aalo was selected for the program following a competitive Request for Applications process and aims to be the first recipient to begin construction on a test facility.

Aalo-X will be manufactured at Aalo’s 40,000 square foot pilot factory in Austin, Texas, before being transported to and installed at INL.

The Aalo-X is the precursor to the Aalo Pod which is expected to provide commercial power in 2029. The Aalo Pod is a 50 MWe XMR power plant purpose-built for data centers. Each Aalo Pod contains five Aalo-1 reactors, is fully modular (both the reactor and the plant) and can scale seamlessly to gigawatts.

“With a small physical footprint and no need for external water sources, the Aalo Pod is easy to collocate onsite with the data center. Aalo-1 reactors are factory built, sodium-cooled, and use proven, safe, readily available low-enriched uranium dioxide fuel,” the company said.

Company Secures Funding

Aalo Atomics recently secured $100M in Series B funding.

The funding is led by Valor Equity Partners with participation from new and existing investors including Fine Structure Ventures, Hitachi Ventures, NRG Energy, Vamos Ventures, Tishman Speyer, Kindred Ventures, 50Y, Harpoon Ventures, Crescent Enterprises, Crosscut, Alumni Ventures, MCJ, Gaingels, and Nucleation Capital, among others.

Aalo has raised more than $136 million to date and has completed its first full-scale non-nuclear prototype earlier this year with plans to finish construction on its first extra modular nuclear reactor (XMR) in 2026.

And in today’s time, renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass hold out a hopeful solution.
Unlike conventional fossil-fuel-based power plants, renewable energy power plants are decentralized and sit in remote or ecologically critical positions.
Enabling Project Financing The renewable energy insurance market has developed rapidly, from a simple property damage policy to technologically enhanced solutions.
These factors together drive more capital flow into the renewable energy sector, accelerating project deployment and contributing to a more sustainable energy future.","As India gears up for decarbonizing energy to 50% and achieving 500 GW of fossil fuel-free generating capacity by 2030, renewable energy is becoming centre stage in the country. Insurance is becoming a quiet force enabler, insuring green assets and releasing funds that can help drive the world’s clean energy transition. With global warming and changing climatic conditions, there has never been a greater need to accelerate the transition to clean energy. And in today’s time, renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass hold out a hopeful solution. More importantly, there is a need to protect the renewable energy sources, which can only be done through insurance.

Below are ways in which insurance is protecting the renewable energy sector today:

Protecting India’s vision of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030

Renewables usually face unique risks like weather challenges, land acquisition delays, grid unavailability, and technology performance issues. Unlike conventional fossil-fuel-based power plants, renewable energy power plants are decentralized and sit in remote or ecologically critical positions. Solar farms are exposed to hail, heat fatigue, and dust storms; wind turbines are subject to lightning strikes, blade wear, or gusty surges of wind; hydroelectric stations are exposed to fluctuations with the seasons, droughts, or floods.

Insurance thus offers protection against such disturbances as natural catastrophes, fire and explosion risks, construction delays, and cost overruns. In the absence of proper cover, a single bout of weather-related incident or cyber-attack can lead to huge losses.

Along with that, renewable insurance also provides operational risk coverage, which includes machinery breakdown cover, liability cover (third-party, environmental), and loss of revenue due to underperformance or downtime.

Enabling Project Financing

The renewable energy insurance market has developed rapidly, from a simple property damage policy to technologically enhanced solutions. The insurance products available today are designed to meet the unique requirements of green power programs, taking into account the complexities of technologies, geographies, and regulatory environments.

Lenders and equity investors, thus, often require insurance as a condition for disbursement to fund renewable energy projects. Her,e insurance today plays an instrumental role by improving creditworthiness for Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). For banks and NBFCs involved in green financing, it can help in redirecting their loan portfolios. These factors together drive more capital flow into the renewable energy sector, accelerating project deployment and contributing to a more sustainable energy future.

Supporting during Construction & Commissioning

Insurance policies like Contractors All Risk (CAR), Erection All Risk (EAR), and aDayin Start-Up (DSU) are meant to support construction projects, as well as renewable energy projects. These policies cover unforeseen circumstances during installation and commissioning, and help in timely project completion, which is critical for meeting the national targets of the country.

Protecting the Indian renewable energy market

The industry here is witnessing a 15–20% increase in demand, fuelled by favourable government policies, increased ESG expectations, and increased sensitization of the project exposures. Foreign reinsurers and insurers are also plugging gaps, crafting policies for new technology such as floating solar, offshore wind, battery energy storage systems, and hybrid renewable configurations. Well-insured projects will be more likely to attract capital, meet demands, and sail through regulatory bottlenecks. They are also better able to deliver steady returns and address long-term sustainability demands.

Insurance companies help align coverage with MNRE policies and state-level solar/wind park frameworks. Insurance is also allowing the realization of wider environmental ambitions by making new technology deployment, such as green hydrogen, carbon capture, and energy storage at scale, feasible. High-risk, high-payback projects like these have difficulty finding capital because there is perceived risk. With suitable insurance products, the road to commercialization is easier and less risky.

While we promote sustainable development and renewable energy, we should appreciate the support systems fuelling this revolution. Insurance, largely unnoticed, is a silent pillar of the renewable industry, converting risk into resilience, fear into foresight, and ambition into sustainable advancement.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/default-article-banner.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 17:02:24.661866

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Renewable energy executive calls for public awareness, equity, and action in reshaping how America thinks about energy access

Louisiana, USA, 30th August 2025, ZEX PR WIRE, Tyler Pommier, Executive Vice President of Innovation at GulfStream Renewables, is calling on individuals, communities, and leaders across the U.S. to rethink the way energy is produced, shared, and understood. After years of spearheading clean energy projects across the Gulf Coast, Pommier is using his platform to raise awareness about energy equity and local empowerment through decentralized, renewable systems.

""Everyone deserves access to clean power,"" Pommier says. ""Not just for the environment, but for dignity, safety, and freedom.""

This message is central to Pommier's recent TEDx talk titled ""Decentralizing Power: Energy Belongs to Everyone."" It also echoes throughout his work developing solar, wind, and battery systems that support schools, neighborhoods, and underserved rural areas.

The Power Gap

Pommier's advocacy comes at a time when energy insecurity remains a serious issue. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration:

Nearly one in three U.S. households faces some form of energy insecurity each year.

In rural and low-income communities, power outages and energy costs impact health, education, and economic stability.

Schools in underserved areas face frequent disruptions due to unreliable power, affecting student learning and safety.

""This isn't just a technical problem-it's a people problem,"" says Pommier. ""When a school loses power, classrooms close. When a family can't afford heating, people get sick. Energy touches every part of our lives.""

Local Action, Local Control

One of Pommier's proudest achievements is a series of solar-plus-battery installations in rural schools across Louisiana.

""These schools had constant outages,"" he explains. ""We gave them a way to stay open, save money, and be resilient. That kind of project shows how clean energy can serve real human needs.""

He believes decentralized systems-like rooftop solar, community microgrids, and battery storage-can give control back to families, schools, and local governments.

""I want to see communities that don't just use power,"" he says. ""I want to see communities that own their power.""

Making Clean Energy Understandable

Pommier is also focused on simplifying the conversation. ""You can't just throw data at people,"" he says. ""You have to explain how it affects their daily lives. Like: Will your fridge stay on in a storm? Will your kid's school stay open during a blackout?""

His plainspoken approach has made him a trusted voice at town halls, schools, and policy meetings.

What You Can Do

Pommier isn't asking people to wait for government action or big investment. Instead, he's offering simple steps that everyday people can take:

Learn how your home or building uses energy.

Ask questions at local meetings about power sourcing and grid reliability.

Support community solar projects or energy co-ops.

Encourage schools and public buildings to explore renewable options.

Talk about it. Share energy stories with neighbors, family, and friends.

""Start small,"" Pommier says. ""Talk to your city council. Learn how your utility works. Ask where your electricity comes from. That's how change begins.""

InsideSources.com

A great debate is underway as political leaders, technology experts and leaders from multiple industries engage in a serious discussion about the impending AI revolution and its implications for our country, society and future.

The conclusions drawn from these discussions range from wildly optimistic to a frightening, dystopian future. However, two things that are almost universally accepted are, one, the United States must win the AI race against our Chinese counterparts, and two, winning this race requires new power, equipment and an aggressive data-center buildout that depends on a combination of innovative policies and coordination between governments and industry.

The National Association of Electrical Distributors is a national organization representing wholesalers of electrical products with nearly 5,600 warehouse locations nationwide. The industry is positioned to help the nation rise to the occasion. Research indicates that $4.5 billion in economic activity will flow through the warehouse and distribution network to support data center buildout this year.

The question is, “How do policymakers create an environment where private industry can achieve this monumental task?”

Leaders in Washington must focus on expanding opportunities to attract and retain a skilled workforce, while also strengthening domestic sourcing and manufacturing across the electrical equipment supply chain.

On the workforce, Congress and the administration made progress in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by including a provision to allow individuals to use money from 529 savings accounts to pay for post-secondary training programs. This will help more Americans obtain and retain well-paying jobs that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.

Congress should pass the Veterans Energy Transition Act, which would help veterans and their spouses secure well-paying jobs in the growing energy industry.

Nearly 200,000 service members transition out of active duty annually. NAED is helping our members tap into this talent pool. Incentivizing this burgeoning pipeline would benefit more of those who have served and will equip our members with the talent they need to electrify America. Veterans bring valuable skills, hands-on training, and a strong sense of mission that aligns closely with the needs of the energy industry.

Congress should also extend and expand tax incentives designed to promote domestic manufacturing of key technologies, most notably distribution transformers. As the country starts reshoring production of certain materials and components, an incentive structure that has proven successful in the past should be reworked to provide additional relief to companies trying to do the right thing by bringing jobs back to America.

Permitting reform, which has been discussed but has proven elusive, is needed to cut red tape and to allow project developers the required legal and regulatory certainty to build reliable mining and power generation capacity. We appreciate efforts to move the ball forward, but we need legislation to ensure these efforts are not reversed in the future.

Finally, we support a trade policy framework set forth by NEMA, our electrical manufacturing partner, that encourages American investments and onshoring.

Their three-pronged “Tariff Offset” framework aligns trade policy with national goals by offering targeted tariff relief for capital investments in domestic manufacturing, for goods essential to AI and grid infrastructure, and for products meeting “Made in America” content standards.

Together, these sensible policies will give risk-takers the coverage they need to shift workers to critical industries, unleash the availability of materials and products sourced by American-based firms, and provide needed relief for those working to ensure the United States can meet the demands to dominate the AI race.",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bud-DeFlaviis-e1756310893412.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 20:03:28.170236

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.
The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state.
Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.
Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the power to implement a penalty but has not done so since it was given that authority in 2023.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state. It created an independent division at the commission to oversee the oil and gas industry and provide guidance to the state on its energy transition.

Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.

“When Governor Newsom signed this legislation two years ago, he promised that we would utilize the new transparency tools to look under the hood of our oil and gas market that had been a black box for decades,” spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in a statement. “We did exactly that.”

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission has not determined what would count as an excessive profit under the policy.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting towards more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://www.wspa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/2025/08/68b2129967efd3.90903522.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 19:03:04.009529

“But we just want to say very clearly that we need the private sector.” ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","The head of this year’s United Nations climate summit in Brazil urged CEOs to ignore the Trump-led green backlash and come to the Amazonian city of Belem to step up the fight against global warming.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Andre Correa do Lago, who will oversee the COP30 climate talks in November, sought to allay growing concerns that US President Donald Trump’s use of tariffs and hostility toward green energy sources could undermine the clean power transition. He said that recent attacks on clean energy sources like wind and solar show that the interests of fossil fuel producers are increasingly threatened by the transition to a greener economy.

“The success of this agenda is a challenge to some businesses and some interests,” said Correa do Lago, while calling on the private sector to attend the COP30 summit en masse in order to implement the commitments made by countries. “This is the utmost demonstration that these policies worked or these policies are working and that they are somehow threatening some significant interest.”

Trump’s distaste for climate-progressive policies has reverberated across the business community as he puts a halt to wind projects, slaps countries across the world with tariffs and causes banks to rethink their own climate commitments for fear of running against the ESG backlash. Against such a backdrop, it’s not clear how many executives will make the trip to a climate conference in Brazil.

The dilemma faced by business was recently exemplified when the world’s biggest climate alliance for banks suspended its activities and proposed a vote on scrapping its current structure in the face of a Wall Street exodus that spread globally.

In a letter published Friday, Correa do Lago called on the private sector to take a “step forward, and not back” in order to make the transition an “exponential reality.”

So far, the run-up to COP30 has been overshadowed by logistical issues in the Amazonian city of Belem, with many of the 50,000 participants expected battling a shortage of available accommodation and extremely high prices. It’s an issue that business executives will also have to contend with, and many may choose to focus on side events taking place in the larger cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

Correa do Lago said that private sector representatives would face less of an issue in Belem as they’d likely attend the summit for shorter periods than negotiators.

“Obviously the element that unfortunately everybody’s talking about Belem is the difficulty of having rooms,” he said. “But we just want to say very clearly that we need the private sector.”

By suspending new project approvals, rescinding designated wind energy zones, and revoking subsidies, the administration has introduced immediate and long-term risks for investors, workers, and energy security. This analysis examines the implications of these policies, drawing on recent actions and their economic and strategic consequences.

Immediate Risks: Project Halts and Job Losses

The administration’s January 2025 executive order effectively froze offshore wind development by halting permits, loans, and rights-of-way approvals [1]. This move canceled $679 million in funding for 12 projects and revoked key approvals, such as the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island [2]. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management also rescinded 3.5 million acres of designated Wind Energy Areas, removing pre-approved zones for development [1]. These actions have already jeopardized over 17,000 jobs in the offshore wind sector, particularly in blue-collar communities reliant on port infrastructure and manufacturing [2].

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which accelerated the phase-out of subsidies for renewables, further exacerbated the crisis. By shortening the eligibility period for tax credits to 12 months and imposing stricter permitting timelines, the law has made financing and project timelines increasingly precarious [1]. The result? A 36% drop in U.S. renewable energy investment in the first half of 2025 [2].

Long-Term Risks: Investor Confidence and Market Shifts

The regulatory uncertainty has triggered a ""regulatory lottery"" for developers, eroding investor confidence [2]. Investors are now pivoting to alternative technologies like green hydrogen and energy storage, as well as emerging markets less susceptible to U.S. policy volatility [1]. This shift risks leaving the U.S. behind in the global clean energy race, where countries like Germany and the UK are scaling offshore wind capacity.

The administration’s ""project density"" policy, requiring renewables to match fossil fuels’ energy output per acre, has also disqualified many wind and solar projects from permits [1]. This arbitrary standard undermines the scalability of renewables and prioritizes short-term fossil fuel production, including resuming LNG exports and lifting drilling restrictions in Alaska [1]. Such policies expose the U.S. to price volatility and geopolitical risks, contrasting with the energy security promised by renewables [3].

Energy Security and Strategic Implications

While the administration frames these rollbacks as a path to ""American energy dominance,"" the reality is more complex. Despite federal setbacks, renewables still accounted for 90% of new electrical capacity additions in the first nine months of 2024, driven by market forces and state-level policies [1]. However, the federal retreat has created a fragmented energy strategy, where state-level progress is undermined by national policy.

The termination of offshore wind port infrastructure funding and the rescission of the Lava Ridge wind project in Idaho signal a broader retreat from long-term planning [2]. This undermines the U.S.’s ability to meet climate goals and compete globally, as the Department of the Interior simultaneously rolls back protections for national forests and geothermal incentives [1].

Conclusion: Navigating the Storm

Trump’s offshore wind rollbacks present a dual challenge: immediate job losses and investment declines, coupled with long-term risks to energy security and global competitiveness. For investors, the key lies in hedging against policy uncertainty by diversifying into resilient technologies and markets. Yet, the administration’s focus on fossil fuels and nuclear energy may not address the volatility and environmental costs inherent in those sectors [2].

As the offshore wind sector braces for further regulatory turbulence, the question remains: Can market forces and state-level initiatives offset the federal retreat, or will the U.S. cede its clean energy future to more policy-stable nations? The answer will shape not only the energy transition but the economic and strategic trajectory of the country.

In a report last week, Compass Point analysts led by Whitney Stanco said the Department of Energy's recent establishment of a new consortium for nuclear fuel paves the way for the Trump administration to take stakes in companies as part of the government's quest to build a domestic supply of enriched uranium, the critical fuel used to make nuclear energy.

“Given the U.S. nuclear fuel industry’s interest in roughly $3.4 billion of federal funding from Biden-era appropriations, we believe it may be a target for future similar Trump administration deals,” Stanco wrote.

The DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy is expected to work with industry participants in the coming weeks to identify participants and long-term goals.

The Trump administration has already announced deals with Intel (INTC) and rare earths producer MP Materials (MP), both of which involved the government backing major domestic manufacturing projects. Following the Intel deal struck earlier this month, Trump and other members of the administration suggested this would be the beginning of a broader investment strategy.

Stanco sees Bethesda, Md-based Centrus Energy (LEU) as a likely recipient of government backing, as it is the only domestic company currently producing enriched uranium under a DOE contract. Centrus shares have rallied over 180% year to date. BWX Technologies (BWXT), a Lynchburg, Va-based company with a $15 billion market cap, is also on the analyst’s list. Its stock is up 45% year to date.

The Russia-Ukraine war renewed national security concerns around nuclear power, as uranium enrichment has increasingly shifted overseas. Meanwhile, the AI boom’s surging energy demands have increased interest in nuclear energy as deals between Big Tech and nuclear energy providers have put a spotlight on the sector.

Nuclear energy providers Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VSTR) are each up more than 35% year to date on optimism of growing power demand for data centers.

On Tuesday, BofA initiated coverage of Oklo (OKLO), a builder of next-generation small nuclear reactors (SMRs), with a Buy rating. Its stock is up more than 1,000% over the last year as investors bet on nuclear energy as part of the AI trade. ""Nuclear is regaining momentum, backed by both the DOE and data center operators, with Oklo well positioned to meet the rising energy needs of AI,"" the firm wrote.

And while the administration's high-profile Intel deal is seen as a novel arrangement, Compass Point's Stanco notes that government ownership of nuclear fuel production is not unusual around the world.

In the US, much of the enriched uranium supply comes from Urenco, whose ownership is split among the UK and Dutch governments, along with German utilities. France, meanwhile, owns 90% of Orano, a primary enrichment company seeking to expand in the US.

""Therefore, we can see where the Trump administration may want to exert leverage through the potential funding, and, in the case of Urenco or Orano, even through trade or other sovereign negotiations, to seek more US ownership of new domestic nuclear fuel production,"" Stanco added.

A 'fundamental tension'

Still, questions remain on how these deals will ultimately shake out and whether the government should be doling out money in exchange for stakes.

“There is a fundamental tension here,” Philip Rossetti, a resident senior fellow at the right-leaning R Street Institute, told Yahoo Finance. ""You're incentivizing these companies to try to get under this umbrella of governmental protection.”

“The problem is, if that company starts to become inefficient with its production, like if it has rising production costs, or neglecting investment that would improve productivity or reduce operating costs, the bearer of those costs and inefficiencies are going to be the public,"" he added.

But the White House has signaled Intel's deal could be just the beginning of a new wave of government dealmaking under the second Trump administration.

MP Materials stock surged 50% in one session in July after announcing the Pentagon would become its largest shareholder to curb reliance on Chinese rare earths. Intel shares rose 5% after the US announced a 9.9% stake in the struggling chipmaker.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently hinted the administration is considering taking a stake in defense contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT), telling CNBC there has been a ""monstrous discussion about defense.""

“The Biden administration literally was giving Intel money for free and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies just giving the money for free,” said Lutnick.

“Donald Trump turned it into saying, ‘Hey, we want equity for the money. If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action for the American taxpayer.’”

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It's the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

The scholar asks whether China will take over the global auto industry.
There are, after all, about 150 passenger car manufacturers in China — 97 domestic manufacturers and 43 joint ventures with foreigners.
That’s not good news for a Chinese car sector that has now become extraordinarily dependent on exports.
In a world where China is shut off from the most developed markets, China’s car industry and BYD, its leader, may be the ones without a future.","China’s carmakers were responsible for 21 percent of global sales in 2024, according to consulting group AlixPartners. They are projected to account for 30 percent in 2030.

China, already the world’s largest automobile market, “has overtaken Detroit as the center of the global auto industry,” writes the New York Times. The country’s manufacturers are not stopping there, however.

“China now has an incredible — and I would argue unprecedented — capacity to supply over half the global market for cars, which is typically around 90 million cars a year,” according to Brad Sester of the Council on Foreign Relations.

The scholar asks whether China will take over the global auto industry. The answer: Probably not.

China’s automobile sector is certainly big. There are, after all, about 150 passenger car manufacturers in China — 97 domestic manufacturers and 43 joint ventures with foreigners. New companies are still entering the crowded market.

Some of those car companies are doing well. In an industry where 70 percent factory utilization is the general dividing line between profitability and failure, Tesla in China had the highest rate at 96 percent.

The company in its Shanghai “gigafactory” makes the Model 3 and Model Y sport-utility vehicles for both domestic and foreign sales. Shenzhen-based BYD, the world’s largest new-energy vehicle maker, enjoyed utilization rates of 80 to 85 percent in the 2022 to 2024 timeframe.

Many of the companies in China will not survive, however. Only about 15 percent of 70 Chinese carmakers tracked by Gasgoo Automotive Research Institute had a factory utilization rate last year of at least 70 percent.

The next trend in China, therefore, is easy to predict.

“The consolidation has not yet truly begun,” Stephen Dyer of AlixPartners in Shanghai told Bloomberg. “In the end, it will slowly consolidate because car making is a truly cash-burning business. We expect to see maybe a dozen survivors.”

Price wars started in early 2023 and have taken their toll. The discounting is the inevitable result of too much supply. Too much supply is the inevitable result of China’s economic model, which depresses consumption and prioritizes industrial production.

As a result of this model, China’s internal market — around 25 million car sales per year — is not growing robustly.

In the last several weeks, the Chinese central government, alarmed by deep discounting, has stepped in to stabilize prices. Government action is only a temporary fix, however. China’s planners see exports as the longer-term solution.

“China currently has the capacity to produce over two times its own domestic demand and is adding to that capacity quickly thanks to the rapid expansion of its electric vehicle sector,” Sester wrote. “It thus has almost unlimited potential capacity to export.”

And China is exporting, grabbing market share and decimating foreign car companies around the world.

In a rules-based trading system — China acceded to the World Trade Organization in December 2001 — Chinese manufacturers have been able to penetrate open markets. At the same time, Beijing has gamed rules and taken advantage of lax enforcement by others of their rights. As a result, China has largely been allowed to continue policies blocking access to its market.

“A U.S. system built around the ideal of openness and interdependence is facing off against a Chinese counterpart constructed as a fortress of control,” write Tom Orlik, Eric Zhu and Jennifer Welch of Bloomberg.

“In a first-best world of free trade and market competition, the dynamism of the U.S. approach should win every time,” they point out.

But we do not live in that world. The writers dubbed our situation as “the second-best world of protectionism and economic statecraft.” They said this “theory of the second best” posits that “if one of the conditions for perfect markets is missing, sticking with the others — rather than finding a second-best accommodation — only makes things worse.”

“China’s state planners have spent decades developing tools for a second-best world,” they continue. These planners have, with numerous stratagems, successfully exploited that system. In practical terms, China is now forcing the rest of the world to accept a second-best system.

As countries choose the second best — most notably the U.S. with President Trump’s ongoing tariff campaign — China’s industries will suffer, especially as others follow his protectionist lead.

That’s not good news for a Chinese car sector that has now become extraordinarily dependent on exports.

In 2024, BYD, which stands for “Build Your Dreams,” passed Tesla to become the world’s biggest-selling electric vehicle brand. Many believe the race between the two companies is just about over.

It’s not. In a world where China is shut off from the most developed markets, China’s car industry and BYD, its leader, may be the ones without a future.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/china_auto_cas_byd_08232025_GettyImages-2230783280-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 17:03:18.616636

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,’' an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.
“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,’' said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.
More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,’' an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,’' spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,’' she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,’' said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees. Officials expect total staffing to go down to about 12,500, a reduction of more than 3,700 employees, or nearly 23%, from staffing levels when Trump took office in January.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/d24bef2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5494x3090+0+286/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F91%2Fca%2F2893c1244186dbc1aebe5e266741%2F0a99a1b40a02424bbb6e7da7ad2d3b34,N,,2025-08-30 17:03:01.179507

The Humboldt Bay project was planned to build a maritime terminal for assembling and deploying wind turbines, supporting California's goal of achieving 25 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2045.","The U.S. Department of Transportation has canceled funding for 12 infrastructure projects supporting offshore wind development, totaling 679 million dollars. This decision directly impacts thousands of jobs, including many blue-collar workers who supported the current administration in the elections, creating a stark contrast with the government's ""America First"" labor policies.

The administration is accelerating its policy offensive against wind energy development. The Department of Transportation's decision to withdraw funding for these projects is part of a broader strategy to prioritize traditional energy sources over renewable energy. The department's secretary stated that wasteful wind energy projects were diverting resources that could be used to revitalize the U.S. maritime industry. The reallocated funds are expected to support port upgrades and other infrastructure projects.

One of the most significant projects affected is the Revolution Wind project by Danish energy company Orsted A/S, which was ordered to halt its operations off the coast of New England. The project, which was 80% complete, is now under threat, raising concerns about potential electricity price increases. Industry executives warn that the administration's actions against clean energy could lead to higher electricity prices.

The project's suspension has left approximately 1,000 workers in Rhode Island idle, sparking strong discontent among local union leaders. The union chairman highlighted that these jobs were specifically trained ""blue-collar, working-class positions"" that the administration had promised to protect. A non-profit industry advocacy group also noted the irony of these actions coming from an administration that frequently discusses the importance of American workers and enjoys union support.

Industry advocates warn that the project's stagnation will not only affect coastal regions but also ripple through the manufacturing supply chain in Republican strongholds like Louisiana. The administration has reiterated its energy policy priorities, emphasizing the release of domestic oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy as the most effective and reliable tools. Under this policy, multiple offshore wind projects have become targets, with the Humboldt Bay project in California being the most severely affected, losing approximately 427 million dollars in federal funding.

The Humboldt Bay project was planned to build a maritime terminal for assembling and deploying wind turbines, supporting California's goal of achieving 25 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2045. The 12 affected projects include:

Projects with funding withdrawn:

Bridgeport Port Authority Wind Energy Maintenance Port Project in Connecticut (10.53 million dollars)

Louisiana, USA, 30th August 2025, ZEX PR WIRE , Tyler Pommier , Executive Vice President of Innovation at GulfStream Renewables, is calling on individuals, communities, and leaders across the U.S. to rethink the way energy is produced, shared, and understood. After years of spearheading clean energy projects across the Gulf Coast, Pommier is using his platform to raise awareness about energy equity and local empowerment through decentralized, renewable systems.

“Everyone deserves access to clean power,” Pommier says.“Not just for the environment, but for dignity, safety, and freedom.”

This message is central to Pommier's recent TEDx talk titled“Decentralizing Power: Energy Belongs to Everyone.” It also echoes throughout his work developing solar, wind, and battery systems that support schools, neighborhoods, and underserved rural areas.

The Power Gap

Pommier's advocacy comes at a time when energy insecurity remains a serious issue. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration:

Nearly one in three U.S. households faces some form of energy insecurity each year.

In rural and low-income communities, power outages and energy costs impact health, education, and economic stability.

Schools in underserved areas face frequent disruptions due to unreliable power, affecting student learning and safety.

“This isn't just a technical problem-it's a people problem,” says Pommier.“When a school loses power, classrooms close. When a family can't afford heating, people get sick. Energy touches every part of our lives.”

Local Action, Local Control

One of Pommier's proudest achievements is a series of solar-plus-battery installations in rural schools across Louisiana.

“These schools had constant outages,” he explains.“We gave them a way to stay open, save money, and be resilient. That kind of project shows how clean energy can serve real human needs.”

He believes decentralized systems-like rooftop solar, community microgrids, and battery storage-can give control back to families, schools, and local governments.

“I want to see communities that don't just use power,” he says.“I want to see communities that own their power.”

Making Clean Energy Understandable

Pommier is also focused on simplifying the conversation.“You can't just throw data at people,” he says.“You have to explain how it affects their daily lives. Like: Will your fridge stay on in a storm? Will your kid's school stay open during a blackout?”

His plainspoken approach has made him a trusted voice at town halls, schools, and policy meetings.

What You Can Do

Pommier isn't asking people to wait for government action or big investment. Instead, he's offering simple steps that everyday people can take:

Learn how your home or building uses energy.

Ask questions at local meetings about power sourcing and grid reliability.

Support community solar projects or energy co-ops.

Encourage schools and public buildings to explore renewable options.

Talk about it. Share energy stories with neighbors, family, and friends.

“Start small,” Pommier says.“Talk to your city council. Learn how your utility works. Ask where your electricity comes from. That's how change begins.”

Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.","WASHINGTON — The Transportation Department on Friday canceled $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects, the latest attack by the Trump administration on the reeling U.S. offshore wind industry.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It's the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It's the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Lower electricity prices also could accelerate California’s clean energy transition by making electric cars more affordable, helping the state meet its climate goals.
This shift would be more equitable since nearly all households pay electric bills, but many don’t use gas.
Finally, state policymakers should prioritize state funding for California’s electric vehicle programs, which deliver direct savings to all electricity customers.","This legislative session offers a crucial opportunity to update the climate credit program and use these funds to lower electric rates, delivering meaningful relief where families need it most: on their electricity bills. That change, combined with other rate reforms taking effect next year, could reduce costs for most households by 20%, UC Santa Barbara researchers found.

That’s real savings that can improve lives across California. And it starts with thoughtfully reauthorizing the cap and trade program so funding can reach utility customers.

Addressing the affordability crisis requires action on multiple fronts. In addition to reforming the climate credit, state lawmakers should also advance structural changes by regionalizing California’s electric grid and protecting electric vehicle programs, which lower costs for everyone.

The urgency is clear. PG&E rates have climbed 40% above inflation since 2018. Rates for other investor-owned utilities are increasing at a similarly dire pace. For families struggling to make ends meet, these increases are crushing.

California’s leaders can take decisive action in the coming weeks.

It begins with restructuring the climate credit program to deliver monthly relief, instead of twice a year, by using polluter fees to directly reduce electricity prices. This creates predictable savings and importantly can help inland families afford air conditioning during the brutal summer heat.

Lower electricity prices also could accelerate California’s clean energy transition by making electric cars more affordable, helping the state meet its climate goals.

Legislators also could shift funds currently applied to gas bills toward electricity relief, where families need help the most. Electricity represents the largest utility expense for most California households. This shift would be more equitable since nearly all households pay electric bills, but many don’t use gas.

State leaders should pair these climate credit reforms with structural electric system changes, including participating in a regionalized grid that enables clean energy sharing across the West. It will help California develop more renewable energy to use or sell to other states, while reducing fossil fuel dependence and improving air quality.

Finally, state policymakers should prioritize state funding for California’s electric vehicle programs, which deliver direct savings to all electricity customers.

Every electric car and truck on the road helps lower everyone’s bills because EV owners pay more in electricity costs than they actually cost the grid to serve, essentially subsidizing cheaper prices for all Californians. As more families make the switch to electric vehicles, these savings compound, creating a virtuous cycle of falling electricity prices that benefits every household, regardless of what they drive.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/davisenterprise.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/0d/d0d09c6a-17f2-41a1-babd-9b7ed41960e5/68b1e0b8de09b.image.jpg?crop=1000%2C525%2C0%2C237,N,,2025-08-30 13:05:34.203597

State regulators are again seeking developers who could pull off a wind and transmission project with the new regional support.
However, it’s an open question whether the northern Maine transmission project will be able to overcome some of the early roadblocks — including local resistance along the proposed corridor — that have already stalled the project for several years.
But Francis Pullaro, president of the green energy-supporting group RENEW Northeast, said the northern Maine project can survive without federal assistance.
Northern Maine has some of the strongest wind energy potential in the Northeast, according to experts.","A new push to boost electricity capacity across New England could help to get a stalled transmission line project to northern Maine — and related wind energy development in the region — back on track.

The effort by ISO New England, which operates the region’s power grid, will likely support the upgrade of a key substation in Pittsfield and other changes to move power farther south into New England. That could, in turn, make it easier to tap the mostly undeveloped wind energy potential of northern Maine, according to Jack Shapiro, director for clean energy programs at the Natural Resources Council of Maine.

Clean energy advocates hope the efforts by ISO New England could give a much-needed boost to Maine’s own plans to create more wind energy in Aroostook County and send it southward. State regulators are again seeking developers who could pull off a wind and transmission project with the new regional support.

However, it’s an open question whether the northern Maine transmission project will be able to overcome some of the early roadblocks — including local resistance along the proposed corridor — that have already stalled the project for several years.

Because all six New England states will share in the costs for transmission investments, ISO New England’s new effort could knock hundreds of millions of dollars off the overall cost to Maine ratepayers for a project in the northern part of the state, Shapiro said.

“It’s a really big deal and really exciting to see this kind of regional planning and thinking,” Shapiro said.

Across the U.S., the renewable energy outlook has gotten considerably darker under the new Trump administration, which has pushed executive actions and a Republican megabill that have removed key federal support for those efforts.

But Francis Pullaro, president of the green energy-supporting group RENEW Northeast, said the northern Maine project can survive without federal assistance.

“Federal support is not mandatory; however, certainly any project that can benefit from federal tax policy will have increased benefits for Maine and the region’s consumers,” he said.

Northern Maine has some of the strongest wind energy potential in the Northeast, according to experts. But harnessing that wind and getting the electricity it produces to the power grid has had its share of obstacles and stalled attempts, including the Number Nine Wind Farm canceled in late 2016 and the Aroostook Renewable Gateway canceled in December 2023.

Nonetheless, the region’s electric usage continues to increase due to heat pumps, EVs, and other electrification priorities, and the need for new power sources has grown with it, said Pullaro. That’s on top of Maine’s push to produce 100 percent clean electricity by 2040.

As part of ISO New England’s new initiative to encourage more transmission capacity, it has issued a request for proposals for various efforts, including developing new infrastructure in Pittsfield — or at an alternate location north of a substation there — that can accommodate the interconnection of at least 1,200 megawatts of onshore wind.

The RFP also seeks to increase what’s called the “interface capability” in two different parts of southern Maine near the New Hampshire border.

According to Shapiro, the ISO could select more than one project to address all of those needs but the substation and transmission line would be located in Maine. The six New England states would share in the costs, with bids closing on Sept. 30.

The Pittsfield substation, with its more northern location, could make plugging into the grid easier than a previous substation proposal near Augusta, although the transmission route has not yet been determined, Shapiro said.

Another boost to Maine’s renewed attempt to get electricity flowing from Aroostook County has come from Massachusetts legislators. The state had previously agreed to purchase 40 percent of the power generated from the Aroostook Renewable Gateway project, but that offer had a December 2025 deadline. Recently, the state approved extending that deadline to 2027.

In 2021, the Maine Legislature tasked the Maine Public Utility Commission with soliciting bids for both power generation and transmission for the Aroostook Renewable Gateway project.

New York-headquartered LS Power was awarded the transmission portion of the gateway project, and Boston-based Longroad Energy’s King Pine Wind was selected to generate the power with County located wind turbines.

The Aroostook Renewable Gateway was touted as the largest land-based wind project east of the Mississippi River. With its proposed 170 wind turbines slated to snake along a large swath of Aroostook County mountain tops, it was set to harness the northern Maine wind. And the complementary transmission line, starting in Haynesville, would have carried that power to the New England electric grid.

But cost and transmission route issues plagued LS Power’s bid, despite efforts by the company to meet with the public in a series of information gathering sessions along the proposed route. Many property owners were opposed to the route because in certain places it cut through the middle of farmlands or rural towns. In late December 2023, the PUC canceled the project because of cost uncertainties.

But in May 2024, the PUC put out a request for information from clean-energy experts and developers interested in bidding on the wind or transmission projects before proceeding with a new call for bids, to better determine how to move forward. In April, the commission made a second request for information that mentioned details on the ISO New England initiative and the proposed substation in Pittsfield.

The deadline for additional comments on the request is Sept. 30, according to PUC spokesperson Susan Faloon. The project is now called the Northern Maine Renewable Energy Development Program.

“Overall, the state and region must bring online low-cost clean energy that provides meaningful benefits to host communities, the states and consumers,” Pullaro said. “If we get this right, it is possible to envision a second regional project moving forward. If we don’t get this right, it means higher costs and energy shortages.”

The PUC expects to issue a draft RFP for the Aroostook wind project and transmission line to allow for public feedback in the coming weeks and then to issue the final request by the end of the year, said Faloon.

Pullaro said that whichever project is ultimately selected, its developers will have a critical role to play in meeting with communities and citizens to listen to their ideas and concerns, and answer questions.

“The importance of the line is that bringing it to fruition will, after 15-plus years of effort, finally unlock northern Maine’s clean energy potential, delivering lower electricity costs and significant community benefits and local investment and jobs,” Pullaro said.",https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Legislatures-Going-Green.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 19:02:15.231165

Electric two-wheeler maker Ather Energy on Saturday unveiled a new two-wheeler platform for a new generation of electric scooters across multiple segments.

The company also announced a series of other significant product and technology developments, including showcasing a concept moto-scooter Redux, and AtherStack 7.0, which would alert riders to share live location, report on potholes and crashes, update them on tyre pressure, among others.

Built for versatility, scalability, and cost optimisation, the new e-scooter platform is the first vehicle architecture since the launch of Ather 450, the company announced at an event here.

""With the EL platform, we are laying the foundation for Ather's next phase of growth. Just as the 450 defined our first chapter, EL will define the next, enabling us to develop multiple types of scooters at scale far more efficiently,"" said Tarun Mehta, Co-founder & CEO, Ather Energy, at the event.

This platform-first approach enables faster innovation and improved efficiency, serviceability, and rider experience, he said adding the latest platform reflects years of learning, deep R&D, and engineering.

Live Events

He said the Ather's new factory at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar will scale with EL platform products to meet growing demand effectively.

A vehicle platform is the underlying structure and integrated systems shared by multiple vehicle models. The structure, which includes the chassis, powertrain, underbody, and electronic architectures, serves as the common foundation for the design and engineering.

The company has two manufacturing plants in Hosur (Tamil Nadu), one each for vehicle manufacturing and battery manufacturing. Additionally, another is coming up in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Maharashtra, which is expected to increase Ather's total manufacturing capacity to 1.42 million EVs per year.

Ather said its next-generation platform is designed to meet the evolving and diverse needs of the domestic electric scooter buyers.

Designed on the back of 26 lakh km of field data, the new platform features a new chassis, powertrain, and a fully redesigned electronics stack. This offers the flexibility to build a wide variety of form factors by utilising a common set of key components, the company said.

The versatility it offers enables Ather to cater to different consumer segments, use cases, and markets, while being more cost-effective. It also noted that simpler architecture and a reduced component count enable 15 per cent faster assembly.

This also allows up to 2X faster periodic services, increasing the service interval up to 10,000 km, it said.

The new platform also introduces features such as Advanced Electronic Braking System (AEBS), which enhances braking performance by reducing stopping distance and minimising rear-wheel lockups, it said.

""With AtherStackTM 7.0, we're bringing AI into everyday riding through an LLM (Large Language Model) trained for our use cases and tuned to Indian dialects. Voice is the first step in that journey, an interface beyond buttons that makes rides smarter, safer, and more intuitive,"" said Swapnil Jain, Co-founder and CTO at Ather Energy.

Ather also announced expanding its theft-safety suite with the introduction of ParkSafe and LockSafe features and said that AtherStack 7.0 will roll out as an over-the-air (OTA) update in the coming months, and will be backwards compatible with the Rizta Z and the Ather 450X up to Gen 3 scooters.

The company also announced it has updated the 2025 Ather 450 Apex with its own advanced cruise control system designed specifically for Indian riding conditions.

Ather also unveiled its next-generation fast-charging experience. The new 6 kW charger is half the size of the current Ather fast charger and delivers double the speed in select Ather variants, adding up to 30 km of range in just 10 minutes, the company said.

Global Clean Energy Incentives: A Long-Term Tailwind While the U.S. market falters, global clean energy incentives are accelerating SolarEdge’s international expansion.","The recent volatility in SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) has sparked debate among investors. With Trump’s 2025 policies phasing out solar tax credits and imposing tariffs, the U.S. solar market faces headwinds. However, SolarEdge’s strategic pivot to international markets, resilient financials, and analyst optimism suggest the pullback may present a compelling entry point for long-term investors.

Political Headwinds and U.S. Market Challenges

President Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" has disrupted the U.S. solar sector by phasing out tax credits for solar and wind energy, favoring hydropower and nuclear alternatives [1]. This policy shift has led to a 42% drop in SolarEdge’s stock price at one point in 2025 [1]. Additionally, tightened federal permits and tariffs on solar imports from Southeast Asia have increased costs and supply chain risks [3]. BloombergNEF projects a 23% decline in U.S. solar installations through 2030 compared to earlier forecasts, directly threatening SolarEdge’s domestic growth [5].

Despite these challenges, the company is adapting. CEO Shuky Nir emphasized in Q2 2025 earnings calls that SolarEdge is expanding U.S. manufacturing to leverage the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit, aiming to neutralize tariff impacts by 2026 [1]. This onshoring strategy aligns with the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives, which have sustained some U.S. solar growth [4].

Analyst Sentiment: Mixed but Optimistic

Analyst ratings for SEDG remain mixed, with a ""Reduce"" consensus from 28 firms, including 10 ""Sell"" and 18 ""Hold"" ratings [1]. However, recent upgrades from Barclays, UBS, and KeyCorp signal cautious optimism. Barclays raised its price target from $12 to $29, while UBS increased its target to $30, maintaining a ""neutral"" rating [1]. These upgrades follow SolarEdge’s Q2 revenue of $289.43 million, a 9% year-over-year increase and a 32% sequential jump [1].

The stock’s 31.8% month-to-date gain as of August 29, 2025, reflects investor confidence despite the bearish consensus [6]. Analysts project an average 1-year target price of $18.20, implying a potential 44.5% downside from the current $32.81 [1]. Yet, the recent Q3 revenue guidance of $315M–$355M (vs. $296.7M estimate) has prompted price target revisions, suggesting earnings resilience [5].

Financial Resilience and Strategic Diversification

SolarEdge’s Q2 2025 results highlight operational improvements. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 13.1%, up from 7.8% in Q1, driven by higher revenue and cost efficiencies [2]. The company also increased cash reserves to $131.8 million, providing liquidity for R&D and strategic acquisitions [3]. Management anticipates further margin improvements in Q3, with non-GAAP gross margin projected at 15–19% despite a 2% tariff impact [3].

Critically, SolarEdge is diversifying its revenue streams. A partnership with Schaeffler to deploy 2,300 EV charging points in Europe and growth in commercial storage solutions position the company to offset U.S. market risks [3]. This pivot aligns with global trends, as the residential solar market faces headwinds in 2026 [1].

Global Clean Energy Incentives: A Long-Term Tailwind

While the U.S. market falters, global clean energy incentives are accelerating SolarEdge’s international expansion. The EU added 67 GW of solar capacity in 2024, supported by the Green Deal and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism [1]. India, now the third-largest solar market, installed 30.7 GW in 2024, driven by its 500 GW non-fossil fuel target by 2030 [1]. Latin America’s Brazil added 14 GW of solar in 2024, fueled by distributed generation and rural electrification [1].

SolarEdge is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends. Malaysia’s Corporate Renewable Energy Supply Scheme and Indonesia’s power wheeling policies are creating favorable conditions for solar-storage projects [3]. Additionally, Singapore’s carbon credit purchases and Vietnam’s Direct Power Purchase Agreement (DPPA) scheme are expanding renewable energy adoption [4].

Conclusion: A Calculated Buy for Long-Term Investors

SolarEdge’s stock has faced significant volatility due to U.S. policy risks, but its financial resilience, strategic diversification, and global market opportunities suggest the pullback is temporary. While the Trump administration’s policies create near-term uncertainty, the company’s onshoring efforts, margin improvements, and international expansion plans mitigate these risks.

For investors with a long-term horizon, SEDG’s current valuation—trading at a discount to its 2028 revenue projections of $1.7 billion [3]—offers a compelling entry point. The global solar market’s projected 10.6% CAGR from 2025 to 2030 [2] further underscores SolarEdge’s potential to thrive beyond U.S. borders. However, investors must remain cautious about regulatory shifts and supply chain bottlenecks.

In a sector defined by rapid innovation and policy-driven cycles, SolarEdge’s adaptability and global reach position it as a resilient long-term play.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 16:04:35.577193

An innovative solution from MIT might hold the key to revolutionizing electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling. A research team at the esteemed institution has unveiled a self-assembling battery material that disintegrates upon contact with a simple organic liquid. This breakthrough, detailed in a recent Nature Chemistry paper, could mark a significant move towards batteries designed with recyclability in mind.

The material primarily acts as an electrolyte in solid-state batteries and is quickly reduced to its molecular components, which could potentially streamline the recycling process. Current recycling methods often shred batteries into mixed, tough-to-process materials. This new approach allows the battery to disassemble, effectively simplifying the separation of components. As Yukio Cho, the lead author of the study, told MIT News, ""Our approach is to start with easily recyclable materials and figure out how to make them battery-compatible. Designing batteries for recyclability from the beginning is a new approach.""

The innovation draws on aramid amphiphiles (AAs), which self-assemble in water to form nanoribbons capable of conducting lithium ions. This combination of resilience, reminiscent of Kevlar, and ion conductivity could prove integral to creating sustainable, efficient batteries. Upon exposure to water, these AAs quickly transform into a gel, indicating a high volume of nanoribbons ready to be hot-pressed into a solid-state material. The team successfully tested a battery cell using this material, although they acknowledged that performance was hampered by polarization, limiting rapid charging and discharging.

Significantly, when dipped into an organic solvent, the battery dissolves, enabling each part to separate for easier recycling. ""So, when you want to recycle the battery, the entire electrolyte layer can fall off naturally and you can recycle the electrodes separately,"" Cho explained in a statement obtained by MIT News. The team currently aims to fully optimize the material's performance and explore integration with existing battery designs and new battery chemistries.

With the escalating demand for EVs, this research could also help address the critical issue of lithium supply. Reusing materials from recycled batteries may act as an effective domestic source of lithium, mitigating the need for new mines and stabilizing lithium pricing. ""If we can start to recycle lithium-ion batteries from battery waste at scale, it'll have the same effect as opening lithium mines in the U.S.,"" said Cho. This type of innovation not only represents a step forward environmentally but also signifies a potential paradigm shift in how the industry approaches battery life cycle and resource utilization.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/8/mit-mavens-unveil-game-changing-self-dismantling-ev-battery-revolutionizing-recycling-and-curbing-e-waste.webp,N,,2025-08-30 14:06:14.837936

“We’ll start to be able to go to electric fleets and reduce the cost straight up — no incentives, no tax breaks, no grants — versus a [gas-powered] fleet,” said CEO Rick Wilmer.
Charging networks have long angled to serve vehicle fleets, such as delivery companies, rideshare outfits and construction contractors, that typically have a large and predictable power demand.
When the vehicles are idle and have extra electrons, they can uncork a tiny trickle of revenue, or at least help power nearby buildings.
Often, these fleets are idle at the end of a work day, precisely when power demand is peaking on the typical grid.","For the past few years, charging networks, delivery fleets and retail hubs have been hustling to add infrastructure to provide juice to electric cars. The next step: helping drivers sell excess electrons back to the grid.

ChargePoint Holdings Inc., a Silicon Valley-based company that operates roughly 35,000 fast-charging ports in the US, announced this week a new kind of station that will pump power to and from vehicles, as opposed to the vast majority of chargers, which simply take electrons from the grid.

ChargePoint hopes the system will win business from companies that operate large fleets of vehicles by providing the opportunity to sell the electrons sitting in idle cars and trucks.

“We’ll start to be able to go to electric fleets and reduce the cost straight up — no incentives, no tax breaks, no grants — versus a [gas-powered] fleet,” said CEO Rick Wilmer.

Charging networks have long angled to serve vehicle fleets, such as delivery companies, rideshare outfits and construction contractors, that typically have a large and predictable power demand. ChargePoint reckons the next phase of charging competition will be helping those companies monetize their vehicles. When the vehicles are idle and have extra electrons, they can uncork a tiny trickle of revenue, or at least help power nearby buildings. Often, these fleets are idle at the end of a work day, precisely when power demand is peaking on the typical grid.

“You’re ending up with a significantly better mousetrap,” Wilmer said.

At the same time, there’s a push among many companies to generate and store electricity onsite to safeguard against outages, arbitrage time-of-use power prices or get off the grid entirely. Those sites will now be able to tap into vehicles as part of their energy mix, according to Eaton Corp., a power management company that is partnering with ChargePoint on the new charging system. The stations, which ChargePoint has dubbed Express Grid, will also use electricity generated onsite, say from solar panels or wind turbines.

Companies are “adding distributed energy resources such as solar, storage and wind,” said Paul Ryan, vice president and general manager of energy transition at Eaton. “Now you have EVs that are battery assets.”

To be sure, not all utilities can or will accept electricity from anything that isn’t a power plant. Likewise, many of today’s EVs can only accept electrons, not feed them the other way, a process known as bi-directional charging. For example, Ford Motor Co.’s electric pick-up truck, the F-150 Lightning, can discharge its battery, but the company’s electric crossover, the Mustang Mach-E, doesn’t have that capability.

But many analysts expect so-called bidirectional charging will soon be ubiquitous in the EV market. And with more volatile weather and the rise of power-hungry data centers, US utilities are scrambling to get electricity wherever they can find it.

While ChargePoint and Eaton unveiled their new charging system on Thursday, they have yet to take orders. The companies expect to install the first such unit in the second half of next year.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/384a5bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff9%2Fe0%2Fce675a8e1c39f8079090b5a85704%2F1x-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 13:04:20.822360

Trump called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand, aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. Increased use of electric vehicles also has boosted demand, even as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans move to restrict tax credits and other incentives for EV purchases approved under the Biden administration.

Natural gas prices, meanwhile, are rising sharply amid increased exports to Europe and other international customers.

Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to lower Americans’ electric bills by 50%. Democrats have been quick to blame him for the price hikes, citing actions to hamstring clean energy in the sprawling tax-and-spending cut bill approved last month, as well as regulations since then to further restrict wind and solar power.

Advocates say renewables provide the extra energy needed

“Now more than ever, we need more energy, not less, to meet our increased energy demand and power our grid. Instead of increasing our energy supply Donald Trump is taking a sledgehammer to the clean energy sector, killing jobs and projects,” said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

A report from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found the GOP tax law will increase the average family’s energy bill by $130 annually by 2030. “By quickly phasing out technology-neutral clean energy tax credits and adding complex material sourcing requirements,” the tax law will “significantly hamper the development of domestic electricity generation capacity,” the report said.

Renewable advocates were blunter.

“The real scam is blaming solar for fossil fuel price spikes,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in response to Trump’s post.

“Farmers, families, and businesses choose solar to save money, preserve land, and escape high costs of the old, dirty fuels being forced on them by this administration,” the group added.

As technology improves, wind and solar offer some of the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power. More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy, said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, another industry group.

States with the highest share of clean energy production have seen prices decline in the past year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while prices have gone up in states with the least renewable energy use.

“By slowing clean energy deployment, the Trump administration is directly fueling cost increases,” Grumet said

“Blocking cheap, clean energy while doubling down on outdated fossil fuels makes no economic or environmental sense,” added Ted Kelly, director of U.S. clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Partisanship anchors debate over rising energy prices

Energy Secretary Chris Wright blamed rising prices on “momentum” from Biden-era policies that backed renewable power over fossil fuel sources such as oil, coal and natural gas.

“That momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office,” Wright told POLITICO during a visit to Iowa last week. About 60% of the state’s electricity comes from wind.

Not all the pushback comes from Democrats.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican who backs wind power, has placed a hold on three Treasury nominees to ensure wind and solar have “an appropriate glidepath for the orderly phase-out of the tax credits” approved in the 2022 climate law under former President Joe Biden.

Grassley said he was encouraged by new Treasury guidance that limits tax credits for wind and solar projects but does not eliminate them. The guidance “seems to offer a viable path forward for the wind and solar industries to continue to meet increased energy demand,” Grassley said in a statement.",https://nsjonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/A10C.JohnWright.png,N,,2025-08-30 13:04:49.155372

According to Interesting Engineering, the US-based Duane Arnold Energy Center — which was Iowa's only nuclear power plant — shut down operations in 2020, and now NextEra is hoping to have the plant restarted.

Though initial plans after the shutdown were leaning toward solar power, which would have been the most ideal solution from an environmental and cost-per-kilowatt perspective, the company stated they instead plan to ""reaggregate Duane Arnold's original interconnection rights to accelerate the recommissioning of the facility,"" making nuclear energy their priority, per Interesting Engineering.

Nuclear energy is the largest source of ""clean energy"" in the U.S, according to the Department of Energy (defining it as clean energy because it produces almost no carbon pollution, though ""cleaner"" or ""more sustainable"" are probably fairer terms given nuclear's hazardous waste and risks). Nuclear can supply energy on demand — unlike wind and solar, which rely on the weather or time of day, though rapidly improving battery tech solves this — making the move away from dirty fuel sources arguably more seamless, or at least easier for renewable skeptics to grasp.

Pushback on nuclear energy can be broad and stem from historical examples of disasters that are generally less applicable to any modern facility that isn't on a fault line, though security is always a factor. Major concerns pointed to by critics generally come down to safety issues, the production of radioactive waste, as well as the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Though these concerns are fair, they are paired with the benefits, making this energy source complex with clear pros and cons that most scientists agree add up to a better equation than seen with any fossil fuels — especially coal.

High upfront costs are another drawback associated with nuclear energy, though with the closed Duane Arnold Energy Center, the infrastructure is already in place, and the facility has been maintained as part of the process of keeping people safe.

""This process has kept the plant's core infrastructure largely intact,"" Interesting Engineering reported. ""An initial engineering assessment found the reactor to be in good condition, suggesting the entire plant could potentially be restored to operation by late 2028,"" the article continued, likely with upgraded computer hardware for safety, monitoring, and security.

Now, with NextEra Energy's request filed with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, it's just a matter of waiting to see how the plant pans out.

While NextEra is an energy company that operates fossil fuel power plants, it has a reputation for advancing renewable energy and nuclear power initiatives and advancements to lower its overall reliance on dirty fuel sources that would also make the company and country more reliant on drilling and mining that often require foreign sources. CEO John Ketchum recently spoke out about the federal government's ""Unleashing American Energy"" plan's featuring of coal as misguided, saying that ""the train has already left the station on coal.""

As with all grid-scale power plants, the energy goes to all kinds of needs in the area including homes, and if you want to become less reliant on the grid yourself, you can install solar panels. Federal tax credits worth up to around $10,000 expire after Dec. 31 and solar projects must be fully installed by then, which can take around 12 weeks, so it's important to act fast if you want to take advantage before it's too late.

Meanwhile, the President Trump administration is working to reduce the restrictions on air pollution to support government plans for higher fossil fuel production and accelerate new exploration and drilling projects.","Air pollution from oil and gas causes as many as 91,000 premature U.S. deaths a year, according to a study published in Science Advances in August. Meanwhile, during a time when many governments are shifting to green, the U.S. government is doubling down on its fossil fuel production and has recently carried out actions that aim to water down the rigorous air pollution standards enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The link between fossil fuels and premature deaths has been stressed by scientists and doctors for decades, although the connection is often greatly understated by the oil industry. Meanwhile, other safer energy sources, such as nuclear power, get far more attention for their perceived negative threat to health. However, the new study from University College London and the Stockholm Environment Institute, George Washington University, and the University of Colorado Boulder shows just how many tens of thousands of deaths are caused each year by air pollution from the burning of oil and gas, backed with real data.

Air pollution from oil and gas kills around 91,000 Americans prematurely, as well as causes health problems across hundreds of thousands more in the U.S., each year, with a greater impact on poor communities, particularly those of color. There are also over 10,000 pre-term births linked to fine particulate matter from oil and gas, 216,000 annual childhood-onset asthma cases, and 1,610 annual lifetime cancer cases, according to the study. The highest number of air pollution-linked deaths and illnesses was seen in California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.

The paper’s lead author, Karn Vohra, said, “We’ve long known that these communities are exposed to such levels of inequitable exposure as well as health burden… We were able to just put numbers to what that looks like.”

The study is the first to comprehensively assess the impact of oil and gas-related air pollution on human health and premature deaths, analysing all stages of the oil and gas supply chain, from exploration to end use. It assesses data from 2017, which is the most recent year that has complete data available. However, between 2017 and 2023, U.S. oil and gas output increased by 40 percent, meaning the figures in the study likely understate the current situation.

To assess the data, researchers developed a comprehensive inventory of oil and gas air pollution sources, then ran it through a computer model that calculates the complex air chemistry that forms harmful pollutants across the U.S. They analysed the air pollutant concentrations and epidemiological evidence of the relationship between exposure and health risk, using census and health data, to determine various adverse health outcomes and racial-ethnic disparities. The analysis shows that the final end-use stage overwhelmingly contributes the biggest health burden, contributing to 96 percent of the total incidents linked to the oil and gas industry.

The research found that Indigenous and Hispanic populations were most affected by the exploration, extraction, transportation, and storage stages of oil and gas production, while Black and Asian populations were overwhelmingly more affected by emissions from the processing, refining, manufacturing, distribution, and usage stages. This is linked to the geographical concentrations of specific demographics in certain areas of the United States.

The researchers also looked at the spillover effects on neighbouring countries and found that air pollution linked to the U.S. oil and gas sector causes 1,170 premature deaths in southern Canada and 440 early deaths a year in northern Mexico.

Meanwhile, the President Trump administration is working to reduce the restrictions on air pollution to support government plans for higher fossil fuel production and accelerate new exploration and drilling projects. In March, U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to undertake 31 historic actions in the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history. Some of these actions included the reconsideration of: regulations on power plants, regulations throttling the oil and gas industry, mercury and air toxics standards and the mandatory greenhouse gas reporting programme.

He said at the time, “Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen. We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more.”

A change in EPA standards could lead thousands of cities across the U.S. to become even more polluted at a time when most developed countries around the world are striving to reduce emissions, improve environmental protections, and undergo a green transition. Timothy Donaghy, the research director for the environmental group Greenpeace USA, stressed, “Given the reckless deregulation being pushed by Trump’s EPA and the president’s call to ‘drill, baby, drill’, this new study should be a flashing red warning light for the nation.”

A settlement from a major lawsuit is providing the funds for an ambitious infrastructure project to add dozens of charging stations for electric vehicles in Indiana.

As Electrek reported, Indiana is set to spend $3.3 million to add 36 charging stations across the Hoosier State. The money for the project comes from the Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust, which was created to manage the proceeds of the $2.9 billion settlement following the automaker's Clean Air Act violations.

The plans include 18 DC chargers, among the fastest available, and another 18 Level 2 chargers. The former will be placed along the state's Alternative Fuel Corridors, which means that drivers will have unlimited access at travel stations, restaurants, and shopping areas along Indiana's highways. The projects are slated to be completed by 2026.

The new chargers will help plug gaps in the state's charging infrastructure and address one of the key stumbling blocks to wider electric vehicle adoption.

""Range anxiety,"" the concern that a car will run out of charge before reaching its destination, is a commonly cited reason for some Americans' hesitation to go electric. The increased presence of charging infrastructure will go a long way to allaying those fears.

Electric vehicles are cheaper to run and much better for the environment than standard gas-powered cars. While there are environmental issues regarding mineral extraction to manufacture batteries, EVs pay off their carbon debt after around 11,000 miles, per Carbon Brief.

Even with public chargers, it's much cheaper to fill a battery than a gas tank. But charging at home through solar panels is by far the cheapest and cleanest way to power an EV. With EnergySage's tools, homeowners can compare prices and save up to $10,000 on domestic solar panel installation.

The article's comments expressed excitement at the possibilities the scheme will unlock.

One user said, ""I drive my EV through Indiana several times a year. The more charging options, the better! It's great to hear some good news now and then!""

Another added, ""Great for Indiana. Let's keep building them and putting fast chargers at nearly every corner and every freeway exit.""

The proposal aims to allow 20–25% FDI through the automatic route in non-sensitive areas such as manufacturing, renewable energy, and auto components.

Currently, under Press Note 3 (2020), investments from countries sharing land borders with India, particularly China, require prior government approval.

This rule was introduced after the COVID-19 outbreak and escalating border tensions, to prevent opportunistic acquisitions of Indian firms.

Officials now suggest a more balanced approach. While strategic sectors like defence, telecom, energy exploration, and sensitive installations will remain restricted, others could be opened up to streamline investments, create jobs, and strengthen domestic supply chains.

Any concerns raised about specific investments will still be examined individually to safeguard national interests.

This development comes at a time when diplomatic engagement between India and China is slowly resuming. Recent ministerial visits, talks on border disputes, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in China signal efforts to stabilise ties.

The government’s policy think tank, NITI Aayog, has also recommended easing restrictions by allowing up to 24% Chinese FDI without prior clearance, a move aimed at reviving stalled projects such as BYD’s $1 billion electric vehicle plan.

Industry observers note that such reforms could encourage investment flow, reduce project delays, and support India’s manufacturing ambitions.

If approved, this would mark India’s first step towards easing FDI restrictions on Chinese companies since 2020, reflecting a cautious balance between security concerns and economic growth.",https://knnindia.co.in/uploads/newsfiles/FDI-IND-CHINA-30-8-2025.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 13:04:01.948078

Greg Markannen (R-Hancock), the Republican budget allocates $50 million to Wakefield Township in Gogebic County to invest into road upgrades, fortification of the electrical grid and improvements to telecommunication services across the region.
Leading the charge is Protect the Porkies, a grassroots group led by Tom Grotewohl, a resident of Wakefield Township.
In a statement released Thursday, Grotewohl denounced the inclusion of funding for the mine within the House Republican’s budget proposal.
Chief among environmental advocates’ concerns is the location of the mine’s tailings basin, which would store mining waste on sloping topography leading into Lake Superior.
Should the dam collapse, several toxins including arsenic, cadmium, selenium, lead and mercury would be released into the waterway.","Following the passage of the Michigan House of Representatives’ budget proposal for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, opponents of a controversial mining project are slamming the plan for a $50 million allocation aimed at preparing local communities for the project.

Put forth in a request from Rep. Greg Markannen (R-Hancock), the Republican budget allocates $50 million to Wakefield Township in Gogebic County to invest into road upgrades, fortification of the electrical grid and improvements to telecommunication services across the region.

“Site readiness, or lack thereof, is commonly cited as a factor in investment decisions by businesses and venture funds considering Michigan-based opportunities,” Markannen said in his request for legislative spending in May.

He noted that “an opportunity before the Township offers a generational opportunity to create hundreds of good-paying jobs to support local families and bolster the national supply chain and defense capabilities,” a reference to Highland Copper’s Copperwood Mine, but noted site investment is needed to encourage investment in the area.

While the state’s Strategic Fund Board approved $50 million for the mining project last year, the funding was held up in the Michigan Senate, when the Appropriations Committee adjourned for the year without voting on the funding.

While some state and community officials have welcomed the project, the mine has received push back from multiple environmental groups who are raising concerns about the underground mine and its proximity to the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, the North Country Trail, and Lake Superior.

Leading the charge is Protect the Porkies, a grassroots group led by Tom Grotewohl, a resident of Wakefield Township.

In a statement released Thursday, Grotewohl denounced the inclusion of funding for the mine within the House Republican’s budget proposal.

“Make no mistake, this funding request is identical in purpose to the $50 million Michigan Strategic Fund-approved SOAR grant twice halted last year due to pushback from around the state and nation,” Grotehwol said. “Considering Speaker Matt Hall’s [(R-Richland Township)] commitment to transparency, it’s surprising that he and his colleagues would include a corporate welfare handout thinly veiled as a community infrastructure grant to Wakefield Township.”

Earlier this summer, Highland Copper, the Canadian company developing the mine, pointed to Wakefield Township’s request for legislative funding as an alternative route in receiving infrastructure funding for the project.

“If one path is successful, the other will no longer be required,” the company said in a July 2 news release.

However, Jane Fitkin, director of Citizens for a Safe & Clean Lake Superior, argued that if the project is to move forward, Highland Copper should be the one footing the bill – not Michigan taxpayers.

Chief among environmental advocates’ concerns is the location of the mine’s tailings basin, which would store mining waste on sloping topography leading into Lake Superior. Should the dam collapse, several toxins including arsenic, cadmium, selenium, lead and mercury would be released into the waterway.

This contamination would infringe on the treaty rights of several Native American tribes to hunt, fish and gather within the territory ceded in the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe.

In a statement, Highland Copper called the project a “once-in-a-generation project” saying the grant would be used to fund infrastructure that’s needed to bring to life projects like the Copperwood Mine and more.

Wakefield Township Supervisor Mandy Lake applauded the Legislature for “prioritizing the Western Upper Peninsula and demonstrating its commitment to giving our community a future.”

“The infrastructure funded through this grant will have a tremendous positive impact on our whole region, and while it will support a great opportunity like Copperwood, it will also support our logging industry, and better our position to attract more business opportunities as well,” Lake told the Advance in an email.

Marty Fittante, CEO of Invest UP, a regional economic organization based in the Upper Peninsula, similarly cheered the inclusion of funding within the House’s budget proposal, comparing the effort to the Eagle Mine in Marquette County – which has drawn similar concerns from the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community alongside environmental advocates.

According to its website, the mine employs roughly 400 people with a 75% local hire commitment.

“We know firsthand from the success of Eagle Mine and its regulation under Michigan’s stringent mining standards, environmental stewardship and economic opportunity can be complementary to one another,” Fittante said. “This infrastructure funding will pave the way not just for the Copperwood Mine, a project that will create good paying jobs in a community that desperately needs them, but will also support the forest products industry which is also a critical opportunity for the region.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/michigan-air-use-permit-permit-to-install-application-for-copperwood-resources-inc1756562634.png?h=ccd5c36a&itok=baesAUsw,N,,2025-08-30 12:06:16.198872

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by two to 536 in the week to August 29, the lowest since August 2021.

Baker Hughes said this week’s decline puts the total rig count down 47 rigs, or 8.1%, below the total this time last year.

Baker Hughes said oil rigs rose by one to 412 this week, while gas rigs fell by three to 119.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third year in a row in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 to around 13.4 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, the EIA projected a 65% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020.

The EIA projected gas output would rise to 106.4 billion cubic feet per day in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax.
It does not include a road usage charge.
In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections.
Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

However, the special session got off to a rocky start: The state Senate met as scheduled at 9 a.m., but the state House failed to reach the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, leaving the session in limbo as of late Friday afternoon.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are at risk, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon's transportation woes

Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle's telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state's decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting restrictions on how the transportation department can spend money on maintenance operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state's total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii's program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon's transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon's voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they're more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don't realize that ""both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars.

The company is dealing with external factors hurting business, including tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, a decline in global sales, increasing competition in China amid a brutal price war, mounting lawsuits, a talent exodus, and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political adventures. Despite all those negative developments, Tesla's stock has surged 54% higher over the past 12 months. And one recent move could help move more vehicles, which is exactly what the company needs in the near term.

Worrisome pricing?

Political backlash has put pressure on Tesla's used-car pricing. So much pressure, in fact, that even though Tesla is often considered a premium brand, its used vehicles are now selling almost as cheaply as the average used car -- and the latter's price is moving higher, while Tesla's prices continue to move lower. The problem started last year when the broader used car market in the U.S. started seeing values drop, but the broader market began recovering in the spring, and Tesla values continued to drop.

What's Tesla to do?

While consumer backlash is likely to eventually fade, Tesla's primary problem in the near term is to reverse its sales decline. Tesla recently started offering leases of certified preowned cars, which is fairly rare in the automotive industry. It's also offering $0 down as it tries to load as many deliveries into the third quarter as possible before the federal $7,500 tax credit on new electric vehicles (EVs) and the $4,000 credit for used EVs expire at the end of September.

The industry is banking on demand being pulled into the third quarter, and Tesla is aiming to capture as many sales as possible with the new leasing strategy. Telsa is doing this for the first time, and these certified preowned vehicles, mostly Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, are being offered for as little as $215 per month with $0 down for a 24-month lease and 10,000 miles per year. Tesla is also offering a 12-month lease and up to 15,000 miles annually, with $0 down but an acquisition fee of nearly $700.

Whether you're a fan of Musk or not, or Tesla or EVs in general, this is a compelling deal and the cheapest way to get into a Tesla at the moment. The problem is that used Teslas have been piling up, as the brand took a hit this year, and this does appear a little desperate.

Tesla is also trying a new strategy with its Cybertruck that has left investors and analysts unimpressed with its deliveries. Tesla raised the price of the high-end version of the Cybertruck to $114,990, up from $99,990, in the U.S., per listings on its website. The Cybertruck now comes with what Tesla calls a ""Luxe Package"" including Full-Self Driving (FSD), four-year wheel and tire protection, and free supercharging access. Unfortunately, pricing changes on a single trim, even a high-end and more profitable trim package, aren't likely to move the needle for either deliveries or financials.

The National Association of Forest Service Retirees, for example, submitted comments arguing that the proposal lacks detail and could compromise regional functions.","The U.S. Department of Agriculture is giving the public just three weeks to weigh in on a key step of its attempt to scrap the Roadless Rule, which protects almost 59 million acres of forest land from road construction and timber harvesting.

The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) published a notice Friday seeking comment on its intention to develop an environmental impact statement for the proposed rescission of the 2001 rule. The comment period will run until Sept. 19.

The public had a full month to comment when the rule was created. The USFS received more than 1.6 million comments on the rule, the most it has ever received.

Experts caution that the truncated comment period limits the opportunity for public comment, a key part of rulemaking and a hallmark of the original rule.

Sam Evans, an attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the three-week comment period—only 14 business days from official publication—is an “unusual choice,” given the norm of 30-day comment periods. This also differs, he said, from when the Bush administration proposed repealing the rule in 2005. At that time, the administration offered a two-month comment period, which it extended an additional two months following a public request to do so.

Evans said that a “lengthy and intensive public process,” including over 600 hearings across the country and a flood of supportive comments, was crucial in the development of a strong rule more than two decades ago.

“Nothing like that can happen with the staff capacity and the timeline that the [USFS] is talking about here,” he said. “I think that just goes to show that the Forest Service here is not interested in developing public buy-in or reflecting the interests of the communities that it is supposedly serving.”

“Regulations do not specify the length of public comments. For the notice of intent to development an environmental impact statement, the 21 days was determined to be efficient to notify the public and seek comment. The comment period for the draft environmental impact statement and the proposed rule will be longer,” the USDA press office wrote in response to Inside Climate News’ questions about the shorter comment period.

“The rationale for repealing the Roadless Rule, I find very puzzling and a bit of a ruse for perhaps some other agenda,” said Mike Dombeck, who served as the chief of the agency from 1997 to 2001 and helped develop the rule. “The Forest Service has been a conservation leader over the decades. We need to make sure we continue to strengthen that image and that capability, because we need it more now than ever.”

Implemented at the end of the Clinton administration, the rule prohibits road construction, road reconstruction and timber harvesting on a wide swath of USFS land, effectively protecting a variety of places in states from Alaska to Vermont as remote wilderness areas.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced at a Western Governors’ Association conference in June that USFS, which falls under her agency, planned to rescind it. Like many other conservation professionals, Dombeck said that Rollins’ argument—that repealing the rule would open up forests for timber production—doesn’t have a logical basis.

“As I recall from my involvement in developing the Roadless Rule, only about 8 percent of [forest in] the roadless areas is productive timber base to begin with,” he said. “The assumption that there’s a lot of wood [with economic value in] roadless areas is just simply not true.”

Rulemaking is meant to be a slow, deliberate process, and so too is deregulation. But the Trump administration seems to have a faster outcome in mind, Evans said.

“We’ve heard rumors that the Forest Service … expects to finalize the rule next year,” said Evans, leader of the Southern Environmental Law Center’s National Forests and Parks Program. “Obviously, we don’t think that there is a solid case for repeal of the Roadless Rule. We think that the rule has had tremendous benefits.”

Grassroots organizations across the country got the word out to the public about the initial rule during its development, helping strengthen it. Some groups are now echoing earlier efforts of grassroots organizations in their attempts to fight a repeal.

“Our real interest now is making sure that folks understand what the policy measures are that ensure that public lands actually remain the way that people think of them,” said Alex Craven, a senior campaign representative at the Sierra Club focusing on forest conservation.

The announcement comes as Rollins is proposing a plan to reorganize the Forest Service, including closing nine regional offices over the next year. In the proposal, dated July 24, the agriculture secretary argued that the reorganization would improve “effectiveness and accountability.”

However, experts are cautioning that this could greatly weaken the Forest Service as a whole. The National Association of Forest Service Retirees, for example, submitted comments arguing that the proposal lacks detail and could compromise regional functions. The group urged the USFS to reassess the plan.

“It certainly seems like a disorganized approach to reducing the workforce. If it accomplished anything, it created a lot of chaos, both within the agency and among the partners that depend upon the Forest Service,” Dombeck said.

Craven said that most of the USFS regional offices have been located west of the Rocky Mountains. With the reorganization, “it’s looking like maybe it will be flipped,” he said, despite the fact that wildfire risk is higher in Western states.

Closing regional offices could mean losing staff with knowledge of wildfire mitigation and what to do when invasive bug species arrive in their respective regions, weakening the agency’s ability to respond to disasters.

“Losing the capacity and the research stations is kind of horrifying to me,” Evans said.

The reorganization could also lose the agency irreplaceable institutional knowledge and make it difficult to meet statutory requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), such as producing environmental impact statements.

“Those are really important steps, and with the reorganization, with the drain in capacity that the agency has right now, it’s very hard for you to imagine them doing a good job of that,” Evans said. “Let’s say that they push this through with a truncated NEPA analysis or a really skeletal consultation process. They’re going to be stuck with the loose ends of that forever. … Every project that they do in the future is going to be vulnerable.”

Even with the proposed NEPA changes that the Trump administration announced in July, Evans said that the USFS will still have to follow statutory requirements, which have remained the same. The “ultimate responsibility” of the USFS to consider environmental impacts, he said, still stands.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1615373976-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:05:51.243262

In response to Sen. John Hoeven’s commentary in the Aug. 23 edition of the Herald, I believe North Dakota should be “cracking the code” on geothermal energy as part of a serious energy strategy.

Our state has long relied on coal and natural gas, but the economics are shifting in ways that cannot be ignored. The Inflation Reduction Act’s Investment and Production Tax Credits support renewable energy and carbon capture development, helping maintain a more competitive energy market. While these incentives don’t directly control fossil fuel prices, they enable lower-cost clean energy alternatives that can ease upward pressure on electricity costs. Costs could rise further as carbon capture systems and CO2 pipelines are added to the grid, with 45Q tax credits transferring part of the expense to taxpayers. This is not a formula for affordable or sustainable energy and underscores the need for diverse, domestic resources.

Natural gas prices are increasingly influenced by global factors. As U.S. companies expand liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity, domestic prices become more connected to international demand. The Energy Information Administration projects Henry Hub prices rising gradually from about $3.60 per MMBtu in 2025 to roughly $4.30 per MMBtu in 2026. Such increases can directly affect electricity costs for families and businesses and can challenge the competitiveness of energy-intensive industries, like data centers, where Europe and China are already aligning energy policy with strategic industrial goals.

Geothermal energy offers an alternative path. It is domestic, dispatchable, and immune to international commodity swings. Once developed, geothermal plants can provide decades of reliable, affordable electricity without hidden taxpayer liabilities embedded in fossil fuels. North Dakota’s recent legislation supporting geothermal resource studies was a valuable first step, but other states are moving faster. By investing in geothermal now, North Dakota can grow high-skilled energy jobs, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and ensure long-term energy independence.

If North Dakota intends to remain competitive in energy innovation, workforce development, and consumer affordability, we cannot afford to fall behind. The time to act is now. Geothermal should not be a side project; it should be a cornerstone of our energy future.

Last week, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club and Environmental Integrity Project filed a lawsuit against DEQ for granting Venture Global a Clean Air Act permit for the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG facility, according to a joint news release from the organizations.
""We fear that CP2 LNG will be more of the same — more air pollution that is making us sick.
When The Advocate reached out to Venture Global, the company did not respond.
""The other problem is that it, not just for the people who are going to be directly breathing it, will contribute to the entire area having air quality violations.","Three environmental groups have joined forces to file a lawsuit against the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regarding a permit for a new liquefied natural gas facility in Cameron Parish.

Last week, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club and Environmental Integrity Project filed a lawsuit against DEQ for granting Venture Global a Clean Air Act permit for the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG facility, according to a joint news release from the organizations.

“Venture Global has a long history of noncompliance with regards to its Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal,” Cameron Parish resident and Sierra Club member John Allaire said in the release. “This company has been a bad neighbor and continually pollutes the air we breathe, while generating billions of dollars in profits.

""We fear that CP2 LNG will be more of the same — more air pollution that is making us sick. It is time for LDEQ to do its job and protect people, not corporate profits.”

DEQ Communications Director Greg Langley told The Advocate the agency does not comment on pending litigation. When The Advocate reached out to Venture Global, the company did not respond.

David Bookbinder, director of Law and Policy for Environmental Integrity Project, said the complaint is centered around the belief that CP2 will emit more pollution than DEQ assumed and will have air quality violations, as well as the fact that some of the permit limits are more lenient than justified for different pollutants.

""We're dealing with a facility that's going to be emitting many, many, many tons of pollutants and … the local impact on people who are directly breathing the air is going to be bad,"" Bookbinder said. ""The other problem is that it, not just for the people who are going to be directly breathing it, will contribute to the entire area having air quality violations. It mucks up people's air.""

The facility, which will be one of the largest LNG plants in the nation, would export 20 million metric tons of LNG per year, according to the release. The estimated life cycle greenhouse gas from the methane gas would be more than the annual emissions of 47 million gas-powered cars, the release states.

Construction started on CP2 this summer, and the facility is expected to begin LNG production in 2027.

Allaire, a former oil industry worker, said he and the organizations are upset that the state would grant CP2 a Clean Air Act permit based on the compliance history of Venture Global at Calcasieu Pass, which began operating in 2022.

During its first calendar year of operation, the Calcasieu Pass LNG facility had at least 139 incidents where it exceeded the hourly emission limits of its air permits, The Advocate previously reported. In addition, DEQ granted the facility an increase in its allowed emissions in 2023.

Bookbinder said the next steps for the lawsuit will be the court reaching out within a couple of weeks to provide a schedule to submit all the preliminary paperwork, and about two months later it will release a schedule for briefing.

From there, there will be arguments and then a decision, ""hopefully by the end of 2026,"" Bookbinder said.

Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said that overall the permit is flawed and that is what they would like to see fixed.

""The Department of Environmental Quality does not have a realistic assessment of this facility that they're letting them get away with putting whatever they want on paper and not really tending to the Clean Air Act,"" Rolfes said. ""Our goal would be to get a real serious permit on this facility. I do believe that if you took an honest look at the emissions and at the area and the burden it's already bearing, that they could never get a permit because the pollution there is already too intense.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/67/7675be2a-a890-4999-b5e2-b67f8c8d9cf3/68b1effe4e682.image.png?crop=960%2C504%2C0%2C108,N,,2025-08-30 11:01:46.798981

ISA ENERGIA BRASIL is a leading company in Brazil's power transmission sector. It has been in the country for over 25 years and is a pioneer in developing initiatives that positively impact society and the environment. As part of ISA, a multinational company with over 57 years of experience, ISA ENERGIA BRASIL operates in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Central America. With over 49,000 kilometers of circuits and 113,365 MVA of transformation capacity, and a reliability and availability index of over 99%, ISA's goal is to ensure a resilient, secure, clean, and fair energy transition.

Demonstrating its commitment to modernizing the power grid, ISA ENERGIA BRASIL delivered a significant project in 2023: the country's first digital 4.0 substation. Designed to demonstrate and test cutting-edge IEC 61850 technologies, the project notably highlights Hitachi Energy's contribution to seamlessly integrating advanced Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with rigorous cybersecurity protocols, reinforcing the reliability and availability of the power grids. This initiative is the result of an R&D project by the Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL) and aims to discover new approaches for updating the current grid infrastructure while generating essential insights for future developments in new (greenfield) substations.

Conventional substations require complex infrastructure, such as kilometers of copper cables, and present increasing challenges in security, maintenance, and reliability—especially in a country with the vast size and diverse climates of Brazil. To address this challenge, ISA ENERGIA BRASIL, in partnership with Hitachi Energy, is leading a transformation movement with the implementation of Brazil's first Digital 4.0 Substation in Jaguariúna (SP).

The Jaguariúna Substation project integrates sensing, smart monitoring, IoT (Internet of Things), data exchange via wireless industrial networks, and a layered cybersecurity architecture. These technologies not only improve operational efficiency but also serve as a prototype for future deployments across ISA's extensive network in Latin America.

One of the key differentiators is the Centralized Control and Protection (CPC), which allows for protecting and controlling various transmission functions from a single digital platform. This solution raises the standards for resilience, security, and operational redundancy by consolidating distributed intelligence into a central decision-making core.

This grid modernization project is a testament to ISA ENERGIA BRASIL's efforts to lay the foundation for a more resilient, sustainable, and technologically advanced electrical system. In addition to the improvements in operational efficiency, environmental impact, and grid security achieved through innovative solutions in Jaguariúna, this project aligns with Brazil's broader leadership in energy transition initiatives, such as battery energy storage and hydrogen projects. The country is therefore well-positioned to play a significant role in Latin America's energy future.

Cry me a river. Wait, make that two rivers. On Friday, August 29, the Trump administration yanked another rug out from under the US offshore wind industry, sending thousands of construction jobs spinning into the black hole of malevolent incompetence that passes for the US government these days. How many of those jobs were held by Trump voters remains to be counted, but … yeah, cry me a river.

Trump Kills More Offshore Wind Jobs … Shocker!

USA Today took stock of the situation on August 27, shortly after Trump’s Interior Secretary, Doug Burgum, single-handedly shut down the Revolution Wind offshore project in New England. The work was 80% complete but hundreds of workers were still busy tying up the loose ends when they were all sent home by Secretary Burgum.

“A lot of building trades workers, a lot of union workers, voted for Donald Trump and his team. But they didn’t vote to have union jobs shut down,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley told USA Today. “It shouldn’t work like this.”

Actually, it does work like this, and they did vote to have their jobs shut down. Trump’s antipathy to wind turbines is a well-known fact that he has proclaimed often, and loudly, ever since first campaigning for President in 2016. That was nine years ago. That makes nine years of promising to kill the US wind industry, onshore and off, right on up to and including the campaign year of 2024.

Last year, Trump also promised that the US would have “only two sexes” if he won the office again. Apparently some voters decided that having two sexes, and only two sexes, was more important than, you know, making a living.

“For our folks, this is work, this is make or break for them,” Crowley also told USA Today. “When you get a chance to work on a project that’s going to be around for months at a time, that provides you and your family such a sense of stability. And to have this happen? I’ve never seen anything like this before.”

Hey Guys, Brace Yourself For Another Round Of Offshore Wind Layoffs

In the weeks following Election Day 2024, Associated Press was among those noting that support for Democratic candidates continues to run high among unionized workers and others holding construction jobs, so it’s not clear that Crowley’s observation is a by-the-numbers reflection of the Trump votes cast by people who have a personal interest in working for a living.

Still, AP was also among those emphasizing that the trend has been shifting towards Republican candidates in general, and Trump in particular. “But with Trump’s populist appeal, his working-class base saw a decent share of union rank-and-file voting for Republicans this year,” AP reported on November 23 last year.

“Working-class voters helped Republicans make steady election gains this year and expanded a coalition that increasingly includes rank-and-file union members,” AP added.

If that is indeed the case, then the Rhode Island wind workers who voted for Trump will have plenty of company as they cool their heels around the kitchen table. Revolution Wind is just one among several parts of the US offshore wind industry that were already in motion when Trump took office with intent to kill.

That brings us to Friday, August 29, the day when Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy helped to ensure that the bleeding of union jobs continues. Duffy issued an order clawing back $679 million in federal funds that had been allocated for 12 portside improvement projects that were to have supported the offshore wind industry, funded through his agency’s Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects program and the Port Infrastructure Development Program.

So, there go more jobs. They are probably not coming back. The offshore wind industry, on the other hand, will be just fine. The technology is not going anywhere, and there are plenty of opportunities to create new jobs building offshore wind farms in other countries.

Offshore Wind Or Not, These Jobs Are Toast

The reaction to Friday’s announcement was swift, not that it matters. The Republican majority in Congress has gleefully permitted the President to overr-reach his Constitutional authority on a daily basis ever since January 20. Why should August 29 be any different.

Here’s a representative sample from Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts:

“In unlawfully and senselessly cutting hundreds of millions in federal funding to offshore wind projects, Trump just signed a death warrant for thousands of union jobs nationwide and guaranteed that families’ energy bills will continue to skyrocket.”

Liz Burdock, president of the offshore wind trade organization Oceantic Network, also pointed out that the impact of the August 29 order will spread far beyond the offshore wind industry. “Offshore wind port development upgrades facilities and capabilities that serve multiple industries,” she said, noting that the offshore wind industry has brought new jobs to seaports by reviving underused and idled facilities, some of which had lain fallow for decades.

That’s news to Transportation Secretary Duffy and his gang of taxpayer-paid office workers. “Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Duffy said in a press statement.

“Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little,” he said, adding insult to injury.

Lie Down With Dogs, Wake Up With Fleas

Not to worry! Duffy will use the money to make more jobs at US seaports. No harm, no foul amirite? “Where possible, funding will be used to invest in real infrastructure, restoring American maritime dominance,” Duffy’s office declared.

That remains to be seen. Meanwhile, as may be expected the axe fell almost entirely on states headed up by Democratic governors. Here’s the list posted by Senator Markey, with the states added in:

Withdrawn:

[Maryland} Sparrows Point Steel Marshalling Port Project (PIDP; $47,392,500)

[Connecticut] Bridgeport Port Authority Operations and Maintenance Wind Port Project (PIDP;$10,530,000)

[New Jersey] Wind Port at Paulsboro (PIDP; $20,494,025)

[North Carolina] Radio Island Rail Improvements in Support of Offshore Wind (PIDP; $1,679,604)

[Virginia] PMT Offshore Wind Development (PIDP; $20,000,000)

What do you bet New York Governor Kathy Hochul is on the phone with Trump right now, working to get that $11 million+ project back in motion? Earlier this year, Hochul negotiated a restart of the Empire Wind offshore project, with gas pipeline projects in her state as bargaining chips. Perhaps she has another card to play.

Let’s see what Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has to say about this, too. Youngkin is the only Republican governor on Duffy’s hit list, and he must be wondering what he did wrong. After all, Youngkin has affirmed his support for the Trump agenda all throughout this year.

On the other hand, Youngkin is also the rare, if not the only, Republican governor in the US to champion an offshore wind project. With Youngkin’s support, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is well underway, safe from the knives of the Trump administration — for now, at least.

As of this writing, Youngkin has yet to issue a public response to the loss of more than $60 million in federal funding. Maybe he never will. Why should he? After all, Youngkin is term-limited, and the smart money says a Democratic governor will inherit the whole mess after Election Day in November.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sean-duffy-us-dot.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 14:06:57.095591

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me!

For more than forty years, protectionist barriers have made it difficult for European cars to be sold in the U.S.—and vice versa.

These obstacles mainly come down to differing crash test and emissions standards, which make it costly for automakers to sell a car designed for one market in the other—unless it was engineered for both from the start. This week, however, we learned that a potential trade deal being discussed between the U.S. government and the European Union could allow vehicles designed for one market to be imported and registered in the other without additional testing. The agreement is still vague, and it’s unclear how EU member nations would approve it given the significant differences in U.S. crash and emissions regulations. Stay tuned—I’m working on a video next week that will break it all down.

New sales data for EVs is in for Europe, showing a growing market share and changing brand-loyalty among EV buyers.

According to the ACEA—that’s the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association—just over one million new electric vehicles were registered across Europe in the first seven months of the year, representing a fifteen point six percent market share. That’s up from a twelve point one percent market share in the same period last year. The other key point from the July figures is the dramatic shift in attitudes toward Tesla across Europe. While EV sales overall outpaced ICE sales, and many brands saw double-digit EV growth, Tesla sales are down thirty-seven percent year to date, with BYD overtaking it with two hundred and twenty-five percent growth year over year.

Which brings us to the next story: the ACEA is now lobbying European lawmakers to loosen emissions targets across the region.

Its current president, Olla Källenius (Shell-en-ius), joined Schaeffler Powertrain & Chassis CEO Matthias Zink in a letter urging the EU to ease—or even drop—emissions targets and ICE bans. Calling the 2030 and 2035 CO₂ goals “no longer feasible,” they warned the European auto industry could face economic ruin if forced to comply. While the ACEA represents Europe’s auto sector as a whole, not all manufacturers back this push. Kia’s top European executive recently said the company does not support rolling back zero-emissions requirements, warning such a U-turn would be costly. Kia has heavily invested in European production of its EV4 and is urging the EU to keep the 2035 ICE ban in place.

From the U.S. President to tin-foil hat wearing trolls, we often find ourselves fighting off the assertion that EVs are responsible for more emissions than fossil fueled vehicles. Luckily that claim is super-easy and barely an inconvenience to debunk, with plenty of scientific research to back up that debunking.

Now we’ve got a new study from the University of Michigan to help. Even when accounting for manufacturing and electricity generation, it showed a battery electric vehicle with a three-hundred-mile range produces seventy-one to seventy-three percent fewer lifetime emissions than a comparable internal combustion engine vehicle. Compact electric vehicles have the smallest lifetime emissions overall, but the largest absolute reductions occur when large vehicles, such as pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, are converted to electric power. The study also includes a calculator that allows users to estimate the lifetime emissions of a vehicle on a county-by-county basis within the United States. Unfortunately, the calculator does not include data for other countries or regions.

For a long time, Chinese automakers faced allegations that the government unfairly subsidized domestic production to let them undercut overseas competitors.

Now, the Chinese government has published data showing where its subsidies went and which companies benefited. Between twenty sixteen and twenty twenty two, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology disbursed one point six five billion yuan to the EV industry. Beijing Electric Vehicle Co received the largest share, five hundred and fifty-six million yuan, while BYD got just fifteen point seven four million yuan and Tesla about three point five nine million yuan. The subsidy program initially focused on state-owned companies but shifted around five years ago. BYD subsidiaries received a combined seventy-three point four seven million yuan, while Tesla subsidiaries received thirty point one five million yuan. Leapmotor, the only startup to receive aid so far, got two point seven six million yuan. So yes, the Chinese government did subsidize its EV revolution—just not necessarily in the way many assumed.

Italian energy company EnelX—which many of you might remember as the company that acquired charging station manufacturer eMotorWerks—has been fined two point three million euros in Italy for abusing its market position.

If you haven’t watched our videos on the JuiceBoxes, here’s the context: the original, excellent, network-connected smart charging stations designed by eMotorWerks were ultimately neutered and then completely dropped by EnelX last year, following several years of poor support after the merger. This left hundreds of thousands of customers with non- or partially-functioning units. Italy’s anti-trust authority launched an investigation into EnelX and its subsidiaries and found it engaged in “margin-squeezing practices” in the fast-charging business aimed at blocking competitors from the market. EnelX acknowledged the findings but rejected the conclusions, stating it intends to appeal the decision and the fine. I don’t really buy the whole “karmic justice” thing, but I—and I’m sure many other JuiceBox owners—have little sympathy for this brand.

While Mercedes-Benz’s CEO has been vocal against a rapid all-electric future, the brand’s engineering team just celebrated a major milestone with its concept AMG GT XX EV.

Earlier this week, the concept set twenty-five new distance records in a single run at the Nardo test track. Unlike many recent range records, it averaged three hundred kilometers per hour (about one hundred and eighty-six miles per hour), covering forty thousand seventy-five kilometers (about twenty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-five miles) in seven days, thirteen hours, twenty-four minutes, and seven seconds. That’s the longest distance at these speeds for an EV—roughly equivalent to traveling around the world in less than eight days. The AMG GT XX is Mercedes-Benz’s first all-electric AMG concept and features axial flux motors, direct-cooled batteries, and super-fast charging, technologies planned for production vehicles on the AMG EA platform.

We’re off to Oregon next, where Democratic Governor Tina Kotek is proposing a controversial bill that could affect EV appeal and uptake at a time where EVs are already under attack by the Federal government.

Critics have long argued that EVs don’t pay enough toward road maintenance since they don’t use gasoline and avoid gas taxes. Oregon—and many other states—has traditionally charged EV owners higher bi-annual registration fees to compensate. Now, Kotek wants the state to require EV owners to join OReGo, a pay-as-you-drive program that tracks vehicle use and bills participants accordingly. OReGo has that been around for ten years but currently has just eight hundred fifty participants, showing it isn’t very popular. For low-mileage drivers, the program could be cheaper, but with over one hundred and seventeen thousand plug-in vehicles in Oregon, costs may rise significantly. As an example, someone driving twenty thousand miles a year could face an annual bill of around four hundred dollars. While everyone should contribute to road upkeep, this feels disproportionately high for EV owners.

We know that the current U.S. Government is no fan of renewable energy – or rather, the current White House – and those placed into government roles by the occupant of said white house.

But new data from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shows that through May, the amount of new solar and wind generation projects added to the U.S. grid made up ninety-one percent of all new generating capacity. More than one thousand, five hundred and fifteen megawatts of solar panels were added to the grid in May (and that only includes large-scale grid-tied solar, not residential solar), with the agency forecasting that solar will become the number one two source of U.S. generating capacity in the next three years. However, it’s also worth noting that this particular report from FERC is more than a month behind schedule – and since the President’s actions to dismiss the expansion of renewable energy generation, the agency seems to be undergoing some not-great changes internally…

Finally, for this segment, following last week’s news that the White House wanted to halt new wind and solar projects, the Department of the Interior has forced the U.S.’s first multi-state offshore wind farm to stop construction—a wind farm that’s been fully permitted for a long time and is eighty percent complete.

Revolution Wind, a seven hundred and four megawatt farm off the northeastern coast, was supposed to power three hundred and fifty thousand homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut. Instead, it’s frozen over a stop-work order supposedly needed for national security. Developed by Ørsted and BlackRock Global Infrastructure, the regional grid operator, ISO New England—which manages electricity across six states—warns that this halt threatens grid reliability. Seriously, a fully approved, mostly built project is now stuck because of questionable claims about national security that nobody has actually substantiated.

And yes, some cabinet members, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have been making absurd claims about turbines harming whales, so don’t expect this to be resolved anytime soon. The oil industry—and President “I can’t apply concealer”—want nothing more than to see the world burn while they sit on piles of money that would make Scrooge McDuck blush and Smaug rage with envy.

But hey, if you want to help stabilize your own grid while the government dithers, check out today’s sponsor, EnergySage!

Before we get to our final stories, I want to take just a moment to talk directly to you.

For fifteen years, Transport Evolved has been bringing you independent news about cleaner, greener, safer, and smarter transportation. Ten of those years have been here in the U.S., and through it all we’ve stayed true to our mission: covering stories that matter, even when bigger outlets pass them by.

But the truth is, we can’t do it without you. We’re not backed by corporations or big production budgets. We’re a tiny team—just three full-time and one part-time member—working hard to bring you content every week. And like so many other creators, we’re feeling the squeeze: costs keep rising, while YouTube ad revenue keeps falling. Every single Patreon pledge makes an enormous difference to keeping this show alive.

That’s why, during September and October, we’re holding a special pledge drive. By joining us on Patreon for as little as one dollar fifty a month, you’ll not only keep Transport Evolved going, but you’ll become part of the community that sustains independent journalism.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll share stories from supporters who already make this possible, and we’ll be offering a small thank-you in the form of exclusive digital art from Erin. And this Tuesday, we’ll kick things off live at eleven am Pacific with Liv and Patrick from the Electric Duo.

If you’ve been watching and thought about supporting us, now is the perfect time. Please consider joining us—and thank you, truly, for helping us continue this journey.

Now, it’s time for those last two stories.

As I’ve noted for what feels like the entire summer, there’s been something of a push in the Ev world toward setting new records this year, with range and track records a plenty.

We’ve covered several in this show, but there’s still one left to talk about – the new all-electric speed record set by BYD’s performance arm Yangwang, which managed to send a Yangwang U9 out on the APT automotive Testing Track in Papenburg, Germany to set a new world speed record. Previously set by the Aspark SP600 last year, the Yangwang U9 Track Edition, which can put two thousand, two hundred and fifty kilowatts to its quad motor drivetrain managed to hit a top speed of four hundred and seventy two point four one kilometers per hour. That’s two hundred and ninety-three point five four-two miles per hour, or if you prefer, faster than the Eurocopter X3, the Rimac Never, a Formula 1 car, and yes even most bullet trains. I could make plenty of Yangwang Jokes according to the Brits in the audience, but… I won’t.

And finally,

I’ve been driving and covering electric vehicles for nineteen years now, and in that time, I’ve heard just about every excuse for not getting an EV.

But this week, a new one popped up online that honestly stopped me in my tracks: the state of the average American garage. According to a Michigan-based research firm called Telemetry, one-third of American homes with garages are so full of stuff you couldn’t possibly park a car inside. And by extension, the argument goes, many people overlook EV ownership because they worry about not having a secure place to plug in at night.Now, I’ll admit—I’m not entirely convinced by that logic, though I do respect one of the study’s authors. Maybe I’m biased: my own garage is a woodworking shop, and I don’t know a single EV owner with off-street parking who actually charges inside their garage.But perhaps the best reaction came from two of our own team members, who rent and also own plug-in cars. Their take? “Most of us don’t even have a home, let alone a garage with power. And somehow, those who rent—and drive a plug-in—still manage just fine.”

And on that note, we’re done for today!

Before I go, a huge thank you to the Electric Vehicle Association for sponsoring today’s show. The EVA has been advocating for electric vehicles since nineteen sixty-seven and remains firmly committed to a cleaner, greener future for all. Join the EVA today to find out how to become an EV educator, meet like-minded fans, and get help to make your own transition to electric, help that includes a low-interest loan program to help finance your next step!

And thanks to you – if you can, please consider supporting us from just one dollar and fifty cents a month on Patreon. Youtube, in its ultimate wisdom, is now inserting so many ads into long-form content that it’s pushing people off the platform – and it’s also diluting the money paid to creators for every ad. And because right now there’s not really a good alternative to YouTube, (and no, Nebula is invite only, which is why we’re not on there), Patreon is really our only reliable form of income.

If just four hundred of our one hundred and fifty-two thousand subscribers who have yet signed up to patreon did so and committed to giving the equivalent of a fancy coffee a month, would put us in a much better financial position. And if you’d like to join in by watching the launch of our pledge drive on Tuesday at eleven am Pacific, please do!

We publish every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday here — and every Sunday we drop two videos on Transport Evolved Take Two, our informal behind-the-scenes channel.

And in closing, some important message.

You are valid. You are loved, and you belong.

This week has been another hard one in many countries around the world for different reasons – from yet another mass shooting of innocent victims to blaming an entire community for the actions of that one individual… to mass genocide at the hands of a country which believes it has a divine right to let others die. And of course, all the… horrid things being said and done in the pursuit of enriching a few at the expense of the many.

Right now, division and hate aren’t just tolerated — they are encouraged by those in power driven by a lust for cruelty. In these times, kindness and empathy become acts of resistance. Empathy is not weakness — it’s a skill we must nurture and regularly practice to hold onto our shared humanity.

I also want to remind you that it’s okay to take time off if you need to. To unplug, to get outside, or bury yourself in a good book, listen to your favorite album, or just spend time with loved ones. It’s important to listen to your body and engage in self care – so that when you’re ready, you can come back and fight for decency, community and justice for all. Don’t let the … you know what… win. Embrace your awesomeness, and let your light shine.

Finally, Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. And please — for the sake of everyone’s future — don’t let hate or ignorance win.

One in 10 American families owns an RV,"" Kraus said.
The RV runs on a battery and is equipped with solar panels, an electric heat pump and water tanks.
It saves you fuel economy, saves you range if you have an electric vehicle.
Kraus says Lightship is focused on building in America for America and hopes to be a guiding light to a sustainable future for an American pastime.","This Labor Day weekend, many Colorado families may be hooking up their RVs and heading out on an adventure, but now there's an electric camper option in Broomfield.

A Colorado startup has created America's first all-electric recreational vehicle. Founded by alumni from Tesla, Rivian and Nike, Lightship is manufacturing the country's first self-propelled towable RV in Broomfield.

The first customers will be receiving those vehicles in the coming weeks.

Lightship CEO and co-founder Toby Kraus thinks RVs are as American as apple pie.

""It's part of Americana. One in 10 American families owns an RV,"" Kraus said.

After growing up in Boulder and then working at Tesla, Kraus partnered with another Tesla alumnus to create Lightship, the first all-electric RV in the U.S.

""We really are developing what I would consider a new class of vehicle,"" Kraus said. ""We do something that's a little bit wild, which is we actually put a motor in the vehicle. So even though it's towed, it's also self-propelling. It's supporting its own drag and its own mass.""

The RV can be towed by electric or gas-powered cars.

""We are trying to bring sustainable technology to a new group of people and really get it into the mainstream,"" Kraus said.

The RV runs on a battery and is equipped with solar panels, an electric heat pump and water tanks.

Kraus says it can last a week or more between charges. It has a taller ""camp mode"" and compresses into a more aerodynamic ""road mode"" when driving.

""It's very efficient. It saves you fuel economy, saves you range if you have an electric vehicle. And then when you're inside, it's nice and open,"" Kraus said.

It's all controlled by a tablet.

""This is where you can kind of control everything, lights, climate, door and window status. This is how you level a vehicle. Check your water levels, check your energy status,"" Kraus explained.

Inside the Atmos edition of the RV, you'll find up to three beds, a seating area, kitchen and dry bathroom.

""Over here, we have the kitchen sink, induction cooktop, refrigerator, freezer, microwave. Something that people love is we have a dishwasher,"" Kraus said.

Every RV is made in Lightship's Broomfield factory, which employs 70 people.

""What they're installing right now is one of our high-voltage battery packs,"" Kraus said, while gesturing to some of his employees at work.

The company has a small office and a second showroom in California. Kraus says Lightship is focused on building in America for America and hopes to be a guiding light to a sustainable future for an American pastime.

""We build in the United States, here in Colorado. We also have a supply chain that we set up that is around 80% U.S. domestic content,"" Kraus said.

Lightship's Founders model is already sold out, but their Atmos and Panos models are available at their Colorado showroom and online. The Atmos model starts at $184,000, while the Panos model starts at $151,000.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/30/fc6ba5d3-2eae-4894-b45a-3279abd05064/thumbnail/1200x630/6bba51d647d4ac1b4df05a276a30edd6/broomfield-ev-rvs-6pkg-frame-3167.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:05:27.323792

The company also announced a series of other significant product and technology developments, including showcasing a concept moto-scooter Redux, and AtherStack 7.0, which would alert riders to share live location, report on potholes and crashes, update them on tyre pressure, among others.

Built for versatility, scalability, and cost optimisation, the new e-scooter platform is the first vehicle architecture since the launch of Ather 450, the company announced at an event here.

""With the EL platform, we are laying the foundation for Ather's next phase of growth. Just as the 450 defined our first chapter, EL will define the next, enabling us to develop multiple types of scooters at scale far more efficiently,"" said Tarun Mehta, Co-founder & CEO, Ather Energy, at the event.

This platform-first approach enables faster innovation and improved efficiency, serviceability, and rider experience, he said adding the latest platform reflects years of learning, deep R&D, and engineering.

He said the Ather's new factory at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar will scale with EL platform products to meet growing demand effectively.

A vehicle platform is the underlying structure and integrated systems shared by multiple vehicle models. The structure, which includes the chassis, powertrain, underbody, and electronic architectures, serves as the common foundation for the design and engineering.

The company has two manufacturing plants in Hosur (Tamil Nadu), one each for vehicle manufacturing and battery manufacturing. Additionally, another is coming up in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Maharashtra, which is expected to increase Ather's total manufacturing capacity to 1.42 million EVs per year.

Ather said its next-generation platform is designed to meet the evolving and diverse needs of the domestic electric scooter buyers.

Designed on the back of 26 lakh km of field data, the new platform features a new chassis, powertrain, and a fully redesigned electronics stack. This offers the flexibility to build a wide variety of form factors by utilising a common set of key components, the company said.

The versatility it offers enables Ather to cater to different consumer segments, use cases, and markets, while being more cost-effective. It also noted that simpler architecture and a reduced component count enable 15 per cent faster assembly.

This also allows up to 2X faster periodic services, increasing the service interval up to 10,000 km, it said.

The new platform also introduces features such as Advanced Electronic Braking System (AEBS), which enhances braking performance by reducing stopping distance and minimising rear-wheel lockups, it said.

""With AtherStackTM 7.0, we're bringing AI into everyday riding through an LLM (Large Language Model) trained for our use cases and tuned to Indian dialects. Voice is the first step in that journey, an interface beyond buttons that makes rides smarter, safer, and more intuitive,"" said Swapnil Jain, Co-founder and CTO at Ather Energy.

Ather also announced expanding its theft-safety suite with the introduction of ParkSafe and LockSafe features and said that AtherStack 7.0 will roll out as an over-the-air (OTA) update in the coming months, and will be backwards compatible with the Rizta Z and the Ather 450X up to Gen 3 scooters.

The company also announced it has updated the 2025 Ather 450 Apex with its own advanced cruise control system designed specifically for Indian riding conditions.

That may be you over Labor Day weekend and later this month, too. But are you ready to hunt for the best deals?

Here are some tips and strategies to arm yourself with the best game plan before you set foot into a dealership.

For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

There are several approaches to finding the best deal for your situation, and the path you take comes down to a few intertwined variables like tax credit eligibility, budget targets for monthly payments, and/or total cost. Let’s dig in.

Tax Credits: Which Buyers And Vehicles Qualify?

Thanks to President Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act, effective Sept. 30, the government tax credit for new and used EVs expires. The previous tax credit, implemented during the Biden administration, saved buyers up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on certain used EVs. Tax credits are supposed to be applied at the point of sale and effectively serve as a big discount off your final purchase price.

In other words, get ‘em while supplies last.

If you do intend on purchasing a new EV, know that not every vehicle qualifies for that tax credit, due to the current rules around battery sourcing, the location of final production and total costs.

Then, have a look at our list of the EVs that qualify for the full $7,500 credit. Even if a vehicle qualifies for the credit, the IRS has income thresholds that limit which buyers can get it. You can find those details here, but it is also recommended that you consult your tax professional. The tax credit is capped at $80,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks and $55,000 for other vehicles.

For more budget-oriented buyers looking for an inexpensive EV, vehicles that are at least two years old and have a transaction price of $25,000 and under (before local tax and fees), there is a tax credit up to $4,000. However, the income thresholds are a bit lower for these cars.

Many dealers will apply this credit at the point of sale, but other stores will provide the necessary paperwork for you to file for the credit on your own. Many EV shoppers have reported that it can be challenging to find reputable dealers that are willing to handle the necessary paperwork to obtain the credit. So buyers will want to confirm with the dealership if the store has the experience and willingness to handle the paperwork.

But if you lease a new EV, all limits are off, and you get the $7,500 tax credit regardless of what you want to drive.

Leases Are Where Most Of The Deals Are

When it comes to new EVs, the consensus is to lease them and not buy them. Currently, all EV leases qualify for the $7,500 regardless of the customer’s tax filing status or vehicle production. But that “leasing loophole” goes away at the end of September, too.

Where things get tricky is accurately comparing the lease programs across various brands to determine which ones are more competitive than others. Many automakers will advertise “lease specials” with super-low payments, but it’s important to pay attention to the fine print and details. Often, these low payments require substantial money up front for the math to work.

I often advise putting little or no money down on a lease because the total cost over time remains the same, and you don’t risk that down payment in case your leased car is totaled in an accident.

Before you go to the dealer, it would be wise to compare the advertised specials and reconfigure the numbers and look at what is called “effective monthly payment,” and then compare that cost to the MSRP.

Here is an example comparison between the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the Kia EV6. Two cars that are essentially identical when it comes to mechanical components, most features, and their price point.

Photo by: InsideEVs

For a Hyundai on an Ioniq 5 SEL with an MSRP of $51,200, the lease payment is $209 per month with $3,999 due at signing for a 30,000-mile, 24-month lease. This works out to an effective monthly payment of about $376 per month or a total lease cost of $9,024.

Photo by: InsideEVs

Examining the EV6, we have a Light Long Range AWD with an MSRP of $51,795. Kia is offering a 24-month lease for $289 per month with $3999 due at signing. You get 10,000 miles per year on that one. This works out to an effective monthly payment of $456 per month or a total lease cost of $10,944.

Thus, the Hyundai is about $2,000 cheaper to lease over the course of the term, but in either case, these are super-cheap leases for cars that retail for $50,000.

Some brands have calculators built into their configurators that allow you to adjust your parameters accordingly, though keep in mind that any numbers you see online should be treated as an “estimate” as they often do not include tax and fees and local market factors may impact pricing as well.

I strongly suggest that lease shoppers engage in negotiations with dealers and request quotes in writing before setting foot into the showroom. That way, you can more accurately compare the numbers. Plus, many dealers advertise artificially low lease “deals” that are a way to get you into the store, and then saddle you with a much higher actual payment than you expected; we see this happen quite often.

Have a look at the chart below. I shopped for an Acura ZDX EV for a client. There can be a wide difference in what various dealers are willing to offer. And even though we request quotes for leases with zero down, not every dealer provides quotes in that manner, so we have to reconfigure the numbers for better comparisons.

A Purchase Could Be A Better Play For Hybrids and Plug-Ins

The reality is that a lot of folks don’t have a living situation that allows for home charging, and access to chargers across America is still a work in progress. Those buyers may want to reduce their fuel cost with a battery-assisted car, but not make the full jump to an EV. While leases are usually the way to go for fully electrified models, the programs for plug-in hybrids and standard hybrids may not be as compelling.

For example, the Honda Civic Hybrid is arguably one of the best cars you can buy right now in that $30,000 segment if an EV doesn’t work either from a lifestyle or logistics perspective.

Honda is currently advertising a Civic Sport Hybrid (MSRP $30,490) lease for $339 per month on a 10,000-mile-per-year, 36-month lease with $3,499 due at signing.

Photo by: InsideEVs

That works out to an effective payment of $436 per month, which isn’t terrible. However, when you look at a total lease cost of $15,696 (before tax and fees), the picture changes a bit. It is very unlikely that a $30,000 Civic is going to lose over half its value in three years with only 30,000 miles on the clock. Basically, you will have paid far more over the term of that lease than you should have.

A shopper would be far better off buying this car and taking advantage of Honda’s historically high residual values, even if they only planned on keeping it for a few years. Plus, Honda’s legendary reliability makes this a better purchase to hang onto for a while than many other options.

Despite the Civic Hybrid's popularity, buyers can still score competitive deals. Here is a grid I worked up for a client where my team managed to find discounts at over ten percent off on the more well-equipped Touring trim.

Once again: It pays to shop around.

Don’t Count Out Used Cars

Across the entire budget spectrum, there are some fantastic used values in the pre-owned space, from $15,000 cars to ones retailing for six-figures and beyond. The tax credit applies to any EV under $25,000 that is at least two years old, provided you meet the income requirements.

The market for $25,000-and-under EVs is pretty aggressive, but great deals are out there on perennial favorites like the Chevrolet Bolt EV, Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model 3—the latter in particular is a kind of used deal king.

I have found that the sweet spot for used EVs currently is in the $30,000 to $35,000 range, as that seems to have the best balance of age, mileage, equipment, remaining warranty balance, and price. If you are shopping in this range, the tax credit is no longer a factor, so you don't have to worry about the end-of-September deadline. And you can take advantage of EV depreciation to get something that was once quite expensive for comparably cheap; how about a $32,995 Mercedes-Benz EQE, a car that was probably well over $70,000 when new?

Shopping for a used car requires a bit of a different strategy than shopping for a new car. Most dealers don’t have a lot of wiggle room to move, and most dealers stand firm with their advertised price. This can be frustrating for buyers accustomed to negotiating prices down, but the key to finding a deal on a used car is to focus on the best value, not the biggest discount.

Let’s examine a sample of certified used BMW i4s under $35,000 in the DC metro area:

Photo by: InsideEVs

All three of these cars are within striking distance of each other in terms of price, with mileage at 15,000, 19,000, and 35,000, respectively. All three are eDrive 35 trims, but that doesn’t mean that their original retail price was the same. This is why it’s good to dive into the spec sheets and compare the MSRPs.

The Annapolis car with 19,000 miles had an original MSRP of $55,955, and the Mount Laurel car with 15,000 miles stickered in at $54,820. The Fort Washington car with 35,000 miles retailed for $55,345. BMW’s CPO warranty starts at the original service date. Both the Annapolis and Fort Washington cars were sold in May 2023, whereas the Annapolis car was sold in August 2023.

Examining a closer comparison between the three, we have the Mount Laurel car with 4,000 fewer miles than Annapolis, but $1,000 lower in specs; however, it does have an extra few months of warranty. The Fort Washington car has the highest mileage, yet is about $500 more than the Annapolis car, with a sticker price that is only $500 higher—both have the same warranty balance remaining.

While there really isn't a wrong answer among these three, it appears that the Fort Washington car with the higher mileage is not as good a value as the other two.

As you can see, there are more variables to consider when shopping in the pre-owned market versus new, and buyers need to balance their desired equipment with other factors like mileage and remaining warranty.

Of course, advertised prices don’t always tell the whole story. Unfortunately, many used car dealers will post an online price that is very market competitive, only to add in a bunch of additional charges like “reconditioning fees” and “mandatory accessories.” This is why it is critical to get itemized quotes to really compare the value scores of various leads.

With the tax credits expiring and potential tariff-induced price increases on the horizon, now is a great time to score a deal on your next vehicle, whether it be a full battery EV or a fuel-sipping hybrid. The key to doing so comes down to your ability to compare prices, and don’t limit yourself to your local market, as often better deals can be found elsewhere.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/NGMGLn/s1/labor-day-car-buying.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 11:00:28.120153

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

The fundraising plan was unveiled in the company’s Aug. 11 quarterly earnings release, before work was forced to stop on Revolution Wind.
“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday.
“Revolution Wind, a renewable energy project that is right at the finish line, and which would add 400MW to our clean energy portfolio, must move forward,” Neronha said in a statement Friday.
“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.","Limited power supply in extreme weather events, rising and unpredictable utility bills and thousands of union laborers without work.

That’s the dire picture of Rhode Island’s future without more offshore wind energy, Christopher Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, said in an Aug. 8 affidavit submitted to federal court in Massachusetts.

Two weeks later, the Trump administration abruptly halted construction on Revolution Wind, a project already 80% completed and set to begin delivering power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in mid-2026. Predictions of economic and environmental harms quickly solidified, leaving workers stranded at sea, regional grid reliability under threat and state decarbonization mandates potentially out of reach.

“The invocation of the Wind Memorandum to issue a Stop Work Order for the fully permitted Revolution Wind project as it nears completion will harm Rhode Island, its residents, our strong labor workforce, and our offshore wind and related industries,” Kearns wrote in a second affidavit on Aug 28. “Moreover, it will harm our efforts to diversify our energy system and increase reliability.”

The consequences for Rhode Island’s only commercial offshore wind project will feature heavily in a Sept. 4 federal court hearing, where a group of 18 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, will ask U.S. District Judge William Young of Massachusetts to throw out the Trump administration’s Jan. 20 executive order halting reviews of offshore wind projects.

“The Revolution stop-work order provides another example of the harmful effects of Defendants’ arbitrary decision to adopt and implement the Wind Directive to stop wind-energy development in our States,” the AGs wrote in an Aug. 28 court filing. “And it underscores the importance of prompt vacatur of that decision to enable projects in and beyond the permitting pipeline to proceed toward development.”

The court hearing in Boston was scheduled two months before the Revolution Wind project was suddenly put in jeopardy, prompted by a multistate lawsuit filed in May against the Trump administration. The initial complaint centered on offshore wind projects still awaiting federal approvals, like the SouthCoast Wind project proposed off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, from which Rhode Island is also in negotiations to buy power.

Revolution Wind did not appear at risk, having already begun construction soon after receiving its final federal permit in November 2023.

Stuck in limbo

Little comfort now to the dozen millwrights idled aboard Wind Scylla in Rhode Island Sound for over a week, who were building turbines when the stop work order came through.

“We’re still waiting for an answer from the companies and the contractors on what’s going on,” Evan Wytas, business representative for Millwrights Local 1121, said in an interview Friday morning. “We haven’t gotten any word that they are on their way back, or when that will be.”

Meanwhile, another two dozen union trade workers scheduled to head out to the construction site Aug. 28 are still on land, waiting by the phone for the call that they can head to work, said Erica Hammond, legislative director for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO.

Workers are still getting paid for now, Hammond confirmed, though those who remain onshore much longer might have to file for unemployment, depending on the specific details of their contracts.

“It is very frustrating,” Hammond said. “To stop now, in the case of this specific project, it’s a waste of resources.”

More than 1,000 union workers have spent the last two years building the 65-turbine project, 40 of which have been installed, as well as a pair of substations that will connect the power supply to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity is enough to power 350,000 homes across both states, equal to 2.5% of the electricity load throughout New England, Kearns said in his affidavit.

The renewable electricity supply has already been baked into Rhode Island’s clean energy portfolio and is crucial to meeting the 2021 Act on Climate Law, which mandates net-zero emissions by 2050 with incremental, legally enforceable benchmarks that kick in at the end of the decade.

Orsted, the Danish company co-developing the project, pledged to explore solutions to resume work, including potential litigation, while exploring the financial implications for its $4 billion project. The company is seeking to raise another $9.4 billion from its shareholders, confirming Friday that its majority stakeholder, the Danish government, has agreed to the share sale. The fundraising plan was unveiled in the company’s Aug. 11 quarterly earnings release, before work was forced to stop on Revolution Wind.

“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday. “The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Orsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Orsted’s US offshore wind portfolio.”

The Revolution Wind project was expected to bring in $156.7 million in net income for the company each year once operational, the company said. An “extraordinary general meeting” is scheduled for Sept. 5 to receive board approval for the share sale.

Trump administration plans to revoke federal approval for Ocean City wind farm

Neronha’s office is also considering additional legal action, but had not filed anything as of Friday. He’s focused on the existing multistate lawsuit challenging federal actions on offshore wind.

“Revolution Wind, a renewable energy project that is right at the finish line, and which would add 400MW to our clean energy portfolio, must move forward,” Neronha said in a statement Friday. “Billions in investment, more than 1,000 jobs, and an energy future that helps, not hurts, generations to come, are all on the line.

“For this reason, we formally notified the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts of the President’s unlawful stop work order and the harm it will cause to Rhode Islanders,” his statement said. “We cannot allow this Administration to stop this project, and we will continue to explore additional legal avenues to prevent them from doing so.”

The Sept. 4 hearing in Boston will also give the federal agencies and cabinet directors named as defendants a chance to present their own arguments on why the lawsuit should be tossed. Adam Gustafson, acting assistant U.S. Attorney General, defended the federal administration’s pause on offshore wind projects in an Aug. 8 memo, citing “potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews.”

Gustafson argued that states lacked the jurisdiction to challenge federal review powers, at least on a universal basis. He asked the judge to rule in favor of the defendants, or to limit orders to specific projects and permits, rather than a blanket ruling denying federal review power over offshore wind as a whole.

“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.

The judge is unlikely to make a decision on the dueling motions at the Sept. 4 hearing, but. will likely issue a ruling at a later, unscheduled date.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Revolution-installed-turbine-082025-2.jpeg,N,,2025-08-30 12:04:10.506891

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,” an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,” spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

The legislation, which came into effect on July 4, has eliminated federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, as well as tax incentives for battery manufacturers set to phase out by 2030. This bill is anticipated to slow the growth of EV sales, compelling the industry to rely more on manufacturer discounts rather than consumer incentives to stimulate purchases. Critics fear this shift could strain the market and impact the broader EV ecosystem pivotal to Georgia’s ambitious plans to be the “electric vehicle capital of America.”

Notably, the act has already had a tangible impact on investment in clean energy, with a reported $14 billion in projects either canceled or scaled back in the first quarter of 2025 alone. Among these, a planned $1 billion battery plant in Statesboro, Georgia, is a glaring example of lost potential investments. Industry leaders, however, remain optimistic, asserting that electric vehicle production can thrive independently of federal support.

Georgia Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols expressed confidence, stating, “The tax credits played a purpose, but that purpose may be over. We may not need a subsidy in the future.” The sentiment echoed across numerous EV press conferences in the state indicates a determination to cultivate a self-sustaining supply chain, critical for long-term viability.

While the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 injected enthusiasm into the sector—significantly boosting investments in battery production and critical mineral processing—its recent challenges are forcing local manufacturers to adapt quickly. The IRA had led to a nearly threefold increase in investments in related industries, a trend that professionals worry might reverse due to the scarcity of financial assistance under the new legislation.

With federal support diminishing, local manufacturers face the daunting task of ensuring the development of an American critical minerals supply chain. Experts note that the U.S. currently holds only about 1% of the world’s lithium reserves, essential for battery production. This reliance on external resources poses a severe risk as international competitors—particularly China—dominate the supply chain.

In August, General Motors announced significant investments in U.S. operations, including a collaboration with Hyundai to develop six new electric models. These strategic partnerships hint at a concerted effort for domestic manufacturing despite the legislative challenges. Meanwhile, Kia remains committed to enhancing its local supply chains, a move highlighted by the company’s aim to minimize reliance on imported materials.

Despite the hurdles presented by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, industry proponents maintain a glimmer of hope. Many believe that while traditional incentives fade, innovative manufacturer strategies will emerge, leading to new deals and discounts that could attract consumers. The upcoming phase-out of the 45X tax credit for U.S. battery manufacturers by 2030 looms large, and analysts warn that without a robust domestic strategy, the U.S. risks losing ground to rivals in China and Europe.

In conclusion, while Georgia’s journey toward establishing itself as a leader in the electric vehicle sector faces significant obstacles, industry stakeholders are looking toward an independent future, strategically adapting to minimize dependency on federal incentives. The forthcoming years will reveal whether these efforts can sustain growth and innovation in the evolving landscape of electric vehicle manufacturing.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trumps-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Act-Threatens-Growth-of-Georgias.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:05:40.227580

Johanna ChisholmBBC News

A federal appeals court has ruled most of Donald Trump's tariffs are an overreach of his use of emergency powers as president.

The so-called reciprocal tariffs - imposed on nearly every country the US trades with - are being illegally imposed, the US Court of Appeals said on Friday.

The decision upholds a May ruling from the Court of International Trade, which also rejected Trump's argument that his global tariffs were permitted under an emergency economic powers act.

The court did not halt the tariffs but instead said they would remain in place until mid-October, setting up a further legal challenge in the US Supreme Court.

There are still a lot of unknowns, but here's what we understand so far about the ruling - and what it could mean for the US president's flagship policy.

What did the appeals court say?

In its 7-4 decision, the appellate court backed a lower court's finding that President Trump did not have the authority to impose global tariffs.

This was largely because of the law Trump used to justify the policies, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the judges said does not grant ""the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax"".

The US Court of Appeals rejected Trump's argument that the tariffs were permitted under his emergency economic powers, calling the levies ""invalid as contrary to law"".

Trump immediately rejected the judgement, taking to Truth Social in the hours after it landed to call the appeals court ""highly partisan"" and the ruling a ""disaster"" for the country.

""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" he wrote.

What is the IEEPA?

The decades-old act, which has repeatedly been deployed by Trump during both terms in office, grants a US president significant authority to respond to a national emergency or a major threat from overseas.

The 1977 law states that a president can pull a number of economic levers ""to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy or economy"".

It's been used by both presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, who invoked the act to impose sanctions on Russia after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and then again after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine eight years later.

But the appeals court stated in its decision that the emergency law ""did not give the president wide-ranging authority to impose tariffs"".

The IEEPA ""neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the president's power to impose tariffs"", they said.

Trump argued when he unveiled his global tariffs that a trade imbalance was harmful to US national security, and was therefore a national emergency.

But the court ruled that imposing tariffs is not within the president's mandate, and ""the power of the purse (including the power to tax) belongs to Congress"".

Why is this important?

Outside of being a significant setback to President Trump's centrepiece agenda - tariffs - the federal appeals court ruling could have an immediate impact on the US economy, with knock-on effects felt in global markets.

""Businesses are going to be subject to uncertainty,"" Dr Linda Yueh, an economist at Oxford University and the London Business School, told the BBC's Today programme.

As countries wait to see if the Supreme Court will take up the case, which seems likely, they could decide to hold off on conducting business with the US.

If this happens, Dr Yueh said, it could ""dampen down economic activity"".

There are also significant ramifications that could be felt within the political sphere.

For instance, if the Supreme Court reverses the federal appeals court decision and sides with the Trump administration, it could set a precedent that emboldens the president to use the IEEPA more aggressively than he has done so far.

What happens next?

The case will now most likely proceed to the highest US court, a challenge that Trump signalled on Truth Social.

""Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians,"" Trump wrote. ""Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again!""

The conservative majority on America's highest court could potentially make it more likely to side with the president's view.

Six of the nine justices were appointed by Republican presidents, including three that Trump selected during his first term in the White House.

But the court has also been more critical of presidents when it seems they're overreaching on policies not directly authorised by Congress.

During Joe Biden's presidency, for example, the court expanded on what it called the ""major questions doctrine"" to invalidate Democratic efforts to use existing laws to limit greenhouse gas emissions by power plants and to forgive student loan debt for millions of Americans.

What if the tariffs are ruled illegal?

The federal appeals court was divided 7-4 in its decision that Trump's nearly universal tariffs are illegal. It has now given the US administration until mid-October to appeal to the US Supreme Court on a case with implications for both the US economy and its trade relationship with the rest of the world.

If the Supreme Court affirms the decision, it could trigger uncertainty in financial markets.

There will be questions over whether the US will have to pay back billions of dollars that have been gathered by import taxes on products from countries that have been paying them over the past few months.

It could also throw into question whether major economies - including the UK, Japan and South Korea - are locked-in to the individual trade deals they secured with the US ahead of the August deadline. Other trade deals that are currently being negotiated could also be thrown into chaos.

If allowed to stand, the appeals court decision would also be a tremendous blow to Trump's political authority and reputation as a dealmaker. But if it were overturned by the Supreme Court it would have the opposite effect.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2329/live/1132b900-859a-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 09:58:46.228634

Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the authority to pass a penalty, not a requirement to do so.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission hasn’t imposed a single penalty two years after Newsom gave them the authority to do so, nor has it determined what counts as an excessive profit.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting towards more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://dailyjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/preview-2130.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 17:04:20.343070

“The EPA fired five whistleblowers who signed the EPA Declaration of Dissent, and issued a Notice of Removal for an additional four employees,” according to a statement from Stand Up for Science, a non-profit organisation created in response to US President Donald Trump’s cuts to federal research funding and other policies.

The EPA appeared to acknowledge the job losses in a statement on Aug 29, but did not specify if employees were fired.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualised basis,” an agency spokesman said, declining to comment on “individual personnel matters”.

Since taking charge of the federal agency tasked with ensuring clean air, land and water, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has executed Mr Trump’s agenda, including

gutting climate regulations

, ramping up fossil fuel development and slashing funding for clean energy.

The changes have drawn fierce backlash from scientists and environmental advocates alike.

The EPA

suspended more than a hundred employees

in July after they signed the scathing open letter accusing Mr Zeldin of pushing policies hazardous to both people and the planet.

The letter – signed by 270 employees with 170 choosing to be named – described a climate of political interference and warned that the agency’s leadership was eroding public health protections and scientific integrity.

On Aug 29, the EPA noted their “zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November”.

“The petition – signed by employees using a combination of their titles and offices – contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,” it added.

The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.
The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state.
Newsom's office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.
Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state's refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the power to implement a penalty but has not done so since it was given that authority in 2023.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,"" CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state. It created an independent division at the commission to oversee the oil and gas industry and provide guidance to the state on its energy transition.

Newsom's office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.

“When Governor Newsom signed this legislation two years ago, he promised that we would utilize the new transparency tools to look under the hood of our oil and gas market that had been a black box for decades,” spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in a statement. “We did exactly that.”

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,"" she said. ""And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission has not determined what would count as an excessive profit under the policy.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting towards more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/67r3dd63JxJcUdATofWRkg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/d9daba00f0b7c237cc1d77b764c3a4d6,N,,2025-08-30 12:05:15.414495

That prompted an EPA review of the Clean School Bus program.
Zoom in: Congress also killed another Biden-era program that helped school districts offset the cost of electric buses.
Electric school buses have been deployed in 49 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. territories and more than 20 tribal nations, according to data from WRI's Electric School Bus Initiative.
What to watch: Increasingly, state and local funding programs are helping to drive the electric school bus transition forward.","As students head back to school, a five-year effort to replace diesel school buses with electric ones has hit two big speed bumps: a federal funding freeze, plus the collapse of a leading bus manufacturer.

Why it matters: There's still lots of enthusiasm for cleaner buses, advocates say, but some school districts are turning back to diesel because they didn't get the electric buses they were promised or can't get service on the ones they own.

Catch up quick: Canadian electric bus maker Lion Electric filed for bankruptcy in December 2024 and shut down its only U.S. factory in Illinois.

The new owners, a group of Quebec-based investors that took control in May, reportedly said they won't honor U.S. orders or warranties.

Alarmed school districts that used taxpayer funds to buy Lion buses are left wondering about the status of pending orders, and about who will service buses already on the road.

Zoom out: The Trump administration hasn't said what will happen to the $2.3 billion in unspent funds in the EPA's $5 billion Clean School Bus program, created under 2021's bipartisan infrastructure law.

About $2.7 billion was disbursed across three rounds of funding in 2022 and 2023, during the Biden administration.

Applications for a fourth round of $965 million, announced in September 2024, closed in January, just before Trump took office, but no awards have been made.

As one of his first acts, Trump issued an executive order rolling back funding for clean energy and electric vehicles.

That prompted an EPA review of the Clean School Bus program. The agency expects to provide an update soon on whether more awards will occur, an EPA spokesperson tells Axios.

Zoom in: Congress also killed another Biden-era program that helped school districts offset the cost of electric buses.

The Commercial Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, provided up to $40,000 for the purchase of electric commercial vehicles, including school buses.

It was axed, along with other tax credits for EV purchases, in this year's massive budget reconciliation bill.

Where it stands: There are nearly 14,000 committed electric school buses in the U.S. — meaning they're funded, ordered or delivered — including 5,300 already on the road.

Electric school buses have been deployed in 49 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. territories and more than 20 tribal nations, according to data from WRI's Electric School Bus Initiative.

Yes, but: That momentum died in 2025, with 13,931 committed e-buses, only 73 more than in 2024.

What to watch: Increasingly, state and local funding programs are helping to drive the electric school bus transition forward.

Cumulative state-level funding grew dramatically from $268 million in 2020 to $2.47 billion in 2025.

""We're going to need some amount of incentives to keep moving forward,"" acknowledges Sue Gander, who leads a program at World Resources Institute to support school districts' purchases of electric school buses.

""The economic benefits and health benefits are still there,"" she said. ""Those are the reasons school districts want to move forward"".

The bottom line: Nearly half a million school buses carry more than 20 million children each day in the U.S., and about 90% run on diesel fuel, which has been linked to serious health risks and development issues in children.

New research from the World Resources Institute's Electric School Bus Initiative shows that the U.S. would see an estimated $1.6 billion in societal benefits annually by switching to electric.",https://images.axios.com/rXK9631UO2g4HVpxDjKJa8rx-gc=/0x0:1600x900/1366x768/2025/08/27/1756330170826.png,N,,2025-08-30 11:00:37.612306

""Hey everyone,"" the OP said. ""I have been lurking this subreddit for a while debating if I will make the jump to EV, but I finally did and I am super happy with the purchase.""

They bought their 2024 LR AWD M3 Tesla car used, with a $6,000 down payment and financing $29,000. While it had a ""couple of dings and scratches,"" they were ultimately happy with their decision.

""Went from a 2017 Passat SE I can't stop hard accelerating every chance I can get,"" they shared.

Electric vehicles are gaining traction. As the OP can attest, they accelerate faster than gas-powered cars and save you money over time. Let's look at the numbers.

Your average electric vehicle, while having a higher sticker price, costs $485 per year to run and requires about $900 per year for maintenance. Gas-powered vehicles require over $1,000 on both fronts. If you plan on keeping your car for over six years and are a homeowner with the means to install a charging station, then you'll reap the most benefits.

There's also the federal tax credit to consider, but you'll need to act quickly. Those who purchase an EV before September 30, 2025, will qualify for up to $7,500, per H&R Block. If you purchase a used EV, like the OP, you'll qualify for up to $4,000.

Aside from the financial benefits, EVs are also much more environmentally friendly than gas-powered vehicles. They don't run on dirty fuels, which pollute the air and warm the planet at unprecedented rates.

If you're still on the fence, you've got some options. Firstly, you might consider leasing instead of purchasing it outright. Plus, there are more brands than Tesla out there if you'd rather drive another car. Chevy, for example, has some insanely cheap deals on leasing their EVs.

Here’s a price comparison between EVs and hybrids, according to ChatGPT.

Purchase Price

The biggest car expense is its initial purchase price. ChatGPT pointed out that hybrids are generally cheaper to buy. The difference in price is largely due to battery costs, which make up almost a third of the price of a new EV, according to the Stanford Report.

Data from Kelley Blue Book shows that the cheapest starting price for an EV is $26,795, while hybrids start at $21,900.

Be Aware: I Asked ChatGPT Which Hybrid Vehicles To Stay Away From Buying: Here’s What It Said

Fuel and Energy Costs

EVs offer much lower fuel costs compared with hybrids, ChatGPT said. A hybrid combines a gas engine with an electric motor and a small battery, while electric-only vehicles rely solely on a larger battery and an electric motor.

According to Consumer Reports, the annual fuel cost for a hybrid is $300 to $800 less than that of a gas-only car, while EV owners pay about $1,300 less. Based on this data, EV owners pay roughly $500 to $1,000 less per year on fuel compared with hybrid drivers.

Maintenance

ChatGPT pointed out that EVs usually have lower maintenance costs due to fewer moving parts. EVs don’t need oil changes, but they do need brake pad replacements, although not as often due to regenerative braking. The highest maintenance cost is the battery; however, many manufacturers provide a warranty for the first eight years or 100,000 miles, CarEdge reported.

On the other hand, hybrids still have internal combustion components, so you’ll still need regular oil changes and part replacements on roughly the same maintenance schedule as gas-powered cars.

On a per-mile basis, EV maintenance and repairs are typically 40% lower than comparable gas vehicles, reported the National Resources Defense Council.

Incentives and Tax Credits

According to the IRS, buyers of new EVs can currently get up to $7,500 in federal tax credits, while used models may be eligible for $4,000. This also applies to plug-in hybrids. Standard hybrids do not qualify for the tax credit.

These tax credits can improve EV affordability, but they’re set to expire on Sept. 30, 2025, under President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.

Total Cost of Ownership

ChatGPT cited data compiled by Business Insider on the cost to own certain vehicles in the first five years. According to the data, the cost of owning a Tesla Model Y, the bestselling EV in the U.S., had a five-year cost of $34,500, which included interest charges on the loan, insurance, maintenance, tax and fees, and repairs. Including the purchase price, the total came to $91,000.

The total cost for a Toyota Rav4 hybrid was about $64,300 over five years, about the same as for the gas version. This also included the original purchase price of $35,000.

ChatGPT’s final verdict was that hybrids are generally cheaper to own in 2025, especially over the first five years, but EVs can catch up in the long run if buyers take advantage of tax credits and lower fuel and maintenance costs.

Competitive markets grew as independent power companies expanded and grid operators refined their processes for overseeing pricing and competition.
In New Jersey, Newark-based PSEG wants to be allowed to build power plants.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

The debate that took place in a Washington, D.C., hearing room in June was so filled with energy-industry jargon that most people would not realize they were witnessing a battle over who could own and profit from power plants.

The same fight between utility companies and independent power producers is now happening in statehouses.

Utility companies see the current crisis in the electricity system, driven by rising demand from data centers and high pressure to curb rate increases, as an opportunity. But consumer advocates caution that utilities’ efforts are more a cash grab than a solution.

“We need to plan for contingencies, we need flexibility, we need to plan for redundancies and have all the tools available to us to make sure that when customers turn the lights on, those lights come on,” said Wendy Stark, executive vice president for utilities and chief legal officer for the utility PPL Corp. of Pennsylvania, at the June 4 hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Stark was talking about changing the law in states that decided decades ago to shift to competitive markets for power plants.

Let’s take a step back, because the concepts discussed at the hearing and in cases before state regulatory commissions are well-understood by the companies involved, but might as well be in a foreign language to most observers.

The first thing to grasp is that more than a dozen states—California and Texas were the largest—decided in the 1990s and 2000s to change the rules for who can own power plants. The states said that utilities would focus on the basics of delivering power and billing, and continue to receive a guaranteed profit for this, while non-utility companies would compete on an open market to see who can produce and sell electricity at the lowest price.

Lawmakers and energy analysts often used the word “deregulation” to describe what was happening, but it would be more accurate to call it a restructuring, since power plants were still subject to federal regulations. The process varied by state, but it often involved the utilities selling their power plants, or spinning off those assets into an affiliated company that no longer had a guaranteed profit.

Meanwhile, most states didn’t move away from traditional regulation, and utilities there continue to have local monopolies over power plants and the electricity delivery system. So now the country has several different regulatory systems existing side by side.

But utilities have long argued that competitive markets are ill-suited to making sure a large region has a reliable supply of electricity at affordable prices. They would like to regain the ability to build power plants in restructured states.

Much of this discussion is happening in the territory served by PJM Interconnection, which runs from New Jersey to Chicago and is the country’s largest grid region. State officials have taken a high interest in PJM, the nonprofit company that manages the grid and market, because of recent spikes in electricity bills.

Utilities are backing legislation in Pennsylvania and New Jersey that would allow them to own power plants. Consumer advocates expect to see a similar proposal in Maryland in 2026. Some of the same discussions are happening in other states, such as Illinois and Ohio, but have gained little traction, based on interviews with people who monitor this lobbying.

Among the losers if utilities get what they want would be independent power producers, which are non-utility companies that own power plants, such as LS Power and Vistra Corp. They would face new competition from utilities that have the security of being able to pass costs directly to consumers.

Utility company officials are arguing that changes in market rules could facilitate the development of renewable energy and help meet state climate goals. But advocates say it’s a mistake to frame this debate solely in terms of its effects on climate change or renewable energy, which they say are secondary to the main reason for this fight: a desire by utilities to maximize profit from the growth of data centers.

“With so much growth on the horizon right now, I’m sure [utilities are] seeing dollar signs, and maybe that’s their job,” said John Howat, senior energy analyst for the National Consumer Law Center. “But that’s not necessarily in the public interest.”

David Lapp, the Maryland People’s Counsel, which is the state government’s consumer advocate on utility issues, said this situation may appear complicated, but it’s simple.

“Utilities see an opportunity to grow their profits by expanding their businesses into generation so they can shift risks on the ratepayers and take advantage of data center load growth,” he said.

Lapp sees no evidence that there would be benefits from allowing utilities to do what they want—no cost savings or improvements to reliability.

But some analysts say that consumer advocates may be missing some nuance. Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at Public Citizen, argues that states should at least explore whether there is a consumer-friendly way to allow utilities to build power plants in the states where that’s otherwise not allowed.

“There are no easy fixes here,” he said. “But I think it’s important for state regulators and state lawmakers to explore all options on the table for how to keep the lights on in a reliable and affordable way.”

It’s not a coincidence that all the states considering changes have Democratic governors. Slocum said these officials feel an urgency because of a desire to reduce electricity prices and an awareness that the Trump administration is likely to use federal regulation to make competitive energy markets favor fossil fuels even more than they already do.

“Trump is going to turn federal energy regulators at FERC into a policy arm of the White House,” he said.

Remembering the Bad Old Days

For people like Rob Kelter, who has been advocating on utility issues since the mid-1990s, the current discussion reveals that many people don’t remember or understand that today’s system is largely a response to past excesses and failures of utility companies. He is a senior attorney for the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a Chicago-based nonprofit that is active in much of the Midwest.

“There’s a new generation of legislators who in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania and Illinois don’t all remember how bad things were, how high prices were, when we went through restructuring,” he said.

In the mid-1990s, the federal government and many corporations worked to reduce regulations across industries. Enron, which would later gain infamy as a business failure, helped to lead lobbying campaigns in state legislatures to deregulate utilities such as electricity and natural gas.

Utilities had been vertically integrated, with local monopolies over power plants along with the wires and pipelines to deliver resources. Supporters of restructuring pointed to high rates and cost overruns as evidence that the monopoly model led to inefficiency that could be fixed by allowing competition.

By the early 2000s, more than a dozen states had passed some form of electricity deregulation.

The changes meant that utilities needed to move away from direct ownership of power plants, but they retained control of wires, billing and other core functions. Other companies would own power plants and compete on an open market.

Under the new system, power plant owners would assume the risk for their investments. This was in contrast to a vertically integrated system in which utility ratepayers bore the risk.

The shift to deregulation slowed soon after, hurt by the California electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001, in which the state experienced rolling blackouts and high costs. The problems in California stemmed in part from market manipulations by Enron, which was about to collapse following the discovery of accounting fraud.

But states that had changed their rules mostly stuck with the new way of doing things. Competitive markets grew as independent power companies expanded and grid operators refined their processes for overseeing pricing and competition.

Today, 14 states have restructured electricity markets, according to the Energy Information Administration, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas, plus Washington, D.C. Others have more limited forms of these policies, including Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Virginia and Washington.

The hearing at FERC headquarters in June was part of a technical conference about the challenges that regional grid managers and utilities face as they try to bring new power plants online. One of the main issues is that data centers are becoming huge consumers of electricity, sometimes outpacing the ability to build new power plants and leading to concerns that a tight supply of electricity will lead to high prices for everyone.

Data centers are “sort of like an accelerant” to existing concerns about having enough power plants to meet consumer demand, Adam Keech, vice president of market design and economics for PJM, said at the hearing.

“We don’t have time to waste,” he said.

On that same panel were representatives from some of the utilities that want to own power plants, and some of the independent power producers that stand to be hurt if states move in this direction.

“If the generators and if the market doesn’t supply more generation, the utility could step in,” said Stark of PPL, which is based in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

On the opposite side are companies such as LS Power of New York, which owns power plants across the country and sells electricity in PJM and other markets.

“Can I just dispel some of the false information that’s being given here?” asked Marji Philips, vice president of wholesale market policy for LS Power. She said her company and other power plant owners were investing heavily in new plants and she rejected the idea that market forces were failing to meet demand.

Changes in state law would allow utilities to enter this market with minimal risk, while the existing players would face high risks and new competitors.

Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group for independent power producers, said in an email that lawmakers should be wary of “a reversal in policy and a return to the monopoly utility approach for generation.”

On this point, he agrees with Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy at Advanced Energy United, a trade group whose members include many of the leading solar, wind and energy storage companies.

“While growing energy demand is a challenge for all states to tackle, the solution isn’t for states to abandon market competition but rather to continue to press grid operators to make improvements that ensure the lowest cost for ratepayers,” Rai said in a statement.

“States Have an Opportunity”

The discussion at the June hearing hinted at the much larger lobbying effort taking place in statehouses.

In recent earnings conference calls, executives for several large utilities spoke about their hopes that states would change their laws to allow the companies to build and own power plants.

“Despite higher prices, we are not seeing the market respond fast enough,” said Calvin Butler, CEO of Exelon, in a July 31 conference call. His company owns utilities across PJM, including ComEd in Illinois, PECO in Pennsylvania, BGE in Maryland and Atlantic City Electric in New Jersey.

“States have an opportunity to proactively bring control, certainty and cost benefits by pursuing options outside of the capacity market, including regulated generation,” he said.

FirstEnergy, PPL and PSEG are among the other utilities that have been discussing this topic in state legislatures or before federal regulators.

The companies are focusing much of their attention on Pennsylvania, and, to a lesser extent, Maryland and New Jersey, based on comments from the companies and other interested parties.

Pennsylvania state Sen. Jarrett Coleman, a Republican, has introduced SB 897, which would allow utilities to build and own power plants in cases where state utility regulators determine that this would lead to cost savings for consumers. The bill is awaiting action in a Senate committee.

“Pennsylvania’s decades-old energy policies need to be updated to address potential energy shortfalls and provide the state with additional tools to help insulate customers from growing price volatility and reliability concerns,” Coleman said in an April memo about the bill.

The Energy & Policy Institute, a utility watchdog nonprofit, has been tracking this process and obtained records of email communications between Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office and utilities such as Exelon, FirstEnergy and PPL. The messages reveal little about the views of Shapiro, a Democrat, on whether utilities should be allowed to own power plants, but they do show that large and influential companies are trying to nudge him in that direction.

“We look forward to continuing the productive dialogue surrounding resource adequacy in the face of surging electrical demand driven by new data centers, AI technology, electrification and business development,” said John Hawkins, FirstEnergy’s president for Pennsylvania, in a November 2024 email to Shapiro’s staff.

Inside Climate News asked Shapiro’s office whether the governor supports allowing utilities to own power plants.

“Gov. Shapiro’s focus continues to be on lowering costs for Pennsylvanians by expanding energy generation and pushing for PJM reforms that would better support the new power demands,” said Manuel Bonder, a Shapiro spokesman, in an email. “The Shapiro administration has put forward a comprehensive plan that would streamline project permitting, incentivize new energy generation, and reduce power demand through new investments in energy efficiency.”

The comment did not touch on whether utilities should be allowed to own power plants.

FirstEnergy spokesman Todd Meyers had this statement: “While we are not actively seeking to build generation in the deregulated states in which we operate, FirstEnergy would consider building generation under a regulated construct and if it provides benefits to our customers.”

In Maryland, Exelon and its local utilities have talked about the need for lawmakers to change rules about who can own power plants. Lapp, the People’s Counsel, expects this to intensify when the Maryland General Assembly reconvenes in January.

In New Jersey, Newark-based PSEG wants to be allowed to build power plants. Ralph LaRosa, the utility’s chairman, president and CEO, said in a conference call this month that the region’s need to rapidly increase the electricity supply “may require the consideration of a new approach to procuring capacity and resource planning.”

A pending proposal, Assembly Bill 5439, would allow utilities to compete for the right to do projects in the state. It’s not clear whether this has a chance of passing.

This bill would not be good for consumers, said Brian Lipman, director for New Jersey’s Division of the Rate Counsel, the state’s consumer advocate on utility issues.

“Competition is good for ratepayers,” he said in an email. “Moreover, utility-owned generation will likely shift the risk of producing generation away from generation developers and onto ratepayers. This means that if something goes wrong (cost overrun, inaccurate load forecast) ratepayers, not the generators, will be liable for the costs of that error.”",https://highlandcountypress.com/sites/default/files/36998-acd99b42-6825-4670-9083-1cf8208792ba_0.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 09:58:50.259856

On the shores of Lake Michigan, the 800-megawatt Palisades power plant is racing toward a late-2025 restart after regulators granted an unprecedented exemption that flips its status from “retired” back to “operational”.

Fans of wind turbines and solar farms might raise an eyebrow, yet the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Department of Energy (DOE), and Michigan’s own leaders agree: reviving this dormant reactor will help hit climate targets and keep the grid steady.

A power plant reborn

Palisades shut down in May 2022, got sold off to Holtec International, and entered “retirement mode”—the nuclear version of putting on pajamas and calling it a night. Normally, that’s game over for any power plant. But then electricity demand started growing faster than wind turbines and solar panels could keep up, so policymakers took another peek at the big stainless-steel beast they had parked.

By July 24, 2025, the NRC said, “Fine, you can go back to work,” and by August 25, Palisades officially clocked back in. Think of it as a plant that tried early retirement… then realized it couldn’t afford to sit on the beach all day.

Holtec aims to synchronize the power plant with the grid in the fourth quarter of 2025, making it the first U.S. commercial reactor ever to return to service after being formally retired and stripped for decommissioning.

Dollars, deals, and demand

Bringing a nuclear power plant back to life is not cheap. The DOE has furnished a loan guarantee of $1.52 billion, with five disbursements already released to cover new fuel, component repairs, and safety upgrades.

Michigan legislators added up to $300 million for local infrastructure and workforce training. On the revenue side, Wolverine Power Cooperative and Hoosier Energy signed long-term purchase agreements that lock in buyers for as much as two-thirds of Palisades’ output, anchoring the project’s finances even before the first electron flows.

The lure is obvious: Midwestern data centers, EV battery plants, and electrified factories all need round-the-clock clean juice, and they need it soon.

Why Palisades closed down in the first place

Palisades didn’t shut down in 2022 because of a green revolution or a sudden anti-nuclear crusade. It shut down because it simply stopped being profitable. For years, the power plant sold its electricity under a long-term contract, but once that deal started wobbling, it couldn’t compete in the free market.

Add in a flood of cheap natural gas reshaping the Midwest market, and running an 800-megawatt reactor suddenly looked like running a gourmet restaurant in a town that only wants fast food. (A Homer Simpson reference would be great here, but it’s already too obvious.)

By May 2022, the operator, Entergy, decided it wasn’t worth keeping the lights on. The decision had far more to do with economics and shaky contracts than politics or ecology. Ironically, this “permanent” retirement lasted just long enough for the U.S. Department of Energy and Michigan leaders to realize the grid would be cleaner and more stable with Palisades back on deck. Now, with demand spiking thanks to the rise of Artificial Intelligence and data centers all over the country, priorities have changed. We need stable energy, 24/7, and we need it now.

Tougher than flipping a switch

Resurrection is more complex than restarting a laptop. Holtec projects a combined workforce of more than 600 skilled jobs, preserving the region’s nuclear know-how and salaries that average well above the local median. Once components pass pressure tests, the power plant will run a staged start-up ending in a “grid-sync” test late next year. Only then can Michigan count on continuous output through 2040 and beyond.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/palisades-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 09:58:53.291415

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects.
Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.","WASHINGTON — The Transportation Department on Friday canceled $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects, the latest attack by the Trump administration on the reeling U.S. offshore wind industry.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It's the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

As former Republican congressmen who represented southern districts in Florida and South Carolina, climate change isn’t abstract. Miami is seeing rising tides. North Carolina has been battered by torrential flooding. Energy grids have buckled under record-breaking heat. These risks are real, and they are reshaping our economy, insurance markets, and communities.

RICK PERRY SAYS KEN PAXTON'S ENERGY LAWSUIT WILL HURT US COAL COMPANIES

That is why conservatives must reclaim the climate conversation. Sadly, today’s debate is too often dominated by the loudest partisan voices. On the far left, some prescribe sweeping mandates and federal micromanagement that threaten innovation and growth. On the far right, others—ironically in the name of conservatism—are turning the tools of government against private companies, punishing them for evaluating the financial impacts of climate risk.

Take Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s lawsuit against BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard. He claims these firms formed an ""investment cartel"" by coordinating their consideration of climate risk, effectively conspiring to disadvantage coal producers and traditional energy companies. But that framing badly misrepresents reality. As the Wall Street Journal editorial board noted, coal production increased during the very period Paxton points to—undermining his claim of an anti-energy conspiracy. What he calls collusion is, in fact, routine fiduciary judgment: investors weighing risks and making portfolio choices. That’s not a cartel. That’s an efficient market working as it should.

Assessing risk, whether from hurricanes, regulation, or technological disruption, is the essence of responsible investing. If an asset manager concludes that coastal real estate is more vulnerable to flooding, or that insurance payouts are skyrocketing in certain regions, adjusting portfolios accordingly isn’t ""woke capitalism."" It’s their fiduciary duty. It’s to safeguard the value of their portfolios. It’s exactly how free markets are supposed to function.

Some of Texas’s most respected conservative leaders see this clearly. Rick Perry, former Governor and Energy Secretary during the first Trump Administration, has criticized Attorney General Paxton’s lawsuit, warning that weaponizing state power against investors undermines the very energy agenda conservatives claim to support. Perry has rightly argued that free markets, not lawsuits and political intimidation, are the best way to ensure American energy security and economic resilience. He argues true freedom means defending the right of businesses and investors to assess risk as they see fit.

Conservatives have long championed the principles of limited government and individual liberty. But when politicians intervene to dictate investment strategies or intimidate firms for recognizing climate risks, they abandon those very principles. The real conservative position is simple: the freedom to invest must be protected. American investors and companies must be able to manage all business risks and opportunities to remain profitable and competitive.

Across the country, center-right voices are beginning to step up and lead on this issue. Institutions like the Cato Institute, the National Taxpayers Union, R Street, and federal and state lawmakers are demonstrating how market-based approaches can preserve freedom, drive innovation, and prepare our communities for the realities of climate change. We will all convene later this month in New York City to share how conservatives can chart a path forward.

This is not about choosing between the environment and the economy. It is about unleashing American ingenuity to confront financial risks, create opportunities, and strengthen resilience. Conservatives should be the ones insisting that the marketplace—not government mandates—decides how to adapt and invest for the future.

The stakes are clear. If we cede the conversation, the public will be left with a false choice between big-government mandates from the left and big-government meddling from the right. Both are wrong. Conservatives must stand for freedom. For families rebuilding after storms, for entrepreneurs developing clean technologies, and for investors responsibly assessing risks. Here in America, we must firmly defend the freedom to invest.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/paxton-ken.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 11:01:27.232341

Cell-cultivated meat offers an alternative that allows consumers to enjoy the taste of meat without the moral trade-offs.
Banning cell-cultivated meat betrays those values.","Starting Sept. 1, Texas joins six other states in banning the sale of cell-cultivated meat. It’s a move that feels more symbolic than substantive — after all, cell-cultivated meat is still in its infancy, produced in limited quantities and approved for sale among only a few companies. Yet the symbolism matters. Instead of embracing a tool with enormous potential to address pressing global challenges, some lawmakers are slamming the door before we’ve even had a chance to explore what’s possible.

For Texas lawmakers to ban this technology now is, frankly, shortsighted — and un-American.

Cell-cultivated meat — sometimes called lab-grown meat — is real animal meat produced by taking a small sample of animal cells and growing them in a controlled brewery-like environment. No slaughter is required. The goal is to create a more humane option that could reduce the environmental and health downsides of conventional meat production.

The bans run counter to the very values Texas often claims to champion: entrepreneurship, free markets, consumer choice.

Consider the environmental context. Traditional meat production is responsible for a staggering share of greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water use. And it drives habitat loss on a scale that endangers biodiversity worldwide. Cell-cultivated meat is not yet a perfect solution — current production methods remain energy intensive — but early studies suggest that with continued innovation, it could dramatically reduce land use, pollution and carbon emissions compared with industrial animal agriculture.

If we’re serious about tackling climate change, we need more options on the table, not fewer.

There’s also a public health dimension. Industrial animal farming is a breeding ground for zoonotic diseases and a major driver of antibiotic overuse, which accelerates the rise of resistant bacteria called superbugs. Cell-cultivated meat sidesteps many of these risks. Grown in sterile facilities, it doesn’t require anywhere near as many antibiotics, nor does it involve the dense confinement of animals that facilitates viral outbreaks. In a world where pandemics have reshaped our collective memory, ignoring safer food technologies is a gamble we cannot afford.

And then there’s the ethical dimension. Every year, tens of billions of land animals (and trillions of sea animals) are raised and slaughtered in conditions most people would rather not think about. Cell-cultivated meat offers an alternative that allows consumers to enjoy the taste of meat without the moral trade-offs. Even for those who do not personally object to torturing and/or killing animals, the simple fact that a more humane option exists should be cause for curiosity, not prohibition.

But here’s where the argument against bans becomes even clearer.

First, these laws are bad for the states themselves. Banning cell-cultivated meat doesn’t just block consumers from trying a new food. It also disincentivizes universities, startups and investors from putting down roots in states like Texas.

The cell-cultivated meat industry is still young, but it is already attracting billions of dollars in research funding, venture capital and private partnerships. By saying “not here,” Texas is essentially exporting those dollars, jobs and opportunities to more welcoming regions. At a time when states are competing fiercely to attract high-tech industries, this decision ensures Texas will lose out.

Second, these bans are bad for the nation. When American states reject innovation, they send a clear signal to companies: build elsewhere. And “elsewhere” increasingly means China, Singapore or Europe — regions that have been more open to experimentation. The U.S. risks repeating the mistake we made with solar panels, where hesitation at home allowed foreign competitors to dominate the market.

Do we really want the future of meat production — a technology that could reshape agriculture, trade and climate policy — controlled by other countries simply because we were too quick to shut the door?

Third, these bans are un-American. At their core, they run counter to the very values Texas and other states often claim to champion: entrepreneurship, free markets and consumer choice. To limit what scientists can research, what entrepreneurs can build and what consumers can buy is government overreach, plain and simple.

If cell-cultivated meat is truly unappealing, then consumers will reject it, and the companies making it will fail. That’s how markets work. But to pre-emptively prohibit a technology before it has even had the chance to compete? That’s not protecting freedom — it’s stifling it.

For Texas lawmakers to ban this technology now is, frankly, shortsighted — and un-American.

So why are states like Texas, Florida and Alabama banning cultivated meat? The justifications offered are often thin. Some politicians argue it’s about protecting ranchers, who fear economic displacement. Others appeal to “naturalness,” casting cell-cultivated meat as strange or unsafe. But history shows that dismissing new food technologies out of fear rarely holds up. Pasteurization, refrigeration and even “artificial ice” all faced initial skepticism before becoming mainstream. The idea that protecting ranchers requires banning potential competitors is particularly puzzling in states that otherwise champion free markets and innovation.

Of course, cell-cultivated meat is not a silver bullet. Critics are right to note that the technology is still expensive, scaling is difficult and its environmental advantages depend on how production evolves. But those are reasons to support research, not to prohibit it outright. If cell-cultivated meat succeeds, it could reduce our dependence on industrial animal farming. If it fails, it won’t be because Texas banned it in its early days — it will be because consumers didn’t want it, or the economics didn’t work out. That’s how innovation should rise or fall: on its merits, not on premature political bans.

At its heart, this debate is not about whether Texans — or anyone — should eat cell-cultivated meat tomorrow. It’s about whether we will allow innovation to flourish so that people can decide for themselves. Banning a technology before it has even had a chance to prove itself is not conservative. It is not pragmatic. It is not wise. It is anti-American.

Texas prides itself on independence, grit and innovation. Banning cell-cultivated meat betrays those values. Rather than fearing the future of food, the Lone Star State — and the rest of the nation for that matter — should be shaping it.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250828-lab-grown-meat-vl-1251p-73d3ac.jpg",N,,2025-08-30 09:59:44.768222

Ohio labor leaders say renewable energy is not just powering homes, but creating thousands of good-paying union jobs.

Despite the current administration's focus on fossil fuels, clean energy jobs are growing twice as fast as the overall labor market and Ohio ranks in the top 10 states for clean energy employment.

Pat Hook, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 683 in Columbus, said his members have already worked on several utility-scale solar projects in central Ohio, with more underway.

""It has provided hundreds and hundreds of jobs, millions of dollars in wages and benefits, opportunities for a large number of people to enter the electrical industry, join our apprenticeship programs,"" Hook outlined.

Renewable energy workers earn about 30% more than the national median wage and union coverage in the sector is above 10%, nearly three times the private-sector average, according to federal labor data.

Hook acknowledged some local groups have opposed solar projects, raising concerns about land use or environmental impacts but he noted completed projects have disproved most claims and are generating tax revenues to benefit schools, police and fire services in surrounding communities.

Kevin Pranis, Great Lakes marketing manager for the Laborers' International Union of North America, said clean energy projects have provided stable, long-term job opportunities.

""We really train people to be construction professionals over a set of skills that laborers focus on,"" Pranis explained. ""Those skills are applicable, whether it's a solar project, a wind project, a highway, a school or any other type.""",,N,,2025-08-30 09:58:41.214464

Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting restrictions on how the transportation department can spend money on maintenance operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.coloradohometownweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Electric_Vehicles-Road_User_Fee_73408-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-08-30 18:06:08.985271

II. General Information

A. Overview of Proposed Action

On April 17, 2015, EPA published a final rule creating 40 CFR part 257, subpart D, which establishes a comprehensive set of minimum Federal requirements for the disposal of CCR in landfills and surface impoundments (80 FR 21302) (“Federal CCR regulations”).[ ] Section 2301 of the 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act amended RCRA section 4005 to create a new subsection (d) that requires EPA to establish a Federal CCR permitting program. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d).

As amended, RCRA section 4005(d) also allows States to seek approval for a State CCR permit program that will operate in lieu of a Federal CCR permit program in the State. The statute provides that within 180 days after a State submits a complete application to the Administrator for approval, EPA shall approve the State permit program if the Administrator determines that the State program requires each CCR unit located in the State to achieve compliance with either the Federal requirements or other State requirements that EPA determines, after consultation with the State, are at least as protective as those included in the Federal CCR regulations. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B).

On February 6, 2023, WDEQ submitted its State CCR permit program application to EPA Region 8 requesting approval of the State's partial CCR permit program.[ ] EPA is proposing to approve the Wyoming partial CCR permit program pursuant to RCRA 4005(d)(1)(B). 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B). The fact that Wyoming is seeking approval of a partial program does not mean it must subsequently apply for full program approval. However, Wyoming could apply for revised partial program approval or full program approval at some point in the future if it chooses to do so. If approved, the Wyoming CCR permit program will operate in lieu of the Federal CCR program (codified at 40 CFR part 257, subpart D), with the exception of the provisions specifically identified below for which the State is not seeking approval and for which the corresponding provisions of the Federal CCR program would remain in effect. For the approved provisions, EPA would retain its inspection and enforcement authorities under RCRA sections 3007 and 3008, 42 U.S.C. 6927 and 6928, consistent with EPA's ongoing oversight authority under RCRA. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(4)(B).

EPA has also engaged Federally recognized Tribes within the State of Wyoming in consultation and coordination regarding the program determination. EPA established opportunities for an informational session and consultation, beginning with EPA Region 8 sending a letter to the Eastern Shoshone Tribe at Wind River Reservation and the Northern Arapaho Tribe at Wind River Reservation. Tribal consultation has been and will continue to be conducted in accordance with the EPA policy on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribes ( https://www.epa.gov/​sites/​production/​files/​2013-08/​documents/​cons-and-coord-with-indian-tribes-policy.pdf). Neither Tribe sought Tribal consultation.

B. Background

CCR are generated from the combustion of coal, including solid ( printed page 42349) fuels classified as anthracite, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, and lignite, for the purpose of generating steam to power a generator to produce electricity or electricity and other thermal energy by electric utilities and independent power producers. CCR, commonly known as coal ash, include fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, and flue gas desulfurization materials. CCR can be sent offsite for disposal or beneficial use or disposed of in on-site landfills or surface impoundments. This section summarizes EPA's regulatory actions on CCR to date to provide relevant background on this proposed approval of Wyoming's partial CCR permit program.

On April 17, 2015, EPA published a final rule creating 40 CFR part 257, subpart D, which established a comprehensive set of minimum Federal requirements for the disposal of CCR in landfills and surface impoundments (80 FR 21302). The rule created a self-implementing program that regulates the location, design, operating criteria, and groundwater monitoring and corrective action for CCR units, as well as the closure and post-closure care of CCR units. It also requires recordkeeping and notifications for CCR units. EPA has since amended 40 CFR part 257, subpart D on August 5, 2016 (81 FR 51802), July 30, 2018 (83 FR 36435), August 28, 2020 (85 FR 53516), November 12, 2020 (85 FR 72506), May 8, 2024 (89 FR 38950), and November 8, 2024 (89 FR 88650). More information on these rules is provided in the Technical Support Document in the docket for this document.

C. Statutory Authority

EPA is issuing this proposed action pursuant to RCRA sections 4005(d) and 7004(b)(1). See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d) and 6974(b)(1). As amended by section 2301 of the 2016 WIIN Act, RCRA section 4005(d) instructs EPA to establish a Federal permit program similar to those under RCRA subtitle C and other environmental statutes and authorizes States to develop their own CCR permitting programs that go into effect in lieu of the Federal permit program upon approval by EPA. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d).

Under RCRA section 4005(d)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(A), States seeking approval of a State CCR program must submit to the Administrator “in such form as the Administrator may establish, evidence of a permit program or other system of prior approval and conditions under state law for regulation by the State of coal combustion residuals units that are located in the state.” The statute provides that EPA shall approve a State CCR permit program if the Administrator determines that the State program will require each CCR unit located in the State to achieve compliance with either: (1) The Federal CCR requirements at 40 CFR part 257, subpart D; or (2) Other State criteria that the Administrator, after consultation with the State, determines to be “at least as protective as” the Federal requirements. 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B). The Administrator must make a final determination, after providing for public notice and an opportunity for public comment, within 180 days of receiving a State's complete submittal of the information specified in RCRA section 4005(d)(1)(A). 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B). EPA may approve a State CCR permit program in whole or in part. Id. Once approved, the State permit program operates in lieu of the Federal requirements. 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(A). In a State with a partial program, only the State requirements that have been approved by EPA operate in lieu of the Federal requirements, and facilities remain responsible for compliance with all remaining Federal requirements in 40 CFR part 257.

As noted above, the Federal CCR regulations are self-implementing, meaning that CCR landfills and surface impoundments must comply with the terms of the regulations prior to obtaining a Federal permit or a permit issued by an approved State. Noncompliance with the Federal CCR regulations can be the subject of an enforcement action brought directly against the facility. Once a final CCR permit is issued by an approved State or pursuant to a Federal CCR permit program, however, the terms of the permit apply in lieu of the terms of the Federal CCR regulations and/or requirements in an approved State program, and RCRA section 4005(d)(3) provides a permit shield against direct enforcement of the applicable Federal or State CCR regulations (meaning the permit's terms become the enforceable requirements for the permittee).[ ]

RCRA section 7004(b), which applies to all RCRA programs, directs that “public participation in the development, revision, implementation, and enforcement of any . . . program under this chapter shall be provided for, encouraged, and assisted by the Administrator and the States.” 42 U.S.C. 6974(b)(1). Accordingly, EPA considers permitting requirements, requirements for compliance monitoring authority, requirements for enforcement authority, and requirements for intervention in civil enforcement proceedings in evaluating State CCR permit program applications.

Once a State CCR permit program is approved, the Administrator must review the approved program no less frequently than every 12 years, no later than three years after a revision to an applicable section of 40 CFR part 257, subpart D, and no later than one year after any unauthorized significant release from a CCR unit located in the State. EPA also must review an approved State CCR permit program at the request of another State alleging that the soil, groundwater, or surface water of the requesting State is or is likely to be adversely affected by a release from a CCR unit in the approved State. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(D)(i)(I) through (IV).

In a State with an approved State CCR permit program, EPA may commence administrative or judicial enforcement actions under RCRA section 3008, 42 U.S.C. 6928, if the State requests assistance or if EPA determines that an EPA enforcement action is likely to be necessary to ensure that a CCR unit is operating in accordance with the criteria of the State's permit program. 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(4). EPA can enforce any Federal requirements that remain in effect ( i.e., those for which there is no corresponding approved State provision). EPA may also exercise its inspection and information gathering authorities under RCRA section 3007 in a State with an approved program. 42 U.S.C. 6927.

III. The Wyoming Application

EPA began working with WDEQ in September 2019 as the State developed its application for the State's partial CCR permit program.[ ] As it has with other States, EPA discussed with WDEQ the process for EPA to review and approve the State's CCR permit program, WDEQ's anticipated timeline for submitting a CCR permit program application to EPA, and WDEQ's regulations for issuing permits. On February 6, 2023, WDEQ submitted its CCR permit program application to EPA Region 8 requesting approval of the State's partial CCR permit program.

EPA reviewed WDEQ's submission and, on March 27, 2023, sent a letter acknowledging receipt of the ( printed page 42350) application and clarifying the statutory 180-day review period for a final determination of adequacy.[ ] After reviewing the application in more detail, on December 5, 2023, EPA sent a letter stating that the formal review period had not yet begun; discussing further information that would strengthen the application; and discussing the State interpretation of the regulatory performance standards.[ ] On January 29, 2024, WDEQ sent a letter to EPA asserting that EPA's review period had expired, discussing the State's interpretation of the scope of EPA's review of the State CCR permit program application, and responding to EPA's questions from the December 2023 letter.[ ] After further discussions between EPA and WDEQ, on May 16, 2025, EPA sent to WDEQ additional clarification questions to supplement its application. On June 20, 2025, WDEQ responded to EPA's questions.[ ]

IV. EPA Analysis of the Wyoming Application

RCRA section 4005(d) requires EPA to evaluate two components of a State CCR permitting program to determine whether it meets the standard for approval: the program itself, and the technical criteria that will be included in each permit issued under the State program. This section discusses EPA's review of both requirements under RCRA section 4005(d) and the criteria EPA uses to conduct this review.

First, EPA must evaluate the permit program itself (or other system of prior approval and conditions). See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(A) through (B). RCRA section 4005(d)(1)(A) directs the State to provide evidence of a State permit program's compliance with RCRA requirements in such form as determined by the Administrator. In turn, RCRA section 4005(d)(1)(B) directs EPA to approve the State program based upon a determination that the program “requires each coal combustion residuals unit located in the state to achieve compliance with the applicable [Federal or State] criteria.” In other words, the statute directs EPA to determine that the State has sufficient authority to require compliance at all CCR units located within the State. See also 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(D)(ii)(I). To make this determination, EPA evaluates the State's authority to issue permits and impose conditions in those permits, as well as the State's authority to conduct compliance monitoring and enforcement.

During this review of the State permit program, EPA also determines whether the program contains procedures consistent with the public participation directive in RCRA section 7004(b). RCRA section 7004(b), which applies to all RCRA programs, directs that “public participation in the development, revision, implementation, and enforcement of any . . . program under this chapter shall be provided for, encouraged, and assisted by the Administrator and the States.” 42 U.S.C. 6974(b)(1). To make this determination, EPA evaluates the State's public participation procedures for issuing permits and for intervention in civil enforcement proceedings.

Although 40 CFR part 239 applies to the approval of State Municipal Solid Waste Landfill (MSWLF) programs under RCRA section 4005(c)(1) rather than EPA's evaluation of CCR permit programs under RCRA section 4005(d), the specific criteria outlined in that regulation provide a helpful framework to examine the relevant aspects of a State's CCR permit program. States are familiar with these criteria because all States have MSWLF programs that have been approved pursuant to these regulations, and the regulations are generally regarded as protective and appropriate.

Consequently, EPA relied on the four categories of criteria outlined in 40 CFR part 239 as guidelines to evaluate the Wyoming CCR permit program: permitting requirements, requirements for compliance monitoring authority, requirements for enforcement authority, and requirements for intervention in civil enforcement proceedings.

Second, EPA must evaluate the technical criteria that will be included in each permit issued under the State CCR permit program to determine whether they are the same as the Federal criteria, or to the extent they differ, whether the modified criteria are “at least as protective as” the Federal requirements. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B). Only if both components meet the statutory requirements may EPA approve the program. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1). EPA makes this determination by comparing the State's technical criteria to the corresponding Federal criteria and, where necessary, evaluating whether different State criteria are at least as protective as the Federal criteria.

Upon careful review, and as discussed in more detail below, EPA has preliminarily determined that Wyoming's partial CCR permit program includes all the elements of an adequate State CCR permit program. It also contains all the technical criteria in 40 CFR part 257, subpart D, except for the provisions specifically discussed below that Wyoming has not included in its partial CCR permit program. Consequently, EPA is proposing to approve the entirety of Wyoming's partial CCR permit program application. The State's CCR permit program does not encompass the full scope of Federal CCR requirements as presently constituted, and the provisions of the Federal CCR regulations that are not part of Wyoming's approved CCR permit program will remain directly applicable to affected CCR units. 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B).

EPA's full analysis of the Wyoming CCR permit program, and how the Wyoming regulations differ from the Federal requirements, can be found in the Technical Support Document. EPA determined that the Wyoming CCR permit program application was complete and notified Wyoming of its determination by letter.[ ]

A. Adequacy of the Wyoming Permit Program

Section 4005(d)(1)(A) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(A), requires a State seeking State CCR permit program approval to submit to EPA, “in such form as the Administrator may establish, evidence of a permit program or other system of prior approval and conditions under State law for regulation by the State of coal combustion residuals units that are located in the State.” Although the statute directs EPA to establish the form of such evidence, the statute does not require EPA to promulgate regulations governing the process or standard for determining the adequacy of such State programs. EPA, therefore, developed the Coal Combustion Residuals State Permit Program Guidance Document; Interim Final (82 FR 38685, August 15, 2017) ( printed page 42351) (the “Guidance Document”). The Guidance Document provides recommendations on a process and standards that States may choose to use to apply for EPA approval of its CCR permit programs, based on the standards in RCRA section 4005(d), existing regulations at 40 CFR part 239, and the Agency's experience in reviewing and approving State programs.

EPA evaluated the Wyoming CCR permit program using the process and statutory and regulatory standards discussed in sections II.C. and IV.A. of this preamble. EPA's findings are summarized below and provided in more detail in the Technical Support Document located in the docket supporting this proposed determination.

1. Guidelines for Permitting

In EPA's judgment, an adequate State CCR permit program must ensure that: (1) Existing and new facilities are permitted or otherwise approved and in compliance with either 40 CFR part 257 or other State criteria; (2) The State has the authority to collect all information necessary to issue permits that are adequate to ensure compliance with relevant 40 CFR part 257, subpart D requirements; and (3) The State has the authority to impose requirements for CCR units adequate to ensure compliance with either 40 CFR part 257, subpart D, or such other State criteria that have been determined and approved by the Administrator to be at least as protective as 40 CFR part 257, subpart D.

The permitting process in Wyoming involves three entities: (1) WDEQ; (2) The Solid and Hazardous Waste Division (SHWD) within WDEQ; and (3) The Environmental Quality Council (Council), an independent body whose members are appointed by the Governor. For a more detailed description, see section 5.0 of the Narrative Statement.

a. Permit Required

All owners and operators of existing and new CCR facilities in Wyoming are required to comply with State CCR rules found at Wyoming Administrative Rules, Environmental Quality, Solid Waste Rules (SWR) chapter 18, and to obtain a permit in accordance with Wyoming Statutes (WS) section 35-11-502 and SWR chapters 1 and 18. Wyoming law requires every person who treats or transports solid waste or operates a solid waste management unit or facility, including CCR units, to have a valid permit issued by WDEQ. WS section 35-11-502(a); SWR chapter 1, section 1(c), chapter 18, section 4(a). Permit application requirements can be found in SWR chapter 1, section 2, and chapter 18, section 4(d).

b. Permitting Authority

WDEQ has the authority to collect all information necessary to issue permits that are adequate to ensure compliance with SWR chapter 18. WS section 35-11-109. In addition, SWR chapter 18, section 4(d) specifies the information that applicants for a solid waste permit, including a CCR unit permit, are required to submit to show compliance with the SWR.

c. Permit Requirements and Permitting Process

Existing CCR landfills must submit a permit renewal application no later than 12 months prior to the expiration date of the facility's existing solid waste permit. SWR chapter 18, section 4(d). Existing CCR surface impoundments must submit a new permit application within 12 months of the effective date of the State rule. Owners and operators of existing CCR landfills and surface impoundments that intend to cease disposal of all waste before obtaining a permit through the post-closure care period shall submit a closure permit application within 12 months prior to the expiration date of the facility's existing permit or the date the facility anticipates to cease disposal of CCR, whichever comes first. An alternate schedule to submit a new application, renewal application or closure permit application may be approved by the SHWD for good cause. SWR chapter 18, section 4(b).

Applications for renewal permits and closure permits are subject to the application procedures set forth in WS section 35-11-502 and SWR chapter 1, section 2(a), (b), and (c) and must follow the procedures and provisions of SWR chapter 1, section 2(d) and (e) respectively. CCR permits may be transferred from one operator to a new operator with written approval from WDEQ SHWD's Solid Waste Permitting and Corrective Action (SWPCA) Program Director (Director) in accordance with SWR chapter 1, section 3(d).

The permit duration for new or existing CCR surface impoundments and CCR landfills renewal permits will be for the operating life of the facility through post-closure, and closure permits will be issued for a period that includes the time required to complete closure activities and a minimum 30-year post-closure term. SWR chapter 18, section 4(c).

Within sixty days after a permit application has been submitted, WDEQ must notify the applicant whether or not the application is complete. WS section 35-11-502(e). Once WDEQ determines that an application is complete, WDEQ issues a letter of completeness and initiates a technical review of the permit application. At that time, the applicant must conduct a public notice and initiate a 30-day public comment period for the complete application, as described below. WS section 35-11-502(g), (h); SWR chapter 18, section 4. WDEQ must complete the technical review of the application within 90 days. During technical review of the application, WDEQ considers public comments submitted during the public comment period for the complete application. SWR chapter 18, section 2(c)(i)(C). Within WDEQ, the SHWD manages and implements the Wyoming CCR permit program. The SHWD may opt to conduct a public hearing on the application. SWR chapter 18 section 2(c)(i)(D).

Once the SHWD completes technical review of the application, it may make one of three determinations: (1) The permit application is technically inadequate; (2) The permit application is technically adequate, and a proposed permit is suitable for publication; or (3) The permit application is denied. WDEQ may modify, suspend, revoke, or deny a permit if: (1) Permit issuance would not meet the provisions of the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act, WS section 35-11-101 et seq. (the Act) or regulations; (2) The applicant fails to submit the required information; (3) The facility has a history of noncompliance; (4) The applicant indicates the facility would not comply with provisions of the regulations or misrepresents actual site conditions; (5) The applicant fails to employ a qualified solid waste manager; or (6) The applicant, or any partners, executive officers, or corporate directors has been found liable of violating environmental quality laws or criminal racketeering laws or regulations which constitute evidence that the applicant cannot be relied upon to conduct the operations described in the permit application in compliance with the Act or regulations. SWR chapter 1, section 4.

Provisions for amending permits for solid waste handling facilities are in SWR chapter 18, section 4(f). SWR chapter 18, section 3(c) specifies those changes to a permit that qualify as major amendments and which are minor amendments. Major amendments to permits may be requested by the Permittee and are reviewed and processed by the SHWD in accordance with the procedures for new or renewal permits described above. Minor amendments to permits may be completed through written notice and ( printed page 42352) approval by the SHWD within 60 days. SWR chapter 18, section 3(c). A written notice of a minor amendment to a permit can be determined to be deficient, approved, or denied. Permittees can provide additional information to the SHWD in response to any deficiency notice.

EPA has preliminarily determined that the Wyoming approach to CCR permit applications and approvals is adequate, and that this aspect of the Wyoming CCR permit program meets the standard for program approval.

2. Guidelines for Public Participation

Based on RCRA section 7004, 42 U.S.C. 6974, it is EPA's judgment that an adequate State CCR permit program will ensure that: (1) Documents for permit determinations are made available for public review and comment; (2) Final determinations on permit applications are made known to the public; and (3) Public comments on permit determinations are considered and significant comments are responded to in the permit record. EPA's review of Wyoming's CCR permit program indicates that the State has adopted public participation procedures that allow interested parties to talk openly and frankly about permit issues and search for mutually agreeable solutions to differences in views. An overview of Wyoming's public participation provisions is provided below.

a. Public Notice

The State program provides public notice in several ways and at several different stages of the permitting process, which taken together ensure that documents for permit determinations are subject to public review and comment. WDEQ requires State CCR permit applicants to provide notice to the public. Once WDEQ determines that an application is complete, WDEQ issues a letter of completeness and initiates a technical review of the permit application. At this time, the applicant must conduct a public notice and initiate a 30-day public comment period for the complete application. WS section 35-11-502(g), (h); SWR chapter 18, section 4. The public notice must provide specific information about the facility, including its proposed size and location; the types of waste to be managed; methods that will be used to manage the waste; and the operating life of the unit. WDEQ must complete technical review of the application within 90 days. During technical review of the application, WDEQ considers public comments submitted during the public comment period for the complete application. SWR chapter 18, section 2(c)(i)(C). The SHWD may opt to conduct a public hearing on the application. SWR chapter 18 section 2(c)(i)(D). Permit renewals are subject to the same public notice and comment requirements as new permit applications and are therefore subject to two, 30-day public comment periods with options to hold a public hearing for each.

b. Public Comment Period

All applicants for solid waste permits that submit a new, renewal, closure or major amendment permit application are required to complete two public comment periods during the permitting process. The first public comment period occurs after the SHWD deems the permit application complete, and the second occurs when the SHWD deems the permit application technically adequate and issues a proposed permit in accordance with WS section 35-11-502, SWR chapter 1, section 2(c), and SWR chapter 18 section 4(f). Public notice for the complete application and for the proposed permit must contain information about the permit application including the applicant; the proposed facility location and size; the waste types intended for management; the method of waste management; and the operating life of the unit. Public notices must also contain information on how to obtain special assistance or alternate formats of a notice for individuals with disabilities and inform the reader to visit WDEQ's website for a Spanish translation.

The applicant is required to publish each written notice once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the county where the applicant plans to locate the facility or where an existing facility is currently located, for each public comment period. WS section 35-11-502 (g through k) and SWR chapter 18 section 2. Each public comment period begins on the first day of the notice publication and continues until 30 days after the second publication. The applicant is required to give written notice of the permit application to landowners with property located within one-half mile of the site, the mayor of each city or town within 50 miles of the site, the Local County Commission, any solid waste district located in the county, and the Solid Waste Permitting and Corrective Action Program Interested Parties Mailing List (hard copy). The written notice is also posted to WDEQ's Public Notice website.

Permit applications and review documents are available for public review at any WDEQ office and can be sent digitally upon request. Specific information on how to request access to permit documents is found in Wyoming's CCR permit program narrative Section 7.0 Public Participation (Page 14), Appendix G Public Notice Templates, SWR chapter 1 section 2(c), and WS section 35-11-502. Additionally, the public can contact the WDEQ and request to be added to a listserv or mailing list (Interested Parties Mailing List). Written comments on permit applications are accepted by mail, fax, and through WDEQ's digital comment portal. If a commenter has technical difficulties with the digital comment portal, the portal website has instructions for obtaining assistance.

Public comments received by WDEQ during the first public comment period for the complete application are considered by WDEQ in drafting a proposed permit. If substantial written comments, including objections to a proposed permit, are filed during the public comment period for the proposed permit, a public hearing shall be held by the Council within twenty days after the end of the public comment period. WS section 35-11-502(k). The Director shall render a decision on the proposed permit within 30 days after completion of the public comment period if no hearing is requested. If a hearing is held, the Director will issue or deny the permit no later than 15 days from receipt of any findings of fact and decision of the Council. WS section 35-11-502(k) and (m).

All comments received are considered and WDEQ provides a response to each commenter prior to making a final permit determination. In addition to providing responses to individual commenters, all files in WDEQ are available for the public to review unless they are found to be confidential under WS section 35-11-1101 or otherwise protected under the Wyoming Public Records Act. The public can submit a record request using the WDEQ website. The public can also request to view documents at any of WDEQ's offices.

Final permit determinations are required to be added to the owner or operator's CCR website within five days of the owner or operator's receipt of the determination. SWR chapter 18, section 11(c)(i). Documents produced and distributed as part of the permitting process are maintained by WDEQ as a public record in accordance with Wyoming Public Records Act and must be made available to the public accordingly. Public comments are subject to the Wyoming Public Records Act and maintained by WDEQ. ( printed page 42353)

c. Challenges to Permit Decisions

In accordance with WS section 35-11-502(k), any interested person has the right to file written objections to the proposed permit with the Director within 30 days after the last publication of the written notice given for the proposed permit. If substantial written objections are filed, the Wyoming Environmental Council (Council) holds a public hearing. WS section 35-11-502(k). To notify the public of a pending hearing, the Council must publish written notice of the time, date, and location of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the facility would be located once a week for two consecutive weeks immediately prior to the hearing. The public hearing is to be conducted as a contested case under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act (WY APA). WS 16-3-107 through 16-3-112. Judicial review can be obtained pursuant to the WY APA. WS 16-3-114.

If a public hearing is held, the Council shall issue findings of fact and a decision on the proposed permit within 30 days afterward. WDEQ shall issue or deny the permit within 15 days after receiving findings of fact and decision of the Council. WS section 35-11-502(m)

WS section 35-11-1001 provides that any aggrieved party under the Act may obtain judicial review by filing a petition for review within 30 days after entry of the order or other final action complained of pursuant to the provisions of the WY APA. Any interested person has the right to file written objections to a proposed permit with the Director within 30 days after the last publication of the public notice for the public comment period for the permit. If substantial written objections are filed, a public hearing shall be held by the Council. WS section 35-11-112 charges the Council to act as the hearing examiner for WDEQ in any case contesting the grant, denial, suspension, revocation or renewal of any permit required by the Act. The hearing shall be conducted as a contested case in accordance with WY APA, WS sections 16-3-101 et seq.

The WY APA provides that any person aggrieved or adversely affected in fact by a final decision of an agency in a contested case, or by any other agency action or inaction, is entitled to judicial review. WS section 16-3-114.

EPA has preliminarily determined that the Wyoming approach to public participation requirements provides adequate opportunities for public participation in the permitting process sufficient to meet the standard for program approval. The provisions described above meet the three criteria listed at the beginning of this section by providing several means by which documents for draft and final permit determinations are made available for public review and comment, as well as ensuring that public comments on permit determinations are considered and significant comments are responded to in the permit record.

3. Guidelines for Compliance Monitoring Authority

An adequate permit program must provide the State with the authority to gather information about compliance, perform inspections, and ensure that the information it gathers is suitable for enforcement. WDEQ has authority under WS section 35-11-109 to obtain any necessary documents and to conduct monitoring and testing to determine if an owner or operator of a CCR unit is in compliance with the permit and applicable regulations.

The Director or designated officers, employees, or representatives of WDEQ are also granted the authority under WS section 35-11-109 to conduct inspections of facilities, to inspect and copy any records, and to inspect any monitoring equipment or method of operation required to be maintained pursuant to the Act. Further, the application for a CCR unit includes an access agreement authorizing WDEQ to enter an operator's premises where a regulated facility or activity is located or conducted, or where records are kept, to perform inspections and to collect data for the purposes of ensuring compliance or as otherwise authorized by the appropriate rules and regulations of WDEQ. No permit shall be issued unless the owner of the facility provides the written authorization. SWR chapter 1, section 1(g).

In addition, the information that WDEQ collects or obtains during inspections, compliance monitoring, and enforcement, allows the State to verify the accuracy of information submitted by owners or operators of CCR units; verify the adequacy of methods (including sampling) used by owners or operators in developing that information; and produce evidence admissible in an enforcement proceeding. WS section 35-11-109.

Accordingly, EPA has preliminarily determined that these compliance monitoring authorities are adequate, and that this aspect of the Wyoming CCR permit program meets the standard for program approval.

4. Guidelines for Enforcement Authority

An adequate State CCR permit program must provide the State with adequate enforcement authority to administer its State CCR permit program, including the authority to: (1) Restrain any person from engaging in activity which may damage human health or the environment, (2) Sue to enjoin prohibited activity, and (3) Sue to recover civil penalties for prohibited activity.

WS section 35-11-701 authorizes the Director to issue an order requiring the cessation and desistance of violations of the Act, rules, regulations, standards, permits, licenses or variances under the Act. In addition, if the Director has evidence that any pollution source presents an immediate and substantial danger to human or environmental health or safety, the Director may institute, through the Wyoming Attorney General, a civil action for immediate injunctive relief to halt any activity causing the danger. WS section 35-11-115(a). Further, WS section 35-11-109(a)(i) grants WDEQ wide-ranging authority to perform acts necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act and any rules, regulations, orders, or permits established or issued thereunder, and WS section 35-11-109(a)(vii) grants the Director wide latitude to prepare and present enforcement cases before the Council for violations of the Act or regulations promulgated under the Act. When compliance with the Act or the regulations applicable to CCR units, SWR chapter 18, is not achieved, WDEQ is authorized under the Act to engage in voluntary stipulated settlement or to initiate a civil enforcement action in Wyoming District Court.

Finally, under WS section 35-11-901(a), the Director can bring an administrative action for the assessment of civil penalties in Wyoming District Court against any person who violates, or any director, officer or agent of a corporate permittee who willfully and knowingly authorizes, orders or carries out the violation of any provision of the Act, or any rule, regulation, standard, or permit adopted thereunder or who violates any determination or order of the Council pursuant to the Act or any rule, regulation, standard, permit, license, or variance. Such violations are subject to a penalty not to exceed $10,000.00 for each violation for each day during which a violation continues; a temporary or permanent injunction; or both a penalty and an injunction. WS section 35-11-901(a).

Based on the foregoing, EPA has preliminarily determined that this aspect of the Wyoming CCR permit ( printed page 42354) program meets the standard for program approval.

5. Intervention in Civil Enforcement Proceedings

Based on RCRA section 7004, an adequate CCR State permit program must provide an opportunity for citizen intervention in civil enforcement proceedings. Specifically, the State must either: (1) Provide for citizen intervention as a matter of right; or (2) Have in place a process to: (a) Provide notice and opportunity for public involvement in civil enforcement actions, (b) Investigate and provide responses to citizen complaints about violations, and (c) Not oppose citizen intervention when permissive intervention is allowed by statute, rule, or regulation.

WS section 35-11-904(c)(ii) provides that any person may intervene as a matter of right when WDEQ, through the attorney general, has commenced a civil action to require compliance with the provisions of the Act, or any rule, regulation, order or permit issued pursuant to the Act. Additionally, WDEQ has the authority under WS 35-11-701(a) to investigate citizen complaints concerning violations.

Inasmuch as the State explicitly provides for citizen intervention in civil enforcement proceedings as a matter of right, EPA has preliminarily determined that these authorities provide for an adequate level of citizen involvement in the enforcement process, and that this aspect of the Wyoming CCR permit program meets the standard for program approval.

B. Adequacy of Technical Criteria

EPA conducted an analysis of the Wyoming CCR permit program application, including a thorough analysis of Wyoming statutory authorities for the CCR program, as well as its regulations at Solid Waste Rules chapter 18: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals in Landfills and Surface Impoundments. As noted above, Wyoming has requested approval of a partial CCR permit program.

1. Wyoming CCR Units and Resources

WDEQ has identified 19 disposal units that are currently or have been used for disposal of CCR wastes (3 landfills and 16 surface impoundments) at 4 facilities in Wyoming.[ ] WDEQ has demonstrated that it has the personnel to administer a permit program that is at least as protective as the Federal requirements.[ ] The WDEQ SHWD is the lead program for permitting, compliance, and enforcement of CCR units. The WDEQ CCR Program is funded through the State budget process. The WDEQ budget is approved by the Wyoming State Legislature as identified in the Wyoming State Budget. In addition, WDEQ applied for EPA State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) funding for Fiscal Years 2021 through 2023. In total, WDEQ has received $571,396 in funding to develop its CCR permit program. If EPA receives future appropriations, WDEQ can continue to apply for funds for implementation of its CCR permit program. EPA has preliminarily determined that the WDEQ staffing and funding are adequate for WDEQ to administer the CCR permit program.

2. Wyoming CCR Regulations

EPA has preliminarily determined that the portions of the Wyoming CCR permit program that were submitted for approval meet the standard for approval under RCRA section 4005(d)(1)(B)(i), 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B)(i). To make this preliminary determination, EPA compared the technical requirements in the Wyoming CCR regulations at SWR chapter 18 to the Federal CCR regulations at 40 CFR part 257 to determine whether they differed from the Federal requirements, and if so, whether those differences met the standard in RCRA sections 4005(d)(1)(B)(ii) and (C), 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B)(ii) and (C).

WDEQ previously regulated CCR in landfills under the SWR starting in 1990. Under the Wyoming Water Quality Rules promulgated in 1975, Wyoming began regulating CCR surface impoundments. WDEQ incorporated by reference the Federal CCR regulations, promulgated through December 14, 2020, with the addition of those portions of the Act (appendix A of the application) and SWR (appendix B of the application) that were more stringent. This includes additional definitions, general facility information, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, and requirements for co-disposing of other waste streams, which are described further in section V. of the TSD. WDEQ amended the regulations to adopt EPA amendments through December 14, 2020, and chapter 18 became effective on August 19, 2022.

3. Wyoming Partial Program

WDEQ is seeking approval of its partial State CCR permit program pursuant to RCRA section 4005(d). The WDEQ's rules adopt the Federal CCR regulations promulgated through December 14, 2020. Wyoming is not seeking approval for the following four requirements of the Federal CCR regulations and, therefore, those requirements in the Federal CCR regulations will continue to apply directly to each regulated CCR unit in Wyoming:

1. Amendments made in the Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments and CCR Management Units Final Rule.[ ] This includes 40 CFR 257.50(e), which WDEQ has not yet adopted.

2. 40 CFR 257.73(a)(4), 257.73(d)(1)(iv), 257.74(a)(4), and 257.74(d)(1)(iv) for vegetative cover for slope stability;

3. 40 CFR 257.90(g) for suspension of groundwater monitoring; and

4. 40 CFR 257.95(h)(2) for groundwater protection standards for constituents in appendix IV having no Maximum Contaminant Levels.

With the exception of these four items, EPA has preliminarily determined that the Wyoming CCR regulations contain all of the technical elements of the Federal CCR regulations, including requirements for location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post-closure care, recordkeeping, notification, and CCR website posting requirements. The Wyoming CCR permit program also contains State-specific language, references, definitions, and State-specific requirements that differ from the Federal CCR regulations, but which EPA has determined to be “at least as protective as” the Federal criteria. These State-specific requirements are also discussed further in sections III.1. and V. of the Technical Support Document.

The effect of approving a State CCR permit program is that, except for the provisions for which EPA has not granted approval, the Wyoming CCR permit program will apply in lieu of the Federal CCR regulations. For the State provisions that will not be approved upon finalization, the corresponding Federal requirements will continue to apply directly to facilities, and therefore facilities must comply with both the ( printed page 42355) Federal requirements and the State requirements.

V. Wyoming CCR Permits

In accordance with the Wyoming SWR, chapter 18, section 4(a), all CCR units must be permitted in accordance with chapter 18. WDEQ has not issued any SWR chapter 18 CCR permits in the State. In accordance with the SWR, chapter 18, section 4(b), existing CCR landfills and surface impoundments must submit an operating or closure permit application under chapter 18 under certain timeframes unless an alternate schedule is approved by the SHWD for good cause. New CCR units must obtain a permit under chapter 18 prior to construction.

Since WDEQ has not issued permits under the chapter 18 regulations, no Wyoming permits are part of the permit program record under review. In accordance with RCRA sections 4005(d)(3)(A) and 4005(d)(6), in the absence of a permit issued under an approved State program, the owner or operator of a CCR unit must continue to comply with the Federal CCR regulations until a permit from an approved State is issued. 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(3)(A), (d)(6). Any permits issued after approval will be subject to program review provisions required by RCRA sections 4005(d)(1)(D)(i) and 4005(d)(1)(D)(ii). 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(D)(i), (ii).

VI. Proposed Action

EPA has preliminarily determined that the Wyoming partial CCR permit program meets the statutory standard for approval. Therefore, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 6945(d), EPA is proposing to approve the Wyoming partial CCR permit program.",https://www.federalregister.gov/assets/open_graph_site_banner.png,N,,2025-08-30 12:05:07.654753

The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state.
Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.
Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the power to implement a penalty but has not done so since it was given that authority in 2023.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state. It created an independent division at the commission to oversee the oil and gas industry and provide guidance to the state on its energy transition.

Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.

“When Governor Newsom signed this legislation two years ago, he promised that we would utilize the new transparency tools to look under the hood of our oil and gas market that had been a black box for decades,” spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in a statement. “We did exactly that.”

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission has not determined what would count as an excessive profit under the policy.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting towards more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://www.counton2.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/08/68b2129730e247.69368693.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 12:06:20.605618

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

The cut includes $39.3 million for the Fairwinds Landing offshore wind and maritime logistics hub at the former Lambert’s Point Docks in Norfolk and another $20 million for improvements at Portsmouth Marine Terminal, which is a staging area for Dominion Energy’s under-construction wind farm off the shore of Virginia Beach.

Democratic leaders spoke out against the funding withdrawal on Friday. U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, representing Virginia, and U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, representing Hampton Roads, jointly emailed a statement on Friday that said the money was also intended to invest in maritime supply chains and port infrastructure to support not only clean energy but also shipbuilding and repair, and that they would work with their colleagues, state officials and other partners in the region to urge the Trump administration to reverse its decision.

“Stopping this project makes no sense, hurts our economy, and is completely counterproductive to the Administration’s so-called efforts to ‘restore America’s maritime dominance,'” they said.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

EVs often promise lower fueling and maintenance costs, while hybrids have a more affordable purchase price. When asked which one was cheaper, ChatGPT said it’s not as straightforward as you might think.

Here’s a price comparison between EVs and hybrids, according to ChatGPT.

Purchase Price

The biggest car expense is its initial purchase price. ChatGPT pointed out that hybrids are generally cheaper to buy. The difference in price is largely due to battery costs, which make up almost a third of the price of a new EV, according to the Stanford Report.

Data from Kelley Blue Book shows that the cheapest starting price for an EV is $26,795, while hybrids start at $21,900.

Be Aware: I Asked ChatGPT Which Hybrid Vehicles To Stay Away From Buying: Here’s What It Said

Fuel and Energy Costs

EVs offer much lower fuel costs compared with hybrids, ChatGPT said. A hybrid combines a gas engine with an electric motor and a small battery, while electric-only vehicles rely solely on a larger battery and an electric motor.

According to Consumer Reports, the annual fuel cost for a hybrid is $300 to $800 less than that of a gas-only car, while EV owners pay about $1,300 less. Based on this data, EV owners pay roughly $500 to $1,000 less per year on fuel compared with hybrid drivers.

Maintenance

ChatGPT pointed out that EVs usually have lower maintenance costs due to fewer moving parts. EVs don’t need oil changes, but they do need brake pad replacements, although not as often due to regenerative braking. The highest maintenance cost is the battery; however, many manufacturers provide a warranty for the first eight years or 100,000 miles, CarEdge reported.

On the other hand, hybrids still have internal combustion components, so you’ll still need regular oil changes and part replacements on roughly the same maintenance schedule as gas-powered cars.

On a per-mile basis, EV maintenance and repairs are typically 40% lower than comparable gas vehicles, reported the National Resources Defense Council.

Incentives and Tax Credits

According to the IRS, buyers of new EVs can currently get up to $7,500 in federal tax credits, while used models may be eligible for $4,000. This also applies to plug-in hybrids. Standard hybrids do not qualify for the tax credit.

These tax credits can improve EV affordability, but they’re set to expire on Sept. 30, 2025, under President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Vnl3dPwxH6znN192dtBfBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gobankingrates_644/a599228de6616a2733d6c7be1b4589e2,N,,2025-08-30 11:00:50.295652

“It’s very uneasy not knowing who’s going to take over the lease,” Leonard said.","Homeowners who signed long-term lease agreements with solar panel installer PosiGen are searching for answers after the Louisiana-based company laid off hundreds of workers and ceased most of its operations.

PosiGen, which has offices in seven states and is Louisiana’s largest solar company, notified state and local officials on Monday that it was laying off 166 employees at its facilities in Jefferson and St. Charles parishes, saying it defaulted on a credit line and couldn't raise the long-term capital it needed amid rollbacks in federal renewable energy tax credits.

The news came as a shock to Iwona Leonard, who recently signed a 20-year lease agreement with PosiGen and had solar panels installed on the roof of her double in the Lower Garden District just last week.

Leonard said the person she reached on PosiGen’s customer service hotline told her they were “waiting for more information from the higher ups” on what the restructuring meant for customers.

“I’m very nervous,” Leonard said.

PosiGen's founder and executive chairman, Tom Neyhart, did not respond to calls, texts and emails. Messages left with contacts listed in the company’s state filings were also not returned.

Founded in 2011, PosiGen specializes in marketing solar energy systems to low- to moderate-income households and rode a wave of state and federal solar credits that allowed it to grow quickly for much of the past decade.

But it said its ability to secure new investments, which were needed to fund recent expansions, were hampered by the passage in July of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, which cancels certain renewable energy tax credits starting next year.

In early August, the Trump administration also terminated $7 billion in grants aimed at expanding access to solar energy for disadvantaged communities. Louisiana was awarded $156 million through the Solar for All program last year but was still waiting for federal approval of its workplan.

According to a letter to employees from CEO Peter Shaper that was obtained by trade publication Solar Power World, PosiGen wasn't able to obtain enough financing to continue operating and would ""dramatically reduce"" the size of its workforce.

Jeff Cantin, who is the CEO of another New Orleans panel installer, Solar Alternatives, and also serves as board president of the Gulf States Renewable Energy Industries Association, said some companies were preparing for the roll out of the federal grant program. PosiGen, he said, may have been left in a bind when it was canceled.

“The government created a program, announced it, started rolling it out, asked businesses to scale up for it and then pulled the rug out from under it,” said Cantin. “It’s fine if the administration wants to change priorities, but they need to acknowledge that businesses have responded to the government and need time to adapt.”

Under her contract with PosiGen, Leonard agreed to pay $60 per month each for two sets of solar panels, with no upfront cost and payments increasing $1 a year for the next 20 years.

In return, Leonard would be able to use the power generated to offset her electricity bill, which she said can sometimes cost as much as $600 per month. Entergy New Orleans also credits residents with rooftop solar for the excess power they produce for the grid.

Leonard is still waiting for Entergy and the city of New Orleans to inspect the panels. After that, PosiGen said it would turn them on remotely and begin sending her a monthly bill.

It’s unclear what comes next for PosiGen. The company told state officials that an additional 92 employees in Louisiana could be laid off in the next two weeks if it can't find additional funding or a way to sell what remains of its business.

The bill's removal of incentives is expected to slow EV sales growth and increase reliance on manufacturer discounts and deals.

Building a domestic battery supply chain and expanding charging infrastructure are key challenges for the EV industry's future.

“I know he’d give me a discount,” said President Donald Trump moments before buying an $80,000 red Tesla from Elon Musk at the White House lawn on March 11. “But I want to pay full price.”

And full price, he decreed, is what everyone shall pay. Enacted July 4, Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends federal tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) by the end of September and tax breaks for American battery manufacturers in 2030. And the uncertainty has already caused the industry to lose steam.

More clean energy projects were cancelled in the first quarter of 2025 than the past two years combined, according to research group Atlas Public Policy. Since January, these cancellations and downsized projects have amounted to roughly $14 billion in abandoned investments, including a $1 billion factory planned to produce thermal barriers for batteries in Statesboro, Georgia.

As for what these setbacks mean for a state that rolled out a red carpet worth billions of dollars in tax breaks for EV manufacturing plants, intended to become the Gov. Brian Kemp-proclaimed “electric vehicle capital of America” by the end of his second term, industry leaders seem reluctant to show signs of defeat.

In EV press conferences and roadshows across Georgia this month, public officials and manufacturers brushed aside Washington’s setbacks and boasted the industry’s growth, which they claim is headed towards an independent supply chain that will rely less on federal crutches.

“The tax credits played a purpose, but that purpose may be over,” said Georgia Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols in an interview. “We may not need a subsidy in the future.”

But Georgia's EV independence will likely rely on the success of bringing the moving parts closer to home.

“We must develop an American critical mineral supply chain,” said nonprofit Electrification Coalition Policy Manager Skye Golann in the opening speech of an Aug. 7 press briefing, How EV Investments Are Powering Prosperity in Georgia.

One Big Beautiful Bill Act expected to slow EV growth

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August 2022 provided tax credits, subsidies and incentives for the purchasing and manufacturing of EVs and their charging facilities.

Since then, “investments in batteries, fueling equipment, and critical minerals refining and processing have each grown at least three-fold,” according to a 2024 report by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Many of Georgia's own plants have been propped up by federal aid. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy granted $178 million for the construction of Solvay Specialty Polymers' battery-grade polyvinylidene fluoride facility in Augusta. Last year, the DOE awarded $80 million to Fort Valley-based Blue Bird for its electric school bus manufacturing and workforce development.

And Georgia appears to have played its hand right.

“The last few years is where we've really started to see [EV purchases] tick up” in the U.S., said Cox Automotive Director of Industry Insights Stephanie Streaty — a growth also spurred by an IRA credit offering a $7,500 discount for a new EV and $4,000 or 30% for a used EV. Last year ""was a record year of 1.3 million EVs” sold, she added.

EVs are cheaper than ever, said Echols. The Georgia Clean Energy Roadshow he hosted at Savannah Technical College on Aug. 12 featured over 60 vehicles, including one of the City of Savannah's Nissan Leafs, starting at about $30,000. When Echols first began the roadshow 15 years ago, only the Tesla Roadster was on display, worth more than $100,000 at the time.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will remove those incentives that undercut EV prices, already too expensive for many consumers. This year, the average EV transaction was $10,000 more expensive compared to a gas vehicle, according to Cox Automotive data.

“The biggest barrier still is price,” said Streaty.

Before the passing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Cox Automotive predicted that EVs would make up 10% of all cars sold for 2025, up 2% from last year. But now, “you have tariffs, you have interest rates, all these headwinds, and so we adjusted that to 8.5%,” said Streaty.

“Taking away the federal tax credits will dampen some of the growth,” said Golann in an interview. “I certainly think that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a setback for EVs.”

Battery boom... or bust

But the biggest bet for EV stakeholders is likely the battery itself.

Lithium-ion batteries — notoriously expensive to mine, process and transport — could make up 40% the cost of the car, said Streaty. China still dominates the battery's mineral processing, Golan admitted in an interview. But “we've seen new mines, whether in North Carolina or Nevada... what we like to see is developing those supply chains in the U.S.” The U.S. is home to just 1% of the world’s lithium reserves, according to the World Economic Forum.

General Motors has already began building out its American operations, including in Georgia. On Aug. 6, GM announced plans to co-manufacture six EV models with Hyundai, including an electric van for the North American market. A day later, it inked a deal to import Chinese batteries that will “function as a stopgap"" until it can build its own lithium batteries at lower cost in the U.S., according to the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.

About half of Kia’s manufacturing for EV and gas vehicles remains overseas, said Kia's Head of Department Corporate Services and Information Technology Ted Arnold. But Hyundai, a parent company of Kia, is in the process of ""bringing those suppliers locally so that we don't have to import,"" he added.

“We're definitely going to see the battery supply chain start to build out in the U.S.,” echoed Streaty.

But time is ticking before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends the 45X tax credit for U.S. battery manufacturers in five years — a move that will cede growth to other countries, such as China, Mexico, Canada and members of the European Union, according to think tank Energy Innovation.

And many of Georgia's battery manufacturing prospects have already abandoned ship earlier this year.

In January, Norway-based Freyr Battery called off of a battery manufacturing plant in Newnan, it stated in a letter to Coweta County. In February, Aspen Aerogels told investors it halted construction of its second plant manufacturing thermal barriers for EV batteries in Statesboro, and will instead increase production in China, Latitude Media reported. In March, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America President José Muñoz announced an expansion focused on hybrid vehicles at its grand opening, a diversion from its expected all-electric operations.

While this year may end up being the beginning of a bad run, many EV proponents like Streaty are still all-in and holding onto hope that manufacturers will take advantage of the tax break before it ends.

""The IRA 45x reduction credit doesn't sunset until 2030, so I think that's a glimmer of light,"" said Streaty.

The road will be long for EV manufacturers to plant manufacturing more firmly in American soil.

Domestic and statewide supply chain growth ""will take some time,” said Golann. And in the meantime, manufacturers themselves will likely have to push their own deals to make up for today’s price differences. Although Trump can snub a discount for an EV, the average consumer might rely on it.

“Now that the IRA is going away, dealers are really getting aggressive,” said Streaty. Expect more rebates, deals and discounts. Manufacturers have “already spent the money to build the assembly lines and the factories,” said Echols “They're going to want to put incentives on those cars.”

But at some point, EVs “need to be able to sell on their own,"" said Streaty — without the constant incentives.

Now, a team of climate communication experts – including many members of the former climate.gov team – is working to resurrect its content into a new organization with an expanded mission.
“The things that were most popular on climate.gov were things that basically just taught people about climate, both natural climate and climate change,” said Lindsey.
“By carrying on the legacy of climate.gov and actually trying to republish the most vital parts of climate.gov, we hope that we can be a cornerstone,” said Lindsey.
And climate science is the only way to understand and adapt to what is happening on our big beautiful planet.”","Earlier this summer, access to climate.gov – one of the most widely used portals of climate information on the internet – was thwarted by the Trump administration, and its production team was fired in the process.

The website offered years’ worth of accessibly written material on climate science. The site is technically still online but has been intentionally buried by the team of political appointees who now run the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Now, a team of climate communication experts – including many members of the former climate.gov team – is working to resurrect its content into a new organization with an expanded mission.

Their effort’s new website, climate.us, would not only offer public-facing interpretations of climate science, but could also begin to directly offer climate-related services, such as assisting local governments with mapping increased flooding risk due to climate change.

The effort is being led by climate.gov’s former managing editor, Rebecca Lindsey, who, although now unemployed, has recruited several of her former colleagues to volunteer their time in an attempt to build climate.us into a thriving non-profit organization.

“A lot of federal employees are grieving over the sense that they’ve not just lost a job, but a vocation,” said Lindsey. “None of us were ready to let go of climate.gov and the mission.”

In the first few weeks after the Trump administration ended their work, Lindsey’s new team has received a steady flow of outside support, including legal support, and a short-term grant that has helped them develop a vision for what they’d like to do next.

“The things that were most popular on climate.gov were things that basically just taught people about climate, both natural climate and climate change,” said Lindsey. “There is a need for content that helps people achieve basic climate literacy independent of an agency.”

As multi-year veterans of the federal bureaucracy, at times they’ve been surprised by the possibilities that the new effort might offer.

“We’re allowed to use TikTok now,” said Lindsey. “We’re allowed to have a little bit of fun. We have a group chat. We’re diving into things that are not part of our wheelhouse.”

The climate.us team is also in the process of soft-launching a crowdsourced fundraising drive that Lindsey hopes they can leverage into more permanent support from a major foundation. Lindsey also set up an email address to contact the team to offer in-kind support.

“Someone bought our domain name for us. And we have somebody that’s volunteered web hosting space for this phase. But we do not yet have the sort of large operational funding that we will need if we’re going to actually transition climate.gov operations to the nonprofit space.”

In the meantime, Lindsey and her team have found themselves spending the summer knee-deep in the logistics of building a major non-profit from scratch.

“We’ve all had to let go of the 9-5 mentality and basically try to do things as quickly as possible,” said one member of Lindsey’s new team who previously worked with her at climate.gov but asked not to be named for fear of retribution.

“By carrying on the legacy of climate.gov and actually trying to republish the most vital parts of climate.gov, we hope that we can be a cornerstone,” said Lindsey. “We hope that it will provide a critical mass that will attract other partners who want to be part of the effort.”

Given the context of why Lindsey is doing this work at this time and in this way, it has been an emotional summer. The effort has the sheen of equal parts science journalism and a cathartic personal vendetta against an administration that has all but declared war on federal science efforts.

“We’ve been optimistic and alternating between being energized and feeling like this is a good thing and we’re on the right path and then, of course, being terrified that we’re not going to be able to pull it off and six months is going to have passed and we all should have been looking for new jobs and we didn’t,” said Lindsey.

“What’s happening can feel so overwhelming that it’s easy to feel like you’re powerless to do anything about it,” said Lindsey’s team member. “But sometimes you have to just look out and see what’s within your reach. And this problem is within our reach, so we just see it as sort of doing our part.”

Lindsey also told the Guardian that all the content for climate.gov is still up if you know where to look, which when she found that out, made her even more upset.

“This is information that the taxpayers have already paid for,” said Lindsey. “This administration is trying to hide it and take it away from us. It’s an abuse of government. It’s a waste of resources. People should be indignant. That’s not the way the government should work.”

“I think it’s important for this initiative to persist even past this crowdfunding phase,” said another part-time contributor to the project, who wished to remain anonymous because they are still an employee of the federal government.

“Whether people realize it or not, climate change impacts everyone, regardless of the current political environment. And climate science is the only way to understand and adapt to what is happening on our big beautiful planet.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f255e59b1df9494d2bf782873fac2de0e22a1656/443_0_4465_3572/master/4465.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cc3faab5a281ae982355cfdd298c7c48",N,,2025-08-30 08:00:13.328176

Two weeks later, the Trump administration abruptly halted construction on Revolution Wind, a project already 80% completed and set to begin delivering power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in mid-2026.
Revolution Wind did not appear at risk, having already begun construction soon after receiving its final federal permit in November 2023.
“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday.
“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.","Limited power supply in extreme weather events, rising and unpredictable utility bills and thousands of union laborers without work.

That’s the dire picture of Rhode Island’s future without more offshore wind energy, Christopher Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, said in an Aug. 8 affidavit submitted to federal court in Massachusetts.

Two weeks later, the Trump administration abruptly halted construction on Revolution Wind, a project already 80% completed and set to begin delivering power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in mid-2026. Predictions of economic and environmental harms quickly solidified, leaving workers stranded at sea, regional grid reliability under threat and state decarbonization mandates potentially out of reach.

“The invocation of the Wind Memorandum to issue a Stop Work Order for the fully permitted Revolution Wind project as it nears completion will harm Rhode Island, its residents, our strong labor workforce, and our offshore wind and related industries,” Kearns wrote in a second affidavit on Aug 28. “Moreover, it will harm our efforts to diversify our energy system and increase reliability.”

The consequences for Rhode Island’s only commercial offshore wind project will feature heavily in a Sept. 4 federal court hearing, where a group of 18 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, will ask U.S. District Judge William Young of Massachusetts to throw out the Trump administration’s Jan. 20 executive order halting reviews of offshore wind projects.

“The Revolution stop-work order provides another example of the harmful effects of Defendants’ arbitrary decision to adopt and implement the Wind Directive to stop wind-energy development in our States,” the AGs wrote in an Aug. 28 court filing. “And it underscores the importance of prompt vacatur of that decision to enable projects in and beyond the permitting pipeline to proceed toward development.”

The court hearing in Boston was scheduled two months before the Revolution Wind project was suddenly put in jeopardy, prompted by a multistate lawsuit filed in May against the Trump administration. The initial complaint centered on offshore wind projects still awaiting federal approvals, like the SouthCoast Wind project proposed off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, from which Rhode Island is also in negotiations to buy power.

Revolution Wind did not appear at risk, having already begun construction soon after receiving its final federal permit in November 2023.

Stuck in limbo

Little comfort now to the dozen millwrights idled aboard Wind Scylla in Rhode Island Sound for over a week, who were building turbines when the stop work order came through.

“We’re still waiting for an answer from the companies and the contractors on what’s going on,” Evan Wytas, business representative for Millwrights Local 1121, said in an interview Friday morning. “We haven’t gotten any word that they are on their way back, or when that will be.”

Meanwhile, another two dozen union trade workers scheduled to head out to the construction site Aug. 28 are still on land, waiting by the phone for the call that they can head to work, said Erica Hammond, legislative director for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO.

Workers are still getting paid for now, Hammond confirmed, though those who remain onshore much longer might have to file for unemployment, depending on the specific details of their contracts.

“It is very frustrating,” Hammond said. “To stop now, in the case of this specific project, it’s a waste of resources.”

More than 1,000 union workers have spent the last two years building the 65-turbine project, 40 of which have been installed, as well as a pair of substations that will connect the power supply to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity is enough to power 350,000 homes across both states, equal to 2.5% of the electricity load throughout New England, Kearns said in his affidavit.

The renewable electricity supply has already been baked into Rhode Island’s clean energy portfolio and is crucial to meeting the 2021 Act on Climate Law, which mandates net-zero emissions by 2050 with incremental, legally enforceable benchmarks that kick in at the end of the decade.

Orsted, the Danish company co-developing the project, pledged to explore solutions to resume work, including potential litigation, while exploring the financial implications for its $4 billion project. The company is seeking to raise another $9.4 billion from its shareholders, confirming Friday that its majority stakeholder, the Danish government, has agreed to the share sale. The fundraising plan was unveiled in the company’s Aug. 11 quarterly earnings release, before work was forced to stop on Revolution Wind.

“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday. “The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Orsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Orsted’s US offshore wind portfolio.”

The Revolution Wind project was expected to bring in $156.7 million in net income for the company each year once operational, the company said. An “extraordinary general meeting” is scheduled for Sept. 5 to receive board approval for the share sale.

Neronha’s office is also considering additional legal action, but had not filed anything as of Friday. He’s focused on the existing multistate lawsuit challenging federal actions on offshore wind.

“Revolution Wind, a renewable energy project that is right at the finish line, and which would add 400MW to our clean energy portfolio, must move forward,” Neronha said in a statement Friday. “Billions in investment, more than 1,000 jobs, and an energy future that helps, not hurts, generations to come, are all on the line. For this reason, we formally notified the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts of the President’s unlawful stop work order and the harm it will cause to Rhode Islanders. We cannot allow this Administration to stop this project, and we will continue to explore additional legal avenues to prevent them from doing so.”

DOT yanks port funding

The U.S. Department of Transportation announced Friday it was pulling $679 million in federal infrastructure grants tied to 12 “doomed” offshore wind projects across the country. Among the casualties: an $11.2 million grant for Quonset Development Corp. to upgrade its port, improving terminal access for offshore wind projects along with strengthening resiliency against sea level rise.

“The Quonset Development Corporation is disappointed by this decision but understands that this administration is working to fund projects in line with its current policy priorities,” Steven King, managing director for the quasi-public state agency, said in an emailed response Friday. “Given that the Quonset Business Park’s 250 companies work broadly across nearly every sector of the economy, including in shipbuilding, we believe there is common ground to pursue and look forward to working together on new grant projects that align with the administration’s objectives and that grow the economy.”

Gov. Dan McKee was not as forgiving.

“This decision undermines progress on critical infrastructure and threatens Rhode Island’s economic and energy future,” McKee said in a statement late Friday afternoon. “The Port of Davisville and the broader Quonset Business Park are vital hubs for manufacturing, shipping, and energy, including the state’s offshore wind industry. This funding would have modernized port infrastructure and expanded cargo capacity. By withdrawing it, the Trump administration is undermining a high-performing port that drives real economic output, strengthens regional supply chains, and plays a central role in advancing energy and long-term growth for Rhode Island and across the Northeast.”

The Sept. 4 hearing in Boston will also give the federal agencies and cabinet directors named as defendants a chance to present their own arguments on why the lawsuit should be tossed. Adam Gustafson, acting assistant U.S. Attorney General, defended the federal administration’s pause on offshore wind projects in an Aug. 8 memo, citing “potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews.”

Gustafson argued that states lacked the jurisdiction to challenge federal review powers, at least on a universal basis. He asked the judge to rule in favor of the defendants, or to limit orders to specific projects and permits, rather than a blanket ruling denying federal review power over offshore wind as a whole.

“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.

Judge Young is unlikely to make a decision on the dueling motions at the Sept. 4 hearing. A ruling will come at a later, unscheduled date.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

Last week, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club and Environmental Integrity Project filed a lawsuit against DEQ for granting Venture Global a Clean Air Act permit for the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG facility, according to a joint news release from the organizations.
""We fear that CP2 LNG will be more of the same — more air pollution that is making us sick.
When The Advocate reached out to Venture Global, the company did not respond.
""The other problem is that it, not just for the people who are going to be directly breathing it, will contribute to the entire area having air quality violations.","Three environmental groups have joined forces to file a lawsuit against the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regarding a permit for a new liquefied natural gas facility in Cameron Parish.

Last week, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club and Environmental Integrity Project filed a lawsuit against DEQ for granting Venture Global a Clean Air Act permit for the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG facility, according to a joint news release from the organizations.

“Venture Global has a long history of noncompliance with regards to its Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal,” Cameron Parish resident and Sierra Club member John Allaire said in the release. “This company has been a bad neighbor and continually pollutes the air we breathe, while generating billions of dollars in profits.

""We fear that CP2 LNG will be more of the same — more air pollution that is making us sick. It is time for LDEQ to do its job and protect people, not corporate profits.”

DEQ Communications Director Greg Langley told The Advocate the agency does not comment on pending litigation. When The Advocate reached out to Venture Global, the company did not respond.

David Bookbinder, director of Law and Policy for Environmental Integrity Project, said the complaint is centered around the belief that CP2 will emit more pollution than DEQ assumed and will have air quality violations, as well as the fact that some of the permit limits are more lenient than justified for different pollutants.

""We're dealing with a facility that's going to be emitting many, many, many tons of pollutants and … the local impact on people who are directly breathing the air is going to be bad,"" Bookbinder said. ""The other problem is that it, not just for the people who are going to be directly breathing it, will contribute to the entire area having air quality violations. It mucks up people's air.""

The facility, which will be one of the largest LNG plants in the nation, would export 20 million metric tons of LNG per year, according to the release. The estimated life cycle greenhouse gas from the methane gas would be more than the annual emissions of 47 million gas-powered cars, the release states.

Construction started on CP2 this summer, and the facility is expected to begin LNG production in 2027.

Allaire, a former oil industry worker, said he and the organizations are upset that the state would grant CP2 a Clean Air Act permit based on the compliance history of Venture Global at Calcasieu Pass, which began operating in 2022.

During its first calendar year of operation, the Calcasieu Pass LNG facility had at least 139 incidents where it exceeded the hourly emission limits of its air permits, The Advocate previously reported. In addition, DEQ granted the facility an increase in its allowed emissions in 2023.

Bookbinder said the next steps for the lawsuit will be the court reaching out within a couple of weeks to provide a schedule to submit all the preliminary paperwork, and about two months later it will release a schedule for briefing.

From there, there will be arguments and then a decision, ""hopefully by the end of 2026,"" Bookbinder said.

Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said that overall the permit is flawed and that is what they would like to see fixed.

""The Department of Environmental Quality does not have a realistic assessment of this facility that they're letting them get away with putting whatever they want on paper and not really tending to the Clean Air Act,"" Rolfes said. ""Our goal would be to get a real serious permit on this facility. I do believe that if you took an honest look at the emissions and at the area and the burden it's already bearing, that they could never get a permit because the pollution there is already too intense.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/86/18631a50-4286-57fa-95c2-22a35d6d84fa/68b22b21d400c.image.png?crop=960%2C504%2C0%2C108,N,,2025-08-30 13:05:24.339327

I moved to Colorado because I wanted to live in a place where community, economic opportunity and the outdoors all come together. I’ve hiked across the Rockies, talked energy policy on front porches, and helped small business owners explore how solar might lower their operational costs. One thing is clear: Coloradans care deeply about where their energy comes from, and the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) right now has the opportunity to give Coloradans what they want.

Since 2022, rooftop solar has surged across the state. Thanks in part to federal tax credits that were expanded and extended in the Inflation Reduction Act, Colorado has deployed 4,508 MW of solar, powering over 900,000 homes. Jobs in the solar sector are growing — not just in big cities like Denver and Colorado Springs, but all over the state.

Now, with the elimination of solar tax credits in the recently signed “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” that federal support is gone. It’s a devastating blow to an industry that was just hitting its stride, made worse by the fact that four Colorado Representatives — Jeff Hurd, Gabe Evans, Lauren Boebert and Jeff Crank — voted to advance this legislation. They abandoned the very constituents who believed in their promises of energy independence and economic resilience.

But solar won’t stop here.

The elimination of federal incentives forces us to think bigger and act locally. This is Colorado’s moment to lead, and we can do that through community solar programs and decentralized electricity generation systems — what are known as Distributed Power Plants. These are proven solutions that can deliver the benefits of solar energy even without federal support.

Community solar allows renters, condo owners and anyone without suitable rooftops to access renewable energy, spreading costs and benefits across entire communities. Distributed power plants coordinate community solar and battery systems to respond to grid needs in real time, acting like a single large power plant — while reducing the need for expensive peaker plants.

Colorado already has a strong foundation for this work. In 2010, Colorado became the first state to enable community solar with the Community Solar Gardens Act, requiring the state’s two major utility companies — Xcel Energy and Black Hills Energy — to purchase electricity from community solar gardens starting in 2026.

Now Colorado is ready to take the next leap forward with Distributed Power Plants. They can provide grid services, reduce peak demand and give homeowners new ways to earn money from their energy investments while making the entire system more reliable, and making solar more accessible to low- and moderate-income households. From Utah to Massachusetts, Distributed Power Plants are working hard for the grid in diverse locations around the country, and it’s time for Colorado to become a leader in pursuing this energy opportunity.

The details of how these programs will work are being decided right now. On August 26, the Colorado PUC held a virtual public comment hearing on Distributed Power Plant programs. This is our chance to ensure these programs are as accessible and beneficial as possible, serving those they stand to impact most — Colorado families and communities.

Colorado has always been ahead of the curve on clean energy — not because it’s trendy, but because it’s practical. In Boulder and Alamosa, on the Western Slope and in suburban Jefferson County, families go solar because it works — lowering bills, keeping dollars in local economies, and providing resilience during wildfires, heatwaves and winter outages. That demand hasn’t disappeared just because Congress failed to act.

It’s time for Colorado to show the nation what energy independence looks like: community-powered, locally controlled and resilient by design. Our representatives in Congress may have let us down, but our state and local leaders still have the chance to lead.

The solar revolution isn’t over. It’s just getting started — one community at a time.

The first report in this assessment cycle on climate and cities is due in 2027, and there are five U.S. authors involved.
“I’m not concerned about fewer U.S. authors, because it’s made space for other folks,” she said.
Such political actors spread disinformation on climate science and vaccine science, undermining public trust in science and government and threatening democracy itself, the scientists warn in the book.","Even as the U.S. federal government rapidly retreats from science-based decision-making, adopts climate-damaging energy policies and disengages from international climate efforts, 46 American researchers have been chosen as authors for the upcoming three main global climate reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The number of U.S. scientists working on the IPCC reports has decreased markedly over the past decade, from 210 during the panel’s 5th assessment cycle to 46 in the current cycle, according to the panel’s records. But there are still more Americans or scientists with dual citizenship and U.S. university affiliations contributing to the reports than from any other country.

Former NASA chief scientist and senior climate adviser Katherine Calvin, whose role with the international panel was unclear after the Trump administration fired her from the federal agency, is among them. She will co-chair one of the three main assessment groups, IPCC Chair Jim Skea said last week.

“Kate is there and we see no route to her leaving that role in the future,” he said. Calvin, a climate modeling expert, made significant contributions to previous IPCC reports, he added, and will now help guide the structure and direction of the entire climate mitigation working group, with 222 scientists, including 15 other U.S. climate researchers.

The IPCC is the United Nations body responsible for assessing climate science and issuing reports every three to five years to guide government climate policies.

U.S. scientific agencies and their Earth observation programs from satellites were foundational to the IPCC’s earliest reports, in 1990 and 1995, as were U.S. ground- and ocean-based measurements of temperature increases, sea level rise and polar and mountain ice melt.

Measurements developed by U.S. researchers in Hawaii in the 1950s revealed a rapid, steady increase in heat-trapping atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, lending the IPCC’s work a sense of urgency since its establishment in 1988.

And it was a U.S. scientist who helped shape one of the IPCC’s most significant findings in 1994, when the panel concluded that the balance of scientific evidence “suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.”

The IPCC’s influence on global climate policy increased with its 2014 report, the scientific basis for the Paris climate agreement’s goal of limiting warming.

The IPCC has announced a total of 664 authors for the current assessment cycle. For the first time, there are more authors, 51 percent, from developing and emerging-economy countries than from developed countries. The percentage of female authors increased from 33 percent in the last cycle to 44 percent, bringing the IPCC closer to its goal of gender and geographic parity, Skea said.

“You’re seeing many more people providing strong scientific contributions from what you might call the emerging scientific countries, like China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Kenya,” Skea said. “They’re all coming through the system in much greater numbers, which can only be a good thing.”

In the context of the IPCC’s mission to synthesize global climate science, he also noted an increased proportion of scientific literature coming from Europe, China and India in recent years.

The first report in this assessment cycle on climate and cities is due in 2027, and there are five U.S. authors involved. Despite the lack of federal funding, they’ve been able to use philanthropic support to attend lead author meetings in person, rather than simply participating online, Skea said.

Strong Science Institutions Support Democracy

U.S. turnout for the IPCC is a sign that the science community is working to bolster institutional strength and resilience in the face of increasingly hostile political winds, said Rutgers University human-ecology professor Pamela McElwee, who helped coordinate the nomination process for U.S. scientists after the U.S. Department of State canceled the official federal process.

The drop in the number of U.S. authors for the latest round of IPCC reports can’t just be attributed to the lack of federal support, said McElwee, who will co-author a chapter in an upcoming report focusing partly on anti-science policies and climate disinformation.

“I’m not concerned about fewer U.S. authors, because it’s made space for other folks,” she said. “But I am concerned that the authors that were selected get support, and are not told by the federal government in any way, shape or form, what it is that they’re allowed to do.”

Despite the absence of the usual federal nomination process, the total number of U.S. scientists was as high as in the previous cycle, which was during the first Trump administration, thanks to an effort by 10 U.S. universities with official IPCC observer status and the American Geophysical Union, which presented a “nice united front” of scientific solidarity, McElwee said.

That effort included a web portal for nominations, established in late February and early March amid uncertainty about whether a federal nomination process would be in place before the IPCC deadline.

The U.S. science community is also organizing at other levels, including coordinating a response to a climate report issued by the U.S. Department of Energy several weeks ago, she said.

The AGU and the American Meteorological Society have also teamed up to publish a collection of papers to update information from a National Climate Assessment formerly compiled and issued by the federal government but canceled by the Trump administration.

Another group of international scientists is networking to establish independent, distributed systems for storing and sharing scientific information, specifically aimed at protecting science from authoritarian threats.

The threats come from oligarchs acting in their own financial self-interest and that of their political allies, which are often nationalist, populist and authoritarian parties and governments worldwide, University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann and Baylor University health researcher Peter Hotez write in a new book. “Science Under Siege: How to Fight the Five Most Powerful Forces that Threaten Our World” is scheduled for release in early September.

Such political actors spread disinformation on climate science and vaccine science, undermining public trust in science and government and threatening democracy itself, the scientists warn in the book.

“While it may be inconvenient to the current administration, the U.S. does have some of the leading climate scientists in the world, and they will continue to find a way to do and communicate the science regardless of the oppressive political regime,” Mann said.

Former IPCC member Richard Alley, an ice researcher and professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, noted that scientists can spend hundreds of hours on IPCC work, and most of it is volunteer time.

“An IPCC report represents a lot of lost sleep and missed milestones at home while the scientists are laboring to put it together, while still continuing to teach, discover and serve in other ways,” he said.

McElwee said she sees both hopeful and troubling signs for science in the future.

International collaboration remains strong, with U.S. participation, and science is becoming increasingly global and inclusive of Indigenous knowledge, as well as doing more interdisciplinary work to identify the links between social and physical sciences.

On the other hand, the threats are very real, especially in the United States right now, she said, noting that the current administration has said it may rewrite existing reports that have met all scientific standards for accuracy.

That level of threat to scientific integrity calls for a strong response, and researchers in relatively safe positions with academic tenure should step forward first, she said.

Staying engaged in international scientific efforts and helping others do the same is her way of working to protect democratic norms. But she’s discouraged by watching the erosion of those norms.

“I’m increasingly looking at this and saying, what’s the point of being a scientist in a country that doesn’t have rule of law or doesn’t accept the truth of scientific experimentation,” she said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IPCC-62nd-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:06:01.163518

It sparked frustration among electric vehicle drivers and raised concerns about how charger vandalism can slow the shift away from gasoline and diesel.

At many public stations, the screen is the main way to start and pay. Many networks let members start a charge with an account login or RFID card, but guests often depend on the on-screen unit. Damaged screens can leave drivers stranded, and isolated vandalism can undermine confidence in the network when reliability is critical.

Even accounting for manufacturing and battery production, EVs generate less lifetime heat-trapping pollution than gasoline vehicles. Research on battery metals found that mining for materials like lithium has a smaller footprint than the billions of tons of dirty energy — gas, coal, and oil — extracted each year. Driving an EV still reduces pollution over a vehicle's life.

Screens aren't the only targets. In Minnesota, officials reported over 80 damaged charging stations since public installation. These setbacks are also happening worldwide; in the U.K., vandals cut multiple public chargers, and a Glasgow vandalism case showed similar damage.

Some cut charging cords to steal copper wiring for resale; other incidents show no obvious motive. Elsewhere, gas-powered cars blocked chargers, preventing EV drivers from using them at all.

Whether for profit or mischief, vandalism makes a station unusable, inconveniencing drivers. Each case chips away at public trust and creates another barrier to choosing an EV.

As such, some drivers sidestep public chargers entirely by installing home solar and charging where they live. EnergySage's tools can help those looking to invest in solar power by comparing options and costs.

""Blink chargers around here used to be out of service all the time due to broken screens. It was really annoying,"" one commenter wrote.

They noted that smaller-screen units are especially vulnerable to damage. While Blink network users can just use their app or card, they added, ""For guest users it make the charger unusable though.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rFxcvtJZrIb42QJhioKTVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02ODg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/5c0894bc5ad1c06880305f90b2451196,N,,2025-08-30 08:59:31.995121

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

The notion that renewable energy is eating up cropland is a myth.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright stopped in Iowa this month and proclaimed that it’s time for the state’s wind energy industry to stand on its own.
“I think it’s the right time to sunset them,” Wright said of tax incentives for wind energy projects.
But even Sen. Chuck Grassley, the “father of wind energy” appears to be falling in line by accepting Trump’s mistake.","Recently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that federal funding for wind and solar energy projects will be slashed.

The reason? USDA says the agency is more interested in the potential for projects to be built on “prime farmland” than in promoting renewable energy. A press release said the agency’s goal is to end support of “unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources.”

That criticism rings hollow in Iowa, where nearly 60% of the state's electricity comes from wind, more than any other state. The solar industry is also developing. And Iowa’s renewable energy prominence has been a key factor in attracting companies to the state.

Iowa's farmers will lose critical funding opportunities tied to solar and wind installations on their land. Many rural development plans may stall, and jobs tied to clean energy expansion in farming communities could be jeopardized.

The Clean Grid Alliance found that if all proposed solar projects were placed on Iowa’s 17.5 million acres considered “prime,” they would take up 35,000 acres, or just 0.2%. The notion that renewable energy is eating up cropland is a myth.

But, as you may know, President Donald Trump hates wind turbines. He’s talked often of birds killed by turbine blades and even insisted windmills can cause cancer. Trump has issued an executive order directing the Treasury Secretary to stop providing tax credits for wind and solar projects.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright stopped in Iowa this month and proclaimed that it’s time for the state’s wind energy industry to stand on its own.

“I think it’s the right time to sunset them,” Wright said of tax incentives for wind energy projects. “They’re 33 years old now. They’ve been extended 11 times.”

But the International Energy Agency reports that government subsidies benefiting the fossil fuel industry totaled $620 billion in 2023. The federal government has been propping up the ethanol industry in various ways for nearly 50 years.

This entire saga makes no sense. Renewable energy technology is America’s future. Trump administration policies clinging to fossil fuels are shortsighted and misinformed. Also, we’re pulling back from renewables at a critical moment when technology is making it more affordable and reliable.

The United States risks falling behind its global economic competitors. In Iowa, these misguided policies will stunt the growth of a promising industry that employs 4,000 Iowans and has generated $22 billion in capital investments, according to state figures.

Our congressional delegation should abandon its usual fealty to Trump and raise a ruckus over the loss of this funding. But even Sen. Chuck Grassley, the “father of wind energy” appears to be falling in line by accepting Trump’s mistake.

Iowa leaders must demand federal policies that keep our state at the forefront of renewable energy. If they don't, Iowa risks losing jobs, rural income, competitiveness, and the opportunity to counteract climate change. Our state has already seen the costs in floods, derechos and droughts.

Currently, the country relies heavily on imports for critical components. Strengthening the domestic supply chain will reduce dependence on foreign markets, create jobs, and support India’s goal of becoming a global hub for renewable energy manufacturing.

In Detail : The solar industry in India is calling for strong policy support to establish an end-to-end domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem. Currently, the country’s reliance on imported components such as wafers, cells, and polysilicon poses challenges to energy security. Industry players believe that achieving self-reliance in the entire value chain is crucial for long-term sustainability.

While India has made remarkable progress in expanding module manufacturing capacity, the upstream segments remain underdeveloped. The absence of facilities for polysilicon, ingots, and wafers keeps the sector dependent on global suppliers. This not only creates vulnerabilities due to supply chain disruptions but also impacts cost competitiveness in global markets.

Industry leaders are pressing the government to introduce comprehensive incentives that support manufacturing across all stages. Schemes like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) have given a boost, but further measures are required to encourage investments in raw materials and advanced technologies. An integrated ecosystem will help India capture global market share.

Domestic solar manufacturing also presents an opportunity for job creation and skill development at scale. Building the entire supply chain within the country will generate employment for engineers, technicians, and workers across various regions. Additionally, it would help build expertise in high-tech processes such as wafer cutting and cell efficiency enhancement.

Global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic highlighted India’s vulnerability to external markets. With rising energy demand, ensuring a secure and stable supply of solar equipment becomes critical. By building indigenous capacity, India can insulate itself from geopolitical risks and volatile import prices, while fostering resilience in its renewable energy transition.

End-to-end solar manufacturing will also support India’s ambitious renewable energy targets. With plans to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based capacity by 2030, ensuring reliable access to solar components is essential. Localized production will reduce project delays, lower costs, and accelerate the adoption of solar power across residential, commercial, and utility-scale sectors.

Industry stakeholders stress the importance of research and development alongside manufacturing. Innovation in efficiency improvements, advanced materials, and automation will be key to competing globally. Collaboration between manufacturers, research institutes, and government bodies could make India a hub not just for solar production but also for technology leadership.

The push for end-to-end solar manufacturing also has export potential. By building capabilities across the full supply chain, India can supply high-quality equipment to international markets. This aligns with the government’s vision of making India a global renewable energy hub and boosting foreign exchange earnings through clean energy exports.

The call from the industry reflects a broader understanding that energy transition must be backed by self-reliance in clean technology manufacturing. With the right policies, infrastructure, and incentives, India has the opportunity to emerge as a global leader in solar energy. Achieving this goal will ensure both sustainability and economic growth.",https://www.eqmagpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Quark-Solar-is-pleased-to-commission-its-first-rooftop-solar-plant-in-Chakan-industrial-park-of-578kWp-at-Mubea-India.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 07:59:52.394277

These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›

It's been a bit of a weird year for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) investors. The company is dealing with external factors hurting business, including tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, a decline in global sales, increasing competition in China amid a brutal price war, mounting lawsuits, a talent exodus, and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political adventures. Despite all those negative developments, Tesla's stock has surged 54% higher over the past 12 months. And one recent move could help move more vehicles, which is exactly what the company needs in the near term.

Worrisome pricing?

Political backlash has put pressure on Tesla's used-car pricing. So much pressure, in fact, that even though Tesla is often considered a premium brand, its used vehicles are now selling almost as cheaply as the average used car -- and the latter's price is moving higher, while Tesla's prices continue to move lower. The problem started last year when the broader used car market in the U.S. started seeing values drop, but the broader market began recovering in the spring, and Tesla values continued to drop.

What's Tesla to do?

While consumer backlash is likely to eventually fade, Tesla's primary problem in the near term is to reverse its sales decline. Tesla recently started offering leases of certified preowned cars, which is fairly rare in the automotive industry. It's also offering $0 down as it tries to load as many deliveries into the third quarter as possible before the federal $7,500 tax credit on new electric vehicles (EVs) and the $4,000 credit for used EVs expire at the end of September.

The industry is banking on demand being pulled into the third quarter, and Tesla is aiming to capture as many sales as possible with the new leasing strategy. Telsa is doing this for the first time, and these certified preowned vehicles, mostly Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, are being offered for as little as $215 per month with $0 down for a 24-month lease and 10,000 miles per year. Tesla is also offering a 12-month lease and up to 15,000 miles annually, with $0 down but an acquisition fee of nearly $700.

Whether you're a fan of Musk or not, or Tesla or EVs in general, this is a compelling deal and the cheapest way to get into a Tesla at the moment. The problem is that used Teslas have been piling up, as the brand took a hit this year, and this does appear a little desperate.

Tesla is also trying a new strategy with its Cybertruck that has left investors and analysts unimpressed with its deliveries. Tesla raised the price of the high-end version of the Cybertruck to $114,990, up from $99,990, in the U.S., per listings on its website. The Cybertruck now comes with what Tesla calls a ""Luxe Package"" including Full-Self Driving (FSD), four-year wheel and tire protection, and free supercharging access. Unfortunately, pricing changes on a single trim, even a high-end and more profitable trim package, aren't likely to move the needle for either deliveries or financials.

What it all means

With Tesla's stock up 54% over the past year despite all the negative developments, it's clear that investors are truly hoping the EV maker will capture lightning in a bottle with earnings growth driven by autonomous vehicles. Investors are in a tough position as they revisit their investing thesis for a company that might be in the middle of transitioning from an automaker to a company defined by self-driving vehicles, robotics, and artificial intelligence -- maybe not what everybody signed up for when originally investing in Tesla for its electric vehicles. What it all means is that the risk of owning Tesla is higher now and that the company will face a few bumpy quarters as the markets deal with losing the EV tax credits -- so buckle up and prepare for the ride.

“They would have to go in and destroy the community,” Mayfield said, referring to Eddystone.
Researchers from Haverford College have joined to explain how the LNG terminal would affect the county, beyond economic terms.
Mayfield and Carluccio said residents in the affluent area near Chester should care about the LNG terminal.
Modern day Chester is located in the Okehocking and Lenapehocken region, and Fontaine’s activism includes reclaiming his familial roots along the Delaware River.","CHESTER, Pa.—In this small city south of Philadelphia, trash is a problem. A thick white cloud rising from Reworld’s Delaware Valley Resource Recovery Facility, the largest trash incinerator in the country by capacity, and the stinging odor of garbage are daily reminders that mounds of waste from Philadelphia, New York City and Delaware are a toxic burden here.

Air pollution from the burning trash and emissions from other industrial sites along the river have long been blamed for contributing to high rates of deadly illnesses in Chester and the surrounding Delaware County. Beginning in 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency noted the harmful load of industrial facilities in the city.

Now, researchers and community groups are raising alarms that Chester and its neighboring towns could face a new liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal that will increase emissions and pollution and add a potential threat of explosions.

Their concern comes amid a push by the Trump administration to dramatically increase LNG exports, which could contribute an estimated $1.3 trillion dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product through 2040. Pennsylvania lawmakers speak of the financial benefits of a terminal along the Delaware River—they predict thousands of new jobs—but people who live in the region are most interested and worried about the quality of the air they breathe.

LNG is a form of natural gas cooled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit. In Pennsylvania, the nation’s second largest energy-producing state, the gas comes primarily from fracking the Marcellus Shale, which runs beneath about two-thirds to three-quarters of the state.

The condensed fuel is shipped to international markets, which has bolstered the national economy in recent years. But a recent Inside Climate News analysis has found that those exports, and specifically the tankers that transport LNG from the United States, contribute to global warming through the emission of methane, a climate super-pollutant 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.

For the community activists facing a new LNG export terminal, the risks of the tanker traffic and possible pipeline accidents far outweigh the benefits. “It’s the potential of death,” said David Kronheim. The retired computer programmer has lived in Chester for five years, about a mile from the incinerator. If an LNG export terminal were built nearby, Kronheim said he would want to move. “It doesn’t matter where they build it. If you’re within 10 miles you’re in trouble,” said Kronheim, who has joined a local activist group that is fighting the terminal.

In 2016, a New York based company, Penn America Energy, wrote a report on the economic impact of building a $6.4 billion dollar facility that would operate out of Chester in 2023. CEO Franc James held meetings with local lawmakers but faced local pressure against allowing another polluting industry into an overburdened community and obstacles from the Biden administration to slow LNG exports.

That changed on Jan. 20 as President Trump signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency. LNG exports have become a focus of foreign policy and energy development.

In April, Pennsylvania Republican Sen. David McCormick announced in a Washington Times op-ed that Penn America was collaborating with the Pennsylvania Building Trades, a union alliance, on a $7 billion LNG export terminal in Eddystone Borough, a working class white community next to Chester along the I-95 corridor south of Philadelphia.

That terminal, he said, would contribute to future “energy domination” and “that future runs through Pennsylvania.”

“This massive, proposed project in southeastern Pennsylvania has the potential to generate billions in economic impact over the next 20 years, create 3,000 good-paying jobs, and produce $30-$40 million per year in tax revenue for this community,” McCormick said in a separate statement on his Senate website that criticized Biden’s efforts to evaluate environmental and economic impacts of LNG exports.

“The Biden Administration foolishly placed an indefinite pause on this and other critical projects, halting our progress towards energy independence…I’m grateful to President Trump for immediately reversing this ban, allowing proposals like this new LNG export terminal to resume and unleashing Pennsylvania’s energy dominance,” McCormick said.

In June, Reuters reported that James, the Penn America Energy executive, had a meeting in the White House to “provide intelligence” on bringing LNG operations to southeast Pennsylvania. James told Reuters he was looking beyond the original Chester location to other possible sites in Trainer, Marcus Hook and Eddystone.

Last month, Trump signed a record agreement with the European Union to buy $750 billion dollars worth of American energy in the next three years—an amount that some experts warn is unrealistic.

Activists in Delaware County have said that McCormick’s optimistic estimates for job creation and tax revenues clash with on-the-ground realities: potential public health harm from what could be a 100-acre site in a residential area.

Chester and Eddystone are part of what advocates have identified as an environmental justice area, where low-income neighborhoods and communities of color have been disproportionately harmed by polluting industries for decades.

Zulene Mayfield, an activist who heads the nonprofit Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living (CRCQL), has been at the forefront of the environmental justice movement in Chester since 1992.

When she hears talk of a potential economic boom in the area, Mayfield said she can’t help but take the word literally, thinking of a 2022 explosion at an LNG site in Freeport, Texas, that stemmed from a pipe failure. Vapors ignited a fireball. Damage was contained to the site, and there were no injuries reported to authorities, according to a government website.

She noted that the potential exists for liquified natural gas to combust and CRCQL is concerned about an explosion risk in Delaware County, a densely populated area. Two local hospitals closed in the past year, and Mayfield said that undercut the community’s ability to handle medical crises.

“The difference now is that they’ve ripped away the protections,” she said referring to EPA regulations. “And there have never been that many in the first place.”

Following Trump’s executive order, the U.S. Department of Energy announced in January that it was lifting Biden’s 2024 pause on LNG exports. In March, the EPA announced 31 regulatory rollbacks that it called ”the biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history” to encourage energy production.

“We know there’s no help from the EPA,” Mayfield said. “Don’t think the cavalry is coming from Washington. It is incumbent on us to become our own cavalry.”

The Delaware Riverkeeper Network, a nonprofit that aims to protect waterways, has submitted right-to-know requests to Eddystone Borough to sort through documentation or filings related to efforts to build the export terminal. Following Sen. McCormick’s op-ed that raised Eddystone as a possible site, the borough manager for code compliance in May emailed a response to the Riverkeepers that said: “There is nothing to report as I do not know what you are referring to.”

Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, said she is concerned that Penn America Energy has been informally lining up support with elected representatives from the state.

Eddystone and Chester are communities directly next to each other on the Delaware River. Chester takes up six square miles, Eddystone accounts for less than two square miles. Activists say that neither are large enough to safely accommodate the industry, and there isn’t a site to build in either location that wouldn’t infringe on homes, small businesses, churches, or major throughways.

“They would have to go in and destroy the community,” Mayfield said, referring to Eddystone. “[An LNG terminal] is way too large for a populated area like this.”

Mayfield said she is just as worried about LNG in Eddystone as she was about Chester.

Comparing the situation to a house on fire,she said that the threat was the same, regardless of which town in Delaware County that investors had their sights on. “If they go to Eddystone, that’s the equivalent of a neighbor’s house on fire,” she said. “If their house is on fire, our house is going to burn, too.”

Turning their efforts to resisting plans for LNG in Eddystone, Mayfield and Carluccio are leading an education and mobilization campaign across Delaware County with public and virtual forums. Researchers from Haverford College have joined to explain how the LNG terminal would affect the county, beyond economic terms.

“They want us dumb,” said Mayfield at a public forum that CRCQL sponsored last month. “They don’t want educated thinkers. They want workers—bargain basement thinkers who won’t challenge them.”

A crowd of about 30 residents, community organizers and researchers sat on wooden pews one hot summer day at the Quaker Providence Friends Meeting House in Media, about six miles north of Chester, to learn how LNG’s promise for economic development could affect their health.

Mayfield and Carluccio said residents in the affluent area near Chester should care about the LNG terminal. “The fight is getting those who don’t see and smell it [to understand] that you are in just as much danger,” Mayfield said.

Residents living in towns not directly burdened by the industries that pollute Chester might not be aware of the dangerous air emissions that waft inland from the waterfront, she said.

Chester, a predominantly Black community, is burdened by a disproportionate amount of polluting industries, which fits a larger trend of systemic racial bias, along with lower socioeconomic status, as a defining factor of where these industries are historically located. A General Accounting Office study in the 1980s found 75 percent of hazardous waste sites across eight states were in low-income communities of color.

Mayfield pointed out that what happens in Chester now will affect nearby communities. Majority white suburbs will be affected by the LNG terminal’s traffic and air pollution, she said. Harm won’t be contained to just one zip code.

Lauren Minsky, a health studies professor at Haverford College who spoke during the meeting, said her research on cancer in Delaware County found industries on the river had contributed to pollution that correlates with a range of heightened rates of deadly diseases in southeast Pennsylvania.

Minsky presented a map during the meeting that tracked weather patterns and showed how wind moves northwest and inland from the waterfront. Towns farther from the river, including Media, would be affected, and the air from the waterfront was shown to be laden with particulate matter and carcinogens, she said.

“You can think of [it] as a sacrifice zone where people are losing their lives because of these facilities,” Minsky said. ““People in these communities are dying young.”

“It’s not always routine, it’s not only where you work, it’s not only your lifestyle, it can be the land and the air where you live that affects you,” Mayfield said about the causes of cancer and asthma in Delaware County. “Our children literally cannot breathe.”

Children in Eddystone developed Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, a blood cancer, at a rate 1,051 percent higher than the national average, according to Minsky’s research. Meanwhile in Chester City, female rates of laryngeal cancer were 201 percent higher than the national average, and male rates of liver and bile cancer were 97 percent higher than the national average, her research found.

A study published in May by Johns Hopkins researchers focused on Chester and surrounding boroughs in an effort to better account for and assess the noncarcinogenic health eﬀects of cumulative chemical exposures. The researchers found that the mix of pollutants from the various industries posed more health risks to nearby communities–called “fenceline communities” in the study–than the harm associated with a single pollutant.

The Johns Hopkins team noted that “communities along the Delaware River in southeastern Pennsylvania have long faced high levels of pollution from petro-chemical reﬁneries, municipal waste incinerators, and several other industrial facilities.” The EPA had for years documented elevated rates of infant mortality, cancer mortality, and asthma among residents.

Other groups that attended Mayfield’s meeting included Swarthmore College’s Campus Coalition Concerning Chester, Earth Quaker Action Team, and Choices, a youth environmental justice group affiliated with CRCQL.

While CRCQL has been spreading the word of environmental justice and rallying support against LNG proposals this summer through public meetings, Choices has been doing its own advocacy. Its members are between 8 and 18 years old.

Their work has included testing soil samples for lead with University of Pennsylvania researchers, volunteering at a local farm, building solar panels, and events to support and inspire the community.

Nolan Fontaine, who has an Ed.D. in sociology, equity studies and education, is an American Indian organizer who also leads Choices. Modern day Chester is located in the Okehocking and Lenapehocken region, and Fontaine’s activism includes reclaiming his familial roots along the Delaware River. He said Choices aims to change the narrative about industries that came to the city promising jobs and left residents fighting for air.

Hope and love for the community, he said, is intertwined with the resistance to the trash incinerator and polluting sites along the river. It’s evident in Choices initiatives including, “Sowing Seeds of Hope,” a gardening event and plant giveaway.

“It’s a small act of resistance. While we aren’t able to shut down Reworld Covanta yet,” Fontaine said of Chester’s trash incinerator, “we can control our homes and our small environments to make them cleaner, fresher, and a safe place for us to be able to breathe.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chester-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 06:59:50.772001

Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting restrictions on how the transportation department can spend money on maintenance operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.trentonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Electric_Vehicles-Road_User_Fee_73408-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-08-30 12:06:33.734518

Louisiana, USA, 30th August 2025, ZEX PR WIRE, Tyler Pommier, Executive Vice President of Innovation at GulfStream Renewables, is calling on individuals, communities, and leaders across the U.S. to rethink the way energy is produced, shared, and understood. After years of spearheading clean energy projects across the Gulf Coast, Pommier is using his platform to raise awareness about energy equity and local empowerment through decentralized, renewable systems.

“Everyone deserves access to clean power,” Pommier says. “Not just for the environment, but for dignity, safety, and freedom.”

This message is central to Pommier’s recent TEDx talk titled “Decentralizing Power: Energy Belongs to Everyone.” It also echoes throughout his work developing solar, wind, and battery systems that support schools, neighborhoods, and underserved rural areas.

The Power Gap

Pommier’s advocacy comes at a time when energy insecurity remains a serious issue. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration:

Nearly one in three U.S. households faces some form of energy insecurity each year.

In rural and low-income communities, power outages and energy costs impact health, education, and economic stability.

Schools in underserved areas face frequent disruptions due to unreliable power, affecting student learning and safety.

“This isn’t just a technical problem—it’s a people problem,” says Pommier. “When a school loses power, classrooms close. When a family can’t afford heating, people get sick. Energy touches every part of our lives.”

Local Action, Local Control

One of Pommier’s proudest achievements is a series of solar-plus-battery installations in rural schools across Louisiana.

“These schools had constant outages,” he explains. “We gave them a way to stay open, save money, and be resilient. That kind of project shows how clean energy can serve real human needs.”

He believes decentralized systems—like rooftop solar, community microgrids, and battery storage—can give control back to families, schools, and local governments.

“I want to see communities that don’t just use power,” he says. “I want to see communities that own their power.”

Making Clean Energy Understandable

Pommier is also focused on simplifying the conversation. “You can’t just throw data at people,” he says. “You have to explain how it affects their daily lives. Like: Will your fridge stay on in a storm? Will your kid’s school stay open during a blackout?”

His plainspoken approach has made him a trusted voice at town halls, schools, and policy meetings.

What You Can Do

Pommier isn’t asking people to wait for government action or big investment. Instead, he’s offering simple steps that everyday people can take:

Learn how your home or building uses energy.

Ask questions at local meetings about power sourcing and grid reliability.

Support community solar projects or energy co-ops.

Encourage schools and public buildings to explore renewable options.

Talk about it. Share energy stories with neighbors, family, and friends.

“Start small,” Pommier says. “Talk to your city council. Learn how your utility works. Ask where your electricity comes from. That’s how change begins.”

Canada drops several retaliatory tariffs to align with U.S. exemptions

Canada is dropping many of its retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. exemptions under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact (USMCA), Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday. The decision ensures that over 85% of Canadian trade with the U.S. remains tariff-free. The move aligns Canada with carve-outs that shield most goods from punitive duties, while maintaining tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos as negotiations continue with Washington. Carney emphasized the strategic nature of the adjustment, framing it as a way to preserve Canada’s trade advantage and set the stage for the USMCA review in 2026. Read More

Backed by the Department of Energy (DOE), the project marks a shift toward nuclear-powered sustainability, with a clear focus on meeting rising energy demands while reducing environmental impact.

The Aalo-X is an experimental extra modular reactor (XMR), sited beside INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

Aalo aims for it to achieve criticality, the point at which a nuclear chain reaction becomes self-sustaining, by 4 July 2026.

The target date aligns with the company’s plan to go from “founding to fission” in under three years.

A public-private model for sustainable energy innovation

The Aalo-X reactor is selected through a competitive application process as part of the DOE’s newly formed Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program.

This initiative launches in June 2025 following Executive Order 14301.

It allows advanced nuclear designs to be tested beyond national laboratory sites, opening the door to faster commercial deployment.

For the sustainability sector, this means accelerated innovation in low-carbon power generation.

The pilot programme’s structure allows companies like Aalo to collaborate with national labs while fast-tracking testing protocols.

Its design encourages commercial deployment of advanced reactors to new industries, especially those experiencing surging power needs such as cloud computing and data storage.

“Our selection for the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program is a significant catalyst for achieving our goal of going from ‘founding to fission’ in less than three years – a feat many deemed impossible just a year ago,” says Matt Loszak, Co-founder and CEO of Aalo Atomics.

“This milestone groundbreaking event is a testament to the potential that can be unlocked when public entities and private companies partner together in the critical interest of the nation.

""This is a pivotal time for the US nuclear energy industry and we are incredibly proud to be at the forefront.”

The INL test site is designed to help validate technologies that support energy scalability and consistent output.

These features are increasingly vital for data centre operators searching for power sources that are both clean and reliable.

As data centres face growing scrutiny for their energy usage, modular nuclear solutions present a path toward zero-carbon operations.

“Today’s groundbreaking symbolises the progress that can be achieved when innovation, vision and national purpose come together,” says John Wagner, Laboratory Director at INL.

“At Idaho National Laboratory, we are proud to support the Department of Energy’s efforts to accelerate advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen America’s energy security, provide reliable power, and inspire the next generation of innovators.

“Projects like Aalo-X reflect the promise of nuclear energy to meet our nation’s historic demand growth and help enable a more prosperous future for our nation.”

Compact nuclear plants for low-impact energy

The Aalo-X serves as the testbed for the company’s commercial system: the Aalo Pod.

The Aalo Pod is a 50 megawatt-electric (MWe) XMR system made up of five Aalo-1 sodium-cooled reactors.

Each unit runs on low-enriched uranium dioxide fuel, chosen for both its availability and established safety record.

This approach limits supply chain challenges and enhances operational safety.

Unlike traditional nuclear plants, the Aalo Pod does not require an external water source.

It is designed for direct onsite deployment next to data centres, using a compact footprint and fully modular architecture.

This allows operators to scale output from megawatts to gigawatts with lower permitting complexity and minimal construction disruption.

A conceptual design of the Aalo Pod shows the units sited alongside data centres, offering a clear energy strategy for digital infrastructure.

This model helps reduce reliance on fossil fuels while avoiding the intermittency challenges faced by wind and solar.

The company is building the Aalo-X reactor at its 40,000-square-foot pilot facility in Austin, Texas.

Once complete, the reactor will be moved to INL for final installation and commissioning.

Aalo expects the operational insights gained from Aalo-X to shape the commercial rollout of the Aalo Pod, targeted for market introduction by 2029.

New nuclear for a new energy age

“When Aalo-X achieves criticality next year, it will become the first new sodium-cooled reactor to start operation in the US in over four decades,"" says Yasir Arafat, Co-Founder and CTO at Aalo Atomics, who previously led the MARVEL microreactor project at INL",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/1011a5382019bfd570c92988515022e4:c115da524dab3466e0e53a983d54c282/68acb1a2c872dd1078bdb349-screenshot-2025-08-25-at-1-54-28-pm-copy.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 05:59:34.842819

“We’re continuing our trend here of looking into the world and saying, ‘How do we advance fusion as fast as possible?’” co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard told TechCrunch. “This round of capital isn’t just about fusion, just generally as a concept, but it’s about how we go to make fusion into a commercial industrial endeavor.” The company has raised nearly $3 billion — the largest amount ever for any fusion startup.

Existing investors include Emerson Collective, Eni, Future Ventures, Gates Frontier, Google, Hostplus, Khosla Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Safar Partners, Eric Schmidt, Starlight Ventures, and Tiger Global.

New investors like Brevan Howard, Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global, Stanley Druckenmiller, FFA Private Bank in Dubai, Galaxy Interactive, Gigascale Capital, HOF Capital, Neva SGR, Planet First Partners, Woori Venture Partners US, and a consortium of 12 Japanese companies led by Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation joined the round.

Fusion power has long been considered a nearly limitless energy source but it is only recently investors have started placing serious bets on it. In a fusion reaction, atoms are compressed and heated until they form a fourth state of matter known as plasma. On reaching a specific temperature and pressure, the atoms begin to fuse, releasing massive amounts of energy.

CFS is currently building a prototype reactor called Sparc in a Boston suburb. The company plans to get the reactor operating by next year, and hopes scientific breakeven in 2027, a milestone in which the fusion reaction produces more energy than was required to ignite it. While Sparc hasn’t been designed to sell power to the grid, it is vital for CFS.

“There are parts of the modeling and the physics that we don’t yet understand,” Saskia Mordijck, an associate professor of physics at the College of William and Mary, told TechCrunch. “It’s always an open question when you turn on a completely new device that it might go into plasma regimes we’ve never been into, that maybe we uncover things that we just did not expect.”

READ: Bill Gates drops out of the Top 10 rich list — What happened? (

If Sparc starts operating according to plan, CFS will start working on Arc, its commercial-scale power plant, in Virginia starting in 2027 or 2028.

Earlier in this year, Google announced it will buy 200 megawatts of clean fusion power produced by Arc as part of a partnership with CFS. Arc is expected to generate 400 megawatts of clean, zero-carbon power in the early 2030s, which is enough energy to power large industrial sites or roughly 150,000 homes. With this agreement, Google can also purchase power from additional Arc plants.

Mumgaard also told TechCrunch that while Sparc will help prove that the science is sound, it will do more than that for CFS. “That’s very important. But it’s also to know the capabilities that you need to be able to deliver it. It’s also to have the receipts, know what these things cost,” he said. He also added that while the latest funding round will help build Sparc, it wouldn’t be enough for Arc.

“The fact that it’s a first of a kind technology is a wrinkle that then has a big impact on where the capital will come from,” he said. “We’re not entirely sure, but we are pretty committed to doing this. And our investors are pretty committed to doing this.”",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CFS.png,N,,2025-08-30 09:59:01.528166

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

In August of 2024, the United States reached a new monthly record for crude oil production at 13.4 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d).
The Permian Basin remains a cornerstone of that growth, accounting for nearly 50 percent of U.S. oil production and over 20 percent of U.S. natural gas output.
Despite this record production, the prolific basin is actively contributing to environmentally conscious progress in key areas like methane emissions intensity.
Progress like dramatic reductions in methane emissions intensity showcase that industry’s voluntary commitments and pledges to eliminate emissions can and do work.","The latest data from S&P Global Commodity Insights confirms what producers in the Permian Basin have long been showing: oil and natural gas assets can deliver record energy production while reducing emissions. According to S&P, methane emissions intensity in the Permian Basin has dramatically declined by more than 50 percent from 2022 to 2024. The decline is attributed to improved operations, upgraded equipment, and the utilization of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence.

Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights

Additionally, S&P’s recent data shows that since the end of 2022, absolute emissions in the Permian Basin have declined by 55.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which is equivalent to 28.2 million metric tons (MMT) of carbon emissions avoided. To put this reduction into perspective, the reduction is roughly the same as eliminating the annual emissions of an entire country the size of Lithuania, and greater than the greenhouse gas emissions from heating and cooling every home in California, as S&P notes..

Record production does not inhibit emissions reduction efforts

This impressive reduction comes amid record-setting oil production for the country. The United States has produced more crude oil than any nation at any time for the past six years in a row, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). In August of 2024, the United States reached a new monthly record for crude oil production at 13.4 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d).

The Permian Basin remains a cornerstone of that growth, accounting for nearly 50 percent of U.S. oil production and over 20 percent of U.S. natural gas output. Despite this record production, the prolific basin is actively contributing to environmentally conscious progress in key areas like methane emissions intensity.

As Energy in Depth has previously analyzed, data from the Environmental Protection Agency shows that Permian methane emissions have fallen 32 percent since 2019, even as production surged 51 percent during the same time period. That’s a perfect example of how energy growth and environmental goals can go hand in hand.

Industry leads voluntary emissions reduction efforts

Notably, American oil and gas companies have been at the forefront of voluntary efforts, commitments, and programs to reduce methane emissions – which are exactly what lead to impressive declines in emissions like those reflected in S&P Global’s recent data.

Industry groups like the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership, The Environmental Partnership, ONE Future, and the Texas Methane and Flaring Coalition all work to bring together the country’s top oil and gas producers to work towards common goals like improving methane emissions reporting, ending routine flaring, and sharing of best practices for emissions detection.

Following the release of the latest S&P data, the Texas Methane and Flaring Coalition emphasized:

“Our members have consistently demonstrated a sincere and deep commitment to reducing the level of methane intensity levels—efforts that are clearly working.

It's the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax.
The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028.
In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections.
“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.","PORTLAND, Oregon — Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle's telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state's decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state's total vehicles, he said.

Under Hawaii's program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Oregon's voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they're more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don't realize that ""both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

Reliance is investing in the entire clean energy value chain: from producing solar modules and energy storage systems to building electrolysers that use renewable electricity to generate hydrogen — seen as a key fuel for the future. The company also plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel and biofuels from organic waste for both domestic use and export.

“We are building platforms to deliver a comprehensive clean energy ecosystem — solar, battery storage, hydrogen — all at scale and under one umbrella,” said Anant Ambani. The products manufactured at these giga factories will support 24/7 renewable electricity supply and help produce green chemicals including green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuels.

Jamnagar, already home to Reliance’s twin oil refineries — the world’s largest refining complex — is being transformed into the base for the company’s renewable energy ambitions. Construction of the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex is progressing rapidly and is expected to become the world’s largest clean energy hub in terms of scale and integration.

“Jamnagar will represent both the legacy of conventional energy and the future of new energy,” Mr Ambani said. Reliance has already begun producing solar photovoltaic modules at its Jamnagar facility. The company aims to scale up to a capacity of 20 GWp in the coming quarters, making it the largest single-site solar manufacturing facility in the world.

So far, it has successfully produced its first 200 MW of heterojunction (HJT) modules, which offer better performance and durability compared to conventional modules.

Alongside solar, the company is also building battery and electrolyser giga factories. The battery facility, scheduled to open in 2026, will start with an annual capacity of 40 GWh and expand to 100 GWh in phases. The electrolyser plant, also set to be operational by the end of 2026, will have the ability to scale up to 3 GW annually — supporting cost-effective hydrogen production on a global scale.

In Kutch, Gujarat, Reliance is developing one of the largest single-site solar projects in the world, covering 550,000 acres of arid land. At full pace, the site will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day. Once complete, it could supply nearly 10% of India’s electricity demand within the next decade.

The company’s logistics and port infrastructure in Jamnagar and Kandla will support export operations for green hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia and methanol.

“India can become a global leader in affordable green hydrogen and its derivatives,” said Ambani, noting that the initial phase of production will serve the company’s own needs before scaling to 3 million tonnes per year by 2032.

Reliance is also focusing on bioenergy. It is building compressed biogas (CBG) plants with a target capacity of 0.5 million tonnes per year, aiming to scale to over 500 plants by 2030.

To support this, the company has set up the world’s largest Bioenergy Technology and R&D Centre in Jamnagar, where it is developing advanced technologies to increase biogas yields, including enzymes, microbes, and high-efficiency energy crops.

As part of its broader clean energy strategy, Reliance is also launching integrated energy hubs that combine smart farming, biogas and hydrogen production, agrivoltaics (dual land use for agriculture and solar power), and battery storage. These hubs aim to capture CO2 from CBG plants for green chemical production, targeting cost parity with fossil fuels.",https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Anant-Ambani-Executive-Director.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:04:17.443511

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

The U.S. Department of Interior is not saying yes, or no.

In a letter on Aug. 22, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Acting Director Matthew Giacona said his directive to halt work on the Revolution Wind project was due to agency concerns related to the protection of national security interests and the “prevention of interference with reasonable uses” of the ocean under federal law.

A subsequent statement from an Interior Department spokesperson had a different tone.

“Americans deserve energy that is affordable, reliable, and built to last — not experimental and expensive wind projects that are proven failures,” Deputy Press Secretary Aubrie Spady said. “In line with President Donald Trump’s Energy Dominance Agenda, Interior is putting an immediate stop to these costly failures to deliver a stronger energy future and lower costs for American families. Like President Trump said, ‘the days of stupidity are over in the USA!'”

State House News Service asked if the “immediate stop” language would also apply to Vineyard Wind 1, which like Revolution Wind is deep into its construction schedule.

“Every project is reviewed on a case-by-case basis,” Interior Department senior public affairs specialist Elizabeth Peace said in an email. “The statement and the order were specific to the Revolution Wind project.”

Revolution Wind has 20-year power purchase agreements to deliver 400 megawatts of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut, enough to power more than 350,000 homes across both states. Vineyard Wind 1 is exporting power from 17 of 62 planned turbines and plans to have construction completed by the end of the year.

Organizations that represent New England area power generators and the electric grid operator warned that suspension of the in-progress Revolution Wind project puts the region’s energy reliability at risk.

On X, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said the Trump administration’s “market manipulation will cost jobs and millions of dollars of investment in Rhode Island’s offshore wind industry.”

He continued: “Wind power is one of the fastest, cheapest ways to meet rising electricity demand — discouraging clean energy will raise energy prices and worsen the looming climate crisis — but payback to fossil fuel donors comes first.

Reliance Industries is shifting from fossil fuels to clean energy. The company plans a mega battery plant by 2026. It will build a solar project larger than Singapore. Reliance aims for 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2032. Anant Ambani envisions an integrated new energy ecosystem.

Reliance Industries Ltd is accelerating its pivot away from fossil fuels with a sweeping clean energy strategy. The company plans to launch a mega battery manufacturing plant by 2026, build a solar power project larger than Singapore, and achieve 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen capacity by 2032.

Making his first appearance at Reliance’s Annual General Meeting, Anant Ambani — the youngest son of chairman Mukesh Ambani and executive director of the company — outlined a vision to create the world’s most integrated new energy ecosystem, spanning “from sand to electrons to green molecules.”

Fully Integrated Green Energy Platform

Reliance is investing in every link of the clean energy chain:

Solar modules to generate electricity from sunlight.

Advanced batteries to store renewable power.

Electrolysers to produce green hydrogen by splitting water molecules.

Giga factories to manufacture hydrogen and its derivatives, including green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

Biofuels derived from organic waste.

According to Anant Ambani, these facilities will enable round-the-clock renewable energy supply and support both domestic use and exports of clean fuels.

The centrepiece of this transformation is the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex in Jamnagar, already home to Reliance’s massive oil refining operations. Once complete, it will be the world’s largest integrated clean energy hub, producing solar modules, batteries, and hydrogen derivatives at unparalleled scale.

Live Events

Reliance has already started scaling its solar PV manufacturing line at Jamnagar to 20 GWp capacity, which would make it the largest single-site solar facility in the world. The company has rolled out its first 200 MW of high-efficiency HJT modules, which offer higher energy yields and lower degradation compared to conventional panels.

In parallel, construction of battery and electrolyser giga factories is underway. The battery plant, set to start production in 2026, will begin with 40 GWh annual capacity and eventually expand to 100 GWh. The electrolyser facility, also targeted for 2026, will scale up to 3 GW per year and enable globally competitive hydrogen production.

Mega projects in Gujarat

Reliance’s clean energy ambitions are concentrated in Gujarat. In Kutch, the company is developing one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects, covering 550,000 acres — nearly three times Singapore’s land area. At peak installation, Reliance expects to deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers per day. Within a decade, this single project could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity demand.

The Jamnagar and Kandla ports will provide the critical infrastructure backbone, enabling Reliance to export green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. By 2032, the group aims to produce the equivalent of 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually, establishing India as a hub for affordable clean fuels.

Beyond solar and hydrogen, Reliance is scaling its compressed biogas (CBG) operations. The company has set an ambitious target of over 500 CBG plants by 2030, with a combined capacity of 0.5 million tonnes per year. At its Bioenergy Technology and R&D Centre in Jamnagar, Reliance is developing next-generation enzymes, microbial solutions, and high-yield crops to enhance biogas productivity.

Anant Ambani also highlighted the company’s agrivoltaics model, which integrates solar and biogas production on the same land. By capturing carbon dioxide from CBG plants, these hubs will become centers for producing green chemicals. The approach, he noted, delivers a “triple value” — generating renewable gas, electricity, and boosting rural incomes for farmers.

,Detroit and Evs,2025-08-30 06:08:14+00:00,AP News,Oregon could join Hawaii in mandating pay-per-mile fees for EV owners as gas tax projections fall,"Claire Rush, apnews.com, claire-rush",,,,,https://apnews.com/article/oregon-transportation-funding-road-usage-charge-ev-ceb4872e2d2e35f252fb3e27f5bd1f71,"Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are at risk, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.
Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax.
It does not include a road usage charge.
In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections.
Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

However, the special session got off to a rocky start: The state Senate met as scheduled at 9 a.m., but the state House failed to reach the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, leaving the session in limbo as of late Friday afternoon.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are at risk, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting funding restrictions to allow the transportation department to spend more money on maintenance operations, including by redirecting dollars earmarked for public transit and efforts to combat climate change toward such operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/6568c63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2268+0+210/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F26%2F54%2F8c02b5b7edbcc5be9891313564b5%2Fd787cf5ed986407e99fde10e6ead8a17,N,,2025-08-30 03:59:10.105644

Well, a team of Australia's top engineer-scientists have developed a novel method of converting your gas car to an EV without need for heavy batteries or enormous motors: Just weld a garage door motor to the differential, and plug the whole thing into the wall.

The mad geniuses over at Garbage Time have done it again. After pulling the Barra inline-six from a Ford Falcon, Wade and James didn't want to push the shell all the way across the garage to be picked up for scrap with their bare hands. Instead, the pair decided to bring the old Falcon into the future, outfitting it with a full 750 watts of electric power and an extension cord.

That setup didn't exactly account for ""pedals,"" but that's fine. A single switch mounted atop the driver's airbag controls whether the rear motor is on or off, and the steering still seems to work. What else could a car need? Sure, the car may not be fast, but it does drive. It also can't shift into reverse without rewiring the plug on the extension cord, but that's fine. Oh, yeah, and you have to be very careful not to run over the extension cord — though, if you do, you can just coat the newly-stripped cable in tape and mount it to the door so it doesn't touch the oil leak.

This Ford Falcon EV is likely the simplest EV swap out there — it's achievable by anyone with the barest knowledge of welding and just a Home Depot run's worth of parts. It's flawless, and I can think of no better way to get that car you love back on the road.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/the-worlds-simplest-ev-conversion-takes-less-than-a-day/l-intro-1756335312.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 03:59:13.568312

Sign up to get it every Friday.

President Donald Trump has put energy front and center during his second term. On his first day in office alone, he froze spending under the Inflation Reduction Act, took a wrecking ball to offshore wind, and declared an “energy emergency,” citing affordability and grid reliability issues.

Critics have dismissed the emergency as a fabrication. Attorneys general from 15 states are challenging it in court. And Trump, whose policies are slowing the construction of cheap, clean energy, is not exactly acting like there’s an emergency at hand.

Take the Revolution Wind project as the latest example. Last Friday, the Trump administration ordered developer Ørsted to stop all construction on the huge, nearly complete project, citing unspecified “national security” reasons. It’s the second time the government has issued such an order to an offshore wind project that would’ve brought clean power to the Northeast.

The stoppage poses a real threat to the grid in New England, which is home to some of the highest power prices in the nation.

Revolution Wind was supposed to start delivering power next year — very soon in grid-planning terms. ISO-New England, the region’s grid operator, said Monday that it is banking on the wind farm to help meet demand and maintain power reserves. Further delays will continue the region’s reliance on natural gas, which ISO-New England has warned is in short supply and which is subject to price volatility.

Blocking major energy projects from coming online is not exactly consistent with declaring an energy emergency.

And yet, the Revolution Wind pause is just one example of how the administration is stymieing clean energy deployment. In recent months, it has rolled back federal subsidies and grants and implemented new federal leasing rules under which renewables are doomed to fail. Because of these policies, the country is expected to build less than half as much clean energy over the next decade — an outcome experts widely agree will raise power prices.

In fact, the only place the administration has acted as if its emergency is real is when it comes to preserving fossil-fuel power plants on the brink of closure.

The U.S. Department of Energy recently extended its emergency order barring a Michigan coal plant from retiring — a decision that cost the plant’s owner $29 million in its first five weeks. And on Thursday, the DOE extended another order keeping a Pennsylvania gas- and oil-fired peaker plant online. Regional grid operators had previously deemed both plants safe to close.

The moves reveal the incoherence at the heart of Trump’s energy policy, which exploits a questionable emergency to prop up expensive and unnecessary fossil-fueled power plants on the one hand — and blocks the fastest-growing and lowest-cost form of energy on the other.

Clean energy is getting its own day of action

If you’ve read even one edition of this newsletter since Trump took office, you’ll know that clean energy is facing a crisis in the U.S. Sun Day aims to elevate that message and boost the transition from fossil fuels with a nationwide day of action coming up on Sept. 21, Canary Media’s Alison F. Takemura reports.

The brainchild of climate journalist and activist Bill McKibben, Sun Day looks a lot like Earth Day. Advocacy groups and individuals will hold more than 150 events across the country, offering tours of homes with rooftop solar arrays, EV test drives, and other just-plain-fun activities like performances and face painting. You can find an event near you via the Sun Day website, or tap into Sun Day’s toolkit to host an event of your own.

Two nuclear plants inch closer to “renaissance”

Two retired nuclear plants each took a step toward restarting this week. On Monday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a waiver that will let the Duane Arnold plant in Iowa move toward restarting, which plant owner NextEra Energy hopes to do by 2029. And in Michigan, the Palisades plant has returned to operational status after being decommissioned for three years. The designation just means it can start receiving fuel again — it’s not yet generating electricity.

The Trump administration is pushing for a “nuclear renaissance,” both through the development of new advanced nuclear reactors and the reopening of large, retired facilities. The administration and nuclear advocates say the power source can help meet growing electricity demand, though the U.S.’s most recent attempt to build a new nuclear plant took years and billions of dollars more than expected.

It does not include a road usage charge.

However, the special session got off to a rocky start: The state Senate met as scheduled at 9 a.m., but the state House failed to reach the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, leaving the session in limbo as of late Friday afternoon.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are at risk, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting funding restrictions to allow the transportation department to spend more money on maintenance operations, including by redirecting dollars earmarked for public transit and efforts to combat climate change toward such operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.kxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/electriccharging-e1756518893198.webp?icb=1756536523,N,,2025-08-30 03:59:54.900957

Fifteen minutes after the 26-year-old drove home, a roar thundered from the plant where he helped mix chemicals for motor oil and had just punched out. Fire consumed the air, the collapsing metal groaning and liquids hissing as they escaped into the surrounding water, soil, and air. From his yard, he saw neighbors pointing at the rising smoke, not knowing he had been inside the plant only minutes before.

Last Friday afternoon, Aug. 22, a catastrophic explosion erupted at Smitty’s Supply, a major lubricant manufacturing facility in a predominantly Black town about 60 miles northeast of Baton Rouge. The blaze swept through the 15-acre complex that housed half a million gallons of flammable materials.

Oily droplets spattered from the smoky sky as far as 20 miles away, coating rooftops, cars, and front lawns in a slick, shimmering film that glistened like tar. Cancer-causing air toxics such as benzene can be released in refinery and lubricant fires; officials say sampling is underway.

Although no deaths had been reported as of Thursday, the fire inflicted environmental anxiety, residents said. The inferno at Smitty’s Supply is just the latest flashpoint as states and the federal government make it harder to hold industrial companies accountable for damage by rolling back regulations and oversight.

“They don’t care about us,” said Taylor, referring to both the industrial company and government officials. “There is no way people don’t get sick, because we need help over here and we’re not getting it.”

Last year, Louisiana became the focal point for the erosion of civil rights protections against environmental injustice. A state court case stopped the federal government from using the Civil Rights Act to block the expansion of toxic facilities in Black communities.

Now, under the Trump administration, permits for polluting plants are being approved with little oversight. Facilities are also allowed to release more chemicals into the environment as parts of the Clean Air Act get weakened.

At the same time, the administration has moved to repeal a Biden administration rule that strengthened the country’s ability to plan for and address the fallout from hazardous industrial events. These disasters overwhelmingly burden Black families, who are more likely to live nearby and face the greatest health, economic, and environmental harms.

On Aug. 22, more than 80% of residents in the town, including Taylor, were forced to abandon their homes. Over 250 people crammed into a tiny community center overnight, with most sleeping on plastic chairs. Roseland’s mayor and housing director, who handled the evacuation, did not respond to requests for comment.

By Aug. 26, most of the community returned to their homes, but the air remained heavy with the pungent scent of petroleum.

“I’m probably already sick with something,” said Tevin Moore, 33, another former employee of Smitty’s Supply. On Sunday, Taylor and Moore were laid off, along with hundreds of other employees, from the plant. They both said they were offered about $250 in monthly severance.

In every reporting period since 2022, Smitty’s has been cited for significant Clean Water Act violations. The Clean Water Act is the nation’s governing law regarding water safety, but the Trump administration has proposed weakening the rule. Among those violations, the company reported polluting local waterways with organic chemicals, which may include benzene and toluene, at approximately 20 times the legal limit, oil and grease at over four times the cap, and fecal bacteria at four times the cap.

Residents here are exposed to more oil and gas facilities than 90% of Americans and face higher rates of respiratory illness than 95% of the country. As soot from the explosion settles on playgrounds and porches, many locals say the consequences of industry-friendly policies and the erosion of civil rights guardrails are evident.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry cautioned residents not to clean their homes until investigators have determined what chemicals are in the ash. He said at a press conference that the explosion had not caused an “immediate danger to wildlife or to human health.”

State health departments say breathing oil fumes for even a day can cause severe lung irritation, peeling skin, and chemical pneumonitis, and may also trigger neurologic effects and more serious health problems such as cancer, liver and kidney damage, and blood effects.

On Monday, the regional Environmental Protection Agency took over the cleanup of the disaster. Still, residents expressed distrust in the process. The current head of the regional department, appointed by President Donald Trump, is Scott Mason, a former energy official for the state of Oklahoma. Mason was also an author of the Project 2025 plan that called for ending certain pollution regulations, toxic chemical clean-up programs, and research on the impact of pollution on human health.

“I can’t trust them, and I also can’t do it myself,” said Mary, a 68-year-old resident. “I’m just going to have to leave it and hope for the best.”

In a statement issued Tuesday, Smitty’s Supply apologized to the community and its employees. One of the plant executives’ daughters, Bethany Tate, however, said in a Facebook post that “no one was to blame.” An investigation on the cause of the explosion is underway.

Taylor and Moore, who both said they routinely saw chemical fires in the plant, took exception to that comment.

“They never gave us [personal protective equipment] when we worked there, and it smelled just like this. Now we’re going to be walking in and touching oil for weeks,” Moore said.

Since 2020, Smitty’s has faced five serious labor violations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, including four for grease fires and one for a fatal incident, where a worker was struck and killed by a trailer.

The company has vowed to rebuild. Residents told Capital B they have mixed feelings about the facility’s possible return because of the health risks. Despite those concerns, some here would welcome the economic benefits of a new facility.

More than half of Roseland residents — and 90% of its children — live in poverty. In the town of 1,200, Smitty’s, which employed roughly 450 people, was an economic lifesaver. Without it, some residents said it will be harder for people to support themselves financially.

“People are gonna find themselves in the trenches,” Taylor said.

With Environmental Protections Erased, Residents Fend for Themselves

About 1.5 miles away from the plant, Patricia Thomas was mopping the black sheen from her kitchen floor on Tuesday morning when the smell grabbed her throat. Her eyes burned, and the oily grit stuck to her shoes, tracking in from her yard. In her front yard, her green bushes had turned gray, and the mailbox was stuck shut with the black substance that had rained down in the explosion. She has to keep her great‑grandbaby away now. Even her cats, who often go outside, often return to her house streaked in a tar-like substance.

The 65-year-old said she survives on her $450 per month Social Security income. A week ago, she charged over $1,000 on her credit card at Home Depot for new wood paneling for her trailer and paid roofers to lay fresh shingles to stop a leak. The panels are now speckled and tacky to the touch, the shingles already lifting.

“They’re acting like no one is responsible, but I know for sure who isn’t responsible — we didn’t do it,” she said. “Who is paying for it?”

Thomas, who retired early due to health reasons, said issues with her back and shoulders make it difficult for her to scrub the black mystery substance that now coats her porch, fencing, and floors. She is afraid to touch any of it, afraid not to.

“This stuff could kill me if I touch it,” she said, “but what about if I keep tracking it in my house, too?”

At a community meeting on Monday, where many attendees expressed anger that no representatives from Smitty’s Supply or its insurance company were present, neighbors were advised to consult a civil lawyer. Already, six residents have filed lawsuits against the company. But Thomas did the math and shook her head.

“I don’t have money for a lawyer,” she said. “I barely cover my bills.” If there is a class action, maybe she will be included, she said. Otherwise, she worries she will be left to choose between breathing toxic this air and going deeper into debt to clean a mess she did not make.

Both Thomas and Mary said their anxiety levels have already increased.

Following a similar chemical fire in Illinois in 2021, a government survey found that half of the neighboring city’s residents experienced new or worsened health issues. And in 2019, a similar explosion led to residents in France reporting increased stress, depression, insomnia, and anxiety for a year after the event.

Just a year ago, residents in this majority-Black, low-income town would have had the legal right and avenue to petition the government to investigate the company and the disaster for elements of discrimination and wrongdoing. It would also be more difficult for the company to secure pollution permits to reopen operations.

Today, they said they’re left with complimentary water bottles and cleaning supplies.

“In the long run, this is gonna mess up for a long time, and they don’t care because of who lives here,” Taylor said, referring to what she sees as discrimination against Black people. “We don’t know what’s in this air right now or what might be in our water and bodies.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/explosion.webp,N,,2025-08-30 03:59:50.180914

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the Alliance for the Climate Transition (ACT), and the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) applaud Governor Healey for taking decisive action through SMART 3.0 to ensure cost-effective solar generation can come online at a time when federal policies and red tape are raising energy prices.

SMART 3.0 demonstrates the Commonwealth’s commitment to protecting ratepayers, supporting local jobs and meeting growing electricity demand. The Final Regulations and the plans for the initial years of the program clear a path for projects that can leverage the expiring federal tax credits. At a time when we need every electron we can get, solar and storage can come online faster than any other technology and SMART 3.0 will help make that happen.

“The Healey-Driscoll Administration’s release of SMART 3.0 charts a strong path for community and commercial scale solar and storage in Massachusetts and will be critical for driving down energy costs for families,” said Valessa Souter-Kline, SEIA’s Northeast regional director. “We look forward to working with state leaders on implementation to ensure the solar and storage industry continues to create good jobs and can deliver clean, reliable, affordable energy that people across Massachusetts are demanding.”

“With SMART 3.0, Gov. Healey and the DOER team have risen to the occasion to tackle the challenges of our energy system head on,” said Kate Daniel, Northeast Regional Director for CCSA. “Going big on solar now is the best way to unlock affordable, local, clean energy generation for the Commonwealth, while putting savings into the pockets of the energy consumers who need them most.”

“Given the difficult federal climate, it is more important than ever that states step up to play a leading role in strategically crafting thoughtful, targeted programs to unleash clean energy and address rising energy costs,” said Tim Snyder, ACT’s VP of Public Policy and Government Affairs. “That is what the Healey-Driscoll Administration has done with SMART 3.0. We are excited to engage with the legislature and administration to shape legislation that complements these regulations and creates the right landscape for solar projects of all sizes and types, from residential to large arrays.”

The updated program builds on a proven track record while making needed improvements to respond to market conditions on an annual basis, rather than keeping the former rigid pricing structure intact. It addresses implementation challenges raised in the review process to make sure program requirements for site selection and energy storage achieve their intended policy goals. The SMART 3.0 rules aim to better serve low-income customers and improve consumer confidence in solar.

Experts are available for interview.

The executive order comes after President Trump signed his ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ into law earlier this year. The new law eliminates federal tax credits for clean energy projects that do not begin construction by July 2026 or come online by the end of 2027.

This, in addition to other actions taken by the Trump administration, puts hundreds of projects in California at risk of stalling and makes energy more expensive for consumers. These projects will create thousands of good-paying jobs, power thousands of homes, and add critical clean electricity capacity to the state’s power grid.

Full text of the Governor’s executive order is available here.

No other state in the nation has built as much clean energy as fast as California – it’s why we just recently became the largest economy on the planet to be powered by two-thirds clean electricity.

While Trump and Republicans want to bring back the days of dirty coal powering our homes, polluting our air and increasing our electric bills, California will continue our decades of progress building our affordable, clean, reliable energy future.

Governor Gavin Newsom

Trump’s biased, 19th century energy policies mean dirtier, more expensive electricity and higher risk of power outages. A recent study by Energy Innovation expects Californians to pay over $320 more a year for energy thanks to Trump’s backward energy policies. Overall, Americans will be forced to pay $170 billion in added costs on their energy bills while hundreds of thousands of jobs are lost and hundreds of thousands of megawatts in added electricity capacity never get built.

Today’s executive order:

Designates the Energy Working Group of the Governor’s Infrastructure Strike Team to track projects eligible for tax credits and state agencies’ actions to accelerate clean energy project development.

Directs relevant state agencies to prioritize actions within their purview that support projects beginning construction before July 4, 2026 or coming online by December 31, 2027 to capture the expiring federal tax credits.

Directs state energy agencies to assess actions both to capture expiring clean energy tax credits and to further expedite clean energy deployment, and to submit recommendations to the Governor for consideration.

The Governor also continues to work with the Legislature to enable the expansion of regional energy markets to lower energy costs, reduce air pollution, and avoid power outages.

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period.

The state also continues to set clean energy records. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available – the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy. The state has run on 100% clean electricity for some part of the day almost every day this year.

Since the beginning of the Newsom Administration, battery storage is up to over 15,000 megawatts – a 1,900%+ increase, and over 25,000 megawatts of new resources have been added to the electric grid.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/clean-energy-EO-3.png,N,,2025-08-30 05:59:19.791437

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed.
The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon.
In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV.
One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV.","(TestMiles) – Toyota is investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and EVs, but rumors continue to swirl about even bolder future products. Separating fact from speculation matters for both buyers and industry insiders.

Why does this matter right now?

Toyota is not dabbling in electrification; it is betting billions. Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is scheduled to open soon with fourteen lines for hybrid and battery output. The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory. By focusing on hybrids with premium touches, Toyota continues to exploit an efficiency gap while rivals rush into full battery electric territory.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you are an industry professional, this story underlines where Toyota is putting its real money. For consumers, it clarifies what is available now, the Crown sedan and Signia SUV, and what will be available soon, namely, Toyota’s first U.S.-built EVs. Enthusiasts and speculators, however, will want to lean into the second half of this story: the rumors Toyota is not confirming.

And Now for the Speculation: Toyota is not confirming.

This is where things get interesting. Industry chatter often fills the vacuum left by Toyota’s conservative announcements. Some speculation is logical, some fanciful, and all of it has been downplayed by Toyota spokesperson Nathan Kokes, who has emphasized that only announcements made by Toyota should be considered fact. Kokes went on to tell us, “To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana”.

Kokes went on to say, “As previously announced, Toyota plans to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Toyota will now assemble both vehicles at Toyota Kentucky.” And “Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume”. Finally, Kokes gave some insight into Toyota’s commitment to its workforce by saying, “We remain committed to providing long-term job stability for our team members.”

But the speculation from some persists. One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV. Outlets often label it the “bZ5X,” following Toyota’s bZ (beyond zero) naming convention. Others expect a Lexus version called the “TZ.” Toyota has never confirmed these names, and official channels continue to describe the projects simply as future three-row battery electric SUVs.

The Crown line is another hotbed of rumor. In Japan, the Crown family includes sedan, crossover, sport, and estate body styles. Some observers expect Toyota to expand the U.S. Crown line beyond the sedan and Signia SUV, potentially with a larger three-row premium vehicle or a sportier fastback. At this time, Toyota has not confirmed such plans, but marketing material in the U.S. clearly positions Crown as a “family” of models, hinting at long-term potential.

Trucks and off-roaders draw even more speculation. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed the EPU concept, a compact electric pickup with a footprint similar to a Ford Maverick. Many expect this to morph into a U.S. product, but Toyota has never confirmed American production. Similarly, Toyota showed the Compact Cruiser EV, a boxy small SUV in the vein of an FJ or Bronco Sport rival. Rumors continue that Toyota could launch a rugged EV or hybrid under the Land Cruiser or FJ nameplates, but again, no confirmation exists. The only rugged revival officially on the books is the Land Cruiser hybrid, which is already in American showrooms.

There are even whispers of a new sub-brand dedicated to electrification. Commentators suggest Toyota could spin off its EVs into a distinct nameplate, following the path of Lexus in the 1980s or Prius in the 2000s. Toyota has never acknowledged this idea, and so far, the closest evidence is the consistent branding of “bZ” on its vehicles.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term view is two-sided. On the one hand, the confirmed investments are enormous and concrete. North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana will become the core of Toyota’s American electrification strategy, and the Crown family already plants Toyota’s premium flag between Toyota and Lexus. On the other hand, the speculation illustrates the appetite for Toyota to do more: a compact truck to take on Ford, a rugged EV to challenge Bronco, or a broader Crown brand to pull buyers away from Acura and Infiniti. For now, those remain rumors, and Toyota has made it clear that only official announcements are the truth.",https://www.wjtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2025/08/Tacoma_Overlanding_Concept_Action_SEMA_2021_Hi-Res_15-600x400-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 00:59:26.160904

Historical trends from the early 2010s, when initial EV incentives waned, saw used prices stabilize or even rise temporarily as supply tightened.
In Q3 2025 reports, used EV prices are already volatile, with models like the Nissan Leaf dropping 15% year-over-year amid subsidy jitters.
Will used EV values tank due to lost affordability, or rise as the cheaper alternative?","As the clock ticks toward September 30, 2025, the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits are set to expire, marking the end of a significant era in U.S. auto policy. Under the current system, buyers of new EVs can claim up to $7,500, while used models qualify for up to $4,000—subsidies designed to boost adoption amid climate goals. But with Congress passing legislation to terminate these incentives, the ""Fed money"" vanishes, leaving a big question: What happens to new and used EV prices? Will used values soar or plummet? Will new prices drop to lure buyers, or will sales simply freeze?

Let's break it down. For new EVs, the removal of the $7,500 credit effectively hikes the cost to consumers overnight. Economists argue this could dampen demand, especially as EVs already face hurdles like charging infrastructure and range anxiety. Manufacturers like Tesla, Ford, and GM might respond by slashing MSRPs or offering deeper discounts to maintain volume—similar to how the industry reacted to past incentive phase-outs. However, if production costs remain high due to battery prices and supply chain issues, prices could hold steady, leading to a sales slowdown rather than a drop. Recent data shows uncertainty is already fueling a rush in 2025 sales, with new EV registrations up amid fears of post-subsidy sticker shock. But once the credits end, analysts predict a potential 20-30% dip in demand, forcing automakers to choose between profit margins and market share.

The used EV market adds another layer of complexity. Without the $4,000 credit, affordability takes a hit, potentially tanking values as budget-conscious buyers shy away. Yet, some experts counter that higher effective new EV prices could drive shoppers to used options, propping up resale values. Historical trends from the early 2010s, when initial EV incentives waned, saw used prices stabilize or even rise temporarily as supply tightened. Factors like battery degradation and warranty concerns could exacerbate depreciation, though a growing surplus in U.S. battery manufacturing might indirectly lower repair costs, supporting values. In Q3 2025 reports, used EV prices are already volatile, with models like the Nissan Leaf dropping 15% year-over-year amid subsidy jitters.

Overall, the post-subsidy landscape hinges on broader economics: If gas prices spike or state incentives fill the void, EVs might weather the storm. But a full removal could impose societal costs exceeding $33 billion, per recent analyses, by slowing the shift from fossil fuels.

So, readers, what's your call? Will used EV values tank due to lost affordability, or rise as the cheaper alternative? Will new prices plummet to keep showrooms buzzing, or will sales halt until tech advances catch up? Drop your predictions in the comments for bragging rights when the dust settles—history will judge the boldest forecasters!",,N,,2025-08-30 12:05:30.954893

Conclusion: A Golden Age for Grid Infrastructure The Southeast's grid modernization is not merely a technical upgrade—it is a strategic pivot toward a resilient, low-carbon economy.
As the 50 States of Grid Modernization report underscores, the Southeast is no longer on the sidelines of the renewable revolution.","The Southeastern United States is undergoing a transformative shift in its energy infrastructure, driven by the dual imperatives of decarbonization and surging electricity demand. As climate policies tighten and renewable energy adoption accelerates, the region is prioritizing strategic investments in hydroelectric efficiency and grid expansion. These initiatives are not only critical for aligning with national clean energy targets but also present compelling opportunities for investors seeking long-term, high-impact returns.

Transmission Expansion: Bridging Markets and Resources

The Southern Spirit Transmission project, a flagship initiative under the federal Transmission Facilitation Program, exemplifies the Southeast's commitment to grid modernization. This 320-mile, 525 kV HVDC line, funded with up to $360 million in federal support, connects the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) with the Southeastern grid. By enabling 3,000 MW of bidirectional capacity, the project enhances regional energy resilience and facilitates the flow of renewable resources—particularly solar and wind from Texas—into the Southeast.

Such infrastructure is vital for addressing the region's growing electricity demand, projected to rise by 30% by 2040 due to population growth and industrialization. For investors, this project underscores the importance of transmission assets in enabling decarbonization. Companies like Southern Spirit Transmission, LLC and contractors involved in HVDC technology (e.g., Siemens Energy, ABB Ltd.) are poised to benefit from similar projects nationwide.

Hydroelectric Efficiency: Unlocking Legacy Assets

While solar and wind dominate headlines, hydroelectric power remains a cornerstone of the Southeast's renewable portfolio. The U.S. Department of Energy's Maintaining and Enhancing Hydroelectricity Incentives program has allocated $430 million to upgrade aging hydropower facilities, including Santee Cooper's Jefferies Hydroelectric Station in South Carolina. These upgrades—such as replacing outdated turbines with high-efficiency models—boost output by 3% or more while improving grid stability during extreme weather.

Hydro's role in decarbonization is often underestimated. Unlike intermittent renewables, hydro provides dispatchable power and grid inertia, making it a critical partner in a 100% clean energy future. Investors should monitor companies like Kern and Tule Hydro LLC, which are leveraging federal incentives to modernize infrastructure, as well as engineering firms specializing in hydroelectric retrofitting.

Policy and Market Alignment: A Tailwind for Investors

The Southeast's grid modernization efforts are bolstered by a robust policy framework. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act have injected billions into transmission and renewable projects, while states like Virginia and North Carolina are adopting performance-based regulation to incentivize clean energy adoption. The Q2 2025 50 States of Grid Modernization report highlights 77 energy storage deployments and 35 smart grid initiatives in the region, signaling a regulatory environment conducive to innovation.

For example, Virginia's virtual power plant mandate and Georgia's distribution system planning reforms are creating markets for distributed energy resources (DERs) and energy storage. These trends align with the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program's focus on advanced conductor technologies and dynamic line ratings, which could expand transmission capacity without costly new lines.

Investment Strategy: Where to Allocate Capital

Transmission Developers and Contractors: Prioritize firms involved in HVDC technology, substation upgrades, and interregional grid projects. The Southern Spirit Transmission line is a model for future investments, with similar projects likely in the Southeast and Midwest.

Hydroelectric Modernization Firms: Target companies with expertise in turbine retrofitting and dam safety upgrades. Federal funding programs ensure a steady pipeline of projects through 2030.

Energy Storage and Grid-Enhancing Technologies: As the Southeast integrates more renewables, demand for battery storage, dynamic line ratings, and microgrid solutions will surge. States with procurement mandates (e.g., Texas, North Carolina) offer high-growth opportunities.

Performance-Based Regulation (PBR) Advocates: Utilities adopting PBR frameworks, such as Duke Energy and Southern Company, are better positioned to fund modernization while aligning with decarbonization goals.

Conclusion: A Golden Age for Grid Infrastructure

The Southeast's grid modernization is not merely a technical upgrade—it is a strategic pivot toward a resilient, low-carbon economy. With federal funding, state-level innovation, and private-sector collaboration, the region is setting a blueprint for the U.S. energy transition. For investors, this represents a unique window to capitalize on infrastructure that will underpin the next decade of clean energy growth.

As the 50 States of Grid Modernization report underscores, the Southeast is no longer on the sidelines of the renewable revolution. It is now a central player—and the best time to invest is when the transformation is already underway.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 00:59:07.619865

The moment, broadcast live by Good Morning America, follows the finalization of all installation works at the project site, including full installation of all wave energy floaters; connection of hydraulic pipes and supporting infrastructure; and placement of the onshore energy conversion unit.

With installation completed, Eco Wave Power has now officially entered the operational phase of its U.S. excursion. The company will host a formal unveiling ceremony on September 9, 2025, at AltaSea at the Port of Los Angeles.

“Seeing our floaters lowered into the water for the first time and having it shared live on Good Morning America is a moment of great pride, not only for Eco Wave Power but for the future of clean energy innovation,” said Inna Braverman, founder and CEO of Eco Wave Power. “This pilot station is a vital step in demonstrating how wave energy can be harnessed using existing marine infrastructure, while laying the groundwork for full-scale commercialization in the United States.”

Braverman, a Chernobyl survivor with an incredible success story and vision for wave energy, was profiled by Factor This earlier this year.

The Los Angeles project is designed as a demonstration station, with the following objectives:

Showcase Eco Wave Power’s patented onshore technology in U.S. marine conditions

Support environmental monitoring and regulatory processes in collaboration with local stakeholders and authorities, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Serve as an educational hub for industry partners, regulators, and potential customers

Establish a foundation for future grid-connected commercial wave energy projects in the U.S.

Eco Wave Power’s patented onshore wave energy system attaches floaters to existing marine structures. The up-and-down motion of the waves drives hydraulic cylinders, which send pressurized fluid to a land-based energy conversion unit that generates electricity.

The company argues that its technology is modular, low-maintenance, and “designed for minimal environmental impact.” The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that wave energy has the potential to generate over 1,400 terawatt-hours per year—enough to power approximately 130 million homes.

According to the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), this new project is essential for California to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction goals and the resilience and modernization of the electrical grid in Southern California by offering a new, critical pathway in a currently constrained area. Increasing transmission capacity across the region will help reduce unnecessary costs of congestion, integrate more clean energy, and expand access to resources in the Imperial Valley and the Southwest.

“We are proud to undertake a project that is so vital to California’s customers. We must continue to strengthen our energy grid to meet the growing demand for electricity in the Southern California region and to advance the state’s clean energy goals – all while keeping affordability front and center,” said SDG&E President Scott Crider. “We will work closely with customers and communities through a robust stakeholder engagement process to ensure this critical line gets built responsibly.”

This transmission pathway was recognized in CAISO’s 2022-2023 Transmission Plan, which identified the need for 45 transmission projects throughout the state, including this project.

Costs to build and upgrade high-voltage transmission lines (200kV or higher) that provide statewide benefits are proportionately distributed among all California customers within CAISO’s Balancing Authority Area and governed by the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission. This is important because the costs of building transmission projects are shared across California, helping to limit the estimated cost impact on SDG&E customers to approximately 9%, based on current data.

SDG&E is well positioned to deliver this project, backed by a proven track record in developing critical energy infrastructure – from large-scale transmission lines to advanced battery storage systems. The company will also integrate its nationally recognized wildfire safety program into the project. This award-winning initiative has helped prevent a catastrophic utility-caused wildfire for nearly 18 years, underscoring SDG&E’s commitment to safety and resilience.

Importantly, SDG&E will begin an extensive community engagement process where the public will have multiple opportunities to submit feedback on ways to ensure the project is built responsibly as part of the state and federal permitting process. Construction on the transmission line is expected to begin in 2029, with a target in-service date of 2032, subject to obtaining necessary state and federal agency approvals and permits.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,'' an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,'' spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA ""has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,'' she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency's largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,'' said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.""

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees. Officials expect total staffing to go down to about 12,500, a reduction of more than 3,700 employees, or nearly 23%, from staffing levels when Trump took office in January.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/preview-2202.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 02:59:23.521889

“It’s madness to stop a project that already had permits,” said Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and manager for Sea Services who voted for Trump.
The cooperative helped build Ørsted’s South Fork Wind — America’s first large-scale offshore wind farm, which went online last year.
Commercial fishermen have spent a total of 1,109 days working at sea for Revolution Wind, according to Yerman.
Fishermen are paid for the days they work, not for standby,” Gordon Videll, CEO of Sea Services, told Canary Media.","The Trump administration’s order to stop construction of the nearly completed Revolution Wind project is putting hundreds of offshore workers out of a job — including dozens of local fishermen who voted for President Donald Trump and are asking him to reverse course.

A week ago, the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, ordered the Danish wind developer Ørsted to stop all offshore work on the Revolution Wind farm so the federal government can​“address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.” Giacona did not specify the nature of those security concerns.

Construction began on the 704-megawatt project in January 2024 and is now 80% complete, according to Ørsted. The wind farm is being built off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island in a federally designated ​“wind energy area” that received sign-offs from multiple branches of the military, Canary Media reported Sunday.

Though often seen as opposed to offshore wind, many New England fishermen have made peace with the industry in recent years.

They increasingly rely on part-time salaries from wind companies as fishing revenues dry up. Over the past two years, Ørsted put 80 fishermen to work on the Revolution Wind project, paying out $9.5 million to captains, deckhands, and fishing boat owners, according to Gary Yerman, a Connecticut-based fisherman who founded and leads a fisher cooperative called Sea Services North America, which has an active contract to work on Revolution Wind.

“Most of us are Trump voters, and we still believe in a leader who builds. That’s why we’re asking President Trump to reverse the stop-work order issued to Revolution Wind by Interior,” Yerman told Canary Media.

The stop-work order echoes a similar one the Interior Department gave in April that froze all offshore work on New York’s Empire Wind project — a move that grounded Sea Services’ fishermen for a month, until Trump lifted the ban.

Yerman and other commercial fishermen remained quiet the last time Trump’s assault on a wind farm put them out of work. This time they’re speaking out.

“It’s madness to stop a project that already had permits,” said Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and manager for Sea Services who voted for Trump. ​“This is not something any of us planned for: the captains, the crew, the shore engineers, the people we buy food from for our trips.”

Ørsted was one of the first firms building turbines in U.S. waters to employ local fishermen, offering Sea Services a contract in 2021 to perform safety and scout tasks. The cooperative helped build Ørsted’s South Fork Wind — America’s first large-scale offshore wind farm, which went online last year.

Today, it’s common for wind developers to rely on local U.S. fishermen. Avangrid and Vineyard Offshore, codevelopers of the embattled Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, have paid out about $8 million over the past two years directly to local fishermen and vessel owners.

“If the infrastructure and pilings are already in, what good is stopping now?” fisherman Tony Alvernaz told Canary Media when asked about the Revolution Wind pause. A Massachusetts fisherman unaffiliated with Sea Services, Alvernaz works part-time for Vineyard Wind, assisting with the ongoing construction of its 62 turbines. Of those, 17 are already sending power to the grid.

Alvernaz is concerned about the Trump administration’s pattern of halting wind projects without warning and with little justification. Trump has already pressed pause on two of the five offshore wind farms currently under construction in America today.

Trump putting fishermen out of work

In a statement Monday, an Ørsted spokesperson said Revolution Wind supports more than 2,500 jobs around the U.S., including ​“hundreds” of local offshore jobs.

Commercial fishermen have spent a total of 1,109 days working at sea for Revolution Wind, according to Yerman. Now, sitting at the docks due to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, the 15 fishermen who planned to be at sea, working 10-day shifts throughout this month, will get paid nothing.

“Our cooperative only invoices when our boats are on active duty. Fishermen are paid for the days they work, not for standby,” Gordon Videll, CEO of Sea Services, told Canary Media. The group is calling on Trump to lift the ban so that its members can resume the job, which would have involved eight more fishermen helping with an offshore substation this fall.

The extra income from Revolution Wind has been a lifeline, particularly for scallop fishermen who, in recent years, have been severely restricted in how much they can fish.

Strict federal quotas have been put in place to allow scallop populations to rebuild after years of being overfished, according to Morris, but that has meant scallopers — who form the majority of Sea Services’ members — are off the water for about 10 months a year.

Before the pause on Revolution Wind, scalloper Kevin Souza expected to make an additional $200,000 working on the project as a part-time boat captain for two years. Souza told Canary Media in February that, had he stuck to scalloping alone, he’d be ​“lucky” to earn $100,000 in a single year. The deckhands he hires only bring in around $30,000 per year working on scallop boats, but the offshore wind gig makes it possible for them to earn a ​“middle-class wage,” said Souza.

Souza has recruited both of his sons, his nephew, and other young people from longtime fishing families to work for the wind industry. They might have otherwise left the scallop industry if not for the supplemental income, he said.

Losing faith in Trump

As a group, America’s commercial fishermen have long been loyal to Trump. Last week’s order is shaking that confidence.

“I can’t think of one guy who isn’t a Trumper in our co-op. We’re blue-collar guys (and some gals too) who get up before dawn, work with our hands, and we trusted him to look out for us. The truth is, we love President Trump,” Yerman said.

In New Bedford, Massachusetts, home to the country’s most profitable fishing port, ​“TRUMP 2024” flags fly from dozens of boats docked in the harbor. A few of those crews work for the offshore wind companies, and at least one captain lowers his MAGA flag before setting out to the wind farms, according to Rodney Avila, a Sea Services fisherman.

That kind of faith makes Trump’s pause on Revolution Wind even more gutting.

“It’s like having the rug pulled out from under you. … Nobody understands why Trump did it. I don’t know what Trump’s agenda is,” said Morris.

Trump’s attacks on wind have dried up job prospects for local fishermen up and down the East Coast. His administration’s hostile actions have thrown sand in the gears of a New Jersey wind farm that planned to start construction in the next three years, Maryland’s first offshore wind farm, and another wind project off the coast of Maine.

In addition to targeting individual projects, the Trump administration has initiated policies intended to undermine the entire sector: killing offshore wind leasing, pausing permitting for wind farms, and sunsetting tax credits critical to their economic viability.

Many fishermen, including those who have pocketed thousands by working at offshore wind farms, remain wary of the companies building turbines out at sea.

“No fisherman loves new structures in the water, but we all have grandkids,” Roy Campanale, a Sea Services member based in Rhode Island, told Canary Media. ​“We’ve lived with the water getting warmer, watched the fish move north, and had to adapt again and again.”

Alvernaz voted for Trump and opposes certain wind farms that he believes pose a risk to his favorite fishing grounds. He said that he does not support Revolution Wind due to its placement on Cox Ledge, a swath of seabed identified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as critical habitat for Atlantic cod.

“Something about national defense? How can it be an issue of national defense if there are other wind farms out there with the same technology?” pondered Alvernaz. ​“It’s kind of odd.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Fishing-boats-New-Bedford-State-Pier.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=c16edac04a098db36a6d1e4a035923e5,N,,2025-08-29 23:59:09.222944

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

READ MORE: Democratic governors demand Trump resume offshore wind project near Rhode Island

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/2025-08-26T140459Z_687643563_RC21FGA36LNZ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRANSPORTATION-DUFFY-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 23:59:18.650513

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,” an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,” spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees.

If the US is going to build massive new LNG terminals in the Gulf of Mozambique or whatever that body of water between Texas and Florida is called today, it will need plenty of customers for that climate-killing fuel. By definition, exports are not intended for domestic customers, so all that lovely liquid death is intended for people and industries in places other than America.

When the so-called president declared an “energy emergency” earlier this year, he meant that he intended to reward the fossil fuel interests who spent so much money to help him get elected. When he proclaimed his intention to establish “energy dominance,” he meant the US would now supplant OPEC as the top dog on the international energy stage.

During the now infamous three-hour cabinet meeting last week, where all the MAGA faithful competed to be the biggest suck-up to the Pharaoh Of The Potomac, our Dear Leader crowed that he was trying his best to get other nations that have clean energy and climate initiatives as part of their national planning to see the error of their ways.

“I’m trying to have people learn about wind real fast, and I think I’ve done a good job, but not good enough because some countries are still trying,” he said, and added that countries were “destroying themselves” with wind energy. “I hope they get back to fossil fuels,” he said. According to a report by Lisa Friedman of the New York Times, two weeks ago, the failing administration promised to punish countries by imposing tariffs, visa restrictions, and port fees on them if they vote for a global agreement to slash greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping sector.

A few days later in Geneva, the Trump US joined Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries to oppose limits on the production of petroleum-based plastics. “They are clearly using various tools in an attempt to increase the use of fossil fuels around the world instead of decrease,” said Jennifer Morgan, Germany’s former special envoy for climate action,

Chris Wright, the fracking billionaire who is now the head of the US Energy Department, warned that the United States could end its support for the International Energy Agency because it predicted that global demand for oil would peak this decade instead of continue to climb. He proclaimed to Europeans in April that they faced a choice between the “freedom and sovereignty” of abundant fossil fuels and the policies of “climate alarmism” that would make them less prosperous.

Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said the goal of the administration was “restoring America’s energy dominance, ensuring energy independence to protect our national security and driving down costs for American families and businesses. The…..administration will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals.”

Most CleanTechnica readers will be surprised to hear that taking prudent steps to keep the Earth habitable for humans is a “vague climate goal,” but that is the sort of drivel one gets form people infected with a MAGA mind virus.

Alarm On The Continent

Many European officials are alarmed by the amount of pressure the US is exerting on their countries, especially in light of the catastrophic heat waves that have blanketed the Continent in recent years. Lisa Friedman writes that the vast majority of scientists agree a transition away from oil, gas, and coal and toward clean energy resources like wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro power is essential to avoid making climate change more severe.

“At this moment in time it is absolutely imperative that countries double down, triple down, on their collaboration in the face of the climate crisis to not allow the active efforts for a fossil fuel world by the Trump administration succeed,” Jennifer Morgan said.

The alleged president has been pursuing a vendetta against wind energy ever since Scotland approved an offshore wind installation that is visible from his golf emporium in that country 14 years ago. When he met with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, earlier this year, he denounced wind power as a “con job” and claimed that wind turbines drive birds “loco.”

Shortly thereafter he met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and called wind energy “a disaster.” He added that “Wind needs massive subsidies, and you are paying in Scotland and in U.K., and in all over the place where they have them, massive subsidies to have these ugly monsters all over the place.”

This maladministration is “actively trying to undermine countries” on global warming, David Goldwyn, an energy consultant, told Friedman. Several diplomats from other countries said that the administration has used increasingly aggressive tactics to influence international energy policies.

In February, Chris Wright told a conference in London via video that net zero is a “sinister goal” and criticized a British law that makes becoming net zero by 2050 a national goal. In March, the maladministration denounced the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which were adopted by nations unanimously in 2015 and include such woke ideas as addressing poverty, hunger, and climate change. The administration said “the government of the United States must refocus on the interests of Americans,” which apparently means combating “climate ideology.”

Just this month, the US government announced it would reject the agreement reached by the members of the International Maritime Organization to impose a fee on carbon emissions from shipping. The US said it would “not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens” against other countries that support the shipping fee.

“You see a more systematic attempt to be a fossil fuel first strategy to everything that they do,” Jake Schmidt, director of international programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told Friedman. He added that the administration may slow the transition to clean energy by other countries but cannot stop it.

Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment at the Heritage Foundation, which spawned the agenda of grievance and hate known as Project 2025, told Friedman the administration was doing the right thing by pressuring countries to reject renewable energy.

“Europe is coming to the United States saying, ‘Help defend us against Russia, help us with Ukraine,’” she said. “Where at the same time, they’re spending $350 billion a year on green energy investments that are slowing their economies. It doesn’t seem to make very much sense to the administration. I think we’re going to see more pressure.”

Paul Krugman On Allies & Power

Paul Krugman is highly critical of how the US is alienating its allies. On August 29, he wrote on Substack, “The Pax Americana that emerged after World War II — and basically ended on January 20, 2025 — was, in many ways, an American Empire…. We built international economic and military alliances to support a world order in effect designed to U.S. specifications.

“In 1947 a conference in Geneva established the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which set the ground rules for — tariffs and trade. The GATT in turn became the foundation for the World Trade Organization, established in 1994.

“NATO is another international institution create by the US in partnership with its allies. It has always been a partnership of equals. While the NATO military commander has always been an American, the Secretary General has always been a European,” Krugman wrote.

“The current occupant of the White House clearly has no use for subtlety and understatement. In just 7 months Trump has completely ripped up the foundations of the Pax Americana,” Krugman said. “Almost all his tariffs are clearly in violation of the GATT, yet Trump has vandalized the world trading system as casually as he has paved over the Rose Garden. We haven’t yet had a test of whether he would honor our obligations under NATO, but he’s said that his willingness to abide by the most central obligation, the guarantee of mutual defense, ‘depends on your definition.’

“Trump’s foreign policy doctrine appears to be Oderint dum metuant — let them hate as long as they fear — supposedly the favorite motto of the Emperor Caligula. America, he seems to believe, is so powerful that it doesn’t need allies; he can bully the world into doing his bidding.

“Whatever Trump may imagine, the world doesn’t fear us. For example, Trump may have imagined that his tariffs would bring India crawling to him, begging for relief. Instead, India seems to be moving to closer ties with China. In fact, not only does the world not fear us; increasingly, it doesn’t need us. This is even true for nations that used to depend on U.S. military aid.

“One of the many problems with the slogan Make America Great Again was that America already was great. Now, not so much. In a world in which America is no longer the dominant economic and military power it once was — measured by purchasing power, China’s economy is already 30 percent larger than ours — our role in world affairs depends, even more than it did in the past, on having willing allies who trust our promises.”

Krugman ends with this analysis: “We used to be very good at having allies. But Trump has flushed all of that down the golden toilet.”

Alienating Allies Is A Fool’s Game

The damage being done is incalculable. After the first attempt at governing by the man who would be king, the world decided to forgive and forget when adults started running the US government again. They thought America had learned its lesson. They will not be so quick to forget after Americans decided last November, “Yeah, we want more of that.” Repairing the damage from this clown show will take decades, during which America’s leadership on the world stage will be like that of all former empires — nattering on the sidelines about how things used to be and plotting how to regain their former prominence.

The deliberate assault on America’s allies is likely to benefit one nation most of all — China. With its focus on clean energy and electrification of all segments of its economy, China will become the leader of the world’s nations, not least because the US chose to give up its pursuit of education and science to concentrate on grievances and settling scores — real and imagined.

That is not to say that China is prefect; it is not. But it is intent on preserving the Earth as a place where humans can continue to flourish. The US, on the other hand, is doing everything it can to ramp up the destruction of the environment in every way possible. That is a strategy sure to make other nations turn their backs on America and go in search of other allies.

In retrospect, Project 2025 won’t make the US great, it will make the US irrelevant. When historians ask who is responsible for the destruction of America, their search will lead them to the Heritage Foundation and its paterfamilias, Charles Koch. Trump is merely a puppet; Koch is the one pulling the strings. If you are in doubt about the accuracy of that assertion, pick up a copy of Jane Mayer’s Dark Money and be prepared to be frightened out of your wits.

Under the influence of Koch and the MAGAlomaniacs, the US will soon find itself on the outside looking in. When it needs a friend, no one will answer the call. Then and only then with the full extent of the damage done to America by this administration become apparent for all to see.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-30-2025-01_49_51-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-08-29 23:00:34.065987

Car and Electric Vehicle Financing","Electric vehicles have been gaining popularity in the U.S. In 2024, sales were up 7.3% from 2023, with 1.3 million plug-in electric cars sold. If you’re getting ready to buy a car, you may be wondering if you should get in on the action or stick with a tried-and-true gas-powered vehicle.

Cutting out fuel costs is appealing, but are electric vehicles, or EVs, cheaper to operate and maintain overall? Adding up the dollars and cents is not as cut and dry as it sounds. In this article from The Police Credit Union, we’ll show you how to weigh the price of owning an electric vehicle versus a gas-powered vehicle so you can make an informed decision when you buy your next set of wheels.

Create a Vehicle Budget

To compare costs, you’ll want to make a budget for each type of vehicle. Since buying a car is a big investment, you’ll probably want to include an auto loan in your budgeting, no matter which car you decide to buy. Take note that car loan interest rates and terms can vary depending on your credit history, the time of year you purchase the vehicle, and other factors. You’ll also want to account for maintenance, insurance, and other expenses for each type of car. All these items will have an impact on the final ownership costs.

Use our Savings Goal Calculator and Auto Rebate vs. Low Interest Financing Calculator to help add everything up.

Vehicle Purchase Price

Buying an EV typically comes with a heftier price tag than a traditional gas-powered car. However, the gap between gas and EV purchase prices has started to close in recent years. According to Cox Automotive, the parent company of Kelley Blue Book, the average price of an EV in July 2025 was $56,910 while the average gas-powered vehicle came in at only a few thousand dollars less, around $48,907.

Tax Credits and Incentives on Electric Vehicles

In an effort to promote the purchase of EVs, the federal government offers a tax credit of up to $7,500 for new EVs and is also paying out a $4,000 credit for used EVs through September 2025.

Many states also offer electric car incentives like rebates for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle or for purchasing a charging station. California currently offers numerous incentives, rebates, and rewards.

Maintenance and Insurance Costs

Since routine engine maintenance and oil changes aren’t needed on an EV, they’re cheaper to own in that respect. However, other repairs can be a different story.

Certain EV parts are much more expensive than parts for a gas-powered vehicle, so when repairs are required, they often cost more. For example, replacing the battery on a gas vehicle is typically around $100-200, while EV batteries start around $4,000 and, depending on the make and model of your car, can reach a staggering $20,000. Another thing to consider is locating an EV repair shop in your area with specially trained technicians. These mechanics can be harder to find depending on where you live, and may charge higher fees. So, how reliable the EV you buy proves to be can become a major factor in your ownership costs.

The higher costs to repair and replace an EV are the major contributor to higher insurance rates as well.

You may want to consult AAA’s Your Driving Cost fact sheet to get a better idea of how much you might pay in maintenance per mile to drive different types of vehicles.

The Cost of Fueling Up vs Plugging In

Charging an EV could be more attractive than fueling up a vehicle if you’re looking for more stability in your car expenses. Driving a gas-powered vehicle puts you at the mercy of historically unpredictable fuel prices that rise and fall depending on the economic climate, and sometimes causing serious pain at the pump. For example, the national average per gallon went from $2.17 in 2020 to $3.30 in 2024, with lots of other ups and downs over the last 20 years. So, while high fuel costs may not be stressing your budget at the moment, they could change anytime.

On the other side of the coin, when making an investment in an EV, you’ll likely need to pay to install a charger at your home unless you’re living in an apartment community that has this feature. A standard 120-volt outlet typically offers about 32 miles of range. If you want to be prepared for longer trips, you can get a Level 2, 240-volt outlet that can add 250 miles of range. Installation is around $2,000, but some states and local utility companies offer incentives to reduce the cost.

""That 5,000 megawatts, the estimate that's typically quoted is $7.5 billion,"" said Maxwell Brown, an economics and business assistant professor at the Colorado School of Mines.
The elimination of federal investment tax credits, which previously provided 30% off capital costs for renewable energy projects, will also increase expenses.
Angeline Letourneau, an associate professor focused on energy transitions at the Colorado School of Mines, said renewable energy jobs won't directly replace coal plant employment.
Despite funding allocated for economic alternatives in affected communities, Letourneau noted these resources often go toward infrastructure projects rather than creating new employment opportunities.","DENVER — Xcel Energy will close coal-fired power plants in Pueblo and Routt County within five years while building 5,000 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity under a framework approved by state regulators, potentially increasing average household electricity bills by 30%-50% by 2031.

The utility's “just transition” plan calls for replacing aging coal plants with wind farms, solar arrays and transmission infrastructure to meet growing power demands from data centers, population growth and future electrification needs.

""That 5,000 megawatts, the estimate that's typically quoted is $7.5 billion,"" said Maxwell Brown, an economics and business assistant professor at the Colorado School of Mines.

The cost will be passed on to customers through gradual rate increases.

""I think the average customer bill in Colorado is somewhere around $150 per month, and that's per household, and so, a 30% to 50% increase would be an extra $45 to $75 per month,"" Brown said.

He said that is in line with where bills should probably be by then.

Costs could climb higher, however, due to federal trade policies. Brown noted that proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, materials essential for wind turbines and solar panels, could add significant expenses to the project.

""The tariffs on steel and aluminum, you know, 50% tariffs are significant, and they make up a large portion of the cost for natural gas facilities, for wind and solar, especially wind turbines, there's a lot of steel in a wind turbine,"" Brown said. ""If we're talking $7.5 billion, that's somewhere between $0.9 and $1.1 billion extra.""

The elimination of federal investment tax credits, which previously provided 30% off capital costs for renewable energy projects, will also increase expenses. Brown estimates this could result in a 22%-23% cost increase compared to when credits were available.

The transition creates challenges for coal-dependent communities. Angeline Letourneau, an associate professor focused on energy transitions at the Colorado School of Mines, said renewable energy jobs won't directly replace coal plant employment.

""They're just not as labor-intensive as coal mining is,"" Letourneau said. ""It's not like we can build a bunch of solar farms or wind farms, and expect to employ everyone who is employed in a coal plant facility. Hence this need to create new jobs in other fields besides just energy.""

Despite funding allocated for economic alternatives in affected communities, Letourneau noted these resources often go toward infrastructure projects rather than creating new employment opportunities.

“They've put money in place to give economic alternatives to communities, but that hasn't really translated into new job opportunities yet,"" Letourneau said. ""It still often goes towards, kind of, community infrastructure projects that communities have been looking for funding for, and less so towards developing new economic opportunities in the future.""

Brown acknowledged the financial burden on customers but said the transition is necessary and not just happening in Colorado.

""In order to get there, it's going to cost money. And that's just the way of the world,"" Brown said. ""This isn't really unique to Colorado. There's a lot of places around the country that have these sort of mandates, that are facing this sort of uncertainty, that have even more aggressive clean energy targets or emissions reduction targets.""",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/739de345-4caa-450f-97f0-83a1ae91fa61/20250830T002240/739de345-4caa-450f-97f0-83a1ae91fa61_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 23:59:14.665374

The US is forecast to deploy nearly 378 gigawatt-hours of batteries by 2030, BloombergNEF said in a report, 56% lower than the group's forecast issued before Trump took office.

It means the country's battery makers face a looming overcapacity issue with 193 gigawatt-hours of batteries capacity online already and an additional 428 gigawatt-hours likely to be built out by 2030.

Batteries are a key component for electric vehicles, a segment that grew rapidly under the Biden administration.

But with the Trump administration rolling back federal incentives and phasing out tax credits for EV purchases, demand is expected to slow.

With 14 million fewer EVs expected to be sold in the US through 2030, that will be a hit to battery manufacturers.

""Stable regulatory support still matters for EV adoption,"" says Matthew Hales, a BNEF analyst specializing in trade and supply chains. ""President Trump has taken a wrecking ball to that support.""

Meanwhile, battery makers are at risk of losing another type of buyer: power companies.

Utilities in recent years have deployed large-scale batteries to avoid blackouts and store excessive output generated by renewable energy sources.

Virtually non-existent a decade ago, utility-scale battery installations in the US reached a total of 26 gigawatts last year.

In Texas alone, some 4 gigawatts of battery capacity - enough to power around 3 million homes - switched on in 2024.

But the Trump administration has announced rules that push energy storage project developers to steer clear of Chinese battery materials and components in order to qualify for tax credits, which will be hard for the industry.

China dominates the global trade of battery components, with 88% of the world's cathode and 96% of anode production capacity in 2024, according to BNEF.

""These criteria may yet prove unworkable or challenging, dragging down new additions to energy storage in the US,"" Hales says.

The projected surplus may not fully materialize, though. A growing number of battery makers have put their manufacturing plans on hold or scrapped projects entirely since Trump took office.

Kore Power Inc. abandoned its battery plant plans shortly after Trump was sworn in.

Amprius Technologies announced in May that it wouldn't move forward on a US$190 million (RM803mil) battery plant in Colorado.

Automaker Stellantis has also called off its plan to build an Illinois battery plant.

Shrinking demand combined with collapsing government support for clean tech, will likely lead to more factory cancellations, Hales says, calling it ""a poison pill for US manufacturing hopes.""",https://da4dkroembtou.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/24C0265_089.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 03:59:37.613857

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy withdrew or terminated a total of $679 million in funding for 12 doomed offshore wind projects across America. This action will ensure federal dollars are prioritized towards restoring America’s maritime dominance and preventing waste.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy. “Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry. Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

The Trump Administration has refocused the Department of Transportation (USDOT) and its Maritime Administration (MARAD) on rebuilding America’s shipbuilding capacity, unleashing more reliable, traditional forms of energy, and utilizing the nation’s bountiful natural resources to unleash American energy.

Where possible, funding from these projects will be recompeted to address critical port upgrades and other core infrastructure needs of the United States.

Additional Information:

As part of the Department of Transportation’s review of all discretionary grant programs with obligated and unobligated projects, USDOT identified 12 offshore wind grants and project selections that were not aligned with the goals and priorities of the administration.

USDOT has withdrawn one project in the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects (INFRA) program, resulting in a total retraction of roughly $427 million.

MARAD has withdrawn six projects and terminated five within its Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP), resulting in a total retraction of $177 million and roughly $75 million, respectively.

According to the report “Tracking the progress of US grid interconnection”, data from Wood Mackenzie’s Lens Power and Renewables platform shows that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order No. 2023, issued in July of 2023, along with other reforms led by Independent System Operators, has made a considerable impact on processing interconnection agreements, by driving improvements through reducing speculative projects and clearing queue backlogs.

On top of increased connections, regional grid operators are experiencing 9% fewer new project entries, a 51% increase in withdrawals of non-viable projects since 2022.

“It’s clear that these reforms are showing early signs of promise in accelerating the pace of interconnection studies,” said Kaitlin Fung, research analyst, North America Utility-Scale Solar for Wood Mackenzie. “We saw a record year in 2024, with 75 gigawatts (GW) of secured capacity. 2025 is maintaining this momentum, as major grid operators have already secured 36 GW through July 2025, positioning the year to match 2024’s record.”

Solar and storage technologies captured 75%, or 58 GW, of all interconnection agreements in 2024 and will retain a similar market share in 2025. Solar has accounted for half of all signed IAs since 2019, a trend that continues in 2025.

Natural gas has seen an increase in interconnection requests since 2022, adding 121 GW of capacity. This trend has continued in 2025 with new applications for gas generation already breaking annual records by mid-year. However, the number of successful gas interconnection agreements is down 25% since 2022, mainly in PJM, MISO and ERCOT, Wood Mackenzie said.

Regional differences

“Interconnection success rates and queue processing times vary dramatically for different grid operators across regions,” said Fung.

According to the report, ERCOT leads in both success rates and processing speed due to its streamlined queue process through their connect-and manage approach. ISONE ranks second in success rates but has the longest processing time due to its delayed transition from serial to cluster-based processing. CAISO ranks third, but has one of the lowest success rates, driven by a high volume of speculative projects.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-29 21:00:37.743199

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump's administration has fired some Environmental Protection Agency employees after they signed a letter critical of the Trump administration's policies in late June, the EPA said on Friday.

The EPA did not mention how many people were fired and said the June petition had information that the agency called inaccurate. The Washington Post cited union officials to say at least seven EPA employees were fired.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

The development is likely to fuel concerns that the Trump administration does not tolerate dissent. Earlier this week, some employees at the Federal Emergency Management Agency were put on leave after they signed an open letter against the agency's leadership.

CONTEXT

The June letter, titled as a ""Declaration of Dissent,"" accused the federal government of engaging in ""harmful deregulation,"" ""ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters"" and ""promoting a culture of fear"" within the agency.

In early July, the EPA placed about 140 employees on administrative leave after they signed the letter and said it has ""zero-tolerance"" for those sabotaging the government's agenda.

KEY QUOTES

""Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis. EPA does not comment on individual personnel matters,"" an agency spokesperson said.

""The petition — signed by employees using a combination of their titles and offices — contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,"" it added.

The union representing EPA employees criticized the firings.

""The Trump administration and EPA's retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free speech rights,"" Justin Chen, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, a nationwide union that represents more than 8,000 EPA employees, said in a statement cited in the Washington Post.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","By CLAIRE RUSH

Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting restrictions on how the transportation department can spend money on maintenance operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Electric_Vehicles-Road_User_Fee_73408-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-08-29 22:03:40.840063

“Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritising real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little,” he said.
The cuts include a $47m grant for an offshore wind logistics and manufacturing hub near the Port of Baltimore in Maryland, as well as $48m awarded in 2022 for an offshore wind terminal project near New York’s Staten Island.
Also cut was $33m for a port project in Salem, Massachusetts, to redevelop a vacant industrial facility for offshore wind projects.
China, for instance, has invested heavily in solar and wind energy and has become a leading source for wind turbine parts.","The administration of United States President Donald Trump has moved to cancel $679m in federal funding for offshore wind projects, in its latest salvo against renewable energy.

The move on Friday is set to affect 12 offshore projects, including a $427m project in California, as Trump pushes to deregulate and re-prioritise fossil fuels.

In a statement, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the funding was a waste of money “that could otherwise go towards revitalising America’s maritime industry”.

“Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritising real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little,” he said.

The funding had been awarded under the administration of former President Joe Biden as part of a wider pivot towards green energy.

Among the cancellations was funding for The Humboldt Bay project, which was meant to be the first offshore wind terminal on the Pacific coast.

A spokesperson for California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has emerged as a leading state opponent to Trump, criticised the action as an example of the administration “assaulting clean energy and infrastructure projects – hurting business and killing jobs in rural areas, and ceding our economic future to China”.

The cuts include a $47m grant for an offshore wind logistics and manufacturing hub near the Port of Baltimore in Maryland, as well as $48m awarded in 2022 for an offshore wind terminal project near New York’s Staten Island.

Also cut was $33m for a port project in Salem, Massachusetts, to redevelop a vacant industrial facility for offshore wind projects.

In a statement, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey said cancelling the Salem grant will cost 800 construction workers their jobs.

“The real waste here is the Trump administration cancelling tens of millions of dollars for a project that is already under way to increase our energy supply,” she said.

The latest trimming comes after the Trump administration abruptly halted construction of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Department of the Interior said the move was necessary to address national security concerns, without providing further details.

In early August, the Interior Department also cancelled a major wind farm in Idaho, which had been approved in the final days of Biden’s presidency.

Multiple federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Energy and Commerce, said they are reviewing offshore wind farms approved by the Biden administration along the Atlantic coast.

Trump has regularly lashed out at green energy, and particularly wind power, calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Yet, foreign allies and rivals alike have increasingly embraced renewable energy in an effort to slow the ravages of climate change. China, for instance, has invested heavily in solar and wind energy and has become a leading source for wind turbine parts.

Critics have said Trump’s approach will set the US back behind its competitors.

Last week, as US electricity prices rose at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump falsely blamed renewable power for the skyrocketing prices, calling the industry a “scam”.

GIVE IT SOME JUICE: Rivian is getting vocal about the Trump administration’s attacks on electric vehicles — and California’s role as a counterbalance to them.

Hannah Steinweg, public policy and business development manager for California-based maker of electric SUVs, trucks and commercial vans, is pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers to double down on their support for the EV market. The push comes in the wake of President Donald Trump’s moves to revoke the state’s vehicle emissions rules and the federal $7,500 tax incentive for EV purchases.

Rivian would like to see California expand state-backed EV tax credits to a wider swatch of California drivers, and to fund the expansion with revenues generated by the state’s emissions trading program, which is at the center of intense negotiations as lawmakers try to hash out a bill to extend cap-and-trade during the final weeks of session.

Steinweg spoke with POLITICO about tax incentives, cap-and-trade and the threat that China will overtake the United States in the global auto market.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

How much of a blow for Rivian is the loss of the $7,500 federal tax credit?

We don’t think incentives replace merit. We think that we make a really compelling product that is one of the best-selling luxury SUVs in California and in the country. But incentives do accelerate adoption, and they move fence sitters. They’re historical market-shaping tools, and the federal tax credit going away is just one more regulatory support that is going away and is going to create a lot of regulatory uncertainty. Uncertainty makes it hard to plan.

California has an opportunity to backfill that incentive, and it can set up a 50-year roadmap that anchors EVs as a core part of the economy, not just in California, but around the country. Along with other industries like [artificial intelligence] and advanced manufacturing, EVs are the next generation of jobs in California, and … in the United States.

What should the structure of a new California-led incentive program look like?

Our RS1 [7-seat SUV model] is used by small businesses. We have fleets that use it, both public fleets and private fleets. The Palo Alto police department just procured the first RS1 in the nation used at a police department. I think that there is a huge gap in incentives that really hit that vehicle segment. If we’re going to electrify all passenger vehicles, we can’t just electrify sedans. We also have to meet the needs of consumers who want to buy a vehicle with more storage, more towing capacity.

We were the first all-electric truck to market, and I think an incentive that excludes these larger vehicles is really leaving out a lot of Californians and their needs. And so we encourage California to consider bifurcating the incentive to have one MSRP cap for cars and sedans and another MSRP cap for trucks and SUVs. We do have the RS2 coming out the first half of next year, our base model will be $45,000, and any incentive in California would also really benefit the consumers who are looking at a mid-size SUV.

How big a loss was Congress’s revocation of California’s electric vehicle mandates, given that companies like Rivian generate revenue by selling credits to manufacturers who don’t hit their sales goals?

Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks are really creative policy solutions to get automakers to choose to invest in this emerging technology of electric vehicles, or purchase credits to become in compliance. That really bolstered emerging new companies like Tesla, who sold millions of dollars of credits. We also benefited a lot from both programs. It’s no secret that this revenue is going away, but we are not dependent on that revenue to be successful as a company. We do think that those credit programs serve a great purpose in advancing the EV industry here in the United States, which will create American jobs across the country. Rivian is manufactured in Normal, Illinois. We’re setting up another manufacturing facility in Georgia. The benefits of investing in electric vehicle technology has an economic impact across the country, not just in California.

What else should California do to counter these setbacks for the EV market?

It’s imperative that we reauthorize cap and invest [another name for the state’s cap and trade market]. It is important for regulatory certainty. It sends a really positive message to the market and is a perfect vehicle for funding EV incentives. For every $1,000 that you put towards an EV incentive, 8 percent more people purchase an electric vehicle. That policy support brings the cost down, and it gets more people into electric vehicles who might be on the fence now. It is so rare to see so much support for something.

I think it sends a really important message to the rest of the country that California is recommitting itself to the future of the EV industry. It’s better for consumers, and it sends a message to other states. These vehicles are being manufactured in states like Georgia, Illinois and South Carolina. Supporting the industry here supports research and development broadly. China produces 70 percent of electric vehicles, and right now, other [manufacturers] are slowing their EV technology. It’s short-sighted, and it might result in short-term wins, but long-term, it will jeopardize the role of the American auto industry around the world.

How concerned are you that Chinese manufacturers will soon enter the US market?

China has been very generous with its subsidies for electrification, and that works. And the best way the United States can establish itself as a global leader in this new technology is by investing in American car companies like Rivian.

SUSPENSE OVER: The Legislature is into the home stretch after Friday’s deadline to pass bills with a significant price tag.

It wasn’t as bad of a killing field as we expected. According to a tally by veteran lobbyist Chris Micheli, only 27 percent of the bills got held back. (He had projected 31 percent earlier.) The list of survivors included bills we previewed yesterday: SB 34, which limits Southern California air quality regulators’ ability to set port emissions rules; SB 326, Sen. Josh Becker’s bill requiring Cal Fire do costly and detailed wildfire risk forecasts. Sen. Ben Allen got through his SB 682 to ban PFAS from more products, despite cookware manufacturers seeking an exemption for non-stick cookware, by delaying a ban on PFAS in parts for youth off-highway vehicles. And his SB 615, which would require can manufacturers to recycle EV batteries, made it through after removing language that would have tapped cap-and-trade revenues to fund enforcement of the law.

More time is needed on some of the biggies. Allen did decide to turn his SB 601, which would enshrine Biden-era water quality rules in state law, into a two-year bill amid continued opposition from developers, farmers and water agencies that argue the expanded state authority would increase their costs. Next up: a State Water Resources Control Board report due Jan. 1 detailing any workload or legislative changes it needs to fully backfill the 2023 Sackett v. EPA Supreme Court decision that narrowed the definition of wetlands under federal protection.

Investor-owned utilities scored some wins, but the final outcome is still TBD. Appropriators held back SB 332, Sen. Aisha Wahab’s measure to study whether to turn investor-owned utilities in to publicly-owned utilities, and AB 1020, Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo’s measure requiring more thorough reporting of investor-owned utility companies’ taxpayer funding. But other measures the utilities are fighting lived to see another day as lawmakers continue to hash out their energy affordability package, including Assemblymember Marc Berman’s AB 1167 and Sen. Jerry McNerney’s SB 24, which would limit utilities from passing lobbying and political advertising expenses on to ratepayers. Also still in the mix are proposals to reform the credit that appears on ratepayers’ bills from cap-and-trade revenues, limit what infrastructure costs utilities can pass along to ratepayers, and publicly finance new transmission lines.

Data center sustainability is an ongoing issue. Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan’s embattled effort to force data centers to disclose their energy usage, AB 222, died in the Senate Appropriations Committee amid sustained pushback from the tech industry. Assemblymember Diane Papan, however, got her AB 93 through to require data centers to track and report their water use. Sen. Steve Padilla was also successful with SB 57, which would empower energy regulators to set up a separate electric price for data centers.

THE WAIT IS OVER: It’s official. The California Energy Commission voted Friday afternoon to suspend its authority to impose a profit cap on gasoline refiners for five years. The move is a win for the oil industry, which had chafed under the possibility regulators would impose the cap ever since Newsom’s 2023 signature on SB X1-2 raised the spectre of the rule.

Scores of union officials, many from the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California who were representing refinery workers from across the state, voiced their support for the margin cap delay ahead of the CEC vote during a marathon public comment period.

“Every meeting that I go to, I hear from my members concern of the refinery getting shut down,” said Albert Duarte, business manager for the Riverside San Bernardino Building and Construction Trades.

Environmental justice advocates, meanwhile, voiced their displeasure with the CEC’s move.

“It’s counterproductive to gut regulations to provide sweetheart deals to big oil,” said Julia May, a senior scientist for Communities for a Better Environment.

In a report released Friday, commission staffers recommended prioritizing implementing resupply and minimum inventory rules for refiners rather than the profit cap. — NB

THE WINDS ARE CHANGING: Humboldt County was the big loser in the Trump administration’s announcement Friday that $679 million in funding to support offshore-wind-related ports and manufacturing facilities has been canceled.

Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind, the ambitious project to build turbines off the state’s northern coast, had $427 million in funding pulled, the largest cancellation among the 12 offshore wind grants and project selections that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he revoked.

“Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little,” Duffy said in a statement.

The move is Trump’s latest attack on clean energy, including recent efforts to restrict funding for solar and wind projects established during the Biden era. The Transportation Department said the retractions come as part of a wider review of all discretionary grant programs, POLITICO’s Kelsey Tamborrino reports.

Rep. Jared Huffman, who represents Humboldt, slammed the rollback, calling it “a new level of idiocracy.”

“The Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers,” Huffman said in a statement. — AN, KT

The bulk of the Biden-era funds will be clawed back from a marine terminal in Humboldt County, Calif., set to be used to build and launch wind turbines that can float in the ocean. The project received $427 million in federal funding.

The move will also strip millions from two projects in New Jersey, $47 million from an offshore wind project in Maryland, $10.5 million a project in Connecticut, $11.2 million for infrastructure upgrades to the Port of Davisville in Rhode Island and other projects in Virginia, Michigan and elsewhere.

“Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little,” Duffy said Friday.

However, clean energy advocates and leaders in the states losing funding criticized the move, predicting it would contribute to higher energy costs and elimate jobs.

“It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers,” California Rep. Jared Huffman (D), ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, said to The Associated Press.

Others agreed.

“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power,” Kit Kennedy, managing director for the power division at Natural Resources Defense Council, told AP.

“Unfortunately, every American is paying the price for these misguided decisions.”

A separate project known as Revolution Wind is also set to lose funding as ordered by the Trump administration.

In addition, some springs along the coasts are facing an intrusion of salt water, according to the Southwest Florida Water Management District.
“Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,” Fine said.","ZEPHYRHILLS, Fla. (AP) — Seen from the air, a Florida freshwater spring is a bit of liquid heaven, luring humans and wildlife to enjoy its aquamarine cool. With at least 1,000 of them — more than any other state — the springs serve as beaches for large swaths of central and northwestern Florida far from the ocean, with teenagers backflipping from docks and snorkelers peering into the crystalline depths.

But these treasures are under threat from agricultural pollution, rapid development and climate change.

Some places, such as fast-growing Zephyrhills in west-central Florida, have paused some construction as it struggles to stay within limits on the drinking water it can withdraw from a vast underground aquifer. Zephyrhills is home to Crystal Springs, source of the bottled water named after the town and several other brands.

“We really had to do something,” said Steven Spina, a member of the town council. “A lot of residents thought it was a good thing. People were happy to see us take a breath.”

Vast Floridan aquifer is source of springs

Covering an estimated 100,000 square miles (250,000 square kilometers), the underground Floridan Aquifer is the source of 90% of Florida’s drinking water. Because of the porous nature of the state’s bedrock, millions of gallons of water find their way to the surface in the form of clear, clean springs that, in turn, feed into rivers.

The highest concentration of springs are in central and northern Florida, including most of the 30 “first magnitude” springs — those that discharge at least 65 million gallons (246 million liters) of water every day. All but four of them are considered polluted.

“We just have too much pollution going into the ground and too much water coming out of the ground,” said Ryan Smart, executive director of the nonprofit Florida Springs Council. “And when you get that combination, you end up with springs that are no longer blue and vibrant and full of life.”

Agriculture, development are main threats

In rural Florida, runoff from fertilizers and pesticides used in farm fields is a major part of the problem. Fertilizers containing phosphates and nitrogen promote algae blooms that can suffocate a spring. Livestock waste contributes, too.

“When that algae covers everything, then you lose all of the seagrasses. The seagrasses are the forests of the water,” Smart said. “Then you begin to lose the biodiversity. And it even puts our drinking water at risk.”

Elsewhere in Florida, rampant development is the threat. With over 1,000 people moving to Florida every day, more housing subdivisions are sprouting, along with the roads, strip malls, restaurants, golf courses and everything else that comes with them.

That means more paved surfaces that keep rainwater from percolating down into the aquifer and more pollutant-laden runoff from lawn fertilizers, parking lots, ever-widening roads and sometimes septic tanks. It also means more and more people, many of whom enjoy tubing, paddleboarding, kayaking and swimming in the springs.

It gets so busy in summer at some springs located in state and local parks that entry is halted by late morning. At Ichetucknee Springs State Park north of Gainesville, the daily limit of 750 tubers on the upper river is often reached within an hour after the park opens.

Kaelin Gibbs, on vacation in June with his family from Georgia, was swimming in the Blue Hole Spring along the Ichetucknee River.

“This is simply incredible; the water is cool and clear,” said Gibbs. “We’ve been to Florida’s beaches and to Orlando. There is no comparison to how beautiful this spring is.”

But that’s in peril, said Dennis Jones, a Republican former legislator deeply involved in springs issues. He said the volume of permits being issued for water use isn’t sustainable.

“You cannot keep taking water out of the aquifer because it’s not an endless supply,” Jones said.

Phosphate mining has also taken a toll on springs. Their operations require a great deal of water, which reduces water pressure available for springs. Some have died almost completely from mining and other factors, including White Sulphur Springs in north Florida, which was a sacred place for Native Americans and later a tourist resort that attracted famous visitors such as Henry Ford and Theodore Roosevelt.

Climate change alters rainfall patterns, causes sea rise

A more subtle threat to the health of springs involves Earth’s changing climate. It is altering rainfall patterns around the globe, threatening the balance that feeds Florida’s springs.

In addition, some springs along the coasts are facing an intrusion of salt water, according to the Southwest Florida Water Management District. Four major springs are becoming increasingly brackish because of sea level rise and declining rainfall.

“As a result, freshwater vegetation has a hard time surviving in this saltier environment and unwanted vegetation moves in,” the district said in a website post.

State laws to protect springs remain stalled

Florida spends billions every year on water quality projects, including about $800 million this year for Everglades restoration work. State funding for springs runs about $50 million a year, according to state documents.

Two state efforts at improving springs’ quality, both around a decade old, remain bottled up in court and administrative challenges. One would strengthen rules for permits to draw water from the major springs. The other would enhance rules to reduce the amount of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphates that goes into springs that are considered impaired.

Jones, the former legislator, said lobbying by powerful agricultural interests and related political pressures have blocked progress on the nitrogen reduction plan that was expected to take about 20 years.

“We’ve burned up almost 10 years and they haven’t got on stage one. We got more nitrates now than when we started,” Jones said.

In Congress, U.S. Rep. Randy Fine recently filed a bill that would create a Florida Springs National Park across several counties, centered around the Ocala National Forest. Fine said in a statement the designation would protect the springs and increase funding. “Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,” Fine said.

Bottling companies get cheap permits for water

It costs bottling companies just $115 for a permit allowing them to withdraw millions of gallons of water in perpetuity. But they do pay local taxes.

Blue Triton, the company that bottles Zephyrhills water, pays about $600,000 a year in taxes for things like schools, public safety and so forth, said Spina of the city council.

“They are one of our largest taxpayers,” he said.

Time grows short to ensure springs survive

Though they have challenges, Florida’s freshwater springs have energetic friends, too.

Michelle Jamesson loves the springs; she grew up swimming in one and is determined to help protect them for future generations. She volunteers for SpringsWatch Citizen Science Program, coordinating and working with other volunteers for monthly tests on the Wekiva River, north of Orlando.

They test water quality, take photos of underwater vegetation, count birds and more, seeking to spot any big changes that may require action. The Wekiva is fairly stable, she said, though it carries a lot of excess nutrients.

“The wildlife and the ecology, and all of it — it’s so full of life,” Jamesson said.

At the Environmental Protection Authority, we have taken a bold but necessary step—leading the national conversation on phasing out takeaway packs from our system. This is not just a policy directive; it is a mission. A mission to build a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable Ghana for ourselves and for generations to come. As CEO, I am fully committed to this vision. The President has declared his support, and I am personally engaged in ensuring that this transition is both effective and inclusive. We have already begun laying the groundwork with key stakeholders and the wider public. We at EPA understand that this shift will require change—new habits, new systems, and new mindsets. But I am confident that together, as a nation, we can rise to the occasion. Ghana has the potential to lead Africa in environmental responsibility. And with collective action, we will.

Government is facing out Styrofoam packs, properly called take away, the stakeholder engagement were told would be underway, as well as border checks set up to block imports of such products by colleague Maxwell Akobo, 2, has more in the following report. Styrofoam parks, popularly known as takeaways, have long been a common choice for food packaging across the country. But amid growing concerns over their environmental impact, the government is not taking. The same stance against their use. The move follows A directive from the President of the Republic, John Dramani Mahama, who in early June 2025, called for actions to phase out the use of Styrofoam in the country. Speaking at the inauguration of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Ghana Atomic Energy Commissions Board, the Chief Executive Officer of EPA, Professor Amar Brancacci, told journalists that the agency is already engaging key stakeholders to facilitate the ban of the use of Styrofoam. We have started engaging stakeholders, the Ghanian public who used the style of phones to start looking for alternatives to the style of phones so that our nests is to issue official letters and do media engagement as well on it. For now, what we are doing is engaging those stakeholders. So our next step is issuing official notices to organize on that and then we see to the ban. We believe that. Though the President has stated it, we need to engage stakeholders in the disuse of it before we go on the complete ban. She further noted that inspection offices have been established at various border points as part of efforts to prevent the importation of Styrofoam into the country. We've set up offices at the port of entry into Ghana. So currently, we have a physical space at Tema Port, which is the main entry and that will have other spaces. At the other port of entry that landed ports applaud Paga, Elubo all these areas we are going to have physical presence there so that we monitor closely item that comes in. The EPA says it remains committed to enforcing policies that protect the environment. Reporting for joining news Maxwell Acrobat 2 acre.

The company confirmed it has received a critical nuclear fuel allocation from the United States Department of Energy (DOE), ensuring a supply of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), essential to the reactor’s operation.

This federal decision is part of the DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program, aimed at accelerating the deployment of advanced nuclear technologies. Natura Resources is among the first companies selected for the initiative, reinforcing its position within the strategic US civil nuclear sector.

Dedicated infrastructure in Texas

At the same time, the MSR-1 project has received significant academic and financial support. The Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center (SERC), located at Abilene Christian University (ACU), was delivered in August 2023. Specifically designed to host the reactor, this technical facility streamlines the construction operations of the experimental unit.

The project also received construction authorisation from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the deployment of the reactor on ACU’s campus, marking the first such approval for a liquid-fuel advanced reactor. In June 2025, the detailed design of the MSR-1 was completed, enabling procurement activities for the reactor system to begin.

Texas legislative funding and industrial timeline

At the regional level, the Texas Legislature allocated $120mn to Texas Tech University, which will be used to support the construction of the Natura MSR-1. This public backing strengthens collaboration between academic institutions and industry in developing next-generation nuclear technologies.

The Natura MSR-1 is based on a low-pressure liquid fuel technology, with potential applications in power generation, water desalination, and medical isotope production. The next steps include assembling critical components and preparing for the test phase, expected after construction is completed.

“We are grateful for the support from the DOE, the NRC, the State of Texas, and our university partners,” said Doug Robison, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Natura Resources. “The MSR-1 aims to open a new path in advanced nuclear energy.”",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/en_11403008283540-1.webp,N,,2025-08-29 22:01:56.734719

In today’s feature report, Max Jancich and Ashton Harper, in Part 2, talk with Dr. Thomas Butts from Purdue University about herbicides and how farms manage weeds.

And now for your environmental reports:

The US Forest Service is taking steps to enact a controversial plan to harvest 38,000 acres of timber and initiate prescribed burns in Hoosier National Forest, to the protest of many local groups and even Indiana Governor Mike Braun.

In 2021, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) launched the Clean Community program in an effort to make our state a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable place to live. This year, Beech Grove was awarded Indiana’s first gold level status, a milestone for the state and a reflection of the Beech Grove community’s dedication.

The Trump administration is making significant cuts to our nation’s next-generation weather and climate monitoring system, and this affects communities across the country who depend on these tools for our safely related to air quality and ocean health.

The Colorado River Indian Tribes (or CRIT) are taking a groundbreaking step that could reshape how we protect our waterways—they’re working to give the Colorado River the same legal rights as a person.

The Trump Administration Dismisses the Endangered Species List as ‘Hotel California.’ But There’s Far More to the Story. A small percentage of species protected by the law have ever recovered, but an even smaller fraction have gone extinct. With all the threats they face, including long-shrinking federal support, that’s an achievement, scientists note.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

[16] Francis Dietz, HARDI and AHRI File Lawsuit Against New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Over Amended Part 494 Regulations, AHRI (Apr.","8.29.2025

By Judah Prero and Shampa Panda-Bryant

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has issued a series of regulations – both proposed and final – to implement the 2019 New York Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which sets ambitious goals to work towards economy-wide carbon neutrality for New York. This article examines two such regulations: revisions to the existing hydrofluorocarbon standards and reporting, and mandatory greenhouse gas reporting.

New York Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act

The New York Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act requires a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions[1] statewide by 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050 from 1990 levels.[2] It created the Climate Action Council, a group that was tasked with developing a scoping plan to set forth recommendations for how the state would be able to achieve these statewide greenhouse gas emission limits.[3] In December 2022, the council released its final scoping plan, an extensive document that recognized the need for “multipronged policy action, including new regulations and a major scale-up of public investments, to break through thorny market barriers and to manage significant risks to achieving the necessary equity and emissions reduction outcomes.”[4] Two of the regulations the DEC issued in furtherance of the scoping plan are revisions to its existing hydrofluorocarbon standards and mandatory greenhouse gas reporting.

Part 494 Revisions: Hydrofluorocarbon Standards and Reporting

New York finalized revisions to its existing Hydrofluorocarbon Standards and Reporting Regulations found at 6 N.Y.C.R.R. Part 494 that took effect in January of this year. These revisions aim to reduce the environmental impact of refrigerants, substances that are used for cooling, heating and refrigeration with global warming potentials[5] that can be hundreds to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. The revisions focus on fluorinated gases, a category of gases comprised of hydrofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, among others. It covers a number of activities including the use, manufacture, and sale of fluorinated gases with the purpose of a full phasedown of regulated substances to the lowest global warming potential level to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions.

The Part 494 Revisions also act as a regulatory backstop to potential changes to federal regulation of hydrofluorocarbons, which are set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 84. HFCs are alternatives to ozone-depleting substances such as HCFCs and chlorofluorocarbons, which are controlled under the Montreal Protocol for Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, a global agreement finalized in 1987 to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. In the United States, Title VI of the Clean Air Act implements the Montreal Protocol.[6] As a result of the phaseout of ozone-depleting substances, HFCs became the commercial refrigerant of choice. By 2016, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol was added to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs. In 2020, Congress enacted the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act,[7] which directs the United States Environmental Protection Agency to phase down the production and consumption of specifically listed HFCs, manage these HFCs and their substitutes, and facilitate the transition to next-generation technologies through sector-based restrictions.[8] The federal HFCs regulations are contained in 40 C.F.R. Part 84.

Saliently, the Part 494 Revisions include a number of restrictions more stringent than or not included in the federal HFC regulations with oftentimes more accelerated timelines for compliance. For example, the Part 494 Revisions include restrictions that are applicable to all fluorinated gases beyond the federally regulated HFCs. As another example, the federal HFC regulation seeks to phase down the production and consumption of bulk regulated HFCs over a longer period compared to the Part 494 revisions.

Overview of Prohibitions on Fluorinated Gases in Part 494

The Part 494 Revisions have broad applicability, covering the sale, import, manufacture, and activity that “otherwise enters [fluorinated gases] into commerce” in New York.[9] They set sector-based prohibition dates on new and retrofitted equipment, products, and substances with fluorinated gases. The specific sectors identified are aerosols, foam, air conditioning, and refrigeration. They also establish time periods during which newly manufactured products may be sold after the prohibition date. The prohibition dates are determined by the regulated substance’s global warming potential, as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.[10] It also prohibits the purchase and use of bulk regulated substances, or fluorinated gases in containers, in regulated sectors including the air conditioning and refrigeration sectors based on global warming potential. Part 494 sets prohibition dates based on the global warming potential of the regulated substance corresponding to the prohibition dates in the corresponding California state regulation.[11] That section set a prohibition date of Jan. 1, 2025 for bulk regulated substances with a global warming potential exceeding 2,200, with an upcoming prohibition date of Jan. 1, 2030 for bulk regulated substances with a potential exceeding 1,500

Although the Part 494 Revisions do not include any explicit sector-based exemptions, the DEC, in its “Assessment of Public Comments” on the Part 494 Revisions, explained that the restrictions of Part 494 do not extend to certain activities such as research and development and industries such as semiconductor manufacturing.[12] However, the restrictions would apply to any activities that fall outside of research and development such as the purchase of bulk regulated substances for use in comfort cooling of laboratories in a research and development facility.

Additional Requirements

The Part 494 Revisions also include labeling, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. Fluorinated gas manufacturers must provide written disclosures regarding the regulated substances to buyers and the public as a label or other form of documentation. Owners and operators of the largest equipment must report annually on their equipment, leak management, and purchases of regulated substances. Owners and operators of certain equipment that contain regulated substances must now register with the DEC. Additionally, any facility that “supplies, manufactures, produces, or distributes bulk regulated substances” that is “intended for sale or use in New York State” must comply with a separate registration requirement.[13]

The Part 494 Revisions also establishes a refrigerant management program that focuses on the management of existing fluorinated gas emission sources, specifically large commercial equipment. The program establishes requirements for owners or operators of certain refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment with requirements differing depending on the equipment’s refrigerant charge capacity. For example, refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment in a listed subsector[14] with a refrigerant charge capacity of 1,500 pounds or greater must include an automatic leak detection system[15] if the equipment is operated year-round. An owner/operator of such equipment must also register with the DEC and apply a compliant label on the equipment itself or in a location in the facility that holds the equipment.

Litigation

In April 2025, the Heating, Air-conditioning & Refrigeration Distributors International and the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute industry associates filed a lawsuit against the DEC challenging the Part 494 Revisions.[16] The groups alleged that the Part 494 Revisions should be overturned on the grounds that the DEC did not adhere to the law as the authorizing statute, did not adequately consider and discuss the costs in the regulatory impact statement that accompanied the rule, failed to minimize the economic impact of compliance on small businesses, and failed to explain why the regulation exceeded the federal minimum standards as set forth in the federal HFC regulation, among other grounds.[17] The industry group petitioners seek to have the Revised Part 494 regulations vacated and set aside.

Part 253: Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting

The DEC recently proposed a rule to require mandatory greenhouse gas reporting beginning in 2027 (Part 253). Part 253 would require emissions reporting in “carbon dioxide equivalent”[18] using the 20-year global warming potential and the incorporation of upstream out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions from electricity and fossil fuel uses. It would impose reporting requirements for a number of entities that engage in activity in New York state, including electric power entities of all sizes, fuel suppliers, and certain facilities that emit 10,000 or more metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. It adds new obligations, including emissions verification by a third-party auditor and submission of an emissions monitoring plan for emission sources categorized as “large emission sources.” Part 253 is intended to inform other actions regarding greenhouse gas emission reduction, including serving as a framework for a future cap-and-trade program.

Reporting Requirement

Part 253 proposes reporting requirements for emission sources considered to be a “reporting entity,” which includes all suppliers of natural gas, petroleum products, and liquified natural gas, as well as all electric power entities. The reporting threshold and data that each reporting entity must report to the DEC differs based on the type of reporting entity. For example, natural gas suppliers must report greenhouse gas emissions that result from the use of natural gas sold, transferred, or delivered to end users in New York state. In contrast, owners and operators of waste to energy facilities must report emissions in New York state from stationary combustion and fugitive emissions, as well as upstream out-of-state emissions from fossil fuel use required for generation of energy imported into the state. Notably, Part 253 also regulates out-of-state activity. For example, natural gas suppliers must also report upstream out-of-state emissions from fossil fuel use in producing gas supplied to New York.

The DEC has stated it will accept greenhouse emissions data reported under the EPA’s greenhouse gas reporting program at 40 CFR Part 98 for those facilities required to report under Part 98, but that all facilities that report under Part 98 that qualify as a “reporting entity” must also report under Part 253.[19]

Large Emission Sources

Part 253 mandates additional requirements for “Large Emission Sources,” or emission sources that exceed a certain level of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. “Large Emission Sources” include:

Facilities in New York State that meet or exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per emission year.

Waste transporters that have 25,000 MT carbon dioxide equivalent per year of emissions for out-of-state landfill and combustion facilities for all waste exported out of New York state.

Depending on the amount of fuel supplied to New York, suppliers of natural gas, petroleum products, liquified or compressed natural gas, and coal.

The additional standards include working with third-party services accredited by the DEC to submit verification of greenhouse gas emissions data.

Key Takeaways and Next Steps

These recent regulations issued under the New York Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act introduce an additional layer of complexity to the landscape of climate regulations. In these and anticipated future regulations, companies will face not only increased reporting and recordkeeping requirements but also enhanced risks for potential enforcement actions as a result of noncompliance. Adding uncertainty are recent and anticipated lawsuits challenging the validity of any final regulations. Any judicial invalidation of all or portions of final regulations could delay or forestall their implementation, halt enforcement, and lead to reevaluation of the rulemaking process. While the suits proceed, regulated entities must stay apprised of the current compliance requirements and applicable regulations.

New York will continue to issue regulations under the new law to address climate change in furtherance of the state’s goal of aggressively transitioning to a carbon-neutral economy. These regulations may have a likelihood of being more stringent than analogous federal law, which creates complexities in crafting compliance programs and modifying business operations. Compliance with this evolving regulatory landscape will be a critical priority for regulated entities in New York.

We need to stand up to the cruel, inept and corrupt administration in Washington.","This commentary is by Larry Satcowitz, of Randolph. He is a Democrat representing the Orange-Washington-Addison District in the Vermont House of Representatives and is the ranking member of the House Environment Committee.

Every day I look at the headlines with a sense of dread. Every day, it seems, the oligarchs and authoritarians gain a bit more control of our country.

As I was writing this commentary earlier this month, President Donald Trump ordered the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and threatened to do the same to other major U.S. cities. It was just one of a long string of abuses of his power as president.

It is hard to overstate how unprecedented and dangerous our situation is, and it is horrifying to think that they are just getting started. Resistance right now is critical.

In Vermont, our resistance ought to be led, at least in part, by Gov. Phil Scott. Our governor, however, has done little to resist the bully in Washington. Not only has he failed to condemn the outrageous excesses of the federal administration, but he has also readily acquiesced.

In winter, while hundreds of Vermonters protested, he welcomed JD Vance to the state. In April he rejected a call from Vermont state senators to cancel contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies that have been illegally snatching people off the streets.

Last month, his administration failed to provide evidence to the courts that would have allowed Vermont to obtain funds which had already been committed to help us with our electric vehicle charging infrastructure, undermining the efforts of our attorney general.

Earlier this month Scott met with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, who I think is doing everything he can to undermine the rules and laws that keep our nation’s environment clean and safe. Shortly after the visit, Zeldin canceled $62.5 million of already appropriated funding that would have helped low-income Vermonters get energy from solar power projects.

A few days later, and perhaps most egregiously, Scott saw fit to release the personal information of more than 140,000 Vermonters to a federal government that has no legitimate purpose for it. Governors of other states rejected the demand for this information, but our governor capitulated.

Again, the Trump administration is just getting started. There will be more assaults on our liberty and civil institutions. How many more times will Scott disregard Vermonters’ values, safety, livelihood and privacy in favor of taking the easy path?

As we all know, appeasing bullies gives them more power. Our governor either does not understand this or supports Trump’s actions. Either way, he’s dramatically failing us. We need to stand up to the cruel, inept and corrupt administration in Washington. Instead, he’s helping to pave the way for its continued consolidation of power.

Scott is only part of the way through his current term. He still has plenty of time to join other Vermont leaders in resisting Trump. I urge him to do so.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,N,,2025-08-29 20:02:09.385518

In the first five months of 2025, renewable energy projects accounted for 91% of new electricity generation.
Instead, the administration is actively pumping the brakes on new energy projects, and costs are up and expected to continue rising.
And since Trump took office, 64,000 renewable energy jobs have been cut or paused.","In three recent segments, Fox personalities questioned the Trump administration’s efforts to block new renewable energy projects as increased demand for electricity to power new data centers drives rate hikes.

Between 2021 and 2024, average monthly residential electricity bills went up by about $22 per month. Now, energy prices are rising twice as fast as the cost of inflation. According to The Guardian, a recent report from the think tank Energy Innovation found that, “Household electricity bills have increased by 10% since Donald Trump re-entered the White House.”

Several factors, including the cost of equipment updates in response to extreme weather events and an increase in demand for electricity, are contributing to the rate hikes. In New Jersey, grid operators have reportedly been slow to connect new energy projects, with many renewable and storage projects waiting in interconnection queues. In the first five months of 2025, renewable energy projects accounted for 91% of new electricity generation. But much more is needed to help lower the cost of electricity.

One such project is Revolution Wind, a wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is expected to power “more than 350,000 homes.” Or at least, it was. On August 22, Trump issued a stop-work order on the project.

Fox News has scrambled to find a way to blame rate hikes on renewable energy, recently focusing on New Jersey after wholesale electric bills in the state rose by 20% in 2025.

But in an August 26 segment of Varney & Co., Fox correspondent Madison Alworth discussed the stop-work order in Rhode Island for “national security concerns” and concluded that “at the end of this are those folks that are left in the lurch the ratepayers? Because energy bills, they just continue to go up.”

Host Stuart Varney then asked, “And they haven't spelled out what is the national security concern with the project, have they?” Alworth replied that “they have not.” Varney continued, “I thought we wanted all forms of energy to power AI, wind included.”

Fox contributor and wealth management CEO Mark Tepper told Varney, “That would make sense but what we really want is consistent energy sources, and wind is known to be intermittent. It’s inconsistent.”

(Though he appeared to question the administration’s directive in the moment, Varney has hosted Interior Department Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to push anti-renewable energy talking points unchallenged in defense of cancelling the wind project.)

During an August 23 interview on Fox News Live, correspondent Rich Edson asked Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin why it was necessary to halt a nearly-finished offshore wind farm.

“What’s the problem with this wind farm in Rhode Island?” Edson asked. Zeldin replied that Trump is “not a fan of wind,” pointed to largely overblown claims of negative environmental impacts, and added that, “Our country needs more baseload power. … It’s just not an honest approach to this entire energy conversation if we start acting as if wind is going to be a substitute for all of those things.”

In an unusual move for Fox, Edson continued to challenge Zeldin. “This project is apparently largely almost finished,” he continued. “You’ve got AI, you’ve got the electrification of everything around us. I mean, we just need power. Why would you take any power offline?”

Later in the segment, after Zeldin plugged a proposed natural gas pipeline, Edson continued to press the question of renewables, asking, “Is there room for both, though?”

Edson and Varney haven't been the only Fox employees to push back recently.

In an August 22 Fox Business segment, anchor Cheryl Casone interviewed Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), a leading anti-renewable voice in New Jersey. Casone asked “The critics will say yeah, sure, but the money was already put through, these projects have already begun, so you’re going to get a lot of job losses. I'm curious if you worry about that?”

She also referenced that this is a nationwide issue, pointing out higher rates in Connecticut and Maine, saying, “The EIA reports that there’s going to be a 13% rise in electricity costs from 2022-2025 just in general. So this is a major problem. And now with AI data centers, we need all the energy.”

Trump is actively shrinking potential energy supply and killing hundreds of “good union jobs” by halting the construction of the Revolution Wind Project, which began in 2023.

According to Ørsted, the company behind the project, Revolution Wind is 80% finished. It has reportedly created 1,200 jobs in the region, including 300 union jobs.

Trump promised to “cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months” during his 2024 campaign. Instead, the administration is actively pumping the brakes on new energy projects, and costs are up and expected to continue rising. In fact, the Rhodium Group predicts that “new clean capacity additions to the grid will shrink by 57-62% from 2025 through 2035,” tightening energy supply as demand grows. And since Trump took office, 64,000 renewable energy jobs have been cut or paused. BloombergNEF also recently found that billions of dollars in investments are leaving the U.S. in response to Trump’s anti-renewable energy policies.

Experts also say that Trump’s tariffs will make the grid less reliable by making batteries more expensive. According to Wood Mackenzie, Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports could mean that “the cost of a utility scale solar facility in the US will be 54% more expensive than in Europe and 85% more expensive than a new solar plant built in China.”",https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/D8Image/2025/08/28/rhode-island-wind-project.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 20:01:58.679280

According to PhD student and co-author of the paper Ahmad Hassan, the capture costs approximately $70 per metric ton of CO2, which is competitive with other innovative scrubbing techniques.
“Integrating carbon capture directly into a redox flow battery lets us tackle two challenges in one device,” Afshari said in the release.","A team of researchers at the University of Houston has made two breakthroughs in addressing climate change and potentially reducing the cost of capturing harmful emissions from power plants.

Led by Professor Mim Rahimi at UH’s Cullen College of Engineering, the team released two significant publications that made significant strides relating to carbon capture processes. The first, published in Nature Communications, introduced a membraneless electrochemical process that cuts energy requirements and costs for amine-based carbon dioxide capture during the acid gas sweetening process. Another, featured on the cover of ES&T Engineering, demonstrated a vanadium redox flow system capable of both capturing carbon and storing renewable energy.

“These publications reflect our group’s commitment to fundamental electrochemical innovation and real-world applicability,” Rahimi said in a news release. “From membraneless systems to scalable flow systems, we’re charting pathways to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and support the transition to a low-carbon economy.”

According to the researchers, the “A Membraneless Electrochemically Mediated Amine Regeneration for Carbon Capture” research paper marked the beginning of the team’s first focus. The research examined the replacement of costly ion-exchange membranes with gas diffusion electrodes. They found that the membranes were the most expensive part of the system, and they were also a major cause of performance issues and high maintenance costs.

The researchers achieved more than 90 percent CO2 removal (nearly 50 percent more than traditional approaches) by engineering the gas diffusion electrodes. According to PhD student and co-author of the paper Ahmad Hassan, the capture costs approximately $70 per metric ton of CO2, which is competitive with other innovative scrubbing techniques.

“By removing the membrane and the associated hardware, we’ve streamlined the EMAR workflow and dramatically cut energy use,” Hassan said in the news release. “This opens the door to retrofitting existing industrial exhaust systems with a compact, low-cost carbon capture module.”

The second breakthrough, published by PhD student Mohsen Afshari, displayed a reversible flow battery architecture that absorbs CO2 during charging and releases it upon discharge. The results suggested that the technology could potentially provide carbon removal and grid balancing when used with intermittent renewables, such as solar or wind power.

“Integrating carbon capture directly into a redox flow battery lets us tackle two challenges in one device,” Afshari said in the release. “Our front-cover feature highlights its potential to smooth out renewable generation while sequestering CO2.”",https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTUzMjA0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4ODkyMTc3OH0.JzXp_aNHLeW4C1rGD9tI0eyo9ZLUdobQq-apHQXd1Qs/img.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C72%2C0%2C73,N,,2025-08-29 22:59:27.979539

Dubbed the “OPEC of nickel,” Indonesia has transformed the global nickel market through a raw export ban and a surge of Chinese investment.
In 2024, Indonesia accounted for 60 percent of global nickel production and majority Chinese owned companies accounted for approximately 80 percent of battery grade nickel production.
The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has already expressed interest in nickel projects in Brazil and Tanzania.
But the DFC could back energy infrastructure projects critical to cleaner nickel production, while EXIM could leverage its “Make More in America” initiative to finance domestic PCAM and CAM production using Indonesian nickel as feedstock.","The elimination of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean vehicle tax credit in the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” is raising urgent questions for the electric vehicle industry in the United States. How will this impact demand? Can American vehicles compete against Chinese vehicles? And where should companies now source critical minerals?

Known as 30D, the tax credit incentivized the sourcing of critical minerals from free trade agreement (FTA) partners and non-Chinese owned companies for vehicles to qualify for the $7,500 credit. This created a premium for minerals from Australia, Canada, and Chile, helping to stimulate the development of alternative supply chains. Producers without FTAs – such as Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – were excluded.

But the tax credit’s elimination is shifting the calculus on critical mineral sourcing. U.S. strategy must evolve accordingly, particularly in relation to Indonesia, where the current market trajectory is increasingly untenable.

Dubbed the “OPEC of nickel,” Indonesia has transformed the global nickel market through a raw export ban and a surge of Chinese investment. In 2024, Indonesia accounted for 60 percent of global nickel production and majority Chinese owned companies accounted for approximately 80 percent of battery grade nickel production. Despite criticism over weak environmental and labor standards and overproduction, Indonesia’s low-cost supply continues to expand – driving down prices and forcing competitors in Australia and New Caledonia to suspend operations. As Jorge Uzcategui, cobalt and nickel senior analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, noted, Indonesia’s market share grows “day by day.”

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects Indonesia will account for 67 percent of mined nickel by 2030 and 75 percent by 2040, while production in countries like Australia, Canada, and the Philippines declines. Weak EV demand in the United States – exacerbated by the loss of the 30D tax credit and broader economic uncertainty – is likely to depress prices further, reinforcing Indonesia’s dominance.

Ford is the only major U.S. company invested in the battery supply chain in Indonesia. They partnered with Vale Indonesia and China’s Huayou Cobalt, one of the leading nickel refiners and midstream producers. Aware of the negative view toward Indonesia, Ford’s press release stressed the project meets their high ESG standards and the nickel will be “mined in line with our company’s sustainability targets.” Nickel rich lithium-ion batteries remain the most popular battery choice in the United States for EV manufacturers because the nickel-based batteries offer extended driving range, limiting “range-anxiety” for Americans.

Lacking an FTA with the United States, the Indonesian government actively pushed for a “critical minerals agreement,” a critical mineral focused mini-FTA, that would have made Indonesia’s nickel IRA compliant after the initial passage. But all potential minerals agreements faced bipartisan criticism, and a potential Indonesia agreement received intense scrutiny. Now any discussion over a critical minerals agreement is moot.

Without a new strategy that accounts for the elimination of 30D, combined with Indonesia’s continued dominance, the nickel market will continue to consolidate. The United States needs to decide on a new strategy for nickel and Indonesia: build a separate supply chain because of issues with Chinese involvement and labor and environmental standards, or actively engage with the leading producer to ensure that U.S. companies benefit?

Building a Western focused supply chain would require a multipart strategy that utilizes targeted tariffs and strategic investments in coordination with key allies.

Tariffing Indonesian nickel directly is challenging, as the U.S. imports little to none of it. The United States does not have the midstream capabilities to refine the material. Instead, trade actions would need to focus on finished goods – battery cells, packs, and electric vehicles – that contain refined Indonesian nickel. These tariffs could be implemented as a result of the Section 232 investigation the Department of Commerce is currently undertaking on processed critical minerals and derivative products. Any trade actions would need to be undertaken in coordination with strategic investments into non-Indonesian nickel projects across the supply chain to finance new mine and processing facilities or support existing mines nearing care and maintenance. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has already expressed interest in nickel projects in Brazil and Tanzania.

In an ideal scenario, the strategy would be coordinated with key nickel producers like Australia, Canada, New Caledonia, Norway, and others, who could offer domestic incentives to support key mines. At the same time, consumer economies such as the EU, Japan, and South Korea could impose similar tariffs to reinforce non-Indonesian supply chains. Together, these measures would establish a premium for Western-backed projects, helping them compete on cost despite higher environmental and labor standards. This strategy would take several years to get off the ground as production at new mines or the construction of processing facilities require significant time.

Australia, Canada, and potential U.S. projects stand to benefit from this strategy. But the biggest winner would be China. Its dominant position in Indonesia would only strengthen, giving their firms continued access to low-cost nickel. The biggest losers would be automakers and battery manufacturers in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and South Korea. Swapping EV tax credits for tariffs would raise their production costs, making electric vehicles less competitive with internal combustion engine models. This would further slow adoption and widen the gap with Chinese automakers.

This strategy is also unlikely to succeed. Coordinating tariffs, investments, and domestic incentives across allied nations is politically and logistically difficult in the best environments. It is impossible in the current Trump administration-led environment.

The U.S. and its partners also lack the resources to develop parallel supply chains for every mineral on the USGS critical list. Washington needs to prioritize what minerals are the most important for national security purposes while being willing to rely on foreign supply chains for other minerals. I do not think nickel rises to the same level of criticality as other key minerals when considering potential supply disruptions. Immediate efforts to reduce reliance on China should focus on minerals where Beijing controls strategic chokepoints domestically. In terms of nickel, the U.S. should instead prioritize the midstream by onshoring precursor and cathode active material (PCAM and CAM) production.

This means the best strategy is direct engagement with Indonesia and investment into their nickel sector. The Trump administration and Indonesia are finalizing trade negotiations and have the opportunity to make cooperation on nickel a major part of the final deal.

Indonesia, like other resource rich developing countries, wants to diversify away from China. They specifically want increased access to the U.S. market because it has the highest growth potential due to the popularity of nickel-rich lithium-ion batteries. The new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions for manufacturing tax credit (45X) make sourcing from Indonesia challenging but the Indonesian government has shown the willingness to support divestment and reduce ownership stakes in projects in order to get U.S. investment. The trade negotiations are the best opportunity to get responsible U.S. participation in the market and lift environmental and labor standards.

Chinese ownership makes direct U.S. government investment from DFC or EXIM mining and processing projects unlikely. But the DFC could back energy infrastructure projects critical to cleaner nickel production, while EXIM could leverage its “Make More in America” initiative to finance domestic PCAM and CAM production using Indonesian nickel as feedstock.

The Ford model provides the best example for American engagement in Indonesia. It is unlikely new Western mining companies would become involved in the Indonesian nickel industry given policy uncertainty around royalties, depressed prices, and the current incumbents. Instead, the U.S. can utilize the trade negotiations to push for American automakers or commodity firms to take ownership stakes in key projects and receive the subsequent offtake for domestic production. While Chinese companies dominate the industry, Benchmark estimates the share of majority Chinese owned battery grade production in Indonesia will decrease from 80 percent to 54 percent by the early 2030s. American companies can partner with Vale Indonesia, Eramet, Harita Nickel, or other Indonesian companies.

Lower environmental and labor standards have been a key sticking point for avoiding Indonesia. Story after story highlights the environmental damage caused by the nickel sector. Indonesia needs to raise environmental standards, especially regarding its reliance on coal for processing. But the U.S. has limited leverage to drive these changes by standing on the sidelines. Indonesian companies “want assurances that putting money into ESG will lead to further investment from the West” according to Uzcategui. Active and direct engagement is the only way that the U.S. can give those assurances and push for meaningful improvements. Indonesian companies have already shown their willingness to raise standards, even committing to an IRMA audit — one of the most rigorous in the mining industry.

Other critics have pointed to the export ban as a major impediment to engagement. Despite reports after the initial deal suggesting the elimination of trade barriers, it is highly unlikely that Indonesia will change their export restrictions on raw material. Even if they did, the United States does not have the capabilities to process the ore. But more importantly, the export ban is beneficial to the U.S as the nickel would be flowing to China for processing if not for the ban. The United States should view any major critical mineral production out of China as a strategic win as it is out of the reach of potential export restrictions from Beijing.

Comparisons to the oil and gas sectors are often overused when discussing critical minerals. But the last 100 years of energy diplomacy should remind us that we cannot always pick our partners when sourcing key commodities. Indonesia is not the perfect partner, but they cannot be ignored. Direct engagement with them will make American automakers more competitive and make the nickel industry more sustainable.",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2025-08-29-152705.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 19:03:42.522201

(AP) — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the power to implement a penalty but has not done so since it was given that authority in 2023.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state. It created an independent division at the commission to oversee the oil and gas industry and provide guidance to the state on its energy transition.

Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.

“When Governor Newsom signed this legislation two years ago, he promised that we would utilize the new transparency tools to look under the hood of our oil and gas market that had been a black box for decades,” spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in a statement. “We did exactly that.”

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission has not determined what would count as an excessive profit under the policy.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

The federal government has been equally committed to exploring nuclear energy across the Biden and Trump administrations as the country seems to be marching forward into a new era of nuclear energy production.","As the United States faces escalating energy demands amid advancing resource-intensive technology and aging infrastructure, nuclear power has rematerialized as a central pillar of national and state-level energy strategies.

Recent federal executive actions and passage of bipartisan legislation—alongside a wave of state initiatives—signal a renewed commitment to nuclear development, with implications for permitting, licensing and infrastructure investment. This alert outlines the latest regulatory shifts, including executive orders from the Trump administration, implementation of the ADVANCE Act and state-level momentum from New York to Colorado.

Federal Updates

On May 23, President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at fostering a “nuclear renaissance” to help the country “face a new set of challenges, including a global race to dominate in artificial intelligence (AI) a growing need for energy independence, and access to uninterruptible power supplies for national security.”

The executive orders are titled:

“Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies For National Security,”

“Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,”

“Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy,” and

“Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base.”

These executive orders lay out ambitious goals to reinvigorate U.S. nuclear energy, from deploying nuclear reactors to power military bases and AI data centers, recycling and processing spent reactor fuel, increasing domestic production of uranium, bolstering the nuclear workforce, and ultimately expanding nuclear energy by 300 gigawatts by 2050.

However, while the Trump administration has demonstrated ambition for expanding nuclear energy, this is paired with an equally ambitious desire to cut the regulatory scheme surrounding it, particularly around reactor licensing and testing. This has resulted in staff reductions and restricting resources at key agencies.

One of President Trump’s executive orders is aimed at reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the independent agency that regulates the safety of nuclear reactors. The order directs the NRC to work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to “reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology.” The order also seeks to cut staff at NRC: “The personnel and functions of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) shall be reduced to the minimum necessary to fulfill ACRS’s statutory obligations.”

Also in the interest of cutting bureaucratic red tape, one order directs Department of Energy (DOE) leadership to consult with DOGE to streamline environmental reviews by “reform[ing] the Department’s rules governing compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)” and “eliminate or expedite the Department’s environmental reviews for authorizations, permits, approvals, leases, and any other activity requested by an applicant or potential applicant.” These orders are consistent with President Trump’s broader agenda of cutting the size of federal agencies and reducing regulatory schemes for businesses across all sectors.

Even as the Trump administration makes these regulatory reforms, the DOE is expected to work towards implementing the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act, which President Biden signed on July 9, 2024. The ADVANCE Act passed with significant bipartisan support and included provisions aiming to streamline the permitting process by:

providing incentives for developing and deploying new nuclear technologies;

keeping existing nuclear plants online;

converting old coal plants into nuclear plants;

restricting imports of uranium from Russia and China; and

implementing initiatives for efficient, timely and predictable license application reviews by the NRC.

DOE is also working to refocus the Office of Nuclear Energy per the president’s fiscal year 2026 Budget Request. Under the budget proposal, the program would focus on developing innovative concepts for next-generation nuclear reactors and researching advanced nuclear fuels, shifting away from nuclear research.

Simultaneously, Congress is working to create new and strengthen existing programs supporting the growth of nuclear energy. Citing the need for reliable, baseload generation resources, House Energy and Water appropriators provided an increase of $110 million for DOE’s Nuclear Energy Office, including an increase for the Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Program to help support production of the kind of fuel used by advanced reactors. The loan program office would also get more money for nuclear project financing. Senate appropriators have not yet released their version of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill.

Most recently, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing for the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy and Regulatory Affairs on July 22 titled “The New Atomic Age: America’s Energy Future.” This hearing was the latest congressional action related to nuclear energy policy.

State Updates

The federal government is not alone in its renewed appetite for nuclear energy development. Since last year, 34 states across the political spectrum and rural-urban divides introduced legislation relating to nuclear energy policy. In 2024 alone, 25 states passed pro-nuclear legislation, and public utility commissions (PUCs) in seven states approved orders or took direct action in support of nuclear energy. These actions range from funding viability studies for nuclear energy and creating workforce development programs, to paving the way to build new nuclear reactors.

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) recently directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop and construct a zero-emission nuclear power plant in upstate New York. The proposed plant would be the first major nuclear plant built in the United States in over 15 years, and only the sixth built since 1991. Hochul said the new plant will provide one gigawatt of clean energy for the state to help address the increased energy demands and meet the state’s climate goals. The proposal has garnered support from labor unions, including the Transport Workers Union International and the Utility Workers Union of America, but has drawn criticism from environmental groups who fear that the plan will distract from other renewable energy projects.

Texas has also made recent strides to become a leader in nuclear energy. In 2023, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) created the Texas Advanced Nuclear Reactor Working Group to “position Texas as the national leader on advanced nuclear energy.” This year, Gov. Abbott called for the legislature to position the state to lead the country’s “nuclear renaissance,” seeing nuclear energy as a solution to increasing energy needs. Texas currently consumes more energy than any other state and ranks sixth in energy use per capita. This demand has led the state to invest heavily in energy programs from oil and gas to renewable energy sources, and now nuclear as well. In response to Gov. Abbott’s agenda, lawmakers passed the Texas Nuclear Deployment Act this past session, which created the Texas Nuclear Advanced Energy Office and invested $350 million in programs to develop and deploy next-generation nuclear technologies.

And most recently, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) signed the bipartisan House Bill 25-1040 into law passed during the 2025 legislative session to define nuclear energy as a “clean energy resource.” Additionally, Denver International Airport CEO Phil Washington recently announced that the airport is considering plans to build a small modular nuclear reactor on-site to help meet increasing energy demands.

On the other side of the Continental Divide, the governors of Utah, Idaho and Wyoming met for the “Built Here: Nuclear Energy Summit” and signed a tri-state compact to shape regional energy policy with a focus on nuclear development. According to a press release by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R), “The compact focuses on advancing energy resilience, coordinating infrastructure, advocating for commonsense federal policies, and accelerating the development of reliable, affordable nuclear energy.” Gov. Cox also said that the compact “highlighted Utah’s mission to become a national hub for advanced nuclear energy development and underscored the critical role of regional collaboration in building a secure, abundant energy future.”

In January, Wyoming issued the first state permit for a commercial-scale advanced nuclear reactor project. The planned power plant has begun construction near Kemmerer, Wyoming, and will begin producing 350 megawatts of consistent power, enough to power 250,000 homes. The parties involved in in the Wyoming project have begun discussion with additional communities across Wyoming and Utah to build small modular reactors at sites where coal power plants are being retired.

What’s Next?

Proponents and opponents of nuclear energy are not isolated on either side of the aisle. Proponents are motivated by various factors including the need for reliable baseload power, the potential job growth associated with a growing nuclear energy sector, emissions reductions and lower electricity costs. Opponents site concerns with safety and a lack of solutions for storing large amounts of nuclear waste. Interest in solving a different problem may unify both sides, the need to meet the expected exponential increase in demand for electricity due to the growth of AI.

Nuclear energy may well be entering a renaissance in the United States as the country and individual states look for solutions to address increasing energy demands. The last few years have seen states across the country and across the political spectrum take steps to investigate the feasibility of and even begin constructing nuclear reactors.

Utah signed a new memorandum of understanding with TerraPower, a nuclear energy company founded by Bill Gates, to explore a potential site for a reactor and an energy storage plant in the state.

The agreement establishes a non-binding framework for cooperation between the Utah Office of Energy Development, TerraPower and Flagship Companies, a developer, aiming to bring a project to Utah similar to one under construction near Kemmerer, Wyoming — a sodium-cooled fast reactor known as Natrium.

Preliminary site recommendations will come by the end of 2025, according to a news release from the Utah Office of Energy Development. The state and the companies will consider factors like “community support, the physical characteristics of the site, the ability of the site to obtain a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and access to existing infrastructure.”

Gov. Spencer Cox praised the project’s prospects, saying it aligns with Operation Gigawatt, his plan to double the state’s energy production over the next decade.

“Operation Gigawatt is about adding capacity from diverse sources — nuclear, natural gas, geothermal and more — so families and businesses have power that is affordable, reliable and clean,” Cox said in a statement. “This agreement with TerraPower will help keep rates low, strengthen our grid and ensure Utah’s future can be as strong as our past.”

The agreement also adds to a list of memorandums of understanding the state has signed with other nuclear energy developers in its quest to lead in the country’s “nuclear renaissance.”

TerraPower CEO Chris Levesque said in an interview with Bloomberg Podcasts that new technologies, like Natrium, will be essential to upscale nuclear energy in the country, since they are cheaper and safer than current plants.

“It’s still a fission reactor. We break uranium atoms to release a lot of heat and boil water to make steam and drive turbines to make electricity the old fashioned way,” Levesque said. “But by cooling the reactor with liquid sodium, it allows us to have a low pressure plant, which is going to be safer.”

The company has already made progress with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for its first plant in Wyoming, Levesque said. After that’s cleared, the timeline for the construction of a Natrium reactor could be about three years, “which is much shorter than today’s technologies that require all of the steel and concrete,” he said.

For Cox, the project represents an important step in the country’s advancement of nuclear technology, which he said has stalled for the last 50 years. Building more energy resources is in the nation’s best interest, he added, especially with the emergence of power-hungry AI and data centers.

Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis, who has championed green energy initiatives in Washington, D.C., is also on board with the project.

Targets for reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, along with supply chain sustainability integration, are included in the scorecards of our key C-suite leaders.","Beko, one of the world’s largest home appliance manufacturers, places supply chain change at the centre of its sustainability strategy. With operations in more than 55 countries and over 50,000 employees supporting 22 brands, the company reaches hundreds of millions of homes worldwide.

CEO Hakan Bulgurlu says this scale brings responsibility to reduce environmental impact while ensuring resilient global operations.

Beko is driven by sustainability at the heart of growth, which has resulted in the company embedding low-carbon solutions and circularity across its value chain, from raw material sourcing through to product end-of-life.

By addressing energy use, emissions and waste management throughout manufacturing and distribution, the company aims to reduce risks while creating long-term efficiency gains.

Hakan also points to the role of leadership networks in aligning supply chains with climate goals.

As part of the Climate Leaders CEO Alliance within the World Economic Forum, and as President of the European Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (APPLiA), he works with peers to raise industry standards. These collaborations seek to harmonise supply chain practices globally, ensuring suppliers and partners adopt measurable sustainability targets.

How has Beko’s sustainability progressed across regions?

Sustainability used to be a niche expectation in a few developed markets but today, it’s a global imperative.

We are seeing a rising demand for cleaner, more efficient solutions across all markets we operate in.

At Beko, we’ve made it our mission to ensure our ethos of sustainability is accessible to all and is deeply embedded in our manufacturing processes – in some markets, there are no energy-efficiency standards.

We raised our own bar anyway because we answer to something bigger than compliance.

When we entered the South African market in 2011, the average refrigerator was ‘E’ energy class.

We voluntarily improved our market offering so that the lowest class refrigerator we sell is an ‘A’ energy rating.

We were able to reduce the energy consumption of refrigerators made in South Africa by 50%.

Last year, our Defy brand launched its Solar Off-Grid refrigerator and freezer range, specifically designed to address the challenges related to frequent loadshedding and clean energy access in South Africa.

The products are revolutionary themselves, by leveraging solar energy, this range operates independently of the electrical grid, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimising carbon emissions.

Emerging markets, such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Egypt, are key to the global transformation effort but they can’t do it alone.

These regions face unique challenges as rising incomes and temperatures drive greater energy demand.

And it’s simply not acceptable to deny those in the Global South access to comfortable and healthy lives out of fear that emissions will rise as they gain access to what many in the Global North have taken for granted for decades.

That’s why we are focused on using advanced technologies in these markets and establishing sustainable manufacturing facilities.

Our factory in Egypt will achieve up to 50% energy savings compared to conventional facilities.

While in Bangladesh, our factory is designed to maximise natural daylight, featuring skylight roof surfaces for sustainable energy management with energy monitoring systems to track sustainability targets.

By investing in cleaner, more efficient production methods and creating localised solutions, we’re not only reducing emissions but also enabling these countries to leapfrog to more sustainable development pathways.

In Ulmi, Romania, our manufacturing plant was awarded Sustainability Lighthouse status by the WEF for the implementation of cutting-edge sustainable technologies that includes advanced wastewater treatment and running on renewable energy and green electricity.

These are practical examples of how sustainable design can be scaled globally without compromising on performance or accessibility across our planet.

We want solutions that cross borders and solve real problems because unless sustainability is global, it’s not working.

What significant environmental progress has Beko made?

While our initial goal was to achieve 50 MWp of renewable energy capacity by 2030, we have exceeded expectations.

In 2024, our renewable energy capacity reached 90.2-megawatt peak (MWp) — almost 30 times what it was just four years ago.

As of 2024, 60.5% of the electricity we use in manufacturing comes from renewable sources, with a goal to reach 100% by 2030, we’ve also scaled our circular economy model.

Since 2014, we’ve recycled more than 1.86 million Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) units in our WEEE recycling plants and in 2024, more than 114,000 products were refurbished across our global refurbishment network which covers facilities in UK, Italy and Türkiye.

In addition, thanks to the innovative recycled material formulations we have been developing, we have increased our use of recycled plastic throughout the years.

In 2024, 27,835 tonnes of recycled plastics were used in our products and our products are becoming more efficient, too.

In 2024, 61.9% of our turnover came from energy-efficient products, while low-carbon products accounted for 71.5% – that’s impact at scale.

No one would expect a sustainability leader to come from an emerging market, especially in an emission-heavy industry like ours.

Yet, we have been leading our industry in Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the last 6 years in a row. And we didn’t get there by doing what was easy.

We got there by embedding sustainability into the DNA of how we design, build, operate and lead.

These efforts also contributed to us earning a place in TIME Magazine’s list of the world’s most sustainable companies, ranking 17th overall (a leap from 44th in the 2024 list) and first in our industry.

How have the KPIs been strengthened?

For us, sustainability is an operating system.

By aligning our key performance indicators to global climate goals, we are safeguarding our sustainability intentions and sticking close to the science.

We have science-based targets officially validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to cut our Scope 1,2 and Scope 3 use phase emissions by 42% by 2030 and reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 90% by 2050, aligned with the 1.5°C climate scenario.

We have embedded sustainability into our leadership DNA by indirectly linking the success of sustainability related KPIs to executive compensation as part of the overall performance reviews.

Targets for reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, along with supply chain sustainability integration, are included in the scorecards of our key C-suite leaders.

Our Sustainability Linked Financing Framework ties our financial commitments to tangible goals, including reducing GHG emissions and increasing female representation in our workforce.

And we publish it all: verified, transparent ESG data that meets CSRD, GRI and IIRC standards.

We believe sustainability metrics should be as robust as financial ones because in the future, they will be.

How does Beko extend its sustainability into product design and its supply chain?

We take a full lifecycle approach to sustainability and that starts with the materials we use.

We use recycled PET bottles, fishnets and textile wastes in washing machines, dishwashers, ovens and air conditioners and we’re also designing products for easier disassembly and recyclability.

As a global appliance manufacturer, we recognise the critical role our industry plays. Four major product categories, electric motors, air conditioners, refrigerators and lighting, account for 40% of global electricity consumption.

With appliances accounting for more than a third of residential energy use and 15% of global carbon emissions, we have an obligation to do our part.

For years, our industry has focused on Scope 1 and 2 emissions, those we can directly control.

At Beko, we’ve also made substantial progress in reducing emissions in our manufacturing plants through energy efficiency initiatives and renewable energy investments but, these only represent around 1% of our total emissions.

The real challenge lies in Scope 3, which accounts for almost 99% of our company’s GHG emissions and more than 80% of these Scope 3 emissions come from the use phase of our appliances in consumers’ homes – innovation plays a critical role here too.

Technologies across our appliances such as EnergySpin achieves up to 35% energy savings in comparison to our traditional washing machines in everyday wash programmes, not just in eco mode, while our smart home platform HomeWhiz tracks energy consumption in connected devices, with personalised intelligent recommendations and energy saving modes.

For example, our CoolAdapt technology in refrigerators adjust around usage patterns and external conditions to reduce energy use – proving that small changes can add up.

Choosing efficient appliances with adaptive features, maintaining them properly and using features like eco programmes can significantly lower both emissions and energy bills.

Even switching your laundry from a 40 °C wash to a 30 °C wash can cut energy consumption by approximately 30–40%.

Ultimately, our goal is to give people the tools and technology to live more sustainably, without having to compromise on comfort, convenience or performance.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/d7116cea5ac0e09a1215d8ed16885a66:af322f9ea161e54ee69f223b3493a32d/hakan-bulgurlu-beko-ceo.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 05:59:31.731232

The plan could provide 20 metric tons of plutonium fuel to make nuclear power more viable, but it has raised concerns over safety and economic feasibility.

The Department of Energy is expected to release details on the plan in the coming days, Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with the matter and a draft memo. The idea of repurposing plutonium from warheads for the power sector was originally floated in an executive order that President Donald Trump signed in May.

The initiative comes as the nuclear power industry looks to grow, and it has the backing of major tech companies that are looking for zero-emissions power for data centers. Trump has touted nuclear as a reliable power source, but access to fuel remains a key barrier that raises costs and slows the construction of new facilities.

Why does the US have extra plutonium?

Uranium can be found in nature, deep under the Earth’s surface. Plutonium, on the other hand, is man-made. Nuclear power plants in the U.S. use uranium, but plutonium is produced as a byproduct of the chain reaction. Some nuclear power plants can use plutonium as fuel, but it has to be extracted and processed.

Both elements are used to make nuclear weapons. Weapons-grade plutonium is derived from uranium to produce a more powerful explosion. Both elements are highly radioactive.

As the Cold War ended, the U.S. and Russia began disassembling nuclear warheads. The U.S. government currently holds about 60 metric tons of excess plutonium from used reactor fuel, the “pits” that were used in nuclear weapons and other residue, according to a 2018 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

What do we know about the DOE plan?

The 20 metric tons that will become available for the nuclear power industry would come from a 34-metric-ton stockpile the U.S. promised to dispose of in a 2000 nonproliferation agreement with Russia, according to Reuters.

A June memo published on the DOE website outlines takeaways from Trump’s directions, stating, “the President ordered the creation of a program to dispose of surplus plutonium by processing and making it available for advanced reactor fuel.”

A DOE spokesperson did not divulge any specific details on the plan. Reuters quoted the spokesperson as saying the department is “evaluating a variety of strategies to build and strengthen domestic supply chains for nuclear fuel, including plutonium.”

What are the potential pros and cons of recycling plutonium?

Denia Djokić, an assistant research scientist at the University of Michigan specializing in radioactive waste management, told Straight Arrow News she is “hesitant” about the administration’s plan.

On one hand, recycling plutonium has appeal because access to nuclear fuel is “one of the big bottlenecks” facing the nuclear power industry, which currently relies on mining uranium. The fuel would more likely be used to power conventional nuclear reactors, as the next-generation small modular reactors use a specific type of uranium fuel called HALEU.

However, Djokić said the U.S. government had already attempted to recycle plutonium, starting 25 years ago, and found the costs to be prohibitive.

“They wouldn’t be any different now,” Djokić said.

The government even funded a facility in South Carolina to convert leftover plutonium into fuel for nuclear reactors, but cost overruns led the first Trump administration to cancel the $50 billion contract before the facility was completed.

Djokić said plutonium is “a notoriously finicky metal” that makes it difficult to handle. During any recycling process, she said, “you’re essentially increasing the risks of radioactive things being released,” so safety measures contribute to high costs.

Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Reuters that the “DOE should stick to the safer, more secure and far cheaper plan to dilute [excess plutonium] and directly dispose of it.”

Lyman pointed to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, an underground storage site in New Mexico designed to dispose of nuclear waste.

However, some experts see potential in the DOE’s approach.

Bradley Williams, an energy policy advisor at the Idaho National Laboratory, said using existing plutonium is “an initial step that makes sense,” Axios reported. “We might as well get useful electricity out of it,” Williams said at a recent National Press Club event.

What is the state of nuclear regulation?

The use of a different fuel type may also be subject to review by federal regulators.

However, nearly 200 employees have left the Nuclear Regulatory Commission since January amid budget cuts by the Trump administration, according to the Financial Times.

Two of five commissioners’ seats are vacant, and half of the agency’s senior leaders are serving in an “acting” capacity. When Scott Morris left the NRC in May, he was the deputy executive director of operations. Now, Morris told the Financial Times, the agency is experiencing a “huge brain drain of talent.”

Overhauling the commission was also among the goals outlined in Trump’s executive order. Concerns over the DOE plan, however, go beyond the commission’s ability to regulate nuclear power.

Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., cochair of the Congressional Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control Working Group, spoke out against the plan, warning that it poses a security risk.

Giving away 20 metric tons of plutonium amounts to “trashing long-standing bipartisan U.S. policy and raising serious concerns about the spread of nuclear weapons to additional states or terrorist groups,” Markey said. Some scientists think that it’s possible to reverse-engineer aspects of nuclear warhead design by analyzing repurposed plutonium.

“We might as well just sell nuclear weapons at Costco,” Markey said.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082925-GFX_Mikael_FI-PlutoneumNuclearPower-CLEAN.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 19:04:00.192819

One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV.","(TestMiles) – Toyota is investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and EVs, but rumors continue to swirl about even bolder future products. Separating fact from speculation matters for both buyers and industry insiders.

Why does this matter right now?

Toyota is not dabbling in electrification; it is betting billions. Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is scheduled to open soon with fourteen lines for hybrid and battery output. The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory. By focusing on hybrids with premium touches, Toyota continues to exploit an efficiency gap while rivals rush into full battery electric territory.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you are an industry professional, this story underlines where Toyota is putting its real money. For consumers, it clarifies what is available now, the Crown sedan and Signia SUV, and what will be available soon, namely, Toyota’s first U.S.-built EVs. Enthusiasts and speculators, however, will want to lean into the second half of this story: the rumors Toyota is not confirming.

And Now for the Speculation: Toyota is not confirming.

This is where things get interesting. Industry chatter often fills the vacuum left by Toyota’s conservative announcements. Some speculation is logical, some fanciful, and all of it has been downplayed by Toyota spokesperson Nathan Kokes, who has emphasized that only announcements made by Toyota should be considered fact. Kokes went on to tell us, “To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana”.

Kokes went on to say, “As previously announced, Toyota plans to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Toyota will now assemble both vehicles at Toyota Kentucky.” And “Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume”. Finally, Kokes gave some insight into Toyota’s commitment to its workforce by saying, “We remain committed to providing long-term job stability for our team members.”

But the speculation from some persists. One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV. Outlets often label it the “bZ5X,” following Toyota’s bZ (beyond zero) naming convention. Others expect a Lexus version called the “TZ.” Toyota has never confirmed these names, and official channels continue to describe the projects simply as future three-row battery electric SUVs.

The Crown line is another hotbed of rumor. In Japan, the Crown family includes sedan, crossover, sport, and estate body styles. Some observers expect Toyota to expand the U.S. Crown line beyond the sedan and Signia SUV, potentially with a larger three-row premium vehicle or a sportier fastback. At this time, Toyota has not confirmed such plans, but marketing material in the U.S. clearly positions Crown as a “family” of models, hinting at long-term potential.

Trucks and off-roaders draw even more speculation. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed the EPU concept, a compact electric pickup with a footprint similar to a Ford Maverick. Many expect this to morph into a U.S. product, but Toyota has never confirmed American production. Similarly, Toyota showed the Compact Cruiser EV, a boxy small SUV in the vein of an FJ or Bronco Sport rival. Rumors continue that Toyota could launch a rugged EV or hybrid under the Land Cruiser or FJ nameplates, but again, no confirmation exists. The only rugged revival officially on the books is the Land Cruiser hybrid, which is already in American showrooms.

There are even whispers of a new sub-brand dedicated to electrification. Commentators suggest Toyota could spin off its EVs into a distinct nameplate, following the path of Lexus in the 1980s or Prius in the 2000s. Toyota has never acknowledged this idea, and so far, the closest evidence is the consistent branding of “bZ” on its vehicles.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term view is two-sided. On the one hand, the confirmed investments are enormous and concrete. North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana will become the core of Toyota’s American electrification strategy, and the Crown family already plants Toyota’s premium flag between Toyota and Lexus. On the other hand, the speculation illustrates the appetite for Toyota to do more: a compact truck to take on Ford, a rugged EV to challenge Bronco, or a broader Crown brand to pull buyers away from Acura and Infiniti. For now, those remain rumors, and Toyota has made it clear that only official announcements are the truth.",https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/08/Tacoma_Overlanding_Concept_Action_SEMA_2021_Hi-Res_15-600x400-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 20:01:49.360418

However, judging by the words of an influential Republican, these incentives may soon disappear.

“I think it’s more likely that we will cancel them than keep them,” House Speaker Mike Johnson stated in an interview with Bloomberg. “But we’ll see how it goes.”

The new administration does not hide its negative stance on these incentives, which were introduced during Barack Obama’s tenure and later modified under Joe Biden. Some countries, including the UK and Germany, have already abandoned subsidies, believing that the electric vehicle market is now strong enough to develop without government support.

Canceling the incentives would align with Trump’s policy of promoting fossil fuels and dismantling the environmental initiatives of previous years. Furthermore, it would help Republicans save funds, although the real impact on the budget would be minimal—only $2 billion was spent on EV subsidies in the first 10 months of last year.

However, for automakers and buyers, the cancellation of incentives could have serious consequences. The production of electric cars is currently more expensive than that of conventional cars, and tax credits help to equalize prices. The loss of these incentives could further slow down the already weaker demand for electric vehicles in 2024, despite the billions invested by auto giants in the development of new models and factories.

These factors could become an argument in favor of preserving the incentives, as some Republicans would not support a decision that threatens job losses in their states.

Natura Resources LLC announced Wednesday it has secured nuclear fuel from the U.S. Department of Energy for its molten salt reactor, dubbed the MSR-1. The reactor will be built at Abilene Christian University and could revolutionize how nuclear power plants operate.

Unlike traditional nuclear plants that use solid fuel rods, the molten salt reactor runs on liquid fuel at low pressure. Company officials say this advanced nuclear technology makes it inherently safer while producing clean electricity, making fresh water from seawater and medical isotopes for cancer treatment.

The project has racked up several firsts: It's the only liquid-fueled reactor approved for construction by federal regulators, and ACU became the first university to get a construction permit for an advanced reactor.

Texas lawmakers threw their support behind the project, allocating $120 million through Texas Tech University. The Energy Department also selected Natura for a pilot program designed to fast-track advanced reactor development.

""This represents a transformative step toward sustainable energy,"" said Doug Robison, Natura's founder and CEO.

The company completed a specialized research facility at ACU in 2023 and finalized the reactor's design this summer. Construction activities are now underway.

When the Trump administration announced it was moving to eliminate dozens of U.S. climate policies, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said he was sending “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

That drive – to both repeal environmental regulations and cast doubt on science – reflects the Trump administration’s approach to environment policy.

Deregulation has long been a key theme in Republican environmental policy. The conflict between the obligation to protect public health and the desire to boost markets traces back to Ronald Reagan’s presidential administration. Reagan’s perspective that government is not a solution to problems, but is the problem instead, set the stage for Republican administrations that followed.

Reagan argued that the growth of government spending and business regulation had stymied economic prosperity. Environmental regulations were a prime target.

Forty years later, America is seeing many of the same concepts in the Trump administration. However, its strategy could have a greater effect than Reagan ever envisioned.

Slashing budgets and staffing

There are many ways to kneecap government agencies: Instituting massive budget cuts, cutting staff with critical functions and appointing leadership whose goal is limiting the reach and effectiveness of the very agencies they direct are just a few.

In these efforts, Reagan and Trump had similar approaches to the EPA, although with different levels of intensity.

Trump’s EPA budget plan for 2026 includes a draconian 50% cut from the previous year and the lowest budget proposal, when adjusted for inflation, since Reagan. Staff cuts in just the first six months of the second Trump administration put the agency’s total employment at 12,448, down from 16,155 in January.

Reagan dissolved the EPA Office of Enforcement to limit “unnecessary regulation,” which resulted in a 80% decline in actions to enforce environmental regulations. Trump is also stopping enforcement actions, dismantling the EPA’s Science and Research Office and politicizing the agency’s science by putting political appointees in charge, moves that undermine EPA’s independence and expertise.

Both cut EPA’s budget, but that alone does not reduce an agency’s effectiveness.

Politicizing EPA leadership

When the EPA was founded in 1970 during the Nixon administration, it represented a bipartisan consensus: After decades of auto exhaust, polluted waterways and smog-filled air, environmental protection had become a national policy priority.

But industries that EPA regulated argued that the costs of implementing the agency’s mandates were too high. That created tension between economics and science and enforcement.

As part of his “government is not the solution” approach, Reagan issued an executive order shortly after taking office in 1981 requiring federal agencies to submit all proposed rules to the White House Office of Management and Budget before making them public. In Reagan’s eyes, this approach centralized power in the White House and was a way to eliminate burdensome regulations before the agencies announced them to the public.

He also appointed an EPA administrator who shared his anti-government perspective. Anne Gorsuch Burford was a lawyer and state legislator from Colorado, where she routinely voted against toxic waste cleanup and auto pollution controls.

Once in Washington, she appointed several people to the EPA’s leadership team with direct ties to industries the EPA regulated. An example was Rita Lavelle, head of the EPA’s toxic waste programs, who was later convicted of perjury for lying to Congress about when she knew her former employer, a defense contractor, was disposing of toxic waste at a now notorious dump site.

These appointments were an example of regulatory capture by the industries EPA was in charge of overseeing. Anne Gorsuch Burford was held in contempt of Congress for not turning over records related to the Superfund cleanup of the same hazardous waste site, which led to her resignation. The Superfund program to clean up toxic waste dumps was new and one of EPA’s largest programs at the time.

The scandals, broken staff morale, stripped budgets and fights over policy discredited the agency.

Going after government scientists

Anne Gorsuch Burford’s deregulation efforts weren’t fully successful, in part because EPA staff experts rallied to preserve science and regulatory functions. They leaked materials about delays in the Superfund site cleanup to sympathetic congressional staff, who in turn found support from Republican and Democratic senators.

That history may have influenced the Trump administration’s strategy toward the federal bureaucracy’s staff experts, who Trump calls “the Deep State.”

The Department of Government Efficiency, an unofficial group Trump set up in early 2025 headed by Elon Musk, directed the firing of tens of thousands of government scientists and other staff with expertise that government agencies rely on. Thousands more have resigned amid intimidation tactics such as surveillance.

Trump’s head of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, has been clear about targeting bureaucrats. He said in 2023: “We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can’t do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. We want to put them in trauma.”

There is a clear focus today on EPA programs that don’t align with the administration’s views. Programs related to environmental justice for low-income communities are in the line of fire. The appointment of people from the chemical, fossil fuel and corporate industries to high-level regulatory and legal positions raises questions about regulatory capture – whether their focus will be more on the health of the industries they oversee than on the health of the public.

An example is decision-making related to who bears the costs of cleaning up pollution from PFAS “forever chemicals” − persistent, harmful chemicals that are now found in drinking water and in people’s bloodstreams. Steven Cook, a Trump appointee, once represented chemical companies that are fighting a rule that would require them to clean up PFAS pollution. He has now proposed scrapping the rule, The New York Times reports. That move could shift what are expected to be billions of dollars in cleanup costs to taxpayers instead. It would be a significant shift away from the 45-year Superfund mantra that “the polluter pays.” Such actions blur the lines between ethics, policymaking and consumer and company interests.

The first Trump administration had a focus on reforming permitting and bureaucracy. While appearing radical at the time, the revamping of scientific boards to include more industry representatives, the undoing of power plant rules and the lessening of enforcement hobbled but did not completely undo the agency.

The second Trump administration, in actively supporting fossil fuel “energy dominance,” is taking steps to not just eliminate regulations but to ensure future administrations can’t bring the regulations back, by using a complex set of legal arguments related to the regulation of greenhouse gases.

At the same time, the administration is trying to discredit scientific research to downplay the risks of a warming planet.

The Reagan administration, while it also pushed for deregulation and expanded permitting of oil, gas and coal leases, embraced some elements of environmental protection. Reagan designated more than 10 million acres as protected wilderness and signed the Coastal Barriers Resources Act, which helped protect 3.5 million acres of shoreline from development. When Reagan signed the Montreal Protocol in 1988 to help protect the ozone layer, he cited scientific data showing the growing risks of ozone-depleting substances.

When Congress doesn’t push back

There is another critical difference between the first and second Trump administrations: The current Republican-controlled Congress is consenting to almost every request the president makes.

Congress has a constitutional responsibility to be a check on the executive branch, and a bipartisan Congress has long taken an active role in oversight and investigation involving environmental issues.

In 2025, however, Congress has approved most of Trump’s demands, including voting to repeal much of the Inflation Reduction Act, a package of pro-environment spending it had just passed two years earlier and that included many projects in Republican districts.

The administration’s effort to eliminate U.S. climate policies will take time and face lawsuits.

In an irony of history, Anne Gorsuch Burford’s son Neil Gorsuch now sits on the Supreme Court. His vote when those cases come before the court may be the ultimate Reagan legacy on the Trump EPA.

We can do that here, and it would be a boon for the whole West Coast, not just Humboldt Bay and not just California.
In July, the administration announced that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum would have to personally approve all wind energy projects moving forward.

Duffy announced that the Department of Transportation has withdrawn or terminated $679 million for 12 offshore wind projects currently in various stages of development, essentially scuttling the promise of many in-development offshore wind projects in the U.S. in the near term.

Those funds include $426.7 million for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Terminal (an INFRA grant that would essentially pay for the construction and completion of the project) and $8.6 million for the Redwood Marine Terminal Project planning.

In a news release, the DOT characterized the 12 projects as “doomed.”

“The Trump Administration has refocused the Department of Transportation and its Maritime Administration (MARAD) on rebuilding America’s shipbuilding capacity, unleashing more reliable, traditional forms of energy and utilizing the nation’s bountiful natural resources to unleash American energy,” DOT’s press release said.

Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation and Conservation District Commissioner Greg Dale told the Times-Standard that the district would continue to work toward its project goals, hoping to fund the final construction phase of the project at a later date. He said that news of the withdrawal of funds had been disappointing but not altogether unexpected.

“It’s kind of a bummer, but I’m not surprised after all the rhetoric we’ve heard over the last six, eight, 10 months,” Dale said.

Dale said that the shift in policy away from offshore wind, a potential growth industry that could bolster local, state and nationwide manufacturing jobs, seems misguided and that, had the U.S. invested in solar manufacturing at a similar juncture 10 years ago, the nation would be manufacturing solar panels rather than importing them.

“We believe in the project. We believe in the industry, and we want to see the industry thrive, so our goal would be to continue on as best we could,” Dale said. “We’d like to get the project permitted and through all the process, and then when it comes time that we could actually build the project (Dale noted that that phase is likely a decade away “at minimum”), we will cross that bridge when the time comes …

“These are large infrastructure projects. We build lots of large infrastructure projects like offshore oil rigs in America. We can do that here, and it would be a boon for the whole West Coast, not just Humboldt Bay and not just California. It would be a boon for every port on the West Coast, small and large. So I think it’s a good utilization of our resources.”

Rhetoric about wind energy

Concerns about the future of offshore wind have been percolating in the past year, as President Donald Trump continually maligned and misrepresented wind and other green energy technologies, and made efforts to scuttle offshore wind projects.

In May, a coalition of 16 states and Washington, D.C., sued the administration over an executive order halting leasing and permitting for offshore wind projects.

In July, the administration announced that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum would have to personally approve all wind energy projects moving forward.

Just last week, the administration halted construction on the Revolution Wind project, an 80% complete wind energy project off the Rhode Island and Connecticut coast, citing “national security concerns.”

“Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy in a news release issued by the DOT. “Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry. Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

Elected officials respond

“If it’s a day ending in Y, it’s another day the Trump administration is assaulting clean energy and infrastructure projects — hurting business and killing jobs in rural areas, and ceding our economic future to China,” Gov. Gavin Newsom told the Times-Standard via email Friday afternoon.

Humboldt County Fourth District Supervisor Natalie Arroyo called the news “incredibly disappointing.” She said that she was unsure what the next steps the Humboldt Bay Harbor District would take with the vast majority of its funding withdrawn.

California Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) told the Times-Standard in May of this year that offshore wind represented “a once in a lifetime opportunity for the North Coast’s rural economy.” Friday morning, McGuire took a defiant tone in addressing questions about the future of offshore wind in California.

“I’ll be damned if we let Trump’s profit-first, science-last approach take root here at home. California’s green energy and climate programs continue to lead the nation, and offshore wind is a critical component to protecting our progress and communities in the face of the climate crisis,” McGuire said via email. “The Humboldt Bay Harbor District has been working tirelessly with community partners to bring offshore wind to the North Coast and California must continue to support their efforts despite Trump’s moves to bring back offshore oil and expand coal. Wind is the future and we must keep pressing forward.”

Rep. Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) issued a statement on Friday at noon lambasting the decision to cancel offshore wind projects, but he was not available to directly answer questions Friday.

“This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers,” Huffman said. “Surrendering the future to China by dragging America back to dirty, climate-wrecking fossil fuel dependency while most of the world is moving on to safer, cleaner, and cheaper clean energy, is reckless, corrupt, and profoundly against our national interests.

“The Humboldt project in my district shows what’s possible when we put people over polluters. For a small, rural community, it means jobs, affordable and clean power for millions, and Tribes getting a seat at the table and share of the benefits. But Trump has decided that keeping Big Oil happy matters more than lowering costs, creating jobs, or securing America’s energy future.”

Earlier in the week, Huffman told the Times-Standard that “for environmental and economic reasons, the state must position itself as the renewable energy leader.”

He expressed optimism about the state reaching its decarbonization goals and efforts to develop infrastructure around green energy on the North Coast, but stopped short of saying he believed the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind project would be able to weather the antagonism of the Trump administration, saying “without offshore wind, the path forward would be different, but not unattainable.”

“The Administration’s posture and actions have made it harder for the companies involved to maintain the investment they need to move forward right now,” Huffman said. “We have to continue to develop the infrastructure to support the project, and my goal is to position Humboldt as a ‘shovel ready’ port when the winds are more favorable (yes, pun intended).

“Even ignoring the need to decarbonize in order to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, renewable energy is now cheaper and with fewer health impacts than fossil fuel infrastructure. For instance, electricity production from solar energy is now 41% cheaper than the deployment of fossil fuels (according to the UN). As offshore wind technology matures, its price-point will also rapidly decrease.”

Assemblymember Chris Rogers (D-Santa Rosa), a proponent of offshore wind, said in February that the technology has “the potential to transform the economy of the North Coast.” Rogers was traveling Friday and could not be reached in time to comment.

It costs an average of $4,058 annually to insure an electric vehicle, compared with $2,732 for a traditional vehicle, according to the data. Electric cars cost more to replace, are more expensive to repair, and are more likely to have issues that lead to insurance claims, the report said.

“Insurance costs, because they are ongoing, do matter in the long-term calculation of whether it costs more or less for any given person to drive an EV versus a gas-powered car,” said Julia Taliesin, who authored the report.

Battery-powered cars cost more to insure because they have higher sticker prices, are more easily damaged and require specific parts for repairs, Taliesin said. A fender bender that would be a simple fix on a traditional vehicle could require an expensive and lengthy repair on an EV to mend the battery and recalibrate the car and its sensors.

“The cost of what’s making up the car, and the cost of the labor to make those repairs, all go into why EVs are more expensive to insure,” she said.

Insurance prices are even higher in states where there are fewer EVs and fewer mechanics who can work on them, the report said. In Arkansas and Idaho, where there is low EV adoption rates, the cost of full coverage for an electric vehicle can be almost twice that of a traditional car.

In California, it costs 15% to 31% more to insure an electric vehicle than it would to insure a traditional car, according to Insurify. Widespread EV adoption in the state drives prices down and gives insurers more data, allowing them to offer lower premiums, Taliesin said.

“California has been very intentional about infrastructure and incentivizing EV ownership,” Taliesin said. “It leads the nation in EV adoption, and that has a bit of a waterfall effect on a few other things that relate to insurance costs.”

As federal EV incentives dwindle under the Trump administration, state-level programs become increasingly important tools in encouraging EV adoption, experts said. The California Air Resources Board mandates that all new cars sold in the state by 2035 be zero-emission, an ambitious goal that faces challenges in Washington.

Transitioning more completely to electric vehicles is vital in the fight against human-caused climate change, experts say. However, recent polling data from Gallup show that fewer Americans are open to buying an EV than they were two years ago. As of April, 51% of those surveyed said they already owned or were considering buying an EV, down from 59% in 2023.

It’s easier to insure an EV now than it was a decade ago, said Mallory Mooney, director of sales and service at Insurify.

“When we first started seeing EVs, we had a hard time placing Teslas for coverage and other specific models that we’ve seen are troublesome for repair,” she said.

The Tesla Model X and Model 3 top Insurify’s list of most expensive EVs to insure.

The Model X has an average annual cost of $4,765 for full coverage, a sharp 36% jump since last year. The data also show that the Model 3 has a claims frequency rate that is significantly higher than the industry average, indicating it may require more frequent repairs.

Most standard insurance carriers offer policies for EVs, but there are exceptions, even in California, Mooney said. Specialized carriers, including Aspire, Bristol West and National General, which offer policies to high-risk drivers, typically don’t cover electric vehicles.

Though EVs tend to cost more to repair, they usually cost less to maintain under normal conditions, said Taliesin. Savings on maintenance and gas could help offset ongoing insurance fees and high up-front price tags on EVs.

“Electric vehicles are more technical and finicky,” she said. “The more there are on the road, the more affordable they should become.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2023/08/06/2MVTYBRXY7GOJ5XBSC5FIQWP4E.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-08-29 19:07:09.864425

The State Land Office said in a news release Thursday it expects the proposed rule to modernize and improve the agency’s process for issuing geothermal leases in response to an increase in demand.

New Mexico in 2013 amended the Geothermal Resources Act to limit what counts as a “geothermal resource” to be a renewable source of natural heat from the Earth that is above 250 degrees Fahrenheit. The law also required lease holders to pay both the base rent and royalties for any power generated and minerals or chemicals derived from a project.

The State Land Office said in an Aug. 22 explainer that the proposed rule is meant to align with the 2013 legislation.

Under the proposed rule, the State Land Office would be allowed to issue a geothermal lease for a period of up to five years for the purpose of exploration, in anticipation of a potential long-term lease that would last as long as the resource is producing or capable of producing heat “in commercial quantities.”

New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands Stephanie Garcia Richard said Thursday the public comment process will guide her office’s decisions about how to offer leases of state land “to tap this growing renewable energy potential.”

“New Mexico’s geothermal industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years — with the perfect combination of prime geology, technical expertise and a supportive regulatory environment,” Garcia Richard said in a statement. “We need to be ready to meet the growing demand for clean, sustainable energy.”

For example, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in June announced a new private investment in a geothermal plant or plants that will provide social media giant Meta’s New Mexico data centers with 150 megawatts of energy.

The project is expected to start generating power by 2030, XGS Energy Vice President and Head of Development Logan Stephens told the interim legislative Economic and Rural Development and Policy Committee on Aug. 11.

“It represents only a fraction of the broader opportunity here in the state, driven by that abundance of hot-rock geothermal resources, as well as an abundance of suitable land, both private, federal, state and tribal,” Stephens told the committee. “We believe the market opportunity for XGS in New Mexico over the next five years could be several thousands of megawatts. We’re really limited only by our ability to deliver that power to the grid and to the customers, and our ability to secure permits.”

The State Land Office’s public rulemaking hearing begins at 10 a.m. on Sept. 30 in Morgan Hall at the agency’s building at 310 Old Santa Fe Trail in Santa Fe.

The proposed cuts would target the city’s fleet electrification program and energy audits, among other programs. The City Manager’s proposed budget increases spending on the city’s electric vehicle fleet transition from $2.7 to $6.1 million dollars. It also proposes a year by year goal for the city to transition a portion of the municipally owned vehicle fleet to electric: 10% by the end of FY26 and 15% electric by the end of FY27.

The city’s Comprehensive Environmental and Climate Action Plan (CECAP) also lays out a goal that all new transit buses and light duty vehicles purchased by the city, Dallas ISD, and DART be fully electric by 2030 and that 100% of the vehicles in the city’s fleet be electric by 2040.

Environment Texas is organizing a petition opposing the proposed cuts.

“For me, this project is about making sure Amarillo’s skilled workforce benefits from the opportunities it will bring,” Sisemore said.
“Doosan is the largest, most respected nuclear power plant component supplier in the world,” he said.","Fermi America, which is developing what it calls the world’s largest private grid to power artificial intelligence, has named former Amarillo Mayor Trent Sisemore as its community lead while advancing a major international nuclear partnership with Doosan Enerbility.

The Texas Tech University System partner announced the move this week as part of its effort to connect with the Amarillo community, where it plans to build an $11 billion private grid and artificial intelligence campus on 5,200 acres of university land near the city. Preliminary economic impact studies project the development could create about 2,500 direct jobs and 6,000 indirect jobs, generating an estimated $1.2 billion annually during construction.

Sisemore, who served as mayor from 2005 to 2011 and as a city commissioner, will act as Fermi’s local representative. His role includes hosting town halls, collaborating with civic groups and businesses, and leading a new Community Advisory Board that the company says will address infrastructure, housing and environmental concerns.

Fermi co-founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer said Sisemore was chosen because of his deep ties to the region.

“Growing up in the Panhandle forged shared values that Trent exemplifies,” Neugebauer said. “We believe his leadership will help ensure Amarillo’s voice is heard as we build this project.”

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another Fermi co-founder, described Sisemore’s appointment as a signal of the project’s credibility.

“Trent’s track record shows he gets things done while keeping community first,” Perry said.

A familiar local figure

Sisemore is a well-known figure in Amarillo politics and business. During his tenure in city government, he supported initiatives that brought Bell Helicopter’s manufacturing plant to Amarillo, helped develop the Amarillo Civic Center’s performing arts space, and backed the purchase of water rights that city leaders say will sustain the city for more than 200 years.

Beyond politics, Sisemore served 17 years on the board of Happy State Bank and worked with local charities, including the High Plains Food Bank. A businessman and entrepreneur, he co-owned Jack Sisemore Traveland with his father before selling it in 2017, and he was a founding partner of Keystone RV, which grew into the world’s largest travel trailer manufacturer at the time of its sale in 2001.

“For me, this project is about making sure Amarillo’s skilled workforce benefits from the opportunities it will bring,” Sisemore said.

Global partnership

The announcement came days after Fermi signed a memorandum of understanding with Doosan Enerbility, a South Korean company that supplies components for more than 40% of the world’s nuclear power plants, according to industry reports.

Neugebauer said Doosan’s track record gives him confidence the project can remain on schedule. “Doosan is the largest, most respected nuclear power plant component supplier in the world,” he said. “They know how to deliver on time and on budget.”

Mesut Uzman, Fermi’s chief nuclear commercial officer, also pointed to Doosan’s history of delivering projects in Asia and the Middle East. “Having worked with them before, I’ve seen their precision and commitment to safety firsthand,” Uzman said.

Doosan President Jongdoo Kim characterized the partnership as one built on “mutual respect and a shared commitment to innovation.”

Long-term plans

Fermi’s Amarillo campus aims to deliver 11 gigawatts of power — enough to supply about 3 million homes — and 15 million square feet of AI computing capacity. The project will combine natural gas, nuclear, solar and battery storage to meet the demand for data centers, which the U.S. Department of Energy estimates consume 10 times more energy than traditional facilities.

The first gigawatt of natural gas generation is expected online by the end of 2026, with one additional gigawatt added annually for a decade. Nuclear construction is slated to begin in 2027, with the first small modular reactor projected to be operational by 2032.

Fermi has pledged to invest $50 million in local water conservation and renewable energy integration to reduce environmental impacts. Sisemore’s Community Advisory Board is expected to hold its first public meeting in early 2026 to discuss housing expansion, road upgrades and water use with city officials.

“Amarillo has the talent and grit to make this project a success,” Sisemore said. “We’ll work together to ensure this campus benefits our community for generations.”","https://www.amarillo.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/29/NAGN/85893680007-img-9067.jpeg?crop=1498,843,x0,y100&width=1498&height=843&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-29 18:04:12.883124

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) combine electric and gasoline (or diesel) powertrains removing range anxiety concerns and reducing the need for extensive mining required for larger battery packs.
When electric vehicles first arrived on the market, they were promoted as having no ecological downsides.
According to the University of Michigan’s coverage of the relevant studies that's tied to the Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator, that may not necessarily be true.","The University of Michigan is offering a tool that’s supposed to calculate the total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for new vehicles based upon a person’s location and driving patterns. The equation is supposed to take into account everything from the very moment components start being assembled to the day the model is hauled to the junkyard to be destroyed. According to the researchers involved, all-electric vehicles are significantly cleaner than their gasoline-dependent rivals.

Published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, and supported by the State of Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity and the U-M Electric Vehicle Center, the study that yielded the Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator attempted to map U.S. emissions. The takeaway was that the “electrification of powertrains is a powerful tool for decarbonization.”

While the default tool makes a lot of broad assumptions about driving habits, users can tweak things to create a more accurate representation. According to the university, the authors are calling it the most comprehensive analysis to date — “providing drivers with estimates of emissions per mile driven across 35 different combinations of vehicle class and powertrains.”

In terms of body styles, sedans typically produced the least amount of emissions per mile. As you might expect, the numbers come up the bigger and boxier a vehicle gets. Battery electric vehicles were the exception, with the study claiming that EVs had the lowest emissions at just 81 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per mile. That’s 20 percent less than the per-mile emissions of the average gasoline-powered truck.

Since nothing comes out of an EV’s nonexistent tailpipe, the study had to take into account where the electricity was being sourced from. The Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator that coincides with the research takes that into account and lets you set those parameters for yourself when making those comparisons.

However, the research team alleges that it doesn’t really matter. Their final takeaway was that the more electrified a vehicle becomes the less emissions are produced, even with weight and differences in regional power grids being a factor. But their study did not entirely ignore some of the downsides of electrification, even if it was signal minded about the overarching solution.

From the study Greenhouse Gas Reductions Driven by Vehicle Electrification across Powertrains, Classes, Locations, and Use Patterns:

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have substantial environmental benefits over both internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) alternatives, but have disadvantages such as limited range, inadequate charging infrastructure, longer refueling times, and performance issues in extreme environments. BEVs have a larger production burden than other powertrains due to the need for critical minerals and substantial energy for manufacturing long-range batteries. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) combine electric and gasoline (or diesel) powertrains removing range anxiety concerns and reducing the need for extensive mining required for larger battery packs. PHEVs offer many of the benefits of BEVs with the added flexibility of being able to use conventional fuel. To inform consumers, the automotive industry, and national decarbonization strategies, it is important to have a detailed understanding of the lifecycle emissions associated with different vehicle classes, powertrains, and use patterns across the U.S.

“Vehicle electrification is a key strategy for climate action. Transportation accounts for 28 [percent] of greenhouse gas emissions and we need to reduce those to limit future climate impacts such as flooding, wildfires and drought events, which are increasing in intensity and frequency,” said Greg Keoleian, senior author of the new study and a professor at the U-M School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS).

“Our purpose here was to evaluate the cradle-to-grave greenhouse gas reduction from the electrification of vehicles compared with a baseline of gasoline-powered vehicles.”

We’re fairly certain that transportation only accounts for about 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. And even that is split between passenger vehicles, commercial trucks, airplanes, railway lines, and other sources. But the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has cited significantly higher numbers (up to 30 percent) domestically during periods where it was controlled by more climate-focused administrations (e.g. 2020-2024). With that in mind, it might be worth considering the ongoing politicization of the overall premise.

In the past, the University of Michigan has been known for tracking the true average fuel economy of the United States based upon driving habits and the kind of vehicles Americans actually purchased. That study revealed that practical fuel economy only improved by about 10 percent between 1991 and 2015 and was basically stagnant in the later years. This was despite a swath of new government regulations being launched within that timeframe specifically designed to reduce emissions by boosting MPGs. It was an extremely useful dataset and helped showcase how there's often a major break between policy and results.

For whatever reason, the college has since abandoned that study. But it continued to release papers advocating for people to drive differently or embrace new lifestyles that could make up the difference. We’ve likewise seen researchers backed by the university assert that people should simply make different automotive purchasing decisions. Suffice it to say, the college is fairly keen on green initiatives and has provided a mix of highly salient information and what some would consider academic propaganda.

Some of that historically stems from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI), which has a self-stated mission to conduct research that results in improved roadway safety. However, it’s likewise funded by federal and state government agencies, motor vehicle manufacturers and suppliers. That leaves concerns that its studies, which often go back to those same entities to support their decisions, could be influenced by funding.

But the Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator didn’t come via the UMTRI, it came by way of the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS). Previously known as the School of Natural Resources and Environment prior to 2005, and originally created as the School of Forestry, the SEAS is laser focused on environmental issues and promoting things like “climate justice.”

That’s not necessarily a bad thing. However, it still suggests a fairly heavy bias from the relevant source after the public has already endured years of preachy environmentalism. When electric vehicles first arrived on the market, they were promoted as having no ecological downsides. But we eventually learned that wasn’t the case. Battery production not only polluted the environment but often yielded hazardous mining operations that employed children in third-world countries. Modern arguments have EVs as being significantly tougher on the planet and its inhabitants during the manufacturing process, with the ability to make up for it over time by not being as reliant on petroleum products over the lifespan. But this typically presumed a meaningful portion of the electricity was being sourced from renewables.

According to the University of Michigan’s coverage of the relevant studies that's tied to the Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator, that may not necessarily be true. It’s making the claim that choosing the more electrified vehicle will almost always reduce a driver’s greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of where they happen to live within the contiguous United States. However, the study’s authors were a little more nuanced when commenting on the matter.

“The thing is really matching your vehicle with your needs,” stated Keoleian. “Obviously, if you’re in the trades, you may need a pickup truck. But you can get a battery electric pickup truck. If you’re just commuting to work by yourself, I’d recommend a sedan BEV instead.”

However, he likewise suggested that simply pivoting to the smallest gasoline car that would suit a household’s needs would also help move the environmental needle. That certainly feels correct and will undoubtedly save you money in the process. But automakers have pivoted away from lightweight affordable cars in recent years in the hopes of seeing juicier profit margins and better safety scores, making finding those small cars difficult.

All told, it seems like the research has resulted in a potentially useful tool and it's genuinely impressive that anyone was able to compile this much data to begin with. But it has also resulted in some of the same blanket statements about emissions that we’ve been hearing for decades when the whole point of the Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator was to make specific comparisons between regions and vehicle models.

Your author is personally skeptical about any tool being able to take every single factor into account, however. I've been following the industry for a long time and trying to estimate the average emissions of foreign suppliers and shipping companies required to being a single component to a factory before final assembly takes place is borderline impossible. Attempting to do that for every component that goes into every new model currently in production would be a staggering undertaking loaded with false datasets provided by companies desperate to make themselves look as environmentally friendly as possible. At a minimum, even a generalized summation of greenhouse gasses that proved to be truly accurate on a single model would be a tall order and that's before we've attempted to estimate emissions over the remainder of its lifespan.

It’s also unclear whether or not this tool will impact the market in any meaningful way. EVs aren’t really being held back because the public views them as insufficiently green. It’s because they went to market before the technology could offer an ownership experience matching what drivers were already accustomed to at a price they could afford. They’re simply too specialized to work for all households.",https://cdn-fastly.thetruthaboutcars.com/media/2025/08/28/15481/social-45130666.jpg?size=1200x628,N,,2025-08-29 20:02:13.338383

In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV.
One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV.","(TestMiles) – Toyota is investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and EVs, but rumors continue to swirl about even bolder future products. Separating fact from speculation matters for both buyers and industry insiders.

Why does this matter right now?

Toyota is not dabbling in electrification; it is betting billions. Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is scheduled to open soon with fourteen lines for hybrid and battery output. The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory. By focusing on hybrids with premium touches, Toyota continues to exploit an efficiency gap while rivals rush into full battery electric territory.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you are an industry professional, this story underlines where Toyota is putting its real money. For consumers, it clarifies what is available now, the Crown sedan and Signia SUV, and what will be available soon, namely, Toyota’s first U.S.-built EVs. Enthusiasts and speculators, however, will want to lean into the second half of this story: the rumors Toyota is not confirming.

And Now for the Speculation: Toyota is not confirming.

This is where things get interesting. Industry chatter often fills the vacuum left by Toyota’s conservative announcements. Some speculation is logical, some fanciful, and all of it has been downplayed by Toyota spokesperson Nathan Kokes, who has emphasized that only announcements made by Toyota should be considered fact. Kokes went on to tell us, “To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana”.

Kokes went on to say, “As previously announced, Toyota plans to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Toyota will now assemble both vehicles at Toyota Kentucky.” And “Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume”. Finally, Kokes gave some insight into Toyota’s commitment to its workforce by saying, “We remain committed to providing long-term job stability for our team members.”

But the speculation from some persists. One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV. Outlets often label it the “bZ5X,” following Toyota’s bZ (beyond zero) naming convention. Others expect a Lexus version called the “TZ.” Toyota has never confirmed these names, and official channels continue to describe the projects simply as future three-row battery electric SUVs.

The Crown line is another hotbed of rumor. In Japan, the Crown family includes sedan, crossover, sport, and estate body styles. Some observers expect Toyota to expand the U.S. Crown line beyond the sedan and Signia SUV, potentially with a larger three-row premium vehicle or a sportier fastback. At this time, Toyota has not confirmed such plans, but marketing material in the U.S. clearly positions Crown as a “family” of models, hinting at long-term potential.

Trucks and off-roaders draw even more speculation. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed the EPU concept, a compact electric pickup with a footprint similar to a Ford Maverick. Many expect this to morph into a U.S. product, but Toyota has never confirmed American production. Similarly, Toyota showed the Compact Cruiser EV, a boxy small SUV in the vein of an FJ or Bronco Sport rival. Rumors continue that Toyota could launch a rugged EV or hybrid under the Land Cruiser or FJ nameplates, but again, no confirmation exists. The only rugged revival officially on the books is the Land Cruiser hybrid, which is already in American showrooms.

There are even whispers of a new sub-brand dedicated to electrification. Commentators suggest Toyota could spin off its EVs into a distinct nameplate, following the path of Lexus in the 1980s or Prius in the 2000s. Toyota has never acknowledged this idea, and so far, the closest evidence is the consistent branding of “bZ” on its vehicles.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term view is two-sided. On the one hand, the confirmed investments are enormous and concrete. North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana will become the core of Toyota’s American electrification strategy, and the Crown family already plants Toyota’s premium flag between Toyota and Lexus. On the other hand, the speculation illustrates the appetite for Toyota to do more: a compact truck to take on Ford, a rugged EV to challenge Bronco, or a broader Crown brand to pull buyers away from Acura and Infiniti.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV.","(TestMiles) – Toyota is investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and EVs, but rumors continue to swirl about even bolder future products. Separating fact from speculation matters for both buyers and industry insiders.

Why does this matter right now?

Toyota is not dabbling in electrification; it is betting billions. Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is scheduled to open soon with fourteen lines for hybrid and battery output. The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory. By focusing on hybrids with premium touches, Toyota continues to exploit an efficiency gap while rivals rush into full battery electric territory.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you are an industry professional, this story underlines where Toyota is putting its real money. For consumers, it clarifies what is available now, the Crown sedan and Signia SUV, and what will be available soon, namely, Toyota’s first U.S.-built EVs. Enthusiasts and speculators, however, will want to lean into the second half of this story: the rumors Toyota is not confirming.

And Now for the Speculation: Toyota is not confirming.

This is where things get interesting. Industry chatter often fills the vacuum left by Toyota’s conservative announcements. Some speculation is logical, some fanciful, and all of it has been downplayed by Toyota spokesperson Nathan Kokes, who has emphasized that only announcements made by Toyota should be considered fact. Kokes went on to tell us, “To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana”.

Kokes went on to say, “As previously announced, Toyota plans to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Toyota will now assemble both vehicles at Toyota Kentucky.” And “Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume”. Finally, Kokes gave some insight into Toyota’s commitment to its workforce by saying, “We remain committed to providing long-term job stability for our team members.”

But the speculation from some persists. One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV. Outlets often label it the “bZ5X,” following Toyota’s bZ (beyond zero) naming convention. Others expect a Lexus version called the “TZ.” Toyota has never confirmed these names, and official channels continue to describe the projects simply as future three-row battery electric SUVs.

The Crown line is another hotbed of rumor. In Japan, the Crown family includes sedan, crossover, sport, and estate body styles. Some observers expect Toyota to expand the U.S. Crown line beyond the sedan and Signia SUV, potentially with a larger three-row premium vehicle or a sportier fastback. At this time, Toyota has not confirmed such plans, but marketing material in the U.S. clearly positions Crown as a “family” of models, hinting at long-term potential.

Trucks and off-roaders draw even more speculation. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed the EPU concept, a compact electric pickup with a footprint similar to a Ford Maverick. Many expect this to morph into a U.S. product, but Toyota has never confirmed American production.

More than half the country gets its power from electric cooperatives like Tipmont.","A rural utility in the Lafayette area aims to slowly reduce the amount of energy it gets from its power supplier.

More rural electric cooperatives around the country are looking to cut ties with their suppliers in favor of cheaper electric bills for customers and the flexibility to do what they want. That includes individual co-ops in Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Carolina.

Tipmont Rural Electric Membership Cooperative (REMC) plans to slowly phase out the amount of power it gets from Wabash Valley Power Alliance.

One of the benefits of these rural cooperatives is that customers get more of a say in what their utility does — including where it gets its power. But many of them are also part of larger generation and transmission cooperatives — which help REMCs get power and other resources. Contracts with these companies can be long and difficult to get out of.

It took Tipmont seven years to end its contract with WVPA — an agreement had to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Tipmont Communications Director Rob Ford explains why the utility decided to leave.

""Number one, the rates that were being offered oftentimes weren't competitive with the open wholesale power market. And number two, that all requirements contract had us paying for a lot of things that we didn't necessarily need,"" he said.

Ford said buying more power from the wholesale energy market will help the utility access cheaper and potentially cleaner power for customers. The utility hired NextEra Energy to help them navigate the open market — something Ford said will be a learning curve for Tipmont.

Tipmont also hopes to use excess power from rooftop solar and electric school buses to make the utility more reliable.

“We would be able to draw the energy off those school buses around 5, 6 o'clock, use that to lower our peak demand and then the school buses would charge back overnight and be ready to go at 6, 7 a.m. in the morning,” Ford said.

Wabash Valley Power Alliance serves 21 electric cooperatives across Indiana and Illinois. Vicki Duncan Gardner is vice president of marketing, communications and advocacy at WVPA.

She said generation and transmission cooperatives like WVPA have expertise that can help REMCs navigate the complex electric power system.

Duncan Gardner said Tipmont and its customers will no longer be able to benefit from things like the company’s financial investments, energy efficiency programs, and assistance navigating federal and state laws.

“You know this was a decision made by all parties and we certainly wish them the best,"" she said.

Duncan Garder said WVPA has kept electric rates relatively low — especially compared to double-digit increases this year at Indiana’s investor-owned utilities.

The Revolution Wind project, a 65-turbine clean energy initiative that would provide roughly 700 megawatts of energy to homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island, was expected to reduce energy costs in the region. The project is roughly 80% complete, with more than 1,200 workers involved in the effort.

But with the project’s abrupt freeze, many of those workers have been pushed out of work, disrupting a source of high-paying local jobs and leaving local union workers searching for answers.

“A lot of building trades workers, a lot of union workers voted for Donald Trump and his team. But they didn’t vote to have union jobs shut down,” Patrick Crowley, the president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, told USA Today this week. “It shouldn’t work like this.”

The decision has also raised larger concerns about how the administration is handling already ongoing projects.

“We were surprised that he shut down a project that’s 80% complete,” said Aziz Dehkan, the executive director of the Connecticut Roundtable on Climate and Jobs. “I could almost see him stopping nonpermitted or projects that are in the permitting process. But to close down a project that’s 80% complete seems to be a little out of line here.”

In the days since the project was halted, advocates for the Revolution Wind project and clean energy initiatives more broadly told The Connecticut Mirror that the incident raises concerns that go beyond a singular project.

They also point to a broader climate of uncertainty that has been created by the past few months of policy changes affecting wind and solar programs. Those concerns have grown as the Trump administration reverses many of the energy policies of the Biden administration, including elements of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that provided incentives for clean energy projects around the country.

The uncertainty, advocates say, is contributing to further disruption in the industry as the clean energy sector shifts to avoid further setbacks from the federal government. The result could have serious economic implications, halting the industry’s once rapid job growth, limiting investments in new projects and curtailing the continued development of what clean energy supporters see as a vital part of America’s energy economy.

“Over the last six months, the landscape has really changed dramatically,” said Mike Trahan, executive director of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association, which represents solar companies working in Connecticut. “How do you work your way through all those changes to stay competitive and stay in business?”

A growing industry thrown into chaos

Connecticut isn’t at the top of the list when it comes to its clean energy workforce. The state ranks 27th in the nation, employing roughly 44,000 clean energy workers. That’s around 60% of all energy and motor vehicle jobs in the state, according to E2, a national organization focused on finding common ground between energy advocates and business groups.

Still, the state has benefitted from recent investment in clean energy — largely defined as efforts to harness the power of wind, solar, and renewable energy sources — in the past few years. The Revolution Wind project, as well as various “Solar for All” initiatives, have fueled demand for a workforce skilled in clean energy technology, installation, manufacturing and storage.

In recent months however, that has shifted.

“There’s been more than $22 billion worth of private sector investments in clean energy projects, ranging from offshore wind to electric vehicle production to solar panel factories, that have been canceled in just the past eight months alone,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Unfortunately, it looks like those numbers are going to continue in the wrong direction, which is bad for any of us who depend on electricity or, like, jobs in America.”

Much of the industry has been at least in part affected by new policy changes in Washington. In January, the president issued an executive order calling for a halt to the disbursement of any remaining funds allocated under the Inflation Reduction Act.

In July, passage of the Trump-supported budget reconciliation bill included a phase-out of federal tax credits that incentivized solar and wind. Earlier this month, news reports noted that the administration was also planning to claw back some $7 billion in grant money allocated to the Solar for All initiative, a national program to improve access to solar in low-income and disadvantaged communities.

Those changes, Keefe said, have put the potential economic benefits of solar and wind projects in jeopardy.

“We saw what was truly an economic revolution in the making,” he said. “But now all of that has been put at risk because companies have no more market certainty given this current administration. The tax credits and the policies that they were told were going to be in place for 10 years have suddenly been pulled out from underneath them.”

The shift has sparked concerns that the clean energy sector will contract significantly, impacting jobs and limiting the possibility of future projects. According to a June estimate from the Solar Energy Industries Association, earlier versions of the budget reconciliation bill would put some 330,000 “current and future jobs across the country” at risk. A separate state-by-state analysis from the group found that around 2,900 jobs in Connecticut could be impacted.

“Lost jobs in every single state are a recipe for disaster for American families, businesses, and the U.S. economy,” SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a statement earlier this year.

A ‘psychological challenge’

In interviews this week, clean energy advocates and business experts voiced deep concerns about the Trump administration’s reversal of energy policy, framing the sudden halting of Revolution Wind as particularly alarming. But advocates stopped short of saying that the project’s abrupt pause is a harbinger of future economic difficulties in the industry or larger job issues in the state.

Rather, advocates argued that the changes add to an ongoing sense of uncertainty and instability in the clean energy sector more broadly. That uncertainty, they said, could ultimately prove as damaging as any policy changes, as companies retreat from clean energy projects and investors pull away to avoid issues with the federal government.

“That’s the psychological impact that really discourages people,” said Tony Sheridan, the president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut.

That concern was at the top of mind for Kyle Wallace, the then-vice president of public policy and government affairs of solar developer PosiGen, when he spoke to the Connecticut Mirror last month. “We’re just continuing to see an administration that is just actively hostile to renewables, and we had hoped that they would be more indifferent and not actively hostile,” he said.

Wallace confirmed to CT Mirror this week that he was one of the employees affected by PosiGen’s recent announcement that it was laying off a significant number of its workforce, including 78 workers in Connecticut.

In a WARN notice announcing the layoffs, the company, which has been active in state “Solar for All” initiatives and focuses on providing solar to low-income and disadvantaged households that would be unable to afford it, cited financial difficulties as the main factor behind the layoffs.

“These business circumstances were not reasonably foreseeable and arose in an increasingly challenging economic environment that already has forced several other major companies in the renewables industry to cease or significantly reduce their operations,” John Truschinger, the company’s chief administrative officer, explained in the notice.

PosiGen did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

The PosiGen layoffs have sparked further concerns about the state of the clean energy workforce in Connecticut, with some state lawmakers laying blame squarely at the feet of the federal government.

“President Trump talks a big game about standing up for the working man, but the truth is he’s left 78 Connecticut families without a paycheck,” Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said in a statement this week. “These are blue-collar jobs that built our clean energy future. Now they’re gone because Trump needed the money for tax cuts for billionaires and his corrupt circle.”

Others see the layoffs in a different light. Trahan of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association said he thinks ultimately, PosiGen “did everything right.”

“I don’t think people should be looking at that as indicative of what the industry as a whole is facing,” Trahan said, noting that the organization faces specific funding issues. His organization is currently working with former Connecticut PosiGen employees to help them find work in the state.

Still, after a tumultuous few months, clean energy supporters, industry organizers and business group leaders say that companies will need to remain resilient if they plan to continue operating.

“If you want to be successful or you want to sustain your business, you’ve got to be willing to adapt to change,” Trahan said. “And that’s what they’re doing right now.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 18:03:22.669993

By withdrawing offshore wind leasing areas, canceling $679 million in funding for 12 projects, and rescinding key approvals like the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island, the administration has not only stifled renewable energy growth but also redirected capital toward fossil fuels and nuclear energy [1][4]. This shift has created a “regulatory lottery” for developers, eroded investor confidence, and raised urgent questions about the U.S.’s ability to compete in a global clean energy race [1].

The Immediate Fallout for Renewable Energy

The administration’s actions have triggered a 36% decline in U.S. renewable energy investment in the first half of 2025, with over 17,000 blue-collar jobs in offshore wind at risk [1]. The cancellation of 3.5 million acres of designated offshore wind areas has disrupted supply chains and delayed projects critical to regional grid reliability, particularly in the Northeast [4]. For instance, the Northeast’s reliance on natural gas has increased, undermining climate goals and exposing the region to price volatility [1]. Meanwhile, tariffs on wind components from Mexico, Canada, and China have further exacerbated challenges for onshore wind, potentially reducing annual capacity additions by 9% through 2028 [6].

A Shift Toward Traditional Energy

The administration’s preference for fossil fuels is evident in emergency permits for oil and gas projects and the rollback of methane regulations [3]. While these measures may provide short-term economic gains, they risk locking in high-emission infrastructure at a time when global markets are pivoting toward decarbonization. The termination of funding for offshore wind port infrastructure and the rescission of the Lava Ridge wind project in Idaho signal a broader retreat from long-term renewable energy planning [5]. This creates a paradox: as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentivizes domestic clean energy manufacturing, federal policies are simultaneously undermining the very sectors the IRA aims to bolster [2].

Long-Term Risks and Opportunities

Political uncertainty remains a double-edged sword. While the IRA has driven $115 billion in clean energy manufacturing investment since 2022, potential reversals of its provisions under a new administration could destabilize the sector [2]. For example, the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) and associated executive actions threaten to remove subsidies for solar and wind, reducing tax credits for electric vehicles and batteries [3]. Yet, renewables retain inherent advantages: lower levelized costs, quicker deployment timelines, and bipartisan state-level mandates, such as the 17 jurisdictions with statutory clean energy requirements for utilities [3].

Global Competitiveness and Investor Behavior

The U.S. risks ceding global leadership in clean energy as international investments surge. In 2024, global clean energy investment hit $2.1 trillion, with projections of $3.3 trillion in 2025—far outpacing fossil fuel investments [5]. U.S. policy instability, however, has prompted investors to hedge by redirecting capital to sectors like green hydrogen and energy storage or jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks [1]. This trend is compounded by the Supreme Court’s constrained regulatory environment, which limits the Trump administration’s ability to overhaul renewable policies but also creates uncertainty for future administrations [3].

Conclusion

The Trump administration’s offshore wind cuts underscore the precarious balance between political ideology and market realities. While traditional energy sectors may benefit from short-term gains, the long-term risks—ranging from grid instability to lost global competitiveness—are profound. For investors, the path forward lies in hedging against political volatility by diversifying portfolios across technologies and geographies. Yet, the resilience of state-level policies and the IRA’s foundational role in clean energy manufacturing suggest that renewables will remain a cornerstone of U.S. energy markets, even amid headwinds. The challenge now is to navigate this uncertainty with strategic foresight, ensuring that the U.S. does not fall behind in the race for a sustainable future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 18:03:32.549695

This decision, attributed to broad ""national security"" concerns, has caused significant uncertainty and raised questions about the future of the industry [1]. The affected projects include the nearly completed Revolution Wind farm, valued at $6.2 billion, as well as others in Rhode Island, New York, and Idaho. Despite having received full federal approvals and made substantial progress toward completion, these projects have been abruptly halted without clear justification from the administration [1].

This move has triggered legal and political backlash from state leaders and energy developers, who argue that the action undermines investor confidence and threatens the U.S. clean energy transition. Analysts warn that such political interference in the early stages of project development could have lasting consequences, particularly for attracting capital to the renewable energy sector [1]. Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, emphasized that the decision sends a chilling message: “If you’ve gotten all your permits and spent billions of dollars, and even then they can pull the plug, well, who is going to want to put their money up?” [1].

The cancellation of these projects not only jeopardizes thousands of jobs and billions in clean energy investment but also poses risks to grid reliability in the Northeast, a region heavily reliant on renewable energy to meet its power needs [1]. Offshore wind, in particular, is a key component of the U.S. strategy to reduce carbon emissions and stabilize the power grid. These projects were expected to supply electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes and support domestic manufacturing and union jobs. The sudden reversal highlights the vulnerability of the sector to political shifts and raises concerns about the long-term stability of the U.S. clean energy market [1].

The decision also comes at a time when the broader renewable energy sector is experiencing significant growth. Wind and solar power accounted for more than 40 percent of U.S. electricity output in 2024, up from 28 percent nearly two decades earlier [2]. This growth is driven by declining costs, government incentives, and increasing demand for clean energy, particularly in states like Texas, which leads in both wind and solar production [2]. However, the lack of consistent federal support could hinder further development and strain the industry’s ability to scale up at the necessary pace.

While employment in renewable energy continues to rise, there are challenges in accurately measuring the workforce due to discrepancies in data collection methods. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Department of Energy differ significantly in their assessments of jobs in the sector. The Department of Energy reported 125,000 jobs in the wind industry in 2022, compared to only 8,000 by the BLS, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and standardized data [2]. As the demand for electricity is projected to increase in the coming years, driven by AI, data centers, and electrification, ensuring an adequately trained labor force will be critical to supporting the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure [2].

Overall, corn growers got lucky this year with late-season weather that contributed to what is now predicted to be a record bumper crop.
“We tend to see pollination issues being more problematic when we have high temperatures and drought conditions or lack of rainfall,” Licht said.
Yet Iowa had plenty of rain and still saw some pollination issues.
Walton said he can manage as long as the pollination issues don’t get too bad.","PAW PAW, Mich. (AP) — Robb Rynd and his brother grew up farming and wanted to do more of it outside their day jobs, so they went in together on what’s now a little over 200 acres of corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum. Last year was a good year, and Rynd said he enjoyed walking the fields with his kids to see how the corn was doing.

This year is a different story.

All summer he’s been scouting for brown and wilting leaves or ears of corn with kernels missing, and now it’s becoming clear that every kernel will count this harvest. “It’s almost kind of depressing to go out there and look at it and say, ‘oh yep, it does look bad,’” he said.

Across major corn-growing states, climate change is fueling conditions that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers. Factors like consistently high summer overnight temperatures, droughts and heavier-than-usual rains at the wrong time can all disrupt the plants’ pollination — making each full ear of corn less of a guarantee and more of a gamble.

Overall, corn growers got lucky this year with late-season weather that contributed to what is now predicted to be a record bumper crop. But experts say bouts of extreme weather are intensifying the waiting game during a critical time of year between planting and harvest.

Human-caused climate change has worsened multiple U.S. extreme heat events this year and has steadily increased the likelihood of hotter overnight temperatures since 1970, according to Climate Central, an independent group of scientists who communicate climate science and data to the public.

”The hot nights too, like the corn’s never getting a break. It’s just hot all the time,” Rynd said. “I know it’s wearing on me.”

How excessive heat and rainfall can impact corn pollination

As a corn plant grows, the leaves unroll to reveal the tassel, the part that sheds pollen, explained Mark Licht, an associate professor of agronomy and an extension cropping systems specialist at Iowa State University. If the plant grows too fast, which can happen when it’s consistently very hot, the tassel may be wrapped too tightly by the leaf, meaning less pollen gets released.

That can lead to patchy ears of corn. Tight tassel wrap was reported in pockets across parts of the Midwest and the Plains, according to some agricultural trade publication reports during the growing season. Licht said he’d only seen tassel wrapping issues once before in his 20 years as an agronomist.

High temperatures can stress corn in other ways, lowering pollen production, reducing pollen’s viability or drying out other parts of the plants, reducing fertility. “I think any of the pollination issues that we might be having are more because the nights have been so exceedingly warm,” said Larry Walton, who farms near Rynd in southwestern Michigan, where many farmers irrigate because it’s a drier area.

“We tend to see pollination issues being more problematic when we have high temperatures and drought conditions or lack of rainfall,” Licht said. Yet Iowa had plenty of rain and still saw some pollination issues. Excessive moisture can cause corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on the ears.

He said farmers are having to pay more attention to this because “there’s just more variable weather.”

Overall ‘monster’ yield expected despite tricky weather conditions

This winter, the U.S. drought monitor reported drought in nearly 60% of corn production areas in the Midwest. But near or above normal rainfall nearly everywhere east of the Rockies this summer brought that down to just 3% as of the beginning of August, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

That, combined with consistent heat, means that “we are expecting a monster U.S. corn crop in 2025,” Rippey said.

But it wasn’t easy for everyone. “This has probably been one of the most difficult growing seasons that I’ve experienced in my career,” said Philip Good, a farmer in Macon, Mississippi and chair of the United Soybean Board. He planted his corn and soybeans 60 days behind schedule because it rained nearly every day for two months.

They lost some fertilizer and some plants died in standing water, Good said, but they made up for it with some lucky weather later in the season.

“The rain does fall in heavier bursts,” Rippey said. He said that can be an issue for farmers because even when it doesn’t cause flash floods, the moisture doesn’t necessarily percolate into the soil. It runs off and carries fertilizer with it, which is a problem for rivers’ health and farmers’ pocketbooks.

The trend toward higher humidity levels and warmer ocean temperatures, contributing to hotter nights, could be a bigger issue going forward, putting stress on crops like corn and soybeans, Rippey added.

Climate variability adds stress to a critical time for farmers

Late summer is a make-or-break time for farmers: They’re trying to gauge how much they’ll make from the year’s crop and planning their next steps, and patchy pollination doesn’t help.

“We’d like to upgrade a tractor … or we’d maybe try to pick up some more ground,” Rynd said. “It’s hard to want to go do those things when you have a bad year like this.”

When the uncertain pollination is at its worst, if 15% to 25% of every ear of corn doesn’t have kernels, that could mean a significant yield loss over a large field, said Nicolle Ritchie, a Michigan State University extension agent who helps Walton and Rynd survey their crops.

Jason Cope co-founded a farm tech company called PowerPollen whose equipment can mechanically collect pollen and then pollinate future crops. He said that due to extreme weather events, the number of “rescue” pollination jobs they’ve done for customers — to save fields that didn’t naturally pollinate very well — has nearly doubled since they started in 2018.

Walton said he can manage as long as the pollination issues don’t get too bad.

“You learn to roll with the stress part of it because most of that you can’t control anyway,” he added.

The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory. By focusing on hybrids with premium touches, Toyota continues to exploit an efficiency gap while rivals rush into full battery electric territory.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you are an industry professional, this story underlines where Toyota is putting its real money. For consumers, it clarifies what is available now, the Crown sedan and Signia SUV, and what will be available soon, namely, Toyota’s first U.S.-built EVs. Enthusiasts and speculators, however, will want to lean into the second half of this story: the rumors Toyota is not confirming.

And Now for the Speculation: Toyota is not confirming.

This is where things get interesting. Industry chatter often fills the vacuum left by Toyota’s conservative announcements. Some speculation is logical, some fanciful, and all of it has been downplayed by Toyota spokesperson Nathan Kokes, who has emphasized that only announcements made by Toyota should be considered fact. Kokes went on to tell us, “To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana”.

Kokes went on to say, “As previously announced, Toyota plans to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Toyota will now assemble both vehicles at Toyota Kentucky.” And “Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume”. Finally, Kokes gave some insight into Toyota’s commitment to its workforce by saying, “We remain committed to providing long-term job stability for our team members.”

But the speculation from some persists. One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV. Outlets often label it the “bZ5X,” following Toyota’s bZ (beyond zero) naming convention. Others expect a Lexus version called the “TZ.” Toyota has never confirmed these names, and official channels continue to describe the projects simply as future three-row battery electric SUVs.

The Crown line is another hotbed of rumor. In Japan, the Crown family includes sedan, crossover, sport, and estate body styles. Some observers expect Toyota to expand the U.S. Crown line beyond the sedan and Signia SUV, potentially with a larger three-row premium vehicle or a sportier fastback. At this time, Toyota has not confirmed such plans, but marketing material in the U.S. clearly positions Crown as a “family” of models, hinting at long-term potential.

Trucks and off-roaders draw even more speculation. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed the EPU concept, a compact electric pickup with a footprint similar to a Ford Maverick. Many expect this to morph into a U.S. product, but Toyota has never confirmed American production. Similarly, Toyota showed the Compact Cruiser EV, a boxy small SUV in the vein of an FJ or Bronco Sport rival. Rumors continue that Toyota could launch a rugged EV or hybrid under the Land Cruiser or FJ nameplates, but again, no confirmation exists. The only rugged revival officially on the books is the Land Cruiser hybrid, which is already in American showrooms.

There are even whispers of a new sub-brand dedicated to electrification. Commentators suggest Toyota could spin off its EVs into a distinct nameplate, following the path of Lexus in the 1980s or Prius in the 2000s. Toyota has never acknowledged this idea, and so far, the closest evidence is the consistent branding of “bZ” on its vehicles.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term view is two-sided. On the one hand, the confirmed investments are enormous and concrete. North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana will become the core of Toyota’s American electrification strategy, and the Crown family already plants Toyota’s premium flag between Toyota and Lexus. On the other hand, the speculation illustrates the appetite for Toyota to do more: a compact truck to take on Ford, a rugged EV to challenge Bronco, or a broader Crown brand to pull buyers away from Acura and Infiniti. For now, those remain rumors, and Toyota has made it clear that only official announcements are the truth.",https://www.wric.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/74/2025/08/Tacoma_Overlanding_Concept_Action_SEMA_2021_Hi-Res_15-600x400-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 19:07:19.618037

“This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.

“Surrendering the future to China by dragging America back to dirty, climate-wrecking fossil fuel dependency while most of the world is moving on to safer, cleaner, and cheaper clean energy, is reckless, corrupt, and profoundly against our national interests.

“Democrats are fighting for jobs, affordable power, and a clean energy future. Trump is fighting for corrupt oil executives who bankrolled his campaign, and that damage is going to be felt for generations.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy withdrew or terminated a total of $679 million in funding for 12 doomed offshore wind projects across America. This action will ensure federal dollars are prioritized towards restoring America’s maritime dominance and preventing waste.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy. “Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry. Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

The Trump Administration has refocused the Department of Transportation (USDOT) and its Maritime Administration (MARAD) on rebuilding America’s shipbuilding capacity, unleashing more reliable, traditional forms of energy, and utilizing the nation’s bountiful natural resources to unleash American energy.

Where possible, funding from these projects will be recompeted to address critical port upgrades and other core infrastructure needs of the United States.

Additional Information:

As part of the Department of Transportation’s review of all discretionary grant programs with obligated and unobligated projects, USDOT identified 12 offshore wind grants and project selections that were not aligned with the goals and priorities of the administration.

USDOT has withdrawn one project in the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects (INFRA) program, resulting in a total retraction of roughly $427 million. MARAD has withdrawn six projects and terminated five within its Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP), resulting in a total retraction of $177 million and roughly $75 million, respectively.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

However, the special session got off to a rocky start: The state Senate met as scheduled at 9 a.m., but the state House failed to reach the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, leaving the session in limbo as of late Friday afternoon.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are at risk, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting funding restrictions to allow the transportation department to spend more money on maintenance operations, including by redirecting dollars earmarked for public transit and efforts to combat climate change toward such operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://fox59.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/08/68b2595da093b6.15644520.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 23:01:43.390006

Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the authority to pass a penalty, not a requirement to do so.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“A margin cap and penalty would be a misguided policy that fails to address the root causes of California’s elevated gas prices – high costs, expensive regulations, supply constraints, and the reality that gasoline is, and will remain, a critical driver of our state’s economy,” spokesperson Jim Stanley said in a statement earlier this month.

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission hasn’t imposed a single penalty two years after Newsom gave them the authority to do so, nor has it determined what counts as an excessive profit.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting towards more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/preview-2163.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 18:06:46.901257

Launched in 2024, the company aims to localize production in strategic sectors, including semiconductors, smart devices, advanced industrials, and next-generation infrastructure, targeting an addition of roughly $9.3 billion to Saudi Arabia’s non-oil gross domestic product by 2030.

Khaled Ramadan, an economist and head of the International Center for Strategic Studies in Cairo, told Arab News that Alat will have “a highly positive impact on industrial diversification in Saudi Arabia and the realization of Vision 2030.”

It could boost local content, create 39,000 direct jobs by 2030, reduce reliance on oil, and cut imports of electronics and smart devices. He added that achieving these goals will require sustained investment in infrastructure, R&D, and workforce development.

Partnership moves

Alat has quickly moved from strategy to execution. Within weeks of its launch, it signed a joint venture with Japan’s SoftBank Group to produce industrial robots locally, with production slated for 2025.

CEO Amit Midha described the deal as “a gamechanger for manufacturing around the world,” forecasting that the initial setup could add $1 billion to Saudi GDP by next year.

Alat is also partnering with Lenovo to build an advanced electronics plant producing laptops, desktops, servers, and smart devices with 70–80 percent automation.

A €160 million ($187 million) joint venture with global elevator leader TK Elevator will establish Saudi Arabia’s first foreign-owned elevator and escalator manufacturing operation, backed by a product-development center and training facility.

These partnerships reflect a wider national push to diversify the economy, strengthen industrial capacity, and attract foreign investment.

Neha Singh, co-founder of India-based market intelligence platform Tracxn, said Alat’s international partnerships would position Saudi Arabia as a regional manufacturing hub and attract foreign investment. “Alat is set to play a key role in advancing Vision 2030’s industrial ambitions by supporting the shift from an oil-reliant economy to one fueled by innovation,” she said.

Furthering its manufacturing ambitions, Alat, through its strategic investment Sapphire, partnered with the Special Integrated Logistics Zone Co. to establish a state-of-the-art light manufacturing facility at Riyadh Integrated, the Kingdom’s inaugural Special Integrated Logistics Free Zone.

The 40,000-sq.-meter facility, scheduled for completion in 2025, will focus on producing enabling technologies for automation in advanced industrial applications.

• Alat has quickly moved from strategy to execution. Within weeks of its launch, it signed a joint venture with Japan’s SoftBank Group to produce industrial robots locally, with production slated for 2025.

• The company is partnering with Lenovo to build an advanced electronics plant producing laptops, desktops, servers, and smart devices with 70–80 percent automation.

• Beyond robotics, electronics, and semiconductors, the company has identified nine priority sectors, including smart health, AI infrastructure, and electrification.

Abhishek Goyal, co-founder of Tracxn, noted that partnerships with global companies attract foreign investment, bring new technologies into strategic sectors, and benefit from PIF’s network and credibility.

“PIF’s association with the company not only provides financial backing but also lends Alat institutional credibility and international visibility, positioning it as an attractive partner for global collaborations,” he said.

Alat recently became the first company in Saudi Arabia— and among the first globally— to implement specific International Organization for Standardization indicators relating to organizational governance, and ensure measurable, sustainable outcomes. The certifications, awarded following audits by BSI Group and TUV Rheinland, validate Alat’s governance framework and its commitment to continuous improvement.

Sustainable manufacturing

Beyond robotics, electronics, and semiconductors, Alat has identified nine priority sectors, including smart health, AI infrastructure, and electrification. The company has pledged $100 billion in investments by 2030 to support the global energy transition and create tens of thousands of skilled jobs.

“Alat’s strong focus on sustainable technologies to steer the economy toward renewable energy through grid connection of clean energy sources like solar and wind power, building smart and energy-efficient infrastructure in both residential and commercial domains, and decarbonization of key industrial sectors strongly aligns with Saudi Arabia’s sustainable development goals,” Singh said.

Semiconductors, a cornerstone of modern technology, are a key focus for Alat. The global semiconductor market has become a strategic asset for countries aiming to secure technological sovereignty, and Saudi Arabia is looking to capitalize on this trend by localizing production and developing a domestic supply chain.

Analysts say the move could reduce dependence on imports from the US, China, and other leading producers while positioning the Kingdom as a player in high-value, technology-driven industries. Experts caution that entering technology-intensive sectors requires long R&D cycles, advanced infrastructure, and skilled labor.

“Global collaborations and technology transfers will enable Alat to significantly reduce time to market for their products and build offerings that align with international standards, giving them a significant advantage in promoting exports in key industrial sectors,” she said.

“Additionally, international partnerships will provide Saudi engineers and professionals with exposure to global experts, which will benefit local talent development and boost domestic production capabilities.”

Ramadan emphasized that Alat’s success will depend on sustainable partnerships and robust technical infrastructure, representing a qualitative shift away from the Kingdom’s traditional oil- and petrochemical-based industries.

Alat is expected to play a key role in Saudi Arabia’s push toward high-tech, clean-energy manufacturing. Its focus on robotics, semiconductors, advanced electronics, and light manufacturing is supported by international partnerships, governance frameworks, and sustainability initiatives aligned with Vision 2030. Backed by PIF and strategic collaborations, the company is expected to contribute to industrial diversification, job creation, and technological development, while gradually positioning the Kingdom as a competitive player in regional manufacturing.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s non-oil exports, including re-exports, reached SR27.45 billion ($7.31 billion) in June, marking an annual rise of 22.1 percent, official data showed.

Preliminary figures released by the General Authority for Statistics showed that the UAE remained the top destination for the Kingdom’s non-oil products, with exports to the Emirates amounting to SR7.85 billion in the sixth month of the year.

India was the second-largest non-oil trade partner, importing goods worth SR2.6 billion, followed by China at SR2.14 billion, Turkiye at SR946.2 million, and Egypt at SR871.2 million.

The rise in non-oil exports supports the goals of Vision 2030, which aims to diversify Saudi economy and reduce its reliance on oil revenues.

In its latest report, GASTAT stated: “Non-oil exports, including re-exports, recorded an increase of 22.1 percent compared to June 2024, while national non-oil exports, excluding re-exports, increased by 8.4 percent.”

It added: “The value of re-exported goods increased by 60.2 percent during the same period.”

In a separate release, GASTAT noted that Saudi non-oil exports jumped 17.8 percent in the second quarter of 2025, offsetting weaker oil sales and highlighting the Kingdom’s accelerating diversification drive, official data showed.

Machinery, electrical equipment, and parts came in second, accounting for 23.3 percent of total non-oil exports and growing 168 percent year on year. The strength of Saudi non-oil private sector was further affirmed by Riyad Bank’s Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by S&P Global, which showed that the Kingdom’s headline PMI rose to 57.2 in June, up from 55.8 in May. This reading indicates a strong improvement in business conditions, exceeding the long-run average of 56.9.

A PMI score above 50 signals expansion, while a figure below that mark indicates contraction. Saudi Arabia’s June PMI also outpaced that of its regional peers, with the UAE and Kuwait recording 53.5 and 53.1, respectively.

Merchandise exports

According to GASTAT, the Kingdom’s total merchandise exports in June increased by 3.7 percent year on year, although there was a 2.5 percent decrease in oil exports. Consequently, the percentage of oil exports out of total exports decreased from 74.7 percent in June 2024 to 70.2 percent a year later.

China was the top destination for Saudi Arabia’s overall merchandise exports, with shipments valued at SR14.32 billion. The UAE followed at SR8.4 billion — a 43.5 percent jump compared to the previous year — while exports to India reached SR8.33 billion. South Korea and Japan imported SR8.22 billion and SR6.65 billion worth of goods, respectively, while Egypt accounted for SR4.48 billion.

Imports climb

Saudi imports in June reached SR70.03 billion, up 1.7 percent year on year, GASTAT reported.

Machinery, mechanical and electrical equipment topped the import list at SR21.42 billion, followed by transport equipment at SR8.75 billion and chemical products at SR6.38 billion.

Base metal imports stood at SR5.68 billion, while mineral products totaled SR3.95 billion.

By region, Asia remained the Kingdom’s largest trade partner, contributing SR39.68 billion in imports — a 9.2 percent rise from a year ago.

Imports from Europe and the Americas amounted to SR18.6 billion and SR8.23 billion, respectively. Africa supplied SR2.79 billion worth of goods, while imports from Oceania totaled SR719.7 million.

China led all countries as the top source of imports, with SR19.54 billion worth of shipments in June, a 27.7 percent year-on-year increase. The US followed with SR5.79 billion, ahead of the UAE at SR4.31 billion, India at SR3.19 billion, and Germany at SR2.94 billion. Sea routes were the dominant entry channel for imports, accounting for SR41.47 billion — a 4.3 percent decrease year on year. Air and land routes handled SR21.2 billion and SR7.35 billion worth of inbound goods, respectively.

King Abdulaziz Sea Port in Dammam led all seaports with SR17.7 billion in imports, followed by Jeddah Islamic Sea Port at SR16.18 billion and Ras Tanura Port at SR1.28 billion.

Among land entry points, Al-Batha Port managed SR3.07 billion worth of goods, while Riyadh Dry Port and King Fahad Bridge processed SR2.14 billion and SR691.7 million, respectively.

A mixed picture

While non-oil exports strengthened, Saudi Arabia’s overall trade performance showed mixed signals across the second quarter of the year.

During this period, a 15.8 percent drop in oil exports dragged total merchandise exports down by 7.3 percent year on year. Combined with a 13.1 percent rise in imports, this pushed the merchandise trade balance surplus down by 56.2 percent compared to the same period in 2024. Oil’s share of the Kingdom’s total exports slipped from 74.7 percent to 67.9 percent in the quarter, reflecting a gradual rebalancing of the

export basket.

JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia captured 20 percent of the Middle East and North Africa’s gaming revenues in 2024, generating $1.2 billion, as the Kingdom leverages its Vision 2030 strategy to transform the industry into a major economic sector.

With over 2.85 billion players across the world and an audience exceeding 640 million as of last year, the games and esports industry has emerged as the fastest-growing sector in entertainment, according to Savvy Games’ 2024 report, which added that the sector is projected to see growth from 2023 to 2028 that will surpass that of film, live sports, and music and radio.

Three years ago, Saudi Arabia launched a national strategy for gaming and esports, making the sector one of 13 strategic priority industries under Vision 2030. The initiative aims to create 39,000 new jobs and contribute $13.3 billion to gross domestic product by the end of the decade.

Under the chairmanship of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Savvy Games forms a key pillar of Saudi Arabia’s strategy to position itself as the leading global hub for gaming and esports by 2030.

“In 2024, the sector was projected to generate over $187 billion, representing over 2.1 percent year-on-year growth, illustrating its scale and adaptability. The sector’s universal appeal and rapid evolution have positioned it as the leading driver of innovation and audience engagement across the entertainment landscape,” the report added.

According to Mordor Intelligence, the global gaming market is projected to reach $269.06 billion in 2025 and $435.44 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 10.37 percent.

Mordor noted that rapid mobile adoption, the spread of 5G, and cloud streaming are drawing new participants into every part of the value chain, accelerating revenue diversification and platform convergence.

Data in the Savvy report showed that Saudi Arabia’s gaming market generated approximately $1.19 billion in revenue in 2024, with projections to reach $1.64 billion by 2028, representing a CAGR of 8.2 percent.

“This growth is being driven by strong performance across all game segments, with 2023-28 CAGRs estimated to be 8.27 percent for console, 7.29 percent for mobile, and 4.01 percent for PC,” the report added.

The broader MENA region is also set to show significant growth, with video games revenue expected to see a CAGR of 7.3 percent from 2024 to 2027, reaching $5.62 billion in 2024 and $6.94 billion by 2027.

The report noted that Saudi Arabia is spearheading this growth, leading the MENA region with the highest gaming revenue — $1.19 billion in 2024 — and a gamer base exceeding 25.81 million.

“Central to this growth is the National Gaming and Esports Strategy, aligned with Saudi Vision 2030. The NGES aims to harness the creativity and energy of the Saudi population to propel the sector forward,” the report said.

Savvy Games, established by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, has been instrumental in this growth.

Its subsidiary, Scopely, ranked second globally among gaming companies, with its hit Monopoly Go! generating $3 billion in revenue and earning the “Game of the Year” title at Pocket Gamer Mobile Games Awards 2024.

Scopely’s total revenues have reached $10 billion since its founding in 2011, supported by expanding titles like Stumble Guys onto platforms such as Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

Other Saudi-owned subsidiaries include ESL FACEIT Group, Steer Studio, Embracer Group, with 8.1 percent stake, Hero Esports, 30 percent stake, and G1riffin, highlighting the Kingdom’s growing footprint in global gaming and esports.

Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Games, described 2024 as “another hugely successful year,” adding: “When it comes to progress against our strategy, there has been one core theme that has run throughout all our operations: impact.”

He said that this has been evident across all our strategic pillars — game development and publishing, esports, and the KSA ecosystem — with teams in Saudi Arabia and worldwide consistently delivering outstanding products, experiences, and opportunities for the global gaming community.

Riyadh hosted the inaugural Esports World Cup from July 3 to Aug. 25, 2024 featuring 1,500 athletes competing in 23 tournaments across 22 games. With a prize pool of over $60 million, the event highlighted Saudi Arabia’s push to become a top global esports destination.

RIYADH: Egypt recorded its highest level of dollar resources in its history in July, amounting to approximately $8.5 billion, reflecting the improved performance of the country’s economic indicators.

Speaking at a press conference, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly explained that these resources, excluding hot money, were generated across various state sectors, with remittances from Egyptians abroad seeing a historic surge, highlighting the strong confidence and trust citizens have in the national economy, according to a statement.

He also confirmed that the government is finalizing a comprehensive roadmap outlining Egypt’s development and economic strategy through 2030, marking the country’s transition into the post-International Monetary Fund phase.

The developments come after US-based credit rating agency Fitch affirmed Egypt’s long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating at “B” with a stable outlook in April.

The rating was supported by the country’s relatively large economy, fairly high potential gross domestic product growth, and strong support from bilateral as well as multilateral partners.

Speaking to journalists, Madbouly said: “Let me remind you that when we were experiencing problems and instability in the exchange rate, remittances from Egyptians abroad were at their lowest levels. Today, when remittances from Egyptians abroad reach more than $3.6 billion per month, this figure reflects the confidence of Egyptians abroad in the stability and strength of the Egyptian economy.”

He added: “Consequently, our total resources, whether from exports, tourism, industry, and all services, in addition to remittances from Egyptians abroad, have reached $8.5 billion. This is the highest rate of dollar resources we have recorded in Egypt’s history in a single month.”

The prime minister went on to note that Egypt’s foreign exchange reserves have risen to $49 billion, while the annual inflation rate declined to 13.1 percent from 14.4 percent the previous month, signaling a notable enhancement in the country’s economic performance.

“The trade deficit in goods has also decreased by 25 percent, recording only $11 billion in the five-month period from January to May. This is a very significant figure, achieved not through reduced imports, but through increased Egyptian exports. This is all an improvement in the economy’s performance.”

He added: “As experts always say, rely on sustainable resources, which include increased exports, manufacturing rates, and increased remittances from Egyptians abroad.”

The prime minister also highlighted that while Suez Canal revenues have been impacted by exceptional geopolitical conditions, all other sectors generating sustainable resources are witnessing strong, unprecedented growth.

“Most importantly, we have a vision for the next five years, beginning in September. This vision will be presented for community dialogue and discussions with all experts and specialists, so that it can be completed before the end of 2025,” Madbouly said.

Post-IMF plan

The prime minister stated that the government’s full post-IMF plan will be presented to the Cabinet next week, with its key themes and goals to be unveiled at a press conference in early September as a draft of the national vision.

The draft will then be opened for a two-month public dialogue to gather feedback and engage stakeholders in discussions, with the document to be fully completed before the end of this year.

He emphasized that this vision is firmly rooted in Egypt Vision 2030, the outcomes of the National Dialogue, and a wide range of expert insights and sectoral proposals.

It also draws on existing operational strategies for key drivers of the Egyptian economy, including industry, tourism, agriculture, Information and Communications Technology, and various service sectors.

Madbouly also underlined that the vision is grounded in economic goals for the upcoming period and importantly includes multiple quantitative targets and specific figures aimed for achievement within the next five years.

His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.
In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California.
The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.
Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the authority to pass a penalty, not a requirement to do so.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“A margin cap and penalty would be a misguided policy that fails to address the root causes of California’s elevated gas prices – high costs, expensive regulations, supply constraints, and the reality that gasoline is, and will remain, a critical driver of our state’s economy,” spokesperson Jim Stanley said in a statement earlier this month.

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission hasn’t imposed a single penalty two years after Newsom gave them the authority to do so, nor has it determined what counts as an excessive profit.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting towards more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/preview-2181.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 17:05:05.883991

In 2023, U.S. Mercedes sales dipped about 1.6% from 2022 figures, selling roughly 282,229 cars from its dealers in the states.
""Last year was about profitability; this year is about sales growth,"" a Mercedes executive said at the meeting, according to one of the dealers.
Mercedes' electric experiment did not fare well for its dealers.
""I don't think the space for Mercedes is there,"" a Mercedes dealer told AN.","For dealers selling Mercedes-Benz (DDAIF) cars and SUVs, a new shift in stateside sales strategy seems like a godsend, but is also a dire reflection on EV adoption.

According to a report by Automotive News, the three-pointed star announced at a recent dealer meeting in Las Vegas that the brand is shifting its sales strategy from selling high-margin vehicles such as the AMG performance models, the boxy G-Class SUV, the S-Class sedan and EQ electric line to more mass-market models.

At the meeting, Mercedes announced plans to deliver 25 new and updated models to its dealerships this year — with the most anticipated being a new E-Class, a new CLE coupe and convertible, as well as a plug-in hybrid version of the GLC crossover SUV.

The brand is attempting to shift from its widely-criticized EV push, as demand for electric cars in the U.S. has dwindled — which previously had dealers up in furor.

One dealer who attended the Las Vegas event told Automotive News that he welcomed the new strategy because the stockpiles of unsold high-ticket cars were costing them too much sitting unsold.

""The carrying expense is choking me,"" the dealer told AN. ""I'd rather have entry-level vehicles with a turn rate of less than 30 days that I can make a small profit on than carry $100,000 [electric] vehicles for half a year and lose money on.""

The three-pointed star told dealers at the meeting that it expects a double-digit percentage of U.S. vehicle sales to north of 300,000 vehicles. In 2023, U.S. Mercedes sales dipped about 1.6% from 2022 figures, selling roughly 282,229 cars from its dealers in the states.

""Last year was about profitability; this year is about sales growth,"" a Mercedes executive said at the meeting, according to one of the dealers.

Mercedes-Benz USA sales and product management VP Senol Bayrak said that the brand expects the midsize E-Class and compact C-Class sedans, as well as its GLE and GLC crossovers to carry much of the bulk of the sales. Additionally, Bayrak noted that the brand will focus more on a mixed powertrain strategy to offer more choices for its customers.

""We're very happy to bring into the market what is needed, which is the right balance of ICE products, electric products and now also adding PHEV into the mix,"" he said.

Mercedes' electric experiment did not fare well for its dealers. Edmunds data last October showed that Mercedes branded electric vehicles sat on dealer lots for an average of 82 days - a long time compared to the luxury segment's average of 57 days.

One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV.","(TestMiles) – Toyota is investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and EVs, but rumors continue to swirl about even bolder future products. Separating fact from speculation matters for both buyers and industry insiders.

Why does this matter right now?

Toyota is not dabbling in electrification; it is betting billions. Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is scheduled to open soon with fourteen lines for hybrid and battery output. The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory. By focusing on hybrids with premium touches, Toyota continues to exploit an efficiency gap while rivals rush into full battery electric territory.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you are an industry professional, this story underlines where Toyota is putting its real money. For consumers, it clarifies what is available now, the Crown sedan and Signia SUV, and what will be available soon, namely, Toyota’s first U.S.-built EVs. Enthusiasts and speculators, however, will want to lean into the second half of this story: the rumors Toyota is not confirming.

And Now for the Speculation: Toyota is not confirming.

This is where things get interesting. Industry chatter often fills the vacuum left by Toyota’s conservative announcements. Some speculation is logical, some fanciful, and all of it has been downplayed by Toyota spokesperson Nathan Kokes, who has emphasized that only announcements made by Toyota should be considered fact. Kokes went on to tell us, “To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana”.

Kokes went on to say, “As previously announced, Toyota plans to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Toyota will now assemble both vehicles at Toyota Kentucky.” And “Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume”. Finally, Kokes gave some insight into Toyota’s commitment to its workforce by saying, “We remain committed to providing long-term job stability for our team members.”

But the speculation from some persists. One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV. Outlets often label it the “bZ5X,” following Toyota’s bZ (beyond zero) naming convention. Others expect a Lexus version called the “TZ.” Toyota has never confirmed these names, and official channels continue to describe the projects simply as future three-row battery electric SUVs.

The Crown line is another hotbed of rumor. In Japan, the Crown family includes sedan, crossover, sport, and estate body styles. Some observers expect Toyota to expand the U.S. Crown line beyond the sedan and Signia SUV, potentially with a larger three-row premium vehicle or a sportier fastback. At this time, Toyota has not confirmed such plans, but marketing material in the U.S. clearly positions Crown as a “family” of models, hinting at long-term potential.

Trucks and off-roaders draw even more speculation. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed the EPU concept, a compact electric pickup with a footprint similar to a Ford Maverick. Many expect this to morph into a U.S. product, but Toyota has never confirmed American production. Similarly, Toyota showed the Compact Cruiser EV, a boxy small SUV in the vein of an FJ or Bronco Sport rival. Rumors continue that Toyota could launch a rugged EV or hybrid under the Land Cruiser or FJ nameplates, but again, no confirmation exists. The only rugged revival officially on the books is the Land Cruiser hybrid, which is already in American showrooms.

There are even whispers of a new sub-brand dedicated to electrification. Commentators suggest Toyota could spin off its EVs into a distinct nameplate, following the path of Lexus in the 1980s or Prius in the 2000s. Toyota has never acknowledged this idea, and so far, the closest evidence is the consistent branding of “bZ” on its vehicles.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term view is two-sided. On the one hand, the confirmed investments are enormous and concrete. North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana will become the core of Toyota’s American electrification strategy, and the Crown family already plants Toyota’s premium flag between Toyota and Lexus. On the other hand, the speculation illustrates the appetite for Toyota to do more: a compact truck to take on Ford, a rugged EV to challenge Bronco, or a broader Crown brand to pull buyers away from Acura and Infiniti. For now, those remain rumors, and Toyota has made it clear that only official announcements are the truth.",https://kfor.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/Tacoma_Overlanding_Concept_Action_SEMA_2021_Hi-Res_15-600x400-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 19:03:52.337210

It does not include a road usage charge.
In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections.
Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon's transportation woes

Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle's telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state's decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting restrictions on how the transportation department can spend money on maintenance operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state's total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii's program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon's transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon's voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they're more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don't realize that ""both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/arzIwx4Fle7DGpInw1tKpQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/c7316200fcc787c796149482406a2e8f,N,,2025-08-29 19:06:19.837926

One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV.","(TestMiles) – Toyota is investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and EVs, but rumors continue to swirl about even bolder future products. Separating fact from speculation matters for both buyers and industry insiders.

Why does this matter right now?

Toyota is not dabbling in electrification; it is betting billions. Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is scheduled to open soon with fourteen lines for hybrid and battery output. The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory.

Buyers of the Ford Puma Gen-E and the Ford e-Tourneo Courier, alongside four other electric models, are now eligible for the maximum grant available.

This move is part of a broader £650m government initiative designed to reduce the cost of electric vehicle (EV) ownership and support the transition to a more sustainable mode of transport.

The scheme is also expected to provide a significant uplift to the UK automotive industry, improving economic growth and supporting jobs and skills.

The Ford models are at the forefront of the scheme, being the first to offer the full savings potential. In total, there are now 28 EVs that qualify for the ECG, with grants of £1,500 or £3,750.

The government’s investment in the EV sector surpasses £4.5bn, underlining its focus on fostering the adoption of EVs by both businesses and private consumers.

The demand to create energy-efficient buildings that use clean fuel sources isn’t going away, even as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act strips funding for retrofits and solar panels, green building experts said last month at Bisnow’s National Sustainability and Energy Conference.

But with fewer incentives, everyone from investors to developers and consultants in the space has to think about how to cover the new gaps in their financing.

“Our aggression on being more green is going to depend on being able to get like-minded capital, philanthropic capital, municipal financings,” Gizman Abbas, principal of Direct Invest Development, said at the event, held at Convene 360 in Manhattan.

The OBBBA, signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, significantly undercuts provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act that were intended to accelerate the green economy in the U.S. Among the changes are requirements that existing solar or wind projects set to get a tax credit must begin construction by July 4, 2026.

The reduced incentives, which had more uptake in red states than blue, have already killed one project that Abbas was working on in Georgia, he said.

For that development, Direct Invest Development had expected to receive funding from the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program — a billion-dollar incentive designed to make retrofitting affordable housing more affordable. Abbas believes the financing would have allowed the developer to build “some of the greenest buildings the state of Georgia has ever seen.”

That is no longer possible, he said, although he added that the development doesn’t intend to reduce its sustainability components to zero.

Federal legislation isn't the only factor changing the number of financing options that developers have.

Bisnow/Ciara Long

Weeks before Trump’s inauguration, the six biggest banks in the U.S. left the Net Zero Banking Alliance, a United Nations-sponsored group for global banking to set sustainability targets.

Some analysts attributed the mass exits to changes in the political climate, although others pointed to a consensus that rising energy demand means humans may need to tap all available energy sources, including fossil fuels.

Participating in the alliance had put pressure on banks to demonstrate carbon emissions reductions tied to the dollars they deploy, said Nadine Anderson, vice president of acquisitions at investment firm Galvanize Climate Solutions.

Now, there’s less pressure to do so, and less capital available.

“Unfortunately, most of the banks, they were offering that without any sort of competitive spread or competitive terms, so I don't think it really came to fruition,” she said. “Then a lot of that just kind of dried up over the last six months.”

Investors that have put money into a broader range of sustainable energies might be able to switch focus, said Yoni Tammam, a vice president of tax insurance for insurance broker CAC Specialty.

“Those that had a, call it, dual focus of solar and battery may be looking more towards batteries now, because obviously that was less scathed in the new bill, the new Act, than solar and wind,” he said.

But without the tax credit to subsidize costs, an untold number of planned solar panels may disappear from developments across the country, from single-family homes to data centers. Added to the other costs that developers and eventual tenants may face, investors and builders have been left with a gap to fill.

“The economics that you're seeing in solar and batteries, the increasing cost of utilities — that exists now,” Anderson said. “So while there is a changing framework of rollbacks of some of the incentives, the economics are still there, and it's really a supply and demand issue.”

Another way to fill the gap is to cater to the green energy wishes that tenants often have, Abbas said. After conducting market research on renters in some of its existing buildings, Direct Investment Development found that renters remain excited about living in sustainable buildings.

“They really want purified air in their buildings, purified water in their buildings, their carbon footprints managed,” he said. “So when you're targeting those types of potential renters, every percentage extra that you get on your rent helps you on your financing. And so that's really what we're leaning towards.”

But the industry’s clearest next step is a tried-and-true method that has served it well over the decades, developers said: Lobbying.

“As a climate-focused investment manager, it's always been nonnegotiable, and the way that we think about it is: our investment strategy has to work throughout political cycles,” Anderson said. “Obviously it was a lot easier a year ago, when you had the IRA there.”

Average electricity prices increased by 13% from 2022 through 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and they are projected to rise further as artificial intelligence data centers strain power grids.

Politicians of all stripes care about their consumers’ abilities to pay their energy bills comfortably, Abbas said. More energy-efficient buildings mean lower electricity bills, so developers’ and lobbyists’ arguments haven’t changed.

“We'll continue to lobby, because we believe these sustainable investments are not yet self-sufficient,” he said. “We haven't changed how we approach, but our lobbying efforts have sure got sharper.”",https://cdn.bisnow.net/fit?height=1200&type=png&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcdn.bisnow.net%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2025%2F08%2F68b0b8bf783c6-untitled-design-2.png&width=1200&sign=6q7b1z06ueyxoXBCg1U2NagHwB7MNwSOxE9ZhJxu1KY,N,,2025-08-29 18:05:11.141553

Its North Carolina utility was directed by the state's Utilities Commission last fall to explore offshore wind energy.
In a 2024 plan, it showed up to 1.6 GW of offshore wind energy by 2035.
Another model included as much as 2.4 GW of offshore wind energy.","Duke Energy, which is one of the United States’ largest energy companies, has determined that offshore wind energy does not offer a cost advantage over solar power for North Carolina. The determination came as the utility was planning its long-term power sources and is based on proposals from the current leaseholders for offshore wind in North Carolina.

Headquartered in North Carolina, the company operates utilities in the Southeast as well as the Midwest. Its North Carolina utility was directed by the state's Utilities Commission last fall to explore offshore wind energy. As part of this review, it was instructed to request estimates from the three leaseholders for the development of up to 2.4 GW of offshore wind energy.

Duke, through its non-regulated subsidiary Cinergy, holds one of the leases that it was awarded in 2022. The project known as Carolina Long Bay is 22 miles south of Bald Head Island and could support up to approximately 1.6 GW. Neighboring Carolina Long Bay is TotalEnergies, which has the potential for 1.6 GW, and the two companies have explored collaborations.

A third offshore site available to Duke is Avangrid’s Kitty Hawk South, which was awarded in 2017. The company originally said it could produce up to 2.4 GW, but in 2022 sold the northern portion of its lease to Dominion Energy.

The three developers submitted a total of eight proposals, Duke reports in a filing to the Utilities Commission. It was looking for the projects to be developed by 2035.

In the filing submitted on August 11, Duke informed the commission that, based on its review, it determined solar and battery storage was cheaper in every instance. The company reports it was comparing the cost of building 3,576 MW of solar panels and 3,440 MW of battery storage capacity.

A spokesperson for the company told North Carolina Public Radio that they determined “offshore wind is not cost-competitive at this time.” The commission had instructed Duke that if the proposals were cost-competitive, to proceed with a binding request for proposals.

Supporters of wind energy were quick to criticize the review, noting that solar only provides power 30 to 40 percent of the time, whereas wind energy can generate between 80 and 90 percent of the time. They said they were “disappointed” that Duke was not proceeding, highlighting that it would require at least a decade before construction and commercial operations could be realized.

“The cost of wind being compared to solar and storage is one thing, but the efficiency of offshore wind being compared to solar and storage is a completely different thing because there are just fundamentally so many key differences between the technologies,"" Karly Brownfield, a senior program manager with the Southeastern Wind Coalition, told the public radio station WUNC.

Duke Energy is aggressively pursuing solar energy in Florida. The company reported last month that it currently owns, operates, and maintains a portfolio of more than 25 solar sites across Florida that generate approximately 1.5 GW, and between 2025 and 2027, the company plans to build 12 new solar sites, adding 900 megawatts. By the end of 2033, Duke Energy Florida projects it will have over 6.1 GW of utility-scale solar generating capacity online.

Josh Stein has established an energy policy task force to determine how the state can continue to keep utility costs affordable and manage increasing energy demand.

The task force will be co-chaired by Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson and state Rep. Kyle Hall.

“North Carolina is a leader in the clean energy economy and is home to more than 100,000 clean energy jobs,” said Stein in a written statement. “I am grateful for this task force helping to determine how our state can build on this economic momentum, meet growing energy demands and ensure electricity is affordable for North Carolinians.”

According to Stein, North Carolina is the third-fastest-growing state in the country. The state’s rapidly growing manufacturing footprint and the use of energy intensive data centers for artificial intelligence and other uses is increasing and the need for electrical power is placing additional demand on the state’s energy grid.

“Such demand may lead to higher utility bills for families. With growing demand in mind, North Carolina must work to meet its energy requirements while keeping electricity costs low for families,” Stein said.

“As our growing state’s demand for electricity increases, transitioning to clean energy will help ensure affordable prices for ratepayers,” said Wilson.

According to Stein, “The task force will be committed to ensuring North Carolina continues to push forward on critical clean energy commitments that protect the natural resources, the state’s economy and people’s pocketbooks.

“The reconciliation law that Congress passed and President Trump signed into law repealed key components of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, ending access to many energy and manufacturing tax credits for North Carolina businesses — a policy that sparked more than $24 billion in clean energy technology investments across the state.”

Stein said his state is committed to lowering energy costs for families, reducing North Carolina’s dependence on carbon and expanding the state’s clean energy economy.

He pointed out that the state’s commitment to clean energy has attracted $4.9 billion in new investments and more than 15,000 new jobs from clean energy and clean technology companies, including JetZero’s announcement of the largest jobs commitment in state history at Piedmont Triad International Airport to manufacture high-efficiency, low-emission aircraft.

Stein said he issued the executive order establishing the Energy Policy Task Force “to recommend policies to strengthen the state’s clean energy economy by managing increasing electricity demand while maintaining affordability, reliability, and carbon emissions reductions.”

“North Carolina is growing fast, and we need to meet a greater need for energy while at the same time lowering people’s utility bills,” said Hall. “This bipartisan task force will find real solutions that continue to foster growth and keep more money in North Carolinians’ wallets.”

In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV.
One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV.","(TestMiles) – Toyota is investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and EVs, but rumors continue to swirl about even bolder future products. Separating fact from speculation matters for both buyers and industry insiders.

Why does this matter right now?

Toyota is not dabbling in electrification; it is betting billions. Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is scheduled to open soon with fourteen lines for hybrid and battery output. The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory. By focusing on hybrids with premium touches, Toyota continues to exploit an efficiency gap while rivals rush into full battery electric territory.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you are an industry professional, this story underlines where Toyota is putting its real money. For consumers, it clarifies what is available now, the Crown sedan and Signia SUV, and what will be available soon, namely, Toyota’s first U.S.-built EVs. Enthusiasts and speculators, however, will want to lean into the second half of this story: the rumors Toyota is not confirming.

And Now for the Speculation: Toyota is not confirming.

This is where things get interesting. Industry chatter often fills the vacuum left by Toyota’s conservative announcements. Some speculation is logical, some fanciful, and all of it has been downplayed by Toyota spokesperson Nathan Kokes, who has emphasized that only announcements made by Toyota should be considered fact. Kokes went on to tell us, “To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana”.

Kokes went on to say, “As previously announced, Toyota plans to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Toyota will now assemble both vehicles at Toyota Kentucky.” And “Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume”. Finally, Kokes gave some insight into Toyota’s commitment to its workforce by saying, “We remain committed to providing long-term job stability for our team members.”

But the speculation from some persists. One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV. Outlets often label it the “bZ5X,” following Toyota’s bZ (beyond zero) naming convention. Others expect a Lexus version called the “TZ.” Toyota has never confirmed these names, and official channels continue to describe the projects simply as future three-row battery electric SUVs.

The Crown line is another hotbed of rumor. In Japan, the Crown family includes sedan, crossover, sport, and estate body styles. Some observers expect Toyota to expand the U.S. Crown line beyond the sedan and Signia SUV, potentially with a larger three-row premium vehicle or a sportier fastback. At this time, Toyota has not confirmed such plans, but marketing material in the U.S. clearly positions Crown as a “family” of models, hinting at long-term potential.

Trucks and off-roaders draw even more speculation. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed the EPU concept, a compact electric pickup with a footprint similar to a Ford Maverick. Many expect this to morph into a U.S. product, but Toyota has never confirmed American production. Similarly, Toyota showed the Compact Cruiser EV, a boxy small SUV in the vein of an FJ or Bronco Sport rival. Rumors continue that Toyota could launch a rugged EV or hybrid under the Land Cruiser or FJ nameplates, but again, no confirmation exists. The only rugged revival officially on the books is the Land Cruiser hybrid, which is already in American showrooms.

There are even whispers of a new sub-brand dedicated to electrification. Commentators suggest Toyota could spin off its EVs into a distinct nameplate, following the path of Lexus in the 1980s or Prius in the 2000s. Toyota has never acknowledged this idea, and so far, the closest evidence is the consistent branding of “bZ” on its vehicles.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term view is two-sided. On the one hand, the confirmed investments are enormous and concrete. North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana will become the core of Toyota’s American electrification strategy, and the Crown family already plants Toyota’s premium flag between Toyota and Lexus. On the other hand, the speculation illustrates the appetite for Toyota to do more: a compact truck to take on Ford, a rugged EV to challenge Bronco, or a broader Crown brand to pull buyers away from Acura and Infiniti. For now, those remain rumors, and Toyota has made it clear that only official announcements are the truth.",https://fox56news.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2025/08/Tacoma_Overlanding_Concept_Action_SEMA_2021_Hi-Res_15-600x400-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 17:04:19.752648

Commissioner Christian said the following:

“Texas’ reliable energy producers continue to prove that fossil fuel production and a clean environment can coexist. By embracing innovation and industry-driven solutions — not heavy-handed federal mandates — our state is reducing emissions while continuing to fuel America with reliable energy. As the nation’s largest producer of oil and gas, this milestone shows that we can produce affordable, reliable energy and achieve real environmental progress — without sacrificing jobs or energy security.”

“For years, radicle environmentalists and the mainstream media used out-of-context flaring images, from the Permian Basin, to scare average Americans and Wall Street. This fueled the false narrative of Net Zero and gave rise to ESG, which stifled oil and gas investment and left Americans with expensive and unreliable power. Thankfully, the Trump Administration has reversed Biden’s Green New Deal Agenda and prioritized increased U.S. oil and gas production.”

Background: In 2020, Christian convened a Blue Ribbon Task Force to prioritize reducing flaring and improving environmental outcomes while maintaining Texas’ role as the nation’s energy leader. The Task Force developed a comprehensive report with recommendations to minimize flaring, streamline regulatory processes, and increase transparency. Its work emphasized the importance of capturing natural gas that would otherwise be flared, leveraging new technology, and ensuring regulatory certainty to promote both economic recovery and environmental progress.

Under Christian’s leadership, Texas has achieved historic declines in flaring through improved infrastructure, better reporting, and voluntary industry action. The flaring rate in Texas dropped by 63 percent from June 2019 to May 2025. The monthly rates have consistently been below one percent, meaning more than 99% of natural gas produced in Texas is being beneficially used, a news release said.

The company's hydrogen production facilities in Georgia and Louisiana are performing well, with management targeting gross margin neutrality by the end of Q4 2025. Service performance improvements and pricing discipline are contributing to margin recovery.

The electrolyzer business is expected to be a key driver of growth, with a robust pipeline of European projects anticipated to reach final investment decisions in 2026. International opportunities span multiple gigawatts across Australia, Europe, and Central Asia, although timing remains uncertain due to the complex approval processes required for these large-scale projects.

Plug Power ended Q2 with just $140 million in cash, while its free cash outflow is forecast at $521.3 million in 2025. It's evident that Plug Power will need to raise additional capital, which will result in shareholder dilution. The company also faces tariff pressures on its material handling business, although management claims the impacts are manageable due to the reduced Chinese content in its supply chain.

What Is the Target Price for PLUG Stock?

Analysts tracking Plug Power stock forecast revenue to rise from $629 million in 2024 to $1.77 billion in 2029. It is predicted to end 2029 with a free cash flow of $207 million, while EBITDA is forecast at $496 million. If Plug Power stock is priced at 20 times forward free cash flow, it could more than double over the next four years.

Out of the 23 analysts covering PLUG stock, five recommend “Strong Buy,” 14 recommend “Hold,” and four recommend “Strong Sell.” The average PLUG stock price target is $1.97, above the current price of $1.63.

Plug Power’s success depends on government subsidies and its ability to execute on ambitious growth plans while managing cash constraints. Investors should view this as a speculative bet on the development of the hydrogen economy rather than a stable investment opportunity.

The key question is whether the company can survive the U.S. policy headwinds while positioning for eventual recovery. The stock's volatility and dependence on government support make it unsuitable for risk-averse investors.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22443909/Green_hydrogen_by_Scharfsinn_via_Shutterstock.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 11:01:41.394085

The introduction of a £42,000 price cap aims to ban more luxurious trim levels from the scheme.
A DfT spokesperson told the Daily Mail: 'The Electric Car Grant is putting money back in people’s pockets whilst also providing a vital boost for industry.","The Government's Electric Car Grant (ECG) is barely a month old and already ministers have introduced a new stipulation to restrict the number of vehicles qualifying for discounts.

Launched on 15 July, the ECG is Labour's desperate bid to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles following months of slowing demand from private buyers.

The scheme offers to slash the price of some new EVs by as much as £3,750 in the hope that making them more financially appealing will translate to an acceleration in the number of motorists making the switch.

To ensure grants are 'targeted' only to affordable EVs, only those starting from under £37,000 are eligible. Manufacturers too must adhere to stringent sustainability criteria in order for their cars to qualify for the discounts.

With 28 models so far confirmed for grants, the Department for Transport last night introduced a new 'price cap' to the rules to cut more luxurious and well-equipped EVs out of the deal.

This will ultimately add yet more confusion to the scheme, which has already drawn criticism from industry experts and dealers for being convoluted and a drain on taxpayer funds.

The ECG, which is backed by a £650million investment until 2028-29, requires car manufacturers to apply for eligibility for their battery-powered models priced below £37,000.

The DfT has been determining which of these cars qualify based on additional green criteria, namely the emissions produced during the battery's manufacturing and vehicle's assembly, as well as the carbon intensity of the electric grids in the countries where the car is made.

Those that fail to meet the Government's minimum threshold are excluded from the scheme entirely, with all Chinese brands expected to be omitted on these grounds.

EVs deemed suitably green are then judged on a two-tier system: the most sustainable are categorised as 'Band 1' and receive the full grant amount of £3,750; those not quite meeting the highest requirement are demoted to 'Band 2' with smaller discounts of £1,500.

Of the 28 models announced so far, just two - the Ford Puma Gen-E and E-Tourneo Courier - have met the demands of Band 1 eligibility.

And a new stipulation added at midnight means even fewer EV models will be awarded discounts.

The introduction of a £42,000 price cap aims to ban more luxurious trim levels from the scheme.

Confusingly, eligibility for each model is determined by the cheapest version of what the DfT calls the 'interpolation family'. This essentially means models underpinned by the same drivetrain combination of battery and electric motors.

For instance, front-wheel-drive versions of the Nissan Ariya have been confirmed for Band 2 - and therefore subject to a £1,500 discount - based on the entry 'Engage' trim level costing less than £37,000.

The same £1,500 discount was therefore applied to all other versions of the FWD Ariya - even those well above £37,000.

However, the application of the price cap means the highest trim level - Evolve - which is priced over £42,000 no longer qualifies because it is deemed too expensive.

While it shares the same electric drivetrain as the Engage trim, it benefits from a number of luxury features, including an electric panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats, and a high-end sound system.

Ministers believe buyers capable of spending over £42,000 on an EV have suitable funds not to be awarded subsidies funded by taxpayers.

However, for some models, the price cap could rule out advanced safety features as well as luxuries, with manufacturers typically reserving the latest in crash mitigation systems for their higher-specification models.

A DfT spokesperson told the Daily Mail: 'The Electric Car Grant is putting money back in people’s pockets whilst also providing a vital boost for industry.

'The maximum price limit ensures only eligible cars priced at the lower end of the market can qualify for the discounts, ensuring government support is targeted.'

Due to the prolonged application and review process of the ECG, the Government has only been able to announce qualifying EVs in weekly drips and drabs.

It says it is doing so 'as fast as it can'.

This, however, has created a lot of delays, scepticism and frustration.

It took over three weeks for the first four eligible models from Citroen to be announced. The six latest cars qualifying were confirmed on Thursday.

Dealers have reported to trade magazine Car Dealer that confusion surrounding the scheme is causing 'chaos' in showrooms, with drivers withholding purchases while they wait to see which cars will receive the grant - and, more importantly, which models are eligible for the higher Band 1 discount of £3,750.

SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes earlier this month said a 'dip' in registrations in July has been exacerbated by consumer's postponing orders of new EVs over 'certainty' about which models will have their prices reduced.

Jon Lawes, managing director at Novuna Vehicle Solutions, also criticised the Government for its 'rushed rollout and limited industry consultation' on the scheme, which he says has caused major confusion for consumers and car makers alike.

'Manufacturers are scrambling to work out which models apply while consumers are left in limbo, wondering if they’ll actually get up to £3,750 in savings – risking a slowdown in demand, particularly in private sales, which continue to lag behind fleets,' he said.

'And excluding used EVs is a missed opportunity to improve affordability and buyer confidence.'

Peter Smyth, director of retailer group Swansway, told Car Dealer that the ECG's roll-out has been 'shambolic', adding that it should have been far simpler than what he dubbed a 'typical government bureaucratic mess'.

Other retailers said the grant had been 'ill thought out' and created a logjam of customers.

Some motorists, failing to understand the application process in place for manufacturer, have reportedly walked into showrooms demanding the £3,750 discount in full, irrelevant of whether the DfT has confirmed if the model they want qualifies or not.

Another boss of a 'large dealer group' criticised the approach of announcing small batches of new eligible models on an almost weekly basis, saying the DfT should instead provide a full comprehensive list.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/29/13/101662741-0-image-a-127_1756469715545.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 18:03:12.369667

Sisemore, who served as mayor from 2005 to 2011 and as a city commissioner, will act as Fermi’s local representative.
Fermi co-founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer said Sisemore was chosen because of his deep ties to the region.
“For me, this project is about making sure Amarillo’s skilled workforce benefits from the opportunities it will bring,” Sisemore said.
“Doosan is the largest, most respected nuclear power plant component supplier in the world,” he said.","Fermi America, which is developing what it calls the world’s largest private grid to power artificial intelligence, has named former Amarillo Mayor Trent Sisemore as its community lead while advancing a major international nuclear partnership with Doosan Enerbility.

The Texas Tech University System partner announced the move this week as part of its effort to connect with the Amarillo community, where it plans to build an $11 billion private grid and artificial intelligence campus on 5,200 acres of university land near the city. Preliminary economic impact studies project the development could create about 2,500 direct jobs and 6,000 indirect jobs, generating an estimated $1.2 billion annually during construction.

Sisemore, who served as mayor from 2005 to 2011 and as a city commissioner, will act as Fermi’s local representative. His role includes hosting town halls, collaborating with civic groups and businesses, and leading a new Community Advisory Board that the company says will address infrastructure, housing and environmental concerns.

Fermi co-founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer said Sisemore was chosen because of his deep ties to the region.

“Growing up in the Panhandle forged shared values that Trent exemplifies,” Neugebauer said. “We believe his leadership will help ensure Amarillo’s voice is heard as we build this project.”

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another Fermi co-founder, described Sisemore’s appointment as a signal of the project’s credibility.

“Trent’s track record shows he gets things done while keeping community first,” Perry said.

A familiar local figure

Sisemore is a well-known figure in Amarillo politics and business. During his tenure in city government, he supported initiatives that brought Bell Helicopter’s manufacturing plant to Amarillo, helped develop the Amarillo Civic Center’s performing arts space, and backed the purchase of water rights that city leaders say will sustain the city for more than 200 years.

Beyond politics, Sisemore served 17 years on the board of Happy State Bank and worked with local charities, including the High Plains Food Bank. A businessman and entrepreneur, he co-owned Jack Sisemore Traveland with his father before selling it in 2017, and he was a founding partner of Keystone RV, which grew into the world’s largest travel trailer manufacturer at the time of its sale in 2001.

“For me, this project is about making sure Amarillo’s skilled workforce benefits from the opportunities it will bring,” Sisemore said.

Global partnership

The announcement came days after Fermi signed a memorandum of understanding with Doosan Enerbility, a South Korean company that supplies components for more than 40% of the world’s nuclear power plants, according to industry reports.

Neugebauer said Doosan’s track record gives him confidence the project can remain on schedule. “Doosan is the largest, most respected nuclear power plant component supplier in the world,” he said. “They know how to deliver on time and on budget.”

Mesut Uzman, Fermi’s chief nuclear commercial officer, also pointed to Doosan’s history of delivering projects in Asia and the Middle East. “Having worked with them before, I’ve seen their precision and commitment to safety firsthand,” Uzman said.

Doosan President Jongdoo Kim characterized the partnership as one built on “mutual respect and a shared commitment to innovation.”

Long-term plans

Fermi’s Amarillo campus aims to deliver 11 gigawatts of power — enough to supply about 3 million homes — and 15 million square feet of AI computing capacity. The project will combine natural gas, nuclear, solar and battery storage to meet the demand for data centers, which the U.S. Department of Energy estimates consume 10 times more energy than traditional facilities.

The first gigawatt of natural gas generation is expected online by the end of 2026, with one additional gigawatt added annually for a decade. Nuclear construction is slated to begin in 2027, with the first small modular reactor projected to be operational by 2032.

Fermi has pledged to invest $50 million in local water conservation and renewable energy integration to reduce environmental impacts. Sisemore’s Community Advisory Board is expected to hold its first public meeting in early 2026 to discuss housing expansion, road upgrades and water use with city officials.

“Amarillo has the talent and grit to make this project a success,” Sisemore said. “We’ll work together to ensure this campus benefits our community for generations.”","https://www.lubbockonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/29/NAGN/85893680007-img-9067.jpeg?crop=1498,843,x0,y100&width=1498&height=843&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-29 21:00:12.867504

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

As of April, there are more than 117,000 electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles registered in the state.
Hybrid electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles would be phased in beginning July 2028.
Plug-in hybrid drivers could also face higher prices than EV drivers, Morgan said.
“First, we receive a tax break for buying an EV/Hybrid and now we are getting taxed for owning and driving them?!!!","For many people, buying an electric vehicle was a step into the future. Not only did it mean driving a car powered by electricity, but it also meant no longer relying on fossil fuels, like gasoline, to power your car. That helps reduce carbon emissions from Oregon’s highest emitting sector — transportation.

As EVs became more popular over the years, tens of thousands of Oregonians across the state were able to purchase their vehicle at a lower price through federal and state rebates. At one point, qualified Oregonians could have gotten up to $15,000 in rebates. That helped provide some relief against the higher sticker prices and registration fees for these vehicles in the state.

Now, a new proposal under Gov. Tina Kotek’s transportation bill would require EV and plug-in hybrid drivers to enroll in a program that would charge them a per-mile fee, or a “road usage charge,” for driving on any Oregon road.

The state says it needs the charge to fill the Oregon Department of Transportation’s $300 million budget gap. That gap exists, in part due to more people buying EVs — and no longer paying the state’s 40-cent-per-gallon gas tax, which goes toward things like road maintenance.

In testimony, advocates for drivers of gas-powered cars said they support the governor’s legislation.

But environmental groups — and people who already have EVs — say the governor’s current proposal could deter people from driving these vehicles, and could significantly slow down emission reductions from the transportation sector.

Charging per mile

The idea for a road usage charge, or a per-mile fee, isn’t new in Oregon. In fact, there is already a voluntary program in place for EV drivers called OReGO. Oregon was the first state in the nation to launch a road usage program, and it’s been in place since 2015, according to ODOT’s innovative programs policy advisor Scott Boardman.

Under that program, participants pay 2 cents for each mile they drive. The money generated goes into the State Highway Fund, which maintains roads and bridges. The rate was calculated to match what the driver of a gas-powered vehicle that gets 20 miles per gallon would pay in gas taxes — 20 miles per gallon was the average efficiency at the time the program launched.

As of Aug. 15, the OReGO program had 849 vehicles enrolled.

The gas tax has provided the funding necessary to keep up with road maintenance for years, but gas-powered cars have become more energy-efficient and now get more MPG. And there are more electric vehicles on the road than ever, Boardman said.

As of April, there are more than 117,000 electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles registered in the state.

Boardman said these vehicles are paying less for the wear and tear they cause than less efficient cars and trucks. That has created a gap in road funding.

“If we switch to a road usage charge, in which people would be paying by the mile, it kind of decouples the amount that you’re paying in transportation taxes and fees from the efficiency of the vehicle to the actual usage of the transportation system itself,” Boardman said.

Under the proposal, which legislators will consider when they convene for a special session in Salem on Friday, electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles would be required to sign up for the OReGO program.

The charge would remain the same, at 2 cents per mile driven anywhere in the state.

“The less you drive, the less you pay, versus the more you drive and the more wear and tear that you impose on the system, the more you contribute to the operations and maintenance of the roads and the bridges,” Boardman said.

If the proposal becomes law, the state’s registered vehicles would not all be required to sign up at once, he said.

It would require current EV owners to sign up for the program when they renew their registration after July 2027. After that, new EV owners will be required to sign up for the program starting January 2028.

Hybrid electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles would be phased in beginning July 2028.

High registration fees and low miles per gallon

But environmental, climate and electric vehicle advocates say the current proposal is flawed.

Brett Morgan, transportation policy director with nonprofit advocacy group Climate Solutions, pushed back against the suggestion that EVs are not paying their fair share of taxes.

Currently, EV and plug-in hybrid drivers pay higher registration fees than vehicles that get between 20-39 MPG. As of now, electric vehicle drivers pay $316 for registering their vehicle for two years — more than double what drivers of less efficient vehicles are charged. EVs also pay an additional $115 per year in supplemental fees.

Under Kotek’s proposal, that cost would drop to $85 for two years. EV and plug-in hybrid users would no longer pay a supplemental registration fee after signing up for the road use charge program.

While those registration fees may drop, Morgan said, EV and plug-in hybrid drivers in the program could still wind up paying nearly $200 more per year than the driver of a car that gets 20 MPG. That’s because of the road use charge.

An ODOT official said the agency’s own analysis disputes Morgan’s math and concludes that EV drivers would pay less than 20 MPG vehicles if Kotek’s road-use charge proposal passes and the state also increases the gas tax to 46 cents per gallon.

Morgan is advocating for a lower per-mile fee. He said these efficient vehicles should be charged the same rate as gas drivers who get 30 MPG.

“The national average for all vehicle types is closer to 25 MPG, with Oregon in particular trending closer to 30 MPG,” he said. “When you take into consideration more recent data, it more clearly indicates the average MPG of vehicles on the road is much higher than 20 and so if you are to rely on that 20 MPG average assumption, you’re effectively overcharging EV drivers based on past data.”

Charging these drivers of these efficient vehicles at a per-mile rate equivalent to what 20 MPG vehicles pay in gas taxes would increase revenue for the state, Morgan said. But, he said, that would cut into the savings the drivers who made the switch to EVs may be counting on.

“Especially those that are driving further, those that are potentially more dependent on those savings because they’ve made choices, like buying an EV, to make those cost savings happen,” he said.

Plug-in hybrid drivers could also face higher prices than EV drivers, Morgan said. That’s because it’s harder to track which miles are driven using just the electric power of the car. Plug-in hybrid cars are very fuel-efficient and use a blend of electric and gas.

According to ODOT’s Boardman, if Kotek’s proposal passes, the agency will have three years to develop a plan to properly charge users of these vehicles.

But a road usage charge could convince people not to buy or lease EVs, especially at a time when the Trump administration is ending federal EV tax credits. Oregon is also running out of funding for rebates. Since July, the state has issued more than $104 million in EV rebates and has announced it will be temporarily suspending one of its rebates next month due to lack of funding.

Public hearing

On Monday, legislators held the first public hearing for Kotek’s proposed bill. Hundreds of people submitted testimony, including Marie Dodds, the director of government and public affairs at AAA Oregon/Idaho. She said her group supports the overall proposal but she did not provide specific comments about the road usage charge.

“We believe the package reflects the core values that AAA uses to evaluate any transportation funding package, including commitment to traffic safety, protecting the transportation trust fund, ensuring cost responsibility between light and heavy vehicles and accountability and transparency,” she said during the hearing. “Although this package is not perfect, we do believe it takes steps needed to provide the stability, accountability, and measured solutions necessary to keep Oregon moving and efficiently.”

But public support for the road use charge appears limited. Many who testified said they opposed the additional tax on EV and plug-in hybrid drivers.

“This is a regressive tax for all Oregonians, but especially those of us who spent more money to buy EVs or Hybrids to protect our environment,” Ellen Pfander said in her written testimony. “First, we receive a tax break for buying an EV/Hybrid and now we are getting taxed for owning and driving them?!!! I guess I’ll trade it in and buy a huge polluting truck!!! Come up with something that is fair for our environment.”

Others noted the high number of vehicles in the Portland metro area with Washington license plates. Those cars will not pay road use charges for the miles they drive on Oregon’s roads.

“Living in North Portland, I see hundreds if not thousands of Washington vehicles in Portland every day they come from Vancouver to work and shop to avoid paying state taxes,” Maria Belgrave said in written testimony. “Those vehicles cause wear and tear on … our streets and highways. If there was a toll fee to come into the state this would generate the much needed funding to ODOT.”

Others testimony criticized the proposal to charge EVs based on the 20 MPG rate, calling it unfair.

Morgan, the Climate Solutions transportation expert, said charging EVs as much for their road use as drivers of 30 MPG cars pay in gas taxes would be more fair — and would reflect the reality that vehicles in Oregon are becoming more energy efficient. He said if lawmakers make that change, and also develop a strategy to implement the program for plug-in hybrid drivers, a road usage charge could work.

“The [road usage charge] is a really good ‘user pays’ model,” Morgan said. “But if we start out by just penalizing EVs, we’re sending all the wrong signals about what we should be doing as a state.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67d3f2c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+23/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2a%2Ff7%2F49d10f654aa9ab08fdfa9dcd2f9d%2Fev-charging.jpeg,N,,2025-08-29 17:02:34.796030

Josh Stein has established an energy policy task force to determine how the state can continue to keep utility costs affordable and manage increasing energy demand.

The task force will be co-chaired by Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson and state Rep. Kyle Hall.

“North Carolina is a leader in the clean energy economy and is home to more than 100,000 clean energy jobs,” said Stein in a written statement. “I am grateful for this task force helping to determine how our state can build on this economic momentum, meet growing energy demands and ensure electricity is affordable for North Carolinians.”

According to Stein, North Carolina is the third-fastest-growing state in the country. The state’s rapidly growing manufacturing footprint and the use of energy intensive data centers for artificial intelligence and other uses is increasing and the need for electrical power is placing additional demand on the state’s energy grid.

“Such demand may lead to higher utility bills for families. With growing demand in mind, North Carolina must work to meet its energy requirements while keeping electricity costs low for families,” Stein said.

“As our growing state’s demand for electricity increases, transitioning to clean energy will help ensure affordable prices for ratepayers,” said Wilson.

According to Stein, “The task force will be committed to ensuring North Carolina continues to push forward on critical clean energy commitments that protect the natural resources, the state’s economy and people’s pocketbooks.

“The reconciliation law that Congress passed and President Trump signed into law repealed key components of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, ending access to many energy and manufacturing tax credits for North Carolina businesses — a policy that sparked more than $24 billion in clean energy technology investments across the state.”

Stein said his state is committed to lowering energy costs for families, reducing North Carolina’s dependence on carbon and expanding the state’s clean energy economy.

He pointed out that the state’s commitment to clean energy has attracted $4.9 billion in new investments and more than 15,000 new jobs from clean energy and clean technology companies, including JetZero’s announcement of the largest jobs commitment in state history at Piedmont Triad International Airport to manufacture high-efficiency, low-emission aircraft.

Stein said he issued the executive order establishing the Energy Policy Task Force “to recommend policies to strengthen the state’s clean energy economy by managing increasing electricity demand while maintaining affordability, reliability, and carbon emissions reductions.”

“North Carolina is growing fast, and we need to meet a greater need for energy while at the same time lowering people’s utility bills,” said Hall. “This bipartisan task force will find real solutions that continue to foster growth and keep more money in North Carolinians’ wallets.”

The Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to finalize the largest and most expensive Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandate in history. This would significantly increase costs for American refiners and consumers.

Analysis done this summer by Turner Mason & Co. projects the RFS could cost the American people and American fuel producers nearly $70 billion both years. That’s about twice as expensive as the 2023 RFS, the current annual record-holder.

It’s worth noting that EPA shows a different cost projection in its regulatory impact analysis, and that deserves some explanation.

Turner Mason calculated the likely cost of all the RFS regulatory credits (known as RINs) refiners would need to turn into EPA in 2026 and 2027 to prove compliance with the RFS mandate. Turner Mason determined those RINs would cost roughly $70 billion both years.

EPA published a “societal cost” of the RFS program which doesn’t include the cost of any RFS regulatory credits. Even with that huge omission, EPA’s cost v. benefit ratio is still pretty bad: they say the RFS will impose societal costs of $6.7 billion per year, while offering just $200 million in benefits (that means even in the most flattering light, the RFS leaves us $6.5 billion in the red).

Two additional cost notes:

EPA’s omission of RFS credit costs is especially frustrating since the Agency claims RFS costs are “passed through to consumers in [the form of] higher prices on the gasoline and diesel” obligated refineries produce.

EPA’s cost estimates could be even further off base if the Agency chooses to reallocate RFS obligations from small refineries granted relief to larger refineries. EPA has left the door open for the possibility of reallocation on top of the 2026-2027 RFS proposal, which would further inflate the cost of the RFS mandate.

Why are compliance costs so high, and what can EPA do about it?

Glad you asked!

RFS compliance costs are driven by one problem more than any other: the price of regulatory credits for corn starch ethanol are artificially inflated. The price of ethanol credits is driven up by higher priced advanced biofuel credits, and that’s because advanced biofuels must also be used to satisfy a small portion of the RFS implied conventional mandate (that’s part of the RFS where corn ethanol lives). Advanced biofuels are needed to meet the implied conventional mandate because gasoline consumption is trending down in the United States and there’s a limit to how much corn ethanol can be blended into gasoline, based on vehicle and fuel infrastructure compatibility and demand from drivers. Advanced biofuels make up the difference.

EPA can cut RFS compliance costs by more than half, without reducing overall biofuel blending at all. All the agency needs to do is move the small volume of advanced biofuels from the implied conventional category over to the advanced category. This would just make sure the volume tables match what EPA has already recognized elsewhere: that blending 15 billion gallons of corn ethanol isn’t possible in 2026 or 2027. Setting the implied conventional mandate a little lower and raising the advanced mandate by the same amount keeps overall biofuel gallons equal, while cutting the cost of ethanol regulatory credits and the total RFS price tag by more than $35 billion.

There’s more EPA can do to cut costs as well, but this simple switch would cut red tape without affecting volumes. It’s an obvious, cost-saving place to start.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

It does not include a road usage charge.
In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections.
Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

However, the special session got off to a rocky start: The state Senate met as scheduled at 9 a.m., but the state House failed to reach the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, leaving the session in limbo as of late Friday afternoon.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are at risk, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting funding restrictions to allow the transportation department to spend more money on maintenance operations, including by redirecting dollars earmarked for public transit and efforts to combat climate change toward such operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/08/68b2595dd1b490.83974556.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 23:59:35.363518

Commissioner Christian said the following:

“Texas’ reliable energy producers continue to prove that fossil fuel production and a clean environment can coexist. By embracing innovation and industry-driven solutions – not heavy-handed federal mandates – our state is reducing emissions while continuing to fuel America with reliable energy. As the nation’s largest producer of oil and gas, this milestone shows that we can produce affordable, reliable energy and achieve real environmental progress—without sacrificing jobs or energy security.”

“For years, radical environmentalists and the mainstream media used out-of-context flaring images, from the Permian basin, to scare average Americans and Wall Street. This fueled the false narrative of Net Zero and gave rise to ESG, which stifled oil and gas investment and left Americans with expensive and unreliable power. Thankfully, the Trump Administration has reversed Biden’s Green New Deal Agenda and prioritized increased U.S. oil and gas production.”

Background: In 2020, Christian convened a Blue Ribbon Task Force to prioritize reducing flaring and improving environmental outcomes while maintaining Texas’ role as the nation’s energy leader. The Task Force developed a comprehensive report with recommendations to minimize flaring, streamline regulatory processes, and increase transparency. Its work emphasized the importance of capturing natural gas that would otherwise be flared, leveraging new technology, and ensuring regulatory certainty to promote both economic recovery and environmental progress.

Under Christian’s leadership, Texas has achieved historic declines in flaring through improved infrastructure, better reporting, and voluntary industry action. The flaring rate in Texas dropped by 63 percent from June 2019 to May 2025. The monthly rates have consistently been below one percent, meaning more than 99% of natural gas produced in Texas is being beneficially used.

“Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,” Fine said.
Time grows short to ensure springs survive Though they have challenges, Florida’s freshwater springs have energetic friends, too.","ZEPHYRHILLS, Fla. (AP) — Seen from the air, a Florida freshwater spring is a bit of liquid heaven, luring humans and wildlife to enjoy its aquamarine cool. With at least 1,000 of them — more than any other state — the springs serve as beaches for large swaths of central and northwestern Florida far from the ocean, with teenagers backflipping from docks and snorkelers peering into the crystalline depths.

But these treasures are under threat from agricultural pollution, rapid development and climate change.

Some places, such as fast-growing Zephyrhills in west-central Florida, have paused some construction as it struggles to stay within limits on the drinking water it can withdraw from a vast underground aquifer. Zephyrhills is home to Crystal Springs, source of the bottled water named after the town and several other brands.

“We really had to do something,” said Steven Spina, a member of the town council. “A lot of residents thought it was a good thing. People were happy to see us take a breath.”

Vast Floridan aquifer is source of springs

Covering an estimated 100,000 square miles (250,000 square kilometers), the underground Floridan Aquifer is the source of 90% of Florida’s drinking water. Because of the porous nature of the state’s bedrock, millions of gallons of water find their way to the surface in the form of clear, clean springs that, in turn, feed into rivers.

The highest concentration of springs are in central and northern Florida, including most of the 30 “first magnitude” springs — those that discharge at least 65 million gallons (246 million liters) of water every day. All but four of them are considered polluted.

“We just have too much pollution going into the ground and too much water coming out of the ground,” said Ryan Smart, executive director of the nonprofit Florida Springs Council. “And when you get that combination, you end up with springs that are no longer blue and vibrant and full of life.”

Agriculture, development are main threats

In rural Florida, runoff from fertilizers and pesticides used in farm fields is a major part of the problem. Fertilizers containing phosphates and nitrogen promote algae blooms that can suffocate a spring. Livestock waste contributes, too.

“When that algae covers everything, then you lose all of the seagrasses. The seagrasses are the forests of the water,” Smart said. “Then you begin to lose the biodiversity. And it even puts our drinking water at risk.”

Elsewhere in Florida, rampant development is the threat. With over 1,000 people moving to Florida every day, more housing subdivisions are sprouting, along with the roads, strip malls, restaurants, golf courses and everything else that comes with them.

That means more paved surfaces that keep rainwater from percolating down into the aquifer and more pollutant-laden runoff from lawn fertilizers, parking lots, ever-widening roads and sometimes septic tanks. It also means more and more people, many of whom enjoy tubing, paddleboarding, kayaking and swimming in the springs.

It gets so busy in summer at some springs located in state and local parks that entry is halted by late morning. At Ichetucknee Springs State Park north of Gainesville, the daily limit of 750 tubers on the upper river is often reached within an hour after the park opens.

Kaelin Gibbs, on vacation in June with his family from Georgia, was swimming in the Blue Hole Spring along the Ichetucknee River.

“This is simply incredible; the water is cool and clear,” said Gibbs. “We’ve been to Florida’s beaches and to Orlando. There is no comparison to how beautiful this spring is.”

But that’s in peril, said Dennis Jones, a Republican former legislator deeply involved in springs issues. He said the volume of permits being issued for water use isn’t sustainable.

“You cannot keep taking water out of the aquifer because it’s not an endless supply,” Jones said.

Phosphate mining has also taken a toll on springs. Their operations require a great deal of water, which reduces water pressure available for springs. Some have died almost completely from mining and other factors, including White Sulphur Springs in north Florida, which was a sacred place for Native Americans and later a tourist resort that attracted famous visitors such as Henry Ford and Theodore Roosevelt.

Climate change alters rainfall patterns, causes sea rise

A more subtle threat to the health of springs involves Earth’s changing climate. It is altering rainfall patterns around the globe, threatening the balance that feeds Florida’s springs.

In addition, some springs along the coasts are facing an intrusion of salt water, according to the Southwest Florida Water Management District. Four major springs are becoming increasingly brackish because of sea level rise and declining rainfall.

“As a result, freshwater vegetation has a hard time surviving in this saltier environment and unwanted vegetation moves in,” the district said in a website post.

State laws to protect springs remain stalled

Florida spends billions every year on water quality projects, including about $800 million this year for Everglades restoration work. State funding for springs runs about $50 million a year, according to state documents.

Two state efforts at improving springs’ quality, both around a decade old, remain bottled up in court and administrative challenges. One would strengthen rules for permits to draw water from the major springs. The other would enhance rules to reduce the amount of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphates that goes into springs that are considered impaired.

Jones, the former legislator, said lobbying by powerful agricultural interests and related political pressures have blocked progress on the nitrogen reduction plan that was expected to take about 20 years.

“We’ve burned up almost 10 years and they haven’t got on stage one. We got more nitrates now than when we started,” Jones said.

In Congress, U.S. Rep. Randy Fine recently filed a bill that would create a Florida Springs National Park across several counties, centered around the Ocala National Forest. Fine said in a statement the designation would protect the springs and increase funding. “Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,” Fine said.

Bottling companies get cheap permits for water

It costs bottling companies just $115 for a permit allowing them to withdraw millions of gallons of water in perpetuity. But they do pay local taxes.

Blue Triton, the company that bottles Zephyrhills water, pays about $600,000 a year in taxes for things like schools, public safety and so forth, said Spina of the city council.

“They are one of our largest taxpayers,” he said.

Time grows short to ensure springs survive

Though they have challenges, Florida’s freshwater springs have energetic friends, too.

Michelle Jamesson loves the springs; she grew up swimming in one and is determined to help protect them for future generations. She volunteers for SpringsWatch Citizen Science Program, coordinating and working with other volunteers for monthly tests on the Wekiva River, north of Orlando.

They test water quality, take photos of underwater vegetation, count birds and more, seeking to spot any big changes that may require action. The Wekiva is fairly stable, she said, though it carries a lot of excess nutrients.

“The wildlife and the ecology, and all of it — it’s so full of life,” Jamesson said.

The initial 90-day order was issued in June. This is the second power plant the administration has ordered to operate past its planned retirement under the excuse of a so-called “energy emergency”. The first plant, J.H. Campbell in Michigan, cost $29 million to run in the first five weeks of its extension.

The Regional Transmission Organization PJM approved Eddystone’s Unit 3 and 4 retirement in February of 2024, confirming that its retirement will not affect reliability. Contradicting its own assessment, PJM voiced its support for this emergency order. PJM has already gone to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to file for cost recovery of the plant’s 90-day operational costs and been granted the right to stick ratepayers across the PJM footprint with the bill, per the August 15th FERC docket.

The two units, which rely on a combination of oil- and gas fuel inputs, were estimated to cost in the ballpark of $17.4 million per quarter to keep operational past the planned retirement date, according to independent analysis from Grid Strategies.The Sierra Club and partner groups filed a rehearing request for this emergency order in June. The Department of Energy has failed to issue a response.

In response, Sierra Club Senior Advisor Jessi Eidbo issued the following response:

“The Trump administration is forcing another expensive fossil fuel plant that had been ready to retire for over a year to continue operating longer than it has to and making community members across the Mid-Atlantic foot the bill.

The reality is that hardworking families in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, are already living paycheck to paycheck and making difficult decisions at the kitchen table.

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

It is altering rainfall patterns around the globe, threatening the balance that feeds Florida's springs.
In addition, some springs along the coasts are facing an intrusion of salt water, according to the Southwest Florida Water Management District.
""Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,"" Fine said.
Time grows short to ensure springs survive Though they have challenges, Florida's freshwater springs have energetic friends, too.","ZEPHYRHILLS, Fla. (AP) — Seen from the air, a Florida freshwater spring is a bit of liquid heaven, luring humans and wildlife to enjoy its aquamarine cool. With at least 1,000 of them — more than any other state — the springs serve as beaches for large swaths of central and northwestern Florida far from the ocean, with teenagers backflipping from docks and snorkelers peering into the crystalline depths.

But these treasures are under threat from agricultural pollution, rapid development and climate change.

Some places, such as fast-growing Zephyrhills in west-central Florida, have paused some construction as it struggles to stay within limits on the drinking water it can withdraw from a vast underground aquifer. Zephyrhills is home to Crystal Springs, source of the bottled water named after the town and several other brands.

""We really had to do something,"" said Steven Spina, a member of the town council. ""A lot of residents thought it was a good thing. People were happy to see us take a breath.""

Vast Floridan aquifer is source of springs

Covering an estimated 100,000 square miles (250,000 square kilometers), the underground Floridan Aquifer is the source of 90% of Florida's drinking water. Because of the porous nature of the state's bedrock, millions of gallons of water find their way to the surface in the form of clear, clean springs that, in turn, feed into rivers.

The highest concentration of springs are in central and northern Florida, including most of the 30 ""first magnitude"" springs — those that discharge at least 65 million gallons (246 million liters) of water every day. All but four of them are considered polluted.

""We just have too much pollution going into the ground and too much water coming out of the ground,"" said Ryan Smart, executive director of the nonprofit Florida Springs Council. ""And when you get that combination, you end up with springs that are no longer blue and vibrant and full of life.""

Agriculture, development are main threats

In rural Florida, runoff from fertilizers and pesticides used in farm fields is a major part of the problem. Fertilizers containing phosphates and nitrogen promote algae blooms that can suffocate a spring. Livestock waste contributes, too.

""When that algae covers everything, then you lose all of the seagrasses. The seagrasses are the forests of the water,"" Smart said. ""Then you begin to lose the biodiversity. And it even puts our drinking water at risk.""

Elsewhere in Florida, rampant development is the threat. With over 1,000 people moving to Florida every day, more housing subdivisions are sprouting, along with the roads, strip malls, restaurants, golf courses and everything else that comes with them.

That means more paved surfaces that keep rainwater from percolating down into the aquifer and more pollutant-laden runoff from lawn fertilizers, parking lots, ever-widening roads and sometimes septic tanks. It also means more and more people, many of whom enjoy tubing, paddleboarding, kayaking and swimming in the springs.

It gets so busy in summer at some springs located in state and local parks that entry is halted by late morning. At Ichetucknee Springs State Park north of Gainesville, the daily limit of 750 tubers on the upper river is often reached within an hour after the park opens.

Kaelin Gibbs, on vacation in June with his family from Georgia, was swimming in the Blue Hole Spring along the Ichetucknee River.

""This is simply incredible; the water is cool and clear,"" said Gibbs. ""We've been to Florida's beaches and to Orlando. There is no comparison to how beautiful this spring is.""

But that's in peril, said Dennis Jones, a Republican former legislator deeply involved in springs issues. He said the volume of permits being issued for water use isn't sustainable.

""You cannot keep taking water out of the aquifer because it's not an endless supply,"" Jones said.

Phosphate mining has also taken a toll on springs. Their operations require a great deal of water, which reduces water pressure available for springs. Some have died almost completely from mining and other factors, including White Sulphur Springs in north Florida, which was a sacred place for Native Americans and later a tourist resort that attracted famous visitors such as Henry Ford and Theodore Roosevelt.

Climate change alters rainfall patterns, causes sea rise

A more subtle threat to the health of springs involves Earth's changing climate. It is altering rainfall patterns around the globe, threatening the balance that feeds Florida's springs.

In addition, some springs along the coasts are facing an intrusion of salt water, according to the Southwest Florida Water Management District. Four major springs are becoming increasingly brackish because of sea level rise and declining rainfall.

""As a result, freshwater vegetation has a hard time surviving in this saltier environment and unwanted vegetation moves in,"" the district said in a website post.

State laws to protect springs remain stalled

Florida spends billions every year on water quality projects, including about $800 million this year for Everglades restoration work. State funding for springs runs about $50 million a year, according to state documents.

Two state efforts at improving springs' quality, both around a decade old, remain bottled up in court and administrative challenges. One would strengthen rules for permits to draw water from the major springs. The other would enhance rules to reduce the amount of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphates that goes into springs that are considered impaired.

Jones, the former legislator, said lobbying by powerful agricultural interests and related political pressures have blocked progress on the nitrogen reduction plan that was expected to take about 20 years.

""We've burned up almost 10 years and they haven't got on stage one. We got more nitrates now than when we started,"" Jones said.

In Congress, U.S. Rep. Randy Fine recently filed a bill that would create a Florida Springs National Park across several counties, centered around the Ocala National Forest. Fine said in a statement the designation would protect the springs and increase funding. ""Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,"" Fine said.

Bottling companies get cheap permits for water

It costs bottling companies just $115 for a permit allowing them to withdraw millions of gallons of water in perpetuity. But they do pay local taxes.

Blue Triton, the company that bottles Zephyrhills water, pays about $600,000 a year in taxes for things like schools, public safety and so forth, said Spina of the city council.

""They are one of our largest taxpayers,"" he said.

Time grows short to ensure springs survive

Though they have challenges, Florida's freshwater springs have energetic friends, too.

Michelle Jamesson loves the springs; she grew up swimming in one and is determined to help protect them for future generations. She volunteers for SpringsWatch Citizen Science Program, coordinating and working with other volunteers for monthly tests on the Wekiva River, north of Orlando.

They test water quality, take photos of underwater vegetation, count birds and more, seeking to spot any big changes that may require action. The Wekiva is fairly stable, she said, though it carries a lot of excess nutrients.

""The wildlife and the ecology, and all of it — it's so full of life,"" Jamesson said.

Climate change already costs African countries an average of 2% to 5% of GDP, with some spending up to 9% of their budgets on climate disaster responses. By 2030, as many as 118 million of the continent’s poorest people could face the impacts of severe droughts, flooding and extreme heat.

Against this backdrop, the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2) comes at a critical moment. During the gathering, African leaders are expected to advocate for greater influence in global climate decisions, call for fairer funding to respond to climate impacts and demonstrate the continent’s key role as part of the solution — especially through clean energy, carbon capture and locally led resilience.

What to Expect from the Second Africa Climate Summit

Building on the momentum of the inaugural ACS, leaders from across Africa and around the world will gather in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from Sept. 8 to 10, 2025 for the second summit. Convened by the Ethiopian government and the African Union under the theme “Accelerating Global Climate Solutions: Financing for Africa’s Resilient and Green Development,” the event will focus on one of the most pressing challenges in climate diplomacy today: how to fund Africa’s transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future.

Just days before ACS2, the second Africa Climate Week will take place in Addis Ababa from Sept. 1 to 6 under the theme “Dialogues for Ambition and Implementation.” This back-to-back timing is a major opportunity to link the outcomes of Africa Climate Week to the push for action expected at ACS2.

By the end of the ACS2, leaders are expected to sign the Addis Ababa Declaration on Accelerating Climate Action and Finance for Africa’s Green Future. It will outline Africa’s unified position heading into this year’s UN Climate Summit (COP30), in Brazil. The declaration will turn summit priorities into concrete commitments, including expanding renewable energy, advancing green industrialization, sharing technology, building local capacity and enhancing regional cooperation on climate action. It will also reinforce long-standing calls for reforms to global financial systems that shift from debt-heavy models toward grants, concessional funding and partnerships aligned with Africa’s development needs.

4 Key Issues to Watch

With COP30 and the G20 summit on the horizon, ASC2 gives African leaders a pivotal opportunity to unite around a clear plan and push for fairer, more accountable global climate action. Here are four key themes to watch at this year’s summit.

1) Climate Finance: From Aid to Investment

Africa’s climate finance landscape is shifting, but not fast enough. In 2024, climate finance flows grew by 48%, with continent-led funds mobilizing more than $3.5 billion directly into African-led projects and fostering equitable global partnerships.

Still, the gap is vast. African countries need about $3 trillion by 2030 to deliver on their recently updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and the UN estimates $1.3 trillion annually is needed for the continent to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite pledges to double adaptation funding, Africa receives only 20% of global climate adaptation finance, well below the $2.8 trillion required between now and 2030 for the continent to prepare effectively for climate change impacts.

Droughts, floods, wildfires and heat waves are already devastating lives, and the intensity and frequency of these disasters are expected to increase. Lack of adequate finance will exacerbate poverty, food insecurity and reverse development gains — deepening inequality and leaving millions more vulnerable. Without major scale-up in predictable and accessible financing, the world’s most resource-strapped communities will be hit hardest by the worsening impacts of climate change.

Aid alone is no longer enough to meet Africa’s climate and development needs. The continent needs a decisive shift: from aid to fair finance. This must involve channeling larger, more predictable flows of finance toward African enterprises and communities, including blended finance, private capital and risk guarantees. Moving from aid to investment means foreign countries become partners in building a resilient economy in Africa. This type of financing helps not only Africa, but the whole planet, because without major emissions cuts from both wealthy and developing nations alike, the world won't meet its decarbonization goals.

At ACS2, African leaders are expected to set clear goals on climate finance, including making private investment in climate projects less risky; advancing new funding methods like blended finance and payments for ecosystem services that directly benefit communities and local institutions; and developing tools to protect African borrowers from losing money due to currency devaluation.

Uganda assumed the co-chairmanship of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action during the 2025 World Bank and International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings in Washington, D.C. — a development that raises expectations for strong African finance leadership at the summit and a unified push for a shared climate finance agenda. The summit could help reframe climate finance as an investment in global stability and shared prosperity and growth.

2) Africa-Led Climate Solutions

Africa is redefining its path by finding innovative ways to finance nature-based solutions and scale practical initiatives that build both resilience and economic opportunity. Across the continent, communities, innovators and policymakers are driving homegrown approaches — restoring degraded landscapes, deploying solar mini-grids to power rural areas and drawing on indigenous knowledge to strengthen adaptation. Small and medium-sized enterprises already provide 80% of jobs and contribute more than half of GDP — proof that local innovation is one of Africa’s greatest assets.

The Great Green Wall, launched by the African Union in 2007, for example, aims to restore 100 million hectares of degraded landscape across 22 countries. To date, the initiative has mobilized more than $14 billion in funding and commitments. In Kenya, the government is working toward 100% renewable electricity generation and universal energy access by 2030, focusing on solar-powered mini-grids to reach remote communities.

More Local Climate Solutions

Rwanda’s Ireme Invest, launched in 2022, is an investment facility that works with the country’s private sector to support green businesses and strengthen the country’s climate response.

Mission 300, led by the World Bank, African Development Bank and other partners, aims to provide electricity access to 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030, with the goal of ending energy poverty and driving economic growth.

In 2025, the African Union adopted theKampala Declaration, a new agricultural development strategy that aims to increase Africa’s agri-food output by 45% by 2035, transforming food systems as part of a broader food security plan.

The Africa Urban Resilience Programme, launched during the first Africa Urban Forum in September 2024, is mobilizing innovative climate financing to help Africa build resilient cities against climate shocks.

Ethiopia’s Green Legacy and Landscape Restoration Special Fund allocates 0.5% to 1% of its annual federal budget to the long-term efforts to restore degraded landscapes. It's part of the Green Legacy Initiative to boost food security, climate resilience and job creation, which has reportedly planted 40 billion tree seedlings since 2019, helping reverse deforestation rates while creating jobs for women and youth

ACS2 offers a high-level platform to showcase Africa’s most successful homegrown climate solutions — from pioneering renewable energy projects and large-scale land restoration to innovative adaptation strategies. Leaders are expected to highlight these initiatives as proof of Africa’s creativity and leadership in delivering real climate results, as well as creating investment and partnership opportunities.

Selected initiatives will be featured in a flagship report showcasing African-led climate innovations and presenting concrete, scalable solutions that can be replicated across the continent and globally.

By elevating these solutions, ACS2 aims to reshape global narratives — positioning Africa not only as a continent disproportionately affected by climate change, but also as a hub of innovation, resilience and leadership central to solving the world’s climate crisis.

3) Stronger Systems for Climate Action and Unlocking Capital at Scale

To scale up climate action and attract more and better financing, Africa needs new ways to mobilize resources and improve coordination. Country Platforms are emerging as a key tool to achieve this, aligning funding and policies with each country's climate and development priorities. Country Platforms are country-led and bring together development partners around a shared vision, encouraging better coordination and stronger climate and development results.

More than a dozen countries worldwide have launched Country Platforms, and a growing number of African nations are now exploring, designing, updating or putting their own in place. More than just financial tools, Country Platforms represent a new model of African-led partnership — allowing governments to lead their climate and development plans, bring together differente finance partners around national priorities and turn those priorities into projects ready for investment.

The strength of Country Platforms lies in their country-led approach, which brings together governments, the finance sector and other partners to ensure investments match national priorities. When backed by policy reforms, these platforms can help shift climate finance flows from fragmented, donor-driven projects to coordinated, long-term strategies that promote adaptation, build stronger institutions and advance sustainable development.

ACS2 will highlight regional institutions and Country Platforms as critical tools to coordinate climate finance and drive action. The summit will focus on strengthening these institutions to ensure climate efforts have real impact. Civil society is expected to push for greater transparency, accountability and good governance — including building more effective climate finance systems and fundraising; adopting enabling policies; strengthening institutional capacity in areas like trade, innovation, adaptation and resilience; and ensuring youth and marginalized populations are involved in decision-making.

4) Continental Unity in Climate Governance

With major global events coming up this year — including COP30, the G20 summit and the UN General Assembly — Africa must stand together to advocate for a reformed global financial system, better access resource allocation and the recognition that climate change is a matter of justice. This aligns with the African Union’s 2025 theme: “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations.”

ACS2 will encourage African nations to work more closely together, strengthen leadership across borders and connect national efforts within a shared continental vision. By aligning with long-term plans such as Agenda 2063, “The Africa We Want”, the summit aims to support inclusive climate leadership and ensure Africa’s priorities on finance, adaptation and renewable energy are clearly represented and advanced.

The summit will also encourage greater involvement from African communities, especially youth and Indigenous groups, in shaping a climate-resilient future that reflects local needs and experiences. By working together, governments, civil society, youth and the private sector can make sure that Africa’s voice is heard in global climate conversations.

Setting the Stage for Africa’s Future

In the face of growing climate impacts, the stakes are high for Africa — but so are the opportunities. The continent is home to the world’s youngest population, vast renewable resources and holds 30% to 40% of the world’s minerals essential to the green energy transition. With the right partnerships and investment, Africa can accelerate progress toward its climate and development goals.

ACS2 marks a major turning point for Africa, shifting from making promises to taking action. It's a key moment to secure fair, accessible financing, drive green industrial development that adds value to Africa’s resources and reshape the global narrative — recognizing Africa is not just as a victim of climate change, but a leader in solutions. The real test of the summit's success will be whether there's follow-through in accountability, inclusion and real results that improve lives across African communities.

Africa is entering a new chapter, one built on partnerships and agency. Governments, civil society and entrepreneurs are already leading local solutions, while African-led funds are directing finance into projects that reflect the continent's own priorities. Through ASC2, African leaders are amplifying these efforts, attracting investments and urging the world to form fair partnerships that support both Africa and the planet. This summit is a key step toward a more a prosperous future for Africa.",https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/1222x722/s3/2025-08/captura-de-tela-2025-08-29-140834_0.png?VersionId=gbGoa0U7lpuVsC5tTEiQ27KlerbB_RrO&h=4df20b07&itok=IqMDfK6S,N,,2025-08-29 17:02:54.812664

The automaker told employees on August 27 that first- and second-shift production will be paused for one month beginning September 2, the day after Labor Day, and won’t resume until October 6. Production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ will be impacted.

“Factory Zero is making temporary adjustments to production to align to market dynamics,” GM spokesperson Kevin Kelly said in an emailed statement. “General Motors updates schedules as part of our standard process of aligning production to manage vehicle inventory.”

The change will affect around 360 employees, who will be placed on temporary layoff status. GM says these workers may be eligible for subpay and benefits under the GM-UAW national contract.

Factory Zero employs about 4,000 people and was already operating under a temporary second-shift layoff, which will now be extended until October 6. Back in April, GM also cut 200 jobs at the facility, citing slower-than-expected demand for its growing EV lineup, which includes the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV, Sierra EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, and Cadillac Escalade IQ.

Despite these production adjustments, GM sold 46,000 EVs in the U.S. between April and June 2025, its best EV quarter to date, making it the second-largest EV seller behind only Tesla.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It's the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It's the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

Founded over 70 years ago, PPPL leads America’s research into plasma, the electrically charged fourth state of matter, and uses artificial intelligence (AI) and human expertise to advance a number of the nation’s scientific priorities, including bringing commercial fusion energy to the electrical grid, innovating techniques for computer chip fabrication and developing quantum computing and sensing technologies.

Wright visited as a part of his ongoing mission to visit all 17 of the DOE’s national laboratories. He met with leadership from PPPL, Princeton University, DOE and private industry partners. PPPL Director Steven Cowley presented an overview of PPPL’s history, its fusion strategy and the Lab’s efforts to diversify its research portfolio to address national priorities.

During his visit, Wright learned how PPPL is collaborating with venture capital firm SOSV HAX and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to create the NJ HAX Plasma Forge.

He also engaged with leaders from private fusion companies that rely on PPPL for scientific support. They included David Gates from Thea Energy, a company spun out of PPPL research; Cary Forest and Derek Sutherland from Realta Fusion; and Michael Ginsberg, Erik Mårtensson and Laura Zhang from Tokamak Energy.

Solving a grand scientific challenge

Wright also visited PPPL’s National Spherical Torus Experiment-Upgrade (NSTX-U), a fusion device known as a spherical tokamak that allows scientists to determine the best conditions for producing fusion energy, a potentially limitless energy source.

Shaped like an apple with its core removed, NSTX-U is the largest spherical tokamak in the U.S. and is designed to be the most powerful spherical tokamak in the world. Scientists are interested in studying the spherical tokamak concept because these types of compact machines could produce energy more efficiently than conventional, doughnut-shaped tokamaks.

“Forty-three years ago, I went to college to study fusion energy,” Wright said. “It’s an immensely exciting field that I’m still passionate about.”

“NSTX-U is critically important to America’s fusion program,” Cowley said. “It will show the nation and the world how a pilot spherical tokamak fusion plant could lead to commercial fusion.""

“In addition to confining energy more efficiently than typical tokamaks do, compact reactors like NSTX-U could have less massive magnets and be cheaper to build, possibly representing the best design for a commercial fusion power plant,” said Jonathan Menard, deputy director for research.

Wright also met members of PPPL’s apprenticeship program during the stop, learning about the first-in-the-nation apprenticeship in fusion energy and engineering. Andrew Carpe, apprentice program technical administrator, provided an overview of the program, while James Henderson Jr. and Abigail Fellnor, both apprentices, shared their enthusiasm for working at PPPL.

“It is an honor, a privilege and a blessing to work at PPPL,” said Henderson. “I am excited to go to work every day.”

Facilities and partnerships for innovation

At the Fusion Research and Technology Hub test cell, PPPL’s new space for next-generation fusion experiments and technology, Wright learned about its unique infrastructure to support private partners in fusion research.

“We have the scientific know-how and engineering expertise to make new industry ideas a reality,” said Laura Berzak Hopkins, associate laboratory director for strategy and partnerships and deputy chief research officer. “That’s why PPPL is an ideal partner for private companies.”

Wright and his cohort also learned about PPPL’s partnerships with other science-based organizations around the world.

“PPPL collaborates with experimental fusion facilities across the country and globally, accelerating scientific discovery through shared expertise and cutting-edge diagnostics,” said Luis Delgado-Aparicio, head of advanced projects. In one newly approved example, PPPL will deploy an advanced sensor known as a diagnostic on the JT-60SA tokamak in Japan, he said, allowing for unprecedented precision.

Unlocking the mysteries of the universe

At the newly opened Facility for Laboratory Reconnection Experiments (FLARE), Wright learned about PPPL’s efforts to understand magnetic reconnection, when magnetic fields suddenly change shape and release enormous amounts of energy. This new facility is expanding our understanding of solar flares, the aurora borealis and atmospheric disturbances that could damage satellites and power grids. It is also improving our understanding of fusion plasma behavior.

FLARE is a DOE collaborative facility and a national resource where scientists from the Lab, universities and private companies will carry out cutting-edge research and development. In the process, FLARE provides hands-on opportunities and experience for students, interns and apprentices — the leaders of tomorrow.

“FLARE is a one-of-a-kind device designed to probe the physics behind magnetic reconnection, one of the most fundamental, yet still not fully understood phenomena in the universe,” said Erik Gilson, head of discovery plasma science. “And it could only be built here at a national laboratory, where experiments, simulations and theory come together.”

“I’m a strong believer in the national laboratories, not just for the practical applications of their research, but also because of the basic science they conduct,” Wright said. “To me, doing basic science and trying to understand how the cosmos works is part of what it means to be human. I also believe that funding basic science is absolutely essential, and, therefore, a fundamental mission of the government.”

Diamond-based materials for quantum computing and sensing

During his visit, Wright turned on a quantum reactor, ushering in phase two of operations at the Quantum Diamond Laboratory (QDL), which opened in 2024.

QDL allows scientists to study and refine the processes involved in using plasma to create high-quality diamond material for quantum information science applications.

Wright and his team were greeted by Emily Carter, associate laboratory director for AMSS, who gave the secretary an overview of efforts to diversify the Lab’s research portfolio. Wright also met with Alastair Stacey, head of quantum materials and devices at PPPL and one of the world’s leading quantum diamond experts, and Kiran Kumar Kovi, a staff research physicist.

Scientists worldwide are exploring quantum diamond as a potential material for making faster computer chips and sensors that work with unparalleled accuracy, even in extreme environments.

“In QDL, we’re growing pieces of diamond especially modified for new quantum technologies such as sensors that can be used in personalized medicine and future quantum computers,” Stacey said. “We’re also exploring how diamond-based materials can augment silicon in next-generation microchips that will support everything from personal laptops to the national defense systems keeping the nation safe.

“By leading the way in this space, we are helping the U.S. maintain leadership in high-performance computing and quantum material development.”

Driving scientific discovery

Wright also learned about new efforts at PPPL to advance fusion research by harnessing high-powered computing and AI.

He met the Lab’s leading AI experts and students, including Shantenu Jha, head of computational sciences; Michael Churchill, head of digital engineering; and Egemen Kolemen, a staff research physicist.

The researchers explained how PPPL develops the artificially intelligent and traditional computer codes needed to solve fundamental plasma science problems.

“Here at PPPL, we develop the computer codes that advance a range of plasma science fields and refine commercial fusion reactor design,” Jha said. “With breakthroughs in theory, control systems and diagnostics, fusion is no longer guesswork. Our models and simulations, increasingly infused with the transformative potential of artificial intelligence, can predict plasma behavior with confidence, allowing us to improve our designs for fusion power plants without building costly prototypes.”

“I think using AI to control plasma instabilities and help find the optimal geometries for fusion devices will be the extra enabler that will make fusion energy work,” Wright said. “But not only that, AI will also help us design and build commercial fusion power plants by showing us the most practical, cost-effective approaches.”

Wright also toured the construction site of PPPL’s upcoming Princeton Plasma Innovation Center (PPIC), the Lab’s first new building in decades, and signed one of the steel beams that will be used in the building’s construction.

Encompassing 71,000 square feet, this state-of-the-art facility will serve as an international hub of fusion research, incorporating three of the Lab’s strengths: computation, engineering and advanced materials research.

At the end of the visit, Wright joined Cowley for a talk, addressing a packed auditorium of PPPL staff members.

They discussed DOE’s vision for the future of energy and innovation, from advancing fusion as a firm energy source to securing U.S. leadership in AI and quantum technologies. They also highlighted the critical role national laboratories play in advancing these priorities and strengthening America’s competitiveness.

“Thanks to all of you for working at this facility,” Wright said. “You’re doing incredible science with great people, and you’re going to change the world.”",https://www.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale_1440/public/images/2025/08/20250820_SecretaryWright_ML_003.jpg?itok=kEbpLp30,N,,2025-08-29 16:04:31.085650

These were soon consolidated into one agency and the Environmental Protection Agency was created.
Similarly, policies such as the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act allow for the EPA to regulate our biggest polluters and ensure that we have clean air and water.
The EPA concluded that emissions from new motor vehicles contributed to this pollution, justifying regulation under the Clean Air Act.
This would deliberately undermine the EPA’s own power to regulate for clean air and clean water for us all.","The Foundation of Environmental Policy

As the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, comes under increasing attack from a U.S government that does not value clean air, clean water, caring for the environment or even acknowledging the indisputable reality of climate change – it’s a good moment to look back and explore why a functioning EPA touches all of our lives, both here in the U.S and abroad.

The EPA has been the biggest player guiding environmental policy in the U.S, since it was formed in 1970, under the leadership of Republican President Richard Nixon, just a few months after the very first Earth Day on April 22, 1970. Seeing 20 million Americans marching in the streets demanding action on the terrible smog choking cities across the country and filthy water ways, proved people cared about these issues. Nixon was decisive and the EPA was born with bi-partisan support. Suddenly ‘the concept of quality of life’ took hold.

But the EPA’s reach is global. It advises not just the United States, but also plays a pivotal role in world environmental policy and its leadership was until recently a guiding light on all United Nations Environmental Programme negotiations.

Rachel Carson

Prior to the 1960s, environmental protection wasn’t a widely talked about issue among the American public or any public for that matter.

This changed when the 1962 bombshell book Silent Spring by Rachel Carson was published. The book critiqued the widespread use of the pesticide DDT, which had been relatively new at the time. Invented in 1939, DDT is an incredibly powerful pesticide that was created to kill malaria carrying insects to protect troops during World War II. It hit the shelves for consumers in 1945.

The problem with DDT is that it accumulates in the tissues of wildlife and humans alike, disrupting hormones and causing reproductive problems, developmental issues, and increased risk of cancer. It is particularly harmful to birds, leading to thinning eggshells and population declines. Carson’s book foresaw a future with no songbirds due to the impact of DDT and it shocked people into starting to care.

Up until then, very few people had sounded the alarm about its negative effects of DDT, and those who did, were not taken seriously. In effect their warnings were regarded as ‘fake news’. It was only after being denied an article in Reader’s Digest to discuss the results of testing and the harmful effects of DDT, that Carson decided to write her seminal book detailing her findings.

The book discussed how DDT had entered the food and water supply chain by way of runoff and bio-magnification, wherein chemicals increase in concentration in each organism as the food chain rises. As well as this she explained bioaccumulation – a process that means as each animal eats food contaminated with DDT – it builds up inside them over time. Carson brought these concepts up to the public and compelled them to care for the very first time.

This, combined with disasters such as the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill that killed countless marine animals and seabirds forced the average American to be much more aware of environmental issues than ever before. This reached a fever pitch on Earth Day in 1970, which saw President Nixon finally unveil a comprehensive environmental plan to tackle oil spills, invest in environmental research, set limits for emissions to guarantee good air quality and new rules around clean water. These were soon consolidated into one agency and the Environmental Protection Agency was created.

Landmark Policy & Global Influence

In 1972, ten years after Silent Spring was first published, the EPA banned the use of DDT. Thanks to those efforts, the presence of DDT in wildlife, domestic animals and our water ways has decreased, but the effects of DDT still linger and it is important to continue to advocate for banning it globally.

While the EPA helped negotiate and signed the Stockholm Treaty on POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants, like DDT), it is still used in some countries in Africa to combat malaria. Harm reduction is the goal, both from pollutants and the disease carrying insects DDT kills, so having many advisory voices, which includes experts from the EPA, is key. As the EPA comes under domestic attack, its global influence will wane.

The Hudson River Poisoning

In 1976, public concern was sparked again by the discovery of chemical pollution in New York’s Hudson River. PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) are industrial chemicals once widely used in electrical equipment, paints, and pesticides, known for their toxicity and environmental persistence.

It was revealed that from 1947 to 1977, General Electric’s manufacturing plants at Hudson Falls and Fort Edward discharged over a million pounds of PCBs into the Hudson River. To this day, PCB-contaminated sediments in the riverbed continue to leach PCBs into the water through processes like desorption, resuspension, and groundwater seepage. Meanwhile, in Michigan, PCB-laced cattle feed poisoned cows, further raising public alarm.

The EPA was able to take direct action through the Toxic Substances Control Act, which gave them the authority to require testing, reporting, and set guidelines for toxic substances. This policy still stands today and keeps people, wildlife, farm animals, and the environment safer from reckless use of harmful chemicals and discharges from industrial complexes. Without the EPA and this sort of power we would all be at risk of more exposure to toxic chemicals.

Similarly, policies such as the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act allow for the EPA to regulate our biggest polluters and ensure that we have clean air and water.

How Growing EPA Responsibilities Strengthened Our Protection

Following the Toxic Substances Control Act’s passing, it became clear that a fund was needed to pay for cleanups following toxic chemical spills.

In 1980, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as ‘Superfund’. This gives the EPA the resources and authority to lead cleanup efforts in the event of oil spills, and industrial chemical discharges. As well dealing with disasters that do not typically come to mind when we think of environmental events, such as efforts to clean up the aftermath of 9/11, where the EPA coordinated hazardous material removal at Ground Zero, and responses to anthrax poisoning attempts.

The Power and Importance of the Endangerment Finding

Building on its critically important role in addressing industrial pollutants and environmental disasters through programs like Superfund, the EPA also began tackling emerging challenges related to air quality and climate change.

In 2009, the EPA published the seminal Endangerment Finding, which asserted that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, threaten our present and future wellbeing. That is because carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are scientifically proven greenhouse gases that unequivocally drive climate change, this is an established fact, not a matter of belief.

The Endangerment Finding followed the 2007 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which ruled that greenhouse gases are air pollutants covered by the Clean Air Act, thereby granting the EPA the authority to regulate them.

The 2007 court directed the EPA to determine whether scientific research supported the claim that greenhouse gas emissions from cars and other vehicles harm public health.

The EPA gathered evidence that included peer-reviewed assessments from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the U.S. Global Change Research Program, and the National Research Council, compiling thousands of studies demonstrating the multiple harmful impacts of GHGs such as causing rising sea levels, increased frequency and severity of extreme weather, degraded air quality, and negative effects on agriculture and ecosystems.

The EPA concluded that emissions from new motor vehicles contributed to this pollution, justifying regulation under the Clean Air Act. With this evidence, the EPA issued the Endangerment Finding in 2009, empowering the agency to regulate greenhouse gases as a watchdog. This Finding has been upheld in court and serves as the foundation for numerous greenhouse gas regulations

Protecting the Public Health From Administrator Lee Zeldin

The policies the EPA has passed have made all of our lives better,every single day. But the work and the authority of the EPA are under attack from the present U.S Administration.

Just last month, July 28, 2025, the EPA’s own Administer Lee Zeldin, a lawyer not a scientist, proposed repealing the Endangerment Finding. This would deliberately undermine the EPA’s own power to regulate for clean air and clean water for us all. Two critically important issues in keeping the American public safe and healthy.

We need your help in letting him know that this is not acceptable.Your children deserve to breathe air unpolluted by greenhouse gasses, have a government actively fighting climate change and trying to diminish extreme weather events, and ensure you are drinking clean, chemical free water. These are basic human rights and they are not negotiable.

You can write directly to Administer Zeldin here to demand he walk back this harmful plan.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections.
Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/preview-2121.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 16:06:24.949292

Founded in 2011, PosiGen grew by marketing solar systems to low-income households, relying heavily on state and federal incentives.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had visited PosiGen’s St. Rose headquarters in 2023 to highlight those same credits as central to the Biden administration’s clean energy agenda.
“This news is very bleak,” said Troy von Otnott, a local expert in solar energy.
At the end of the day, these are not just clean energy jobs.","NEW ORLEANS – Louisiana-based solar installer PosiGen has announced 166 layoffs in St. Charles and Jefferson parishes and warned that another 92 Louisiana employees could be cut within two weeks if new funding or a buyer is not secured. The company is shutting down most of its operations after financial troubles tied to the rollback of federal solar tax credits.

Founded in 2011, PosiGen grew by marketing solar systems to low-income households, relying heavily on state and federal incentives. At its peak, the company installed nearly 30,000 systems in 15 states under a 20-year lease model requiring no upfront payments or credit checks. Backed by a $200 million investment from Brookfield Asset Management — bringing its total stake since 2023 to $600 million — PosiGen expanded rapidly but became vulnerable when it defaulted on a credit line in August after struggling to raise long-term capital.

The collapse follows the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which rolls back provisions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act by ending the 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit in 2025 and phasing out the Commercial Clean Energy Investment Credit by 2027. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had visited PosiGen’s St. Rose headquarters in 2023 to highlight those same credits as central to the Biden administration’s clean energy agenda.

Industry groups warn PosiGen’s downfall is not an isolated case. Renewable energy firms across the Gulf South and beyond — including electricians, manufacturers, engineers and installers — expanded to meet demand under the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax framework. With those incentives now being rolled back, many face the same “credit cliff” that undermined PosiGen, raising concerns about widespread job losses and stalled projects.

“This news is very bleak,” said Troy von Otnott, a local expert in solar energy. Von Otnott was among the early advocates for Louisiana’s renewable-energy incentives in 2007 and 2008, a period that set the stage for residential solar growth in New Orleans. He co-founded South Coast Solar in 2007, helping establish one of the city’s first large-scale residential solar companies during the post-Katrina rebuilding years. Today, von Otnott spends most of his time as CEO of HotRok Energy, where he is focused on advancing clean-energy solutions through geothermal technology. He also operates Massive Technologies, a consulting firm.

“The biggest problem with the Trump administration’s attempt to negatively impact the solar industry is that the EPA Solar for All Grant Competition was already approved and funded by the federal government,” said von Otnott, referring to the program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund created by the Inflation Reduction Act. “Private businesses took those commitments to heart and increased staffing and spent money to prepare for the program. This type of behavior by the President of the United States freezes financial investment in renewable industries.”

Von Otnott said investors will pull out of these industries in the U.S. “The Trump administration has effectively created mayhem in this industry. Most solar developers I know have already cut jobs and have stopped work and their future looks very bleak.”

“These types of actions betray the American worker. At the end of the day, these are not just clean energy jobs. They are jobs,” said von Otnott. “And these jobs are filled by our fellow neighbors who are engineers, installers, designers and financiers and now they will have to find other opportunities outside renewable energy which may not be available in the impending economic downturn.”",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/08/PosiGen-Cuts-166-Signaling-Solar-Industry-Decline.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 15:07:11.240993

The projects that will no longer receive funding are located off the coasts of 10 states, including California, which will no longer receive Transportation Department money for two wind farms off the coast of Humboldt County.
“The Trump administration is raising alarms about rising energy prices while blocking new supply from reaching the grid,” the Clean Power Association wrote last week about the stop-work order the Trump administration issued for Revolution Wind.","WASHINGTON — One week after President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that he planned to end federal approvals for electricity generated from wind and solar, the U.S. Transportation Department is making good on his promise. On Friday, the agency announced it will end $679 million in funding for 12 offshore wind projects.

“Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement Friday.

Provided through the Transportation Department's Maritime Administration, the rescinded funds will be redirected toward American shipbuilding, port upgrades and “other core infrastructure needs of the United States,” he said.

Trump has made no secret of his disdain for electricity generated from renewables, especially wind, calling it “very ugly” and “the scam of the century.” The One Big Beautiful Bill Act he signed in July shortened the window for wind and solar projects to quality for tax credits enacted during the Biden administration.

On Friday, Duffy said the offshore wind grants and project selections made during Biden's presidency were not aligned with the priorities of the Trump administration.

The projects that will no longer receive funding are located off the coasts of 10 states, including California, which will no longer receive Transportation Department money for two wind farms off the coast of Humboldt County. One of the California projects was expected to provide enough electricity for up to 1.5 million homes once completed and had been slated to receive $427 million from the Maritime Administration.

Other wind projects that will no longer receive federal funding include the Sparrows Point Steel Marshalling Port Project off the coast of Maryland, the Bridgeport Port Authority Operations and Maintenance Wind Port Project off the coast of Connecticut, the Wind Port at Paulsboro off the coast of New Jersey and the Arthur Kill Terminal off the west shore of Staten Island, New York, as well as projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Rhode Island.

Last week, Trump terminated construction of another wind project off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut despite 45 of the project’s 65 turbines having already been installed. Once completed, Revolution Wind was expected to generate enough energy to power more than 350,000 homes.

“The Trump administration is raising alarms about rising energy prices while blocking new supply from reaching the grid,” the Clean Power Association wrote last week about the stop-work order the Trump administration issued for Revolution Wind.

Wind and solar energy accounted for 93% of new electricity added to the power grid in 2024, according to the Clean Power Association.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said it expects increases in electricity prices to outpace inflation through 2026 because of increased demand and utility investments in upgrading electricity infrastructure.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/offshore_wind-1,N,,2025-08-29 16:05:34.753043

“Texas’ reliable energy producers continue to prove that fossil fuel production and a clean environment can coexist. By embracing innovation and industry-driven solutions – not heavy-handed federal mandates – our state is reducing emissions while continuing to fuel America with reliable energy. As the nation’s largest producer of oil and gas, this milestone shows that we can produce affordable, reliable energy and achieve real environmental progress—without sacrificing jobs or energy security.”

“For years, radical environmentalists and the mainstream media used out-of-context flaring images, from the Permian basin, to scare average Americans and Wall Street. This fueled the false narrative of Net Zero and gave rise to ESG, which stifled oil and gas investment and left Americans with expensive and unreliable power. Thankfully, the Trump Administration has reversed Biden’s Green New Deal Agenda and prioritized increased U.S. oil and gas production.”

Background: In 2020, Christian convened a Blue Ribbon Task Force to prioritize reducing flaring and improving environmental outcomes while maintaining Texas’ role as the nation’s energy leader. The Task Force developed a comprehensive report with recommendations to minimize flaring, streamline regulatory processes, and increase transparency. Its work emphasized the importance of capturing natural gas that would otherwise be flared, leveraging new technology, and ensuring regulatory certainty to promote both economic recovery and environmental progress.

Under Christian’s leadership, Texas has achieved historic declines in flaring through improved infrastructure, better reporting, and voluntary industry action. The flaring rate in Texas dropped by 63 percent from June 2019 to May 2025. The monthly rates have consistently been below one percent, meaning more than 99% of natural gas produced in Texas is being beneficially used.

Sure, they typically sell for 14% to 18% more than the average gas car. And, yeah, when parts break, they're generally 30% more expensive to repair (depending on who you ask). Oh, then there's the sky-high depreciation cost to factor in.

A new study shows that EV owners are also getting hosed on insurance costs, too.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and tech in the automotive space. Also on deck: the gasoline-only era of the Nissan GT-R is dead and we learn just how much electricity China's EV charging network uses. Let's jump in.

30%: EVs Cost 49% More To Insure Than Gas Cars

Photo by: IIHS

A new study from Insurify published this month shows that EV drivers, on average, pay 49% higher premiums than those who drive internal-combustion cars.

The data revealed that the average annual premium for EVs nationwide is $3,442, or around $286 per month. Gas cars? Try $193. That's $1,122 extra per year, or enough for a Tesla Model 3 owner to cover their annual driving while charging exclusively at Superchargers.

If you're wondering why a car with fewer moving parts somehow costs more to cover, it comes down to a trifecta of insurance paranoia: Repair costs, repair time and the price of a total loss.

Insurify explains:

Insurers base prices on risk, and insuring a car that’s more expensive to repair or replace adds to the company’s financial risk.

EVs cost 22% more to repair than gas-powered cars, according to Mitchell’s May EV Collision Insights report. The average price of a new EV was $57,734 in June, while the average for gas-powered vehicles was $48,799, according to KBB. In the event of a total loss, insurers could pay an average of 18% more to replace an EV.

EVs require more mechanical labor hours as well: 3.04 hours vs. 1.66 for gas-powered cars, Mitchell reported last year. Because many EVs require original manufacturer parts, mechanics can’t pull from a vast inventory of aftermarket and recycled parts, which often lowers repair costs for gas-powered cars, according to KBB.

Many newer cars, not just EVs, have technology that makes them more expensive to insure and repair. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) often include multiple sensors and cameras and are vulnerable to even minor collision damage.

In short? EVs are packed with pricey battery packs and expensive electronics. A fender bender that might cost you $2,500 to fix in a Toyota Corolla could quickly balloon to well over $20,000 if your EV battery pack happens to be compromised.

Then there's labor. Not every shop is certified (or willing) to work on EVs. According to Insurify's reporting, this has led to a shortage of trained techs who can adequately wrench on EVs safely. Not to mention the net of expensive EV-specific tools and diagnostic systems needed to service these software-centric cars.

Unsurprisingly, Tesla's EVs take top place on the most expensive EVs to insure. The Model X is the winner (or loser?) as the most expensive EV to insure at an average of $4,765 per year. And in some states, the data shows insurance premiums for EVs cost 75% or more than the equivalent gas-powered counterpart.

Insurance Costs by EV Model vs. Their Gas Counterparts

The potentially good news is that the industry pinky-promises that this trend is temporary. It's all reliant on adoption, according to the experts. As more people buy EVs, you get better economies of scale when it comes to battery costs, parts, and skilled labor. Eventually—hopefully—insurance prices will normalize, but it might take a while to get there.

So, yes, EVs are cleaner and quieter and quicker. But until some areas of the auto industry catch up, they're definitely not cheaper—at least not in the parts or insurance department.

60%: The Gasoline-Only Era Of The Nissan GT-R Is Officially Dead

The GT-R has always been Nissan's halo car. Its gas-guzzling, turbo-whistling sports coupe was more of a show of strength against other marques than a practical vehicle. But after nearly eighteen years (and four CEOs), the car has lost the spark that drove enthusiasts with deep pockets to the platform. It's time for a transformation.

Nissan has now officially killed off the R35 GT-R. The very last model, a Midnight Purple Premium Edition T-Spec, rolled off the line with Nissan's new CEO Ivan Espinosa (who Nissan wants you to know is a ""real car guy"") at the helm. And with it marks the end of the gasoline-only era of the GT-R.

""To the many fans of the GT-R worldwide, I want to tell you this isn’t a goodbye to the GT-R forever, it’s our goal for the GT-R nameplate to one day make a return,"" said Espinosa in a statement on the R35's retirement. He continued:

“We understand the expectations are high, the GT-R badge is not something that can be applied to just any vehicle; it is reserved for something truly special and the R35 set the bar high. So, all I can ask is for your patience.""

While Nissan doesn't have a precise plan, we do know a little bit of what to expect thanks to some loose lips at the 2025 New York Auto Show. Back in April, Nissan's North American Chief Planning Officer, Ponz Pandikuthira, told The Drive that the next-gen GT-R was getting a powerplant with a battery. However, it wouldn't be fully electrified.

Here's what Pandikuthira told The Drive:

Pandikuthira said Nissan built some electric prototypes for the next-gen GT-R, but “basically it’s like it would complete one lap at the Nürburgring, and then you have to recharge the car. And then that charging is going to take you a while, and it’s just not authentic.”

“You just built a thing to check that box that you have a GT-R, but it’s not really a GT-R,” Pandikuthira said. “No, electric, I don’t think you’ll deliver with the technology that we have now, or even with solid state, the kind of performance that’s expected out of a GT-R.”

[...]

Pandikuthira elaborated on the upcoming next-gen battery technology, noting that “it might be alright for other electric cars that you could do that are the cruising around need to be seen at a country club, but the ultimate raw performance GT-R as an electric car, that’s really quite a ways away.”

The executive continued to note that solid-state batteries will be the ""key enabler"" to make the GT-R exactly what Nissan wants out of the R36. What isn't clear is how those batteries will be used.

While a full BEV is out of the question, Nissan has apparently been kicking around the pros and cons of mild and plug-in hybrids for the platform. PHEVs add a lot of additional weight, but they potentially meet Pandikuthira's architectural checklist for the next-gen platform: 70 miles of all-electric range, a small (30-kilowatt-hour) battery, plus, a mesh of practicality and track-focused foolery available at the driver's right foot.

The plan was (at least back in April) to give the car a two-turbocharged V6 plus a to-be-decided hybrid component comprised of a solid-state battery pack. But as Espinosa clarified in the R35 GT-R's sendoff:

""While we don’t have a precise plan finalized today, the GT-R will evolve and reemerge in the future.”

Pandikuthira says to expect the GT-R to hit the streets in ""three to five"" years. That's coincidentally just enough time for Nissan to start pumping out its solid-state battery packs in 2028.

90%: Here's How Much Electricity China's EV Charging Networks Use Every Month

Photo by: Electra

China is the EV capital of the world. It produces and consumes the most plug-in vehicles on the planet, which means that it chews through a lot of juice to cover its transportation needs. Have you ever wondered just how much?

Well, now we know. On Tuesday, China's National Energy Administration told the world that China's robust EV charging network delivered 7.7 terawatt-hours of electricity to vehicles in July. Yes, terawatt-hours.

That's kind of hard to picture on its own, so let's break down exactly how much electricity that really is.

Tesla's North American Megafactory, for example, can pump out around 40 gigawatt-hours of battery storage each year. China's consumption is 192 times that amount in just a single month.

Or, maybe it's easier to understand how many miles a car could drive on that amount of electricity. Tesla's latest Model 3 achieves around 4.5 miles per kilowatt-hour of efficiency. That's enough electricity for a single Model 3 to drive 1.7 billion miles, or every single car Tesla has ever sold to drive around 1,000 miles.

China has around 25.5 million battery-electric cars on the road. That means that it dispersed an average of around 300 kWh of electricity per vehicle via the charging network in July, not counting PHEVs. The NEA says that China currently has around 16.7 million EV chargers across the country, or roughly two chargers for every five New Energy Vehicles (which includes PHEVs) on the road.

From Car News China:

This growth is reflected in the latest data: the total number of EV charging infrastructure units (charging piles) reached 16.696 million by the end of July 2025, a tenfold increase compared to 2020.

The first seven months of 2025 alone saw an addition of 3.878 million charging units, a 93.2% year-on-year increase. Public charging facilities grew by 623,000 units (up 28.9%), while private charging facilities surged by 3.255 million units (up 113.6%). The charger-to-new energy vehicle increment ratio stands at 1:1.8, indicating that infrastructure development is keeping pace with the growth of EV sales, which reached 6.913 million units domestically during the same period.

The surge in EV adoption has also driven a significant increase in electricity consumption. According to Du Zhongming, Director of the NEA Electricity Department, quoted by Chinese media CNR, electricity consumption for EV charging and swapping services grew by over 40% in the first seven months of this year. In July 2025 alone, national charging electricity consumption reached approximately 7.71 billion kWh, an increase of 1.0 billion kWh from the previous month, marking a 53.9% year-on-year and 14.9% month-on-month growth. This electricity primarily served buses and passenger vehicles, with sanitation/logistics vehicles and taxis accounting for a smaller share.

You have to admit that these are some pretty insane statistics. 7.7 Terawatt-hours is as much electricity as the State of New York imported from Canada in all of 2024. China did that in just a month and used it only to charge its cars.

It goes to show you that no matter how much the U.S. is cheering on its charging network, its growth is nowhere near as robust as China's. Maybe one day we'll get to two chargers for every five cars, but today, we'll have to settle for one charger for every 18 BEVs.

100%: Are Enthusiasts Becoming More Welcoming Of Hybrids?

Photo by: Toyota

Hybrids used to be this silent joke in the car community. Laughing at folks behind the wheel of a boring car like a Toyota Prius, or smirking to know that someone had a car powered by a battery. But plug-in cars have quickly become more normal and in some cases, even more appealing from a performance perspective.

With the Nissan GT-R headed that way, it could be a pivotal moment for the enthusiast crowd who crave instant acceleration, but still want a throaty exhaust tone and turbo whistle (even if it's just by throwing some bolt-ons into the engine bay). Car people might actually consider a hybrid as a future classic—that's really hard to picture.

Sheetz in York County on Route 30 along I-83 (Exit 21)

“Our stores are already the ultimate one-stop-shop for travelers – offering fresh food, clean facilities and dependable convenience whenever they need it,” Trevor Walter, Sheetz EVP of Petroleum Supply Management said. “We are bringing that same convenience to drivers of electric vehicles across Pennsylvania. Partnering with PennDOT through the NEVI program gives us the ability to grow our network faster, by adding charging options at even more stores our customers already know and love.”

According to PennDOT, the 19 stations opened under the NEVI program represent more than $10.5 million in federal investments.

Making solar permitting quicker and simpler can have a big impact. An analysis by Brown University’s Climate Solutions Lab found that if Texas authorities or approved third parties used automated permitting software such as SolarApp+, it could reduce the cost of rooftop solar systems in the state by $2,100 in 2030 and $4,900 by 2040, and save families over $3,500 a year on their utility bills.

Battery and electric vehicle manufacturers are continuing to move or expand production in Illinois, with several new announcements made this summer.

A 100% solar-powered manufacturing plant for solar and EV components opened in an underserved area of Southern Illinois this week, bolstered by a $4.6 million clean-energy state-incentive package.

Manner Polymers will produce all of the electricity it uses, said the company’s CEO Raj Bhargava.

“Our objective is to build the lowest cost, highest quality, most environmentally sustainable flexible PVC compounding plant in the world,” Bhargava said.

The Manner Polymers manufacturing facility was bolstered by the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois (REV Illinois) incentive package, while Manner Polymers invested $54 million to support the facility’s construction.

REV Illinois provides tax credits to businesses that will support the development and growth of electric vehicles and other products essential to the renewable energy sector. Illinois provides additional benefits through REV for clean energy and advanced manufacturing investments made in underserved or energy transition areas.

“Manner Polymers plant will help maximize the manufacturing potential and accelerate the clean energy revolution that is taking place,” Gov. JB Pritzker said at the facility’s ribbon cutting. “These are gains that are going to be felt by the state of Illinois in a variety of sectors.”

At the ribbon cutting, Gov. Pritzker thanked Republican Sen. Dale Fowler for helping to bring business to the state.

Richardson’s Electronics

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who attended the facility’s ribbon cutting, also recently announced the another REV Illinois investment, with which Richardson Electronics will invest $8.5 million to research, develop and produce next-generation battery energy storage technologies at the company’s Illinois manufacturing facility.

As part of the state’s incentive package, Richardson Electronics was awarded a $8.6 million REV Illinois tax credit for their capital investment and commitment to job creation. In addition to targeting 54 new jobs, the REV agreement also specifies the retention of 190 jobs for the entirety of the four-year agreement period.

According to Pritzker’s office, Richardson Electronics’ decision to expand their operations within Illinois builds upon the numerous manufacturing companies that have also recently chosen to establish or expand their business in the state.

Pure Lithium

In July, Illinois awarded Pure Lithium with $4.4 million in REV incentives for investing $46 million to move from Boston to Chicago. After completing its initial start-up phase in Boston, the entire operation is relocating to Illinois and expanding to include production and manufacturing.

Pure Lithium said the move puts it closer to Argonne National Laboratory. Pure Lithium and Argonne are currently collaborating on a project to scale lithium metal anode production using recycled lithium metal, with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Pure Lithium said its investment will enable the company to manufacture the first commercially viable lithium metal battery in Illinois, with plans to target the drone and defense, consumer electronics, grid-scale energy storage systems and electric vehicle markets, while supporting the state’s clean energy economy.

After exploring options in different cities and states, Pure Lithium said it decided Illinois provides the best opportunities to achieve its goal of commercialization.

Of this money, more than three-quarters was awarded to natural gas companies for carbon sequestration or electrification projects to reduce those companies' net carbon outputs, according to government data.
Critics have argued that this amounts to greenwashing, diverting funds that were supposed to be used to develop cleaner energy solutions into subsidies for heavily polluting, and highly profitable, gas companies.

""The bottom line is wealthy fossil fuel billionaires do not need money back from the B.C. government to continue to subsidize an industry that's bad for our health,"" said Melissa Lem, president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment.

What's happening?

The CleanBC Industry fund claims that it supports ""new industry projects that will create local jobs, strengthen local communities, and grow British Columbia's clean industry,"" according to a government website.

However, critics have pointed out that most of the funding, which comes from a tax on carbon pollution, has gone back to the same heavily polluting companies that the funding was supposed to help phase out.

""It's like taxing tobacco producers and then giving them the money back to put filters on their cigarettes,"" said Lem, per Canada's National Observer.

During 2024, 37 different projects received 127.7 million Canadian dollars ($93.3 million) in funding from the CleanBC Industry fund. Of this money, more than three-quarters was awarded to natural gas companies for carbon sequestration or electrification projects to reduce those companies' net carbon outputs, according to government data.

Critics have argued that this amounts to greenwashing, diverting funds that were supposed to be used to develop cleaner energy solutions into subsidies for heavily polluting, and highly profitable, gas companies.

""It's a form of subsidy to some pretty profitable industries that really should be able to stand on their own two feet and do this work,"" said Jeremy Valeriote, leader of the BC Green Party.

While acknowledging that the projects do reduce the amount of heat-trapping pollution being released at various facilities, Valeriote argued that the funds could have a bigger impact if spent elsewhere.

""It could go a long way to make a tangible difference in people's lives that also drives down emissions like public transit and building retrofits that could help rebuild [public] support for climate action,"" he said, per the publication.

Lem agreed.

""Essentially, investing in our health care system and the health of people across B.C. has to come before industry handouts, and that can also mean investing in and subsidizing renewable energy, not more fracking and LNG [projects],"" she said, referring to liquified natural gas.

Why does it matter?

According to the United Nations, 75% of all heat-trapping pollution and 90% of all carbon dioxide pollution comes from the burning of extracted, nonrenewable fuels such as natural gas and coal.

Additionally, burning these fuels releases health-harming pollution that can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular ailments, lung cancer, diabetes, and more, according to the U.N.

Therefore, in order to reverse the trend of rising global temperatures and improve public health, it is necessary to transition economies away from these fuels and toward cleaner, renewable sources such as solar.

As governments around the world search for ways to accelerate and streamline these changes, one popular solution has been carbon taxes.

By placing a price on pollution, a carbon tax forces companies to internalize the costs of the pollution they create. Such a tax, in theory, can also generate revenue that can be used to boost environmentally friendly solutions such as public transportation or renewable energy power plants.

However, the controversy surrounding the CleanBC Industry fund has highlighted that, in practice, these programs require transparency and strong oversight to ensure the funding is directed to appropriate projects and is not used to subsidize the same polluting industries that are paying the taxes.

What's being done about it?

By calling out what they see as the misallocation of CleanBC Industry fund dollars, groups such as the BC Greens and Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment are seeking to hold the government accountable.

To engage in similar advocacy and push for these kinds of programs in your area, you can use your voice, contact your elected representatives, and support planet-friendly candidates.

Going a step further, driving an electric vehicle and installing solar panels on your home will save you money on gas and electricity while also reducing heat-trapping, health-harming pollution.

With federal tax credits for EVs ending Sept. 30 and credits for home solar ending Dec. 31, it's important to act soon if you want to take advantage. Solar systems can take up to 12 weeks to be permitted and installed, but EnergySage has a great, Expedia-like tool for comparing local quotes and companies that's worth exploring.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CleanBC-Industry-fundimage-recV3lanDUGzgoTcc.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 19:04:55.209661

Sign up to get it every Friday.

President Donald Trump has put energy front and center during his second term. On his first day in office alone, he froze spending under the Inflation Reduction Act, took a wrecking ball to offshore wind, and declared an ​“energy emergency,” citing affordability and grid reliability issues.

Critics have dismissed the emergency as a fabrication. Attorneys general from 15 states are challenging it in court. And Trump, whose policies are slowing the construction of cheap, clean energy, is not exactly acting like there’s an emergency at hand.

Take the Revolution Wind project as the latest example. Last Friday, the Trump administration ordered developer Ørsted to stop all construction on the huge, nearly complete project, citing unspecified ​“national security” reasons. It’s the second time the government has issued such an order to an offshore wind project that would’ve brought clean power to the Northeast.

The stoppage poses a real threat to the grid in New England, which is home to some of the highest power prices in the nation.

Revolution Wind was supposed to start delivering power next year — very soon in grid-planning terms. ISO-New England, the region’s grid operator, said Monday that it is banking on the wind farm to help meet demand and maintain power reserves. Further delays will continue the region’s reliance on natural gas, which ISO-New England has warned is in short supply and which is subject to price volatility.

Blocking major energy projects from coming online is not exactly consistent with declaring an energy emergency.

And yet, the Revolution Wind pause is just one example of how the administration is stymieing clean energy deployment. In recent months, it has rolled back federal subsidies and grants and implemented new federal leasing rules under which renewables are doomed to fail. Because of these policies, the country is expected to build less than half as much clean energy over the next decade — an outcome experts widely agree will raise power prices.

In fact, the only place the administration has acted as if its emergency is real is when it comes to preserving fossil-fuel power plants on the brink of closure.

The U.S. Department of Energy recently extended its emergency order barring a Michigan coal plant from retiring — a decision that cost the plant’s owner $29 million in its first five weeks. And on Thursday, the DOE extended another order keeping a Pennsylvania gas- and oil-fired peaker plant online. Regional grid operators had previously deemed both plants safe to close.

The moves reveal the incoherence at the heart of Trump’s energy policy, which exploits a questionable emergency to prop up expensive and unnecessary fossil-fueled power plants on the one hand — and blocks the fastest-growing and lowest-cost form of energy on the other.

Clean energy is getting its own day of action

If you’ve read even one edition of this newsletter since Trump took office, you’ll know that clean energy is facing a crisis in the U.S. Sun Day aims to elevate that message and boost the transition from fossil fuels with a nationwide day of action coming up on Sept. 21, Canary Media’s Alison F. Takemura reports.

The brainchild of climate journalist and activist Bill McKibben, Sun Day looks a lot like Earth Day. Advocacy groups and individuals will hold more than 150 events across the country, offering tours of homes with rooftop solar arrays, EV test drives, and other just-plain-fun activities like performances and face painting. You can find an event near you via the Sun Day website, or tap into Sun Day’s toolkit to host an event of your own.

Two nuclear plants inch closer to ​“renaissance”

Two retired nuclear plants each took a step toward restarting this week. On Monday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a waiver that will let the Duane Arnold plant in Iowa move toward restarting, which plant owner NextEra Energy hopes to do by 2029. And in Michigan, the Palisades plant has returned to operational status after being decommissioned for three years. The designation just means it can start receiving fuel again — it’s not yet generating electricity.

The Trump administration is pushing for a ​“nuclear renaissance,” both through the development of new advanced nuclear reactors and the reopening of large, retired facilities. The administration and nuclear advocates say the power source can help meet growing electricity demand, though the U.S.’s most recent attempt to build a new nuclear plant took years and billions of dollars more than expected.

Katrina killed more than 1,800 people and exposed deep problems with state and federal recovery programs. Those still have room for improvement, but Cassidy said the federal government must continue to play a primary role when disasters hit.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), in coordination with the New York State Department of Health (DOH) and Cattaraugus County officials, is actively investigating a potential organic waste discharge into Ischua Creek in Franklinville and a significant fish and wildlife die-off.

“DEC is working with State and local partners to lead a comprehensive investigation into the die-off of multiple species in Ischua Creek and any other potential environmental impacts,” DEC Commissioner Amanda Lefton said. “We are advising the public not to fish or recreate in the affected area while DEC takes all actions necessary to ensure protection of public health and the environment.”

“The Department of Health is closely coordinating with DEC and local partners to monitor this potential discharge in Ischua Creek,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said. “While there has been a serious impact to fish and wildlife, at this time there is no indication of any effect on public drinking water supplies. We will continue to monitor these developments and provide guidance when more information is available as protecting the health of New Yorkers remains our top priority.”

On August 26, 2025, DEC received reports of a large fish kill in the creek in Franklinville. DEC field teams immediately responded and are closely monitoring water quality, tracking downstream of Franklinville, and assessing impacts to aquatic life. Staff observed multiple types of dead aquatic species in the area.

At this time, there is no indication of impacts to public drinking water supplies. Local water systems have been notified and are taking precautionary monitoring steps. Agencies are fully evaluating any potential impacts to private wells downstream of the affected areas.

Out of an abundance of caution, the public is advised to avoid all contact with Ischua Creek downstream of Franklinville, including recreational uses such as fishing/fish consumption, boating, and swimming, until further notice.

THE TOP FIVE

1. EPA plans to gut the Clean Water Act

The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to propose a new Clean Water Act rule that would eliminate federal protections for many U.S. waterways, according to an internal presentation leaked to E&E News. If finalized, the rule would establish a two-part test to determine whether a wetland received federal regulations: It would need to contain surface water throughout the “wet season,” and it would need to be touching a river, stream, or other body of water that flows throughout the wet season. The new language would require fewer wetland permits, a slide from the presentation showed, according to reporter Miranda Willson. Two EPA staffers briefed on the proposal confirmed the report.

The new rule follows the 2023 Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA, which said that only waterways “with a ‘continuous surface connection’ to a ‘relatively permanent’ body of water” fell under the Clean Water Act’s protections, according to E&E News. What “relatively permanent” means, however, the court didn’t say, nor did Biden’s EPA. The two EPA staffers, who were granted anonymity to avoid retribution, “said they believed the proposal was not based in science and could worsen pollution if finalized,” Willson wrote.

2. Commonwealth Fusion raises nearly $900 million in funding round

Investors are hot on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology spinoff promising to make fusion energy a reality. Commonwealth Fusion Systems netted an eye-popping $863 million in its latest fundraising round. In a press release Thursday, the company said that its “oversubscribed round of capital is the largest amount raised among deep tech and energy companies since” its $1.8 billion financing deal in 2021. Commonwealth Fusion will use the funds to complete its demonstration project and further develop its proposed first power plant in Virginia. To date, the company said, it has raised close to $3 billion, “about one-third of the total capital invested in private fusion companies worldwide.” It’s a sign that investors recognize Commonwealth Fusion “is making fusion power a reality,” CEO Bob Mumgaard said.

The fusion industry has ballooned over the past six years. “It is finally, possibly, almost time” for the technology to arrive, Heatmap’s Katie Brigham wrote last year, noting: “For the ordinary optimist, fusion energy might invoke a cheerful Jetsons-style future of flying cars and interplanetary colonization. For the cynic, it’s a world-changing moment that’s perpetually 30 years away. But investors, nuclear engineers, and physicists see it as a technology edging ever closer to commercialization and a bipartisan pathway towards both energy security and decarbonization.”

3. In a record, grid connections soared 33% last year

A record 75 gigawatts of new generating capacity hooked up to the U.S. power grid last year, a 33% surge from the previous year, thanks to new federal regulations aimed at streamlining the process. That’s according to new data from the consultancy Wood Mackenzie published Thursday. The report found that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Order No. 2023, issued in July 2023, along with other reforms by independent system operators, have had a “considerable impact on processing interconnection agreements, by driving improvements through reducing speculative projects and clearing queue backlogs.” While connections increased, regional grid operators received 9% fewer new project entries and saw a 51% uptick in non-viable projects since 2022.

Solar and storage technologies made up 75% of all interconnection agreements in 2024, equaling about 58 gigawatts. Wood Mackenzie projected that the sectors will retain a similar market share in 2025. Natural gas saw an increase in interconnection requests since 2022, adding 121 gigawatts of capacity. New gas applications are already breaking annual records this year. But overall the number of gas projects that successfully hook up to the grid is down 25% since 2022.

4. Trump’s assault on nuclear regulator stokes safety fears

Almost 200 people have left the Nuclear Regulatory Commission since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, according to new estimates published Thursday in the Financial Times. Of the 28 officials in senior leadership positions, nearly half are working in an “acting” capacity, and only three of the five NRC commissioner roles are filled. “It is an unprecedented situation with some senior leaders having been forced out and many others leaving for early retirement or worse, resignation,” Scott Morris, the former NRC deputy executive director of operations, who retired in May, told the newspaper. “This is really concerning for the staff and is one of the factors causing many key staff and leaders to leave the agency they love ... creating a huge brain drain of talent.”

The exodus comes as Trump is pressing the agency to dramatically overhaul and speed up its review and approval process for new reactors. Supporters of the president’s effort say the NRC has stymied the nuclear industry for decades, and a future buildout of new reactors requires clearing house. But skeptics of the burn-it-all-down approach warn that the atomic energy industry’s success in avoiding major accidents since the 1979 partial meltdown at Three Mile Island is owed to NRC oversight, and that the agency’s processes have actually protected nuclear developers by avoiding frivolous lawsuits and not-in-my-backyard types.

5. Geothermal’s giant has ‘chosen a winner’ among the next-gen upstarts

Geothermal giant Ormat has reigned over the global industry of harvesting energy from hot underground reservoirs for the past 60 years. Now a new generation of companies is promising to tap the Earth’s heat even in places without water by using fracking technology to drill much deeper, vastly expanding the potential for geothermal. And Ormat has placed a big bet on one. On Thursday, the company inked a strategic partnership with Houston-based Sage Geosystems. As part of the deal, Sage will build its first commercial power plant at an existing Ormat facility in Nevada or Utah, significantly speeding up the timeline for the debut generating station. Sage CEO Cindy Taff told me the plant could be online by next year. “Ormat’s chosen a winner,” Yakov Feygin, a researcher at the Center for Public Enterprise who co-authored a report on next-generation geothermal, told me.

A majority of U.S. voters are still unfamiliar with geothermal power, according to a new poll from Data for Progress I reported on this week. When exposed to details about how the technology works, however, support grows among voters across the political spectrum. Republicans in particular are supportive.

Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Electric_Vehicles-Road_User_Fee_73408-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-08-29 15:06:41.243770

Trump’s decision to abruptly stop construction at Revolution Wind—a nearly completed giant wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island—is the latest in an avalanche of moves meant to gut the U.S. wind and solar industry and dismantle renewable energy projects championed by his predecessor. The United States is the world’s biggest oil producer and exporter of natural gas, and the Trump administration has wholly embraced those fossil fuels in its bid to achieve what it has called “American energy dominance.”

“The Biden administration put climate at the center of its energy policy and took a very transition-forward stance,” said Kevin Book, the managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a consultancy. “The Trump administration is largely running the playbook in reverse.”

Trump’s energy playbook also stands in sharp contrast to that of China, which is the world’s biggest consumer of coal as well as its biggest carbon emitter. Yet Beijing has also poured immense resources into manufacturing renewable and clean energy technologies over the course of decades, allowing it to now command the global market for these cutting-edge systems.

While Washington turns its back on renewable energy, Beijing has only been racing full-speed ahead—driving a widening technological gap that threatens to leave the United States on the back foot in key energy sectors in the years to come, energy and industrial policy experts said.

“The current administration has decided that they want to give up on the renewables race that China is leading, even though most of the technologies were invented here [in the United States],” said Joshua Busby, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who worked at the Defense Department under the Biden administration.

“On some level, it’s giving up on the future, because these are going to be keystone industries that will be foundational for economic wealth of countries around the world,” Busby said.

By the numbers, Beijing’s dominance in the renewable and clean energy technology sectors is gaping. Today, China commands more than 80 percent of global solar panel supply chains and has invested more than $50 billion in new photovoltaic supply capacity—or 10 times as much as Europe, according to the International Energy Agency. (Photovoltaic cells—also known as solar cells—are made of semiconductor material and use sunlight to generate electricity.) In 2023, China accounted for some 65 percent of global wind capacity, according to Wood Mackenzie.

Beijing also dominates the global market for batteries, which underpin electric vehicles (EVs) and thousands of military systems, including lasers and unmanned submersibles. China produces more than three-quarters of batteries sold globally, according to the International Energy Agency, and the country has also produced more than 70 percent of all EV batteries ever manufactured.

“At this point in time, the Chinese side has established a significant and irreversible lead vis-à-vis their U.S. competitors,” for important low-carbon technologies such as solar, wind, and batteries, said Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

“The gap between the two countries will only be widened based on Trump’s policies,” Li added.

In recent years, China has scaled up its global exports of batteries, solar panels, and other clean energy technologies as overproduction issues have resulted in lower prices and pushed desperate Chinese firms to seek new buyers abroad.

That’s especially true for energy-hungry emerging market economies, many of which are still scrambling to meet surging power demand. In 2024, emerging markets were the destination of 43 percent of China’s clean tech exports, nearly double their market share in 2022, according to BloombergNEF.

Take Pakistan, which has been one of the biggest new markets for cheap Chinese solar panels and is now undergoing a solar boom. In 2024, the country more than doubled its solar panel imports from Beijing in just one year.

In Africa, where more than 600 million people still need electricity access, China’s solar exports have also dramatically increased in recent years. Between July 2024 and July 2025, African imports of Chinese solar panels surged by 60 percent, according to an analysis by Ember, an energy tracking group. The biggest customers were South Africa and Nigeria, according to Ember.

Beijing’s global ambitions have also seen Chinese companies set up shop outside of the country’s borders. Chinese manufacturers are now building, or have already built, electric vehicle and battery factories in Brazil, Hungary, Indonesia, Russia, Thailand, and Turkey.

“At the end of the day, this will then be part of the story of China’s global expansion—its economic integration with some parts of the world,” Li said.

Those markets aren’t always eager to accept China’s clean tech exports. One of the clearest examples is Europe, which has railed against an influx of cheap, Chinese-built electric vehicles in recent years and ultimately struck back with its own tariffs and an anti-subsidy investigation to shield domestic automakers. A flood of cheap Chinese EVs in Brazil, too, has sparked considerable local backlash.

“Fair competition is good. What we don’t like is when China floods our market with massively subsidized electric cars. And we have to tackle this, we have to protect our industry,” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen declared last year.

The Trump administration, for its part, appears determined to make sure that other countries “drill, baby, drill” just as much as it plans to, largely by wielding the threat of tariffs and other economic pressures. Trump’s recent trade deal with the European Union, for example, included the bloc’s commitment to buy $750 billion in U.S. oil and gas in exchange for lowered tariffs.

Trump has aggressively attempted to rally other countries to his cause, recently declaring in a cabinet meeting that governments are “destroying themselves” with wind energy and saying that he “hope[s] they get back to fossil fuels.” In another instance, top Trump officials vowed earlier in August to retaliate against any countries that backed a global agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions in international shipping.

But for many countries, renewable energy sources may already be firmly in their energy mix.

“From a purely competitive standpoint … it’s not clear that the U.S. can really prevent the rest of the world [from] becoming much more dependent on renewables and EVs and batteries,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, an expert in industrial policy and Chinese climate policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“The risks are that the U.S. misses out on some of the technologies of the future,” Mazzocco said, later adding: “It’s difficult to see how the U.S. might get back into the game in some of these technologies.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194966973.jpg?w=1000,N,,2025-08-29 15:04:07.657857

A new Rhodium Group and MIT report making the rounds this week paints a grim picture of how quickly a years-long surge of development has receded. For the first time since they started tracking data, cancellations of clean manufacturing plans outpaced announcements of new projects. In Q2 2024, companies committed approximately $4 billion to manufacturing endeavors, but developers pulled the plug on around $5 billion worth (a 59% decline from Q1 2025 and a 44% dip from Q2 2024). Among the major cancellations was GM’s decision not to produce electric vehicles (EVs) at Michigan’s Orion Assembly Plant, instead directing $4 billion into fossil fuel-powered cars.

While actual clean energy and transportation investment in the US in Q2 2025 increased by 1% from Q2 2024, it marked the third consecutive quarterly decline and shows the ripple effect of the Trump administration’s war on clean energy. The feds’ attacks on wind and solar have been more public, but the battery and EV industries are clearly being hurt too.

And yet, like a miraculously crispy potato chip abandoned at the bottom of a poorly-resealed bag, clean tech persists. Projects are being approved, construction is advancing, and financing is being… financed.

Construction is scheduled to begin in the coming months, generating nearly 300 jobs during the build phase. The facility is expected to produce power by 2027 and deliver approximately 450 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity annually, enough to serve 43,000 homes. Ferrovial’s growing portfolio in Texas also includes a 257 MWdc plant in Leon County, and the company is close to finishing a 72 MW PV plant in the Houston area for its client X-Elio.

Invenergy Wants Wind Farm in South Dakota

Chicago-based developer Invenergy has filed a request with regulators in South Dakota for approval to construct a $750 million wind project in western South Dakota with 300 MW capacity bound for Southwest Power Pool (SPP).

Philip Wind Partners, an Invenergy subsidiary, asked to locate the 87-turbine project on 70,000 acres of private land in Haakon County, about 90 minutes east of Rapid City, SD. The developers expect to create around 200 construction jobs and about a dozen long-term gigs. The site’s owners and the state will make out nicely, as Invenergy projects $85M going to landowners, paying over $50M in property taxes, and incurring more than $10M in state and local sales taxes.

The Western Area Power Administration recently completed an environmental review of the project and found no significant impact. If approved, construction could begin as early as next year with operations targeted for 2027.

Lightshift Finishes Microgrid Supporting Schools

Energy storage developer Lightshift Energy (formerly Delorean Power) recently wrapped up work on a 5 MW battery energy storage system (BESS) that will support two high schools in Wakefield, Massachusetts, and operate as a resilient, grid-connected microgrid.

Engineered as part of the Wakefield Municipal Gas and Light Department’s Energy Park Project, the battery system is designed primarily to reduce peak demand on the grid, which is expected to save local customers $20 million over the lifetime of the project. It will also provide backup power to Wakefield Memorial High School and Northeast Metropolitan Regional Vocational High School during outages. The battery displaces the need for diesel backup generators and uses peak shaving revenue to support full electrification of both buildings, enabling clean and reliable heating and cooling year-round.

“Energy storage was our first choice when identifying a more cost-effective and renewable solution to power the schools, compared to diesel backup generators that would have cost $1.2 million per generator,” noted Peter Dion, WMGLD’s General Manager. “We are incredibly grateful to have the entire town’s support to deploy the Lightshift battery that will provide cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable electricity to our schools.”

This is the third project in a broader partnership between Lightshift and the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company (MMWEC), designed to bring energy storage systems to many of the joint action agency’s member utilities. The MMWEC program is estimated to provide more than $200 million in energy savings for residents across Massachusetts.

“This project is such a great example of the many ways energy storage strengthens the communities we partner with. We are bringing clean backup power to schools and supporting their electrification while also providing WMGLD customers with major, risk-free savings,” said Rory Jones, co-founder and Managing Partner of Lightshift Energy. “We couldn’t be more excited to partner with WMGLD on this innovative and timely project.”

“Wakefield has been one of the energy storage trailblazers amongst the municipal utilities, having installed their first battery in 2019,” noticed Jason Viadero, MMWEC’s Director of Engineering and Generation Assets. “Their innovative energy park is [a] further demonstration of the out-of-the-box thinking we will need as part of our clean energy future.”

To mark the project launch, Lightshift also announced a $10,000 donation to the Boys & Girls Club of MetroNorth to support the establishment of its planned Energy Education Center, which will inspire and educate the next generation of young leaders.

Disposing of them can be dangerous, so state leaders are looking to come up with some solutions now.

If you feel like there are more electric cars on our roads, you’re right.

According to the Hawaii EV Association, there are more than 38,000 registered EVs in the state, up 16% from last year.

“We’ve been seeing such a tremendous growth of electric vehicles on the roadways today, and at some point, we’re going to have to deal with the end of life,” said Lene Ichinotsubo, Department of Health Solid & Hazardous Waste Branch Supervisor.

That’s where the Electric Vehicle Recycling and Reuse Working Group comes in. The group was formed as part of Act 209 this past legislative session to develop best practices on what to do with all these dead EV batteries.

“What we do know is if people can’t figure it out, we certainly don’t want those batteries going into landfills inappropriately, and we don’t want them to be stuck on somebody’s land,” said Mark Glick, Hawaii State Energy Office Chief Energy Officer.

Damaged batteries have the potential to catch fire, which is why Matson suspended shipping EVs to Hawaii. Glick believes that’s just temporary.

“We certainly appreciate Matson’s approach to come up with good safety standards and better understanding of how to safely and effectively do that on their ships,” said Glick. “And we were very pleased to see that Pasha has no plans to alter their policies.”

EV batteries should be good for maybe five to ten years. So in the next few years, Glick estimates the number of EV batteries Hawaii will have to deal with will go from hundreds to tens of thousands.

“So we have to get out in front of this issue to make sure that we’re not building problems, you know, for future generations,” said Glick.

The group is led by the State Energy Office and Department of Health, and will get input from everyone involved, including the auto industry, shipping companies, recyclers and firefighters.

“We’re really optimistic having the brain trust of all of these people to develop that potential solution for sustainable and safe management of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries for Hawaii,” said Ichinotsubo. “We’re very optimistic with this group.”

PosiGen laid off 78 people from its offices in Shelton, Danbury and Wethersfield on Sunday, Aug. 24.

In a letter notifying the cities of the layoffs, the company’s chief administrative officer wrote that the company was ceasing “most of its operations throughout the United States, effective immediately.” The company said it was experiencing “significant financial difficulties” made worse by the Trump administration’s spending and tax package, which will end solar tax credits by the end of 2025.

Connecticut Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff (D-Norwalk) criticized the Trump administration for the job losses.

“President Trump talks a big game about standing up for the working man, but the truth is he’s left 78 Connecticut families without a paycheck,” Duff said in a statement. “These are blue-collar jobs that built our clean energy future. Now they’re gone because Trump needed the money for tax cuts for billionaires and his corrupt circle.”

The layoffs at PosiGen come days after the Trump administration ordered a halt in construction on Revolution Wind, an offshore wind farm in Connecticut and Rhode Island, which could threaten more than 1,000 additional jobs.

An uncertain future for green jobs in the state

PosiGen is based in Louisiana and was set to supply more solar panels to Connecticut residents through Solar for All, a federal grant program that awarded $62.4 million to the state last year. But the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled the program earlier this month, terminating the funds that were sent to Connecticut.

Aziz Dehkan, executive director of the Connecticut Roundtable on Climate and Jobs, said the job losses stand to set the state’s green job economy back by years.

“We had a robust, green, renewable energy policy in the state that created green jobs and we're just losing them daily it seems like,” Dehkan said. “What's the next one that's going to happen is really the question here.”

U.S. Rep. John Larson, a Democrat, said the layoffs at PosiGen, and the Trump administration’s move to halt construction on Revolution Wind, would hurt the pocketbooks of consumers.

“If these misguided and vindictive actions are not reversed, thousands of Connecticut households will be stuck paying more for their electricity from an increasingly unreliable power grid for years to come,” Larson said in a statement.

Following the layoff notice, PosiGen now has eight employees remaining in Connecticut. Those workers are expected to be laid off by Sept. 13 if the company can't obtain financing or sell the company.

“The uncertainty that's being caused by the federal government, one by one, ending tax credits or closing down renewable energy projects, hurts everybody,” Dekhan said. “It hurts the economy. It hurts the climate.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/522f5ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4334+0+585/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F98%2Fab%2F21c190c4449fb5b6f359b1038d5c%2F230405-nenc-20230405-nhpr-community-power-keene-00001.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 15:07:04.127230

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Susan Collins, Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, issued a statement on the Office of Management and Budget’s rescissions proposal.

“Congress has received from the Administration a $4.9 billion package of proposed rescissions of funding that had been previously appropriated for a wide range of foreign aid programs. Given that this package was sent to Congress very close to the end of the fiscal year when the funds are scheduled to expire, this is an apparent attempt to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval.

“GAO has concluded that this type of rescission is unlawful and not permitted by the Impoundment Control Act. Article I of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the responsibility for the power of the purse. Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.

“Instead of this attempt to undermine the law, the appropriate way is to identify ways to reduce excessive spending through the bipartisan, annual appropriations process. Congress approves rescissions regularly as part of this process. In fact, the year-long funding bill that we are currently operating under includes 70 rescissions. This month, the Appropriations Committee intends to markup the Fiscal Year 2026 State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs bill. The annual funding bill is the most appropriate way to ensure that any rescissions reflect the views of Congress.”

The plant, which won’t come online until 2031 or later, will saddle Jacksonville residents with decades of higher bills and continued reliance on polluting natural gas.

“This decision doubles down on Jacksonville’s past instead of investing in a sustainable future for our city, neighbors, and children,” said Suzanne Sapp, Sierra Club Senior Campaign Organizer. “At a time when cities across the country are proving solar and storage can deliver affordable, reliable power, JEA is locking us into 30 years of higher bills and climate pollution.”

Key Concerns:

Soaring Costs for Ratepayers – The new plant’s estimated price tag has tripled in just five years, from $553 million in 2019 to $1.57 billion today. JEA officials confirmed rate hikes are inevitable to pay for it.

Locking in Fossil Fuels – Despite promises of efficiency by JEA, the facility will rely on fracked gas, a volatile and climate-damaging fuel. It locks Jacksonville into fossil energy through at least the 2060s.

Missed Opportunity on Renewables – While neighboring utilities expand solar and storage at record pace, JEA rejected clean energy solutions and exaggerated barriers like weather and land use. Meanwhile, its token plan for 200 MW of solar and 100 MW of storage by 2026 pales in comparison to this massive gas buildout.

Rejecting Alternatives – The JEA Board dismissed a lower-cost power purchase agreement with Florida Power and Light, citing storm risks, while ignoring the bigger risks of fossil fuel volatility, climate impacts, and stranded asset costs.

Community Burden – Jacksonville families will pay the price in higher rates, while continuing to live with the pollution, economic risks, and climate harms of outdated fossil infrastructure.

The reason is cited as aligning with market demand for the company's EV trucks.

The factory previously reduced production in April of this year.

In a move a company spokesperson says is intended to temporarily affect production, GM is shutting down production at its Detroit-Hamtramck EV factory. Beginning the day after Labor Day, and ending October 6, both first and second shifts will be shut down.

According to a statement emailed to the Detroit Free Press, the move is intended to make ""temporary adjustments to production to align to market dynamics."" The vehicles affected are the GMC Hummer EV and the Cadillac Escalade IQ.

This shutdown follows on the heels of a similar move in April, where 200 jobs were temporarily cut due to low market demand. In that case, GM also included the EV versions of the Sierra and Silverado pickup trucks.

Essentially, it looks like consumer demand for big EV trucks is softer than projected. A Hummer EV or the full-size electric Escalade are both niche products built to impress, so it's perhaps unsurprising that the sales numbers aren't huge. Still, while GM moves seven times as many regular Escalades each month than it does the EV version, sales of the IQ are at least fairly steady, about 600 per month for the first half of the year.

It's perhaps a bigger issue that the Sierra and Silverado EVs combined sales are about the same as that of the Hummer EV. The Ford Lightning EV pickup sells far better, but it has not been without its stumbles.

With GM's volume-selling EVs, the Equinox and Blazer, both being built in Mexico, executives must surely be looking at the excess production supply in Detroit, and perhaps reconsidering past strategies.

The shift shutdown is expected to impact 360 workers at present; the factory employs a total of 4000 people.

Geopolitics and global economic shifts, ranging from the U.S.–China tensions and the return of a Trump administration, to the Iran–Israel conflict, are casting uncertainty over ASEAN’s energy transition and dampening investor confidence.

Kavita Gandhi, Executive Director of the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS), has put forward the idea of a “sovereign energy bloc”. She argues ASEAN nations should first build a strong internal market before expanding exports, shielding the region from external volatility. In this interview with RECCESSARY, Kavita explains the challenges of realizing such a bloc and shares her views on the region’s renewable energy development.

Four steps toward an ASEAN “Sovereign Energy Bloc”

In a recent op-ed, Kavita highlighted the fragmented nature of ASEAN’s energy market. Infrastructure and planning have developed in a piecemeal way, limiting resource efficiency across the region. This fragmentation weakens ASEAN’s bargaining power in global markets, undermines investor confidence, and even constrains economic growth.

To address this, Kavita calls for a strong regional energy bloc, with exports reinforcing collective sovereignty. She outlines four phases to achieve it:

Strengthen domestic infrastructure: Streamline project approvals, improve grid infrastructure, and build workforce capacity to accelerate clean energy deployment.

Prioritize regional interconnections: Expand bilateral grid links, like those between Singapore and Malaysia, and Indonesia, as testbeds for technical and regulatory alignment, paving the way toward a full ASEAN Power Grid (APG).

Harmonize policy and finance: Coordinate standards, set up a regional power trading platform, and pool blended finance instruments to lower project risks and attract private capital at scale.

Expand exports strategically: Only after a stable internal system is in place should ASEAN scale up clean energy exports, positioning itself not just as a supplier but as a regional price-setter.

In that article, Kavita acknowledges ASEAN cannot decouple from its export economy. But with rising power demand and uneven distribution in countries like Myanmar and Indonesia, prioritizing exports too soon would risk destabilizing domestic supply and grid stability.

When asked about the greatest challenge to create such a bloc, Kavita pointed to consensus-building. “All the ASEAN countries have to come together and say, ‘Yes, this is something we need to get behind.’ Only then can governments bring forward investment proposals, decide how to collaborate, and determine which infrastructure should be built or upgraded.”

From rivalry to synergy: ASEAN’s renewable strengths

As demand for green power surges, a collective energy strategy could spark fears of resource competition. Kavita suggested reframing the issue commercially, leveraging each country’s natural strengths to expand low-carbon supply and meet national climate goals.

She mentioned that Indonesia and the Philippines hold abundant potential of geothermal while Laos has comparative advantage in Hydropower. Agricultural residues in Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand offer strong feedstock for developing biomass & biogas.

Kavita noted that this year’s Asia Clean Energy Summit, hosted by SEAS this October, will spotlight biomass for the first time, including discussions on sustainable feedstock supply.

Looking ahead, Kavita added that emerging options such as green hydrogen and small modular reactors may be costly today but are bound to commercialize.

Kavita cited a Singapore-based photovoltaic firm that set up manufacturing in Indonesia, where the government is scaling solar capacity. “If we have our own ASEAN market, I don’t think supply chains would be a problem.” She added.

Kavita emphasized that companies of all sizes are being driven toward net zero—not only by government policy but also by falling renewable energy costs. For ASEAN, uniting around its own market is critical: ensuring secure and affordable power at home while using integration to shape industry leadership globally.

Founded in 2006, SEAS has grown from an energy efficiency-focused network of 35 firms into Singapore’s leading renewable energy industry association, now representing more than 300 members across clean power and energy solutions. Acting as a bridge between government and business, it organizes forums, publishes policy white papers, and runs training programs to build sustainability talent.",https://www.reccessary.com/data/features/cover/1756446567316986072.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 17:03:07.628732

""It leads the nation in EV adoption, and that has a bit of a waterfall effect on a few other things that relate to insurance costs.""
Transitioning more completely to electric vehicles is vital in the fight against human-caused climate change, experts say.
Specialized carriers, including Aspire, Bristol West and National General, which offer policies to high-risk drivers, typically don't cover electric vehicles.
Though EVs tend to cost more to repair, they usually cost less to maintain under normal conditions, said Taliesin.","As the price of buying an electric vehicle is set to soar with tariffs and the end of government incentives, drivers who want to go green have another hidden cost to consider before making the switch.

The insurance premiums on electric vehicles are, on average, a whopping 49% higher than those for gas-powered cars, according to new data from the digital insurance platform Insurify.

It costs an average of $4,058 annually to insure an electric vehicle, compared with $2,732 for a traditional vehicle, according to the data. Electric cars cost more to replace, are more expensive to repair, and are more likely to have issues that lead to insurance claims, the report said.

The steep insurance prices for EVs come as the U.S. electric-vehicle industry is being battered by auto tariffs, federal legislation and the expiration of a tax incentive attached to new and used electric vehicles.

""Insurance costs, because they are ongoing, do matter in the long-term calculation of whether it costs more or less for any given person to drive an EV versus a gas-powered car,"" said Julia Taliesin, who authored the report.

Battery-powered cars cost more to insure because they have higher sticker prices, are more easily damaged and require specific parts for repairs, Taliesin said. A fender bender that would be a simple fix on a traditional vehicle could require an expensive and lengthy repair on an EV to mend the battery and recalibrate the car and its sensors.

""The cost of what's making up the car, and the cost of the labor to make those repairs, all go into why EVs are more expensive to insure,"" she said.

Insurance prices are even higher in states where there are fewer EVs and fewer mechanics who can work on them, the report said. In Arkansas and Idaho, where there is low EV adoption rates, the cost of full coverage for an electric vehicle can be almost twice that of a traditional car.

In California, it costs 15% to 31% more to insure an electric vehicle than it would to insure a traditional car, according to Insurify. Widespread EV adoption in the state drives prices down and gives insurers more data, allowing them to offer lower premiums, Taliesin said.

""California has been very intentional about infrastructure and incentivizing EV ownership,"" Taliesin said. ""It leads the nation in EV adoption, and that has a bit of a waterfall effect on a few other things that relate to insurance costs.""

As federal EV incentives dwindle under the Trump administration, state-level programs become increasingly important tools in encouraging EV adoption, experts said. The California Air Resources Board mandates that all new cars sold in the state by 2035 be zero-emission, an ambitious goal that faces challenges in Washington.

Transitioning more completely to electric vehicles is vital in the fight against human-caused climate change, experts say. However, recent polling data from Gallup show that fewer Americans are open to buying an EV than they were two years ago. As of April, 51% of those surveyed said they already owned or were considering buying an EV, down from 59% in 2023.

It's easier to insure an EV now than it was a decade ago, said Mallory Mooney, director of sales and service at Insurify.

""When we first started seeing EVs, we had a hard time placing Teslas for coverage and other specific models that we've seen are troublesome for repair,"" she said.

The Tesla Model X and Model 3 top Insurify's list of most expensive EVs to insure.

The Model X has an average annual cost of $4,765 for full coverage, a sharp 36% jump since last year. The data also show that the Model 3 has a claims frequency rate that is significantly higher than the industry average, indicating it may require more frequent repairs.

Most standard insurance carriers offer policies for EVs, but there are exceptions, even in California, Mooney said. Specialized carriers, including Aspire, Bristol West and National General, which offer policies to high-risk drivers, typically don't cover electric vehicles.

Though EVs tend to cost more to repair, they usually cost less to maintain under normal conditions, said Taliesin. Savings on maintenance and gas could help offset ongoing insurance fees and high up-front price tags on EVs.

""Electric vehicles are more technical and finicky,"" she said. ""The more there are on the road, the more affordable they should become.""","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/29/PDTN/85884968007-bizautoevinsuranceget.jpg?crop=2997,1686,x0,y125&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-29 14:03:06.298547

As a national leader, Pennsylvania will continue its competitive program and maximize available NEVI funds to provide a robust EV charging program in Pennsylvania.
National data on the status of the NEVI program by state is available at https://evstates.org/awards-dashboard/.
Information about state infrastructure in Pennsylvania, including completed work and significant projects, is available at www.penndot.pa.gov/results.","Harrisburg, PA – Today, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) announced the opening of two new federally-funded Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, bringing the total number of stations built in Pennsylvania using funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to 19. With the opening of the two new charging locations, Pennsylvania is now tied for first in the nation in stations built using the federal funds.

“Pennsylvania is tied for the most operational NEVI stations in the nation, and more are coming,” said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. “Governor Shapiro set an expectation from the top that we get stuff done for Pennsylvanians, and delivering EV charging is just one example of our commitment to that idea.”

“Our stores are already the ultimate one-stop-shop for travelers – offering fresh food, clean facilities and dependable convenience whenever they need it,” said Trevor Walter, Sheetz EVP of Petroleum Supply Management. “We are bringing that same convenience to drivers of electric vehicles across Pennsylvania. Partnering with PennDOT through the NEVI program gives us the ability to grow our network faster, by adding charging options at even more stores our customers already know and love.”

The 19 stations opened under the NEVI program, representing a federal investment of more than $10.5 million, building upon the Shapiro Administration’s determination to ensure the reliability and accessibility of EV charging and get things done for Pennsylvania travelers.

The new stations are at the following locations:

Sheetz in Altoona, Blair County on along Interstate 99 (Exit 32);

Sheetz in York, York County on Route 30 along I-83 (Exit 21).

PennDOT completed three funding rounds over the course of 2023 and 2024 focused on identifying charging station projects to fill gaps along Pennsylvania’s Alternative Fuels Corridors. A total of 90 active NEVI projects in 43 counties are now in varying stages of implementation and include a total federal investment of $58.4 million. A list of all NEVI awards is available on PennDOT's website.

On August 11, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued new NEVI interim guidelines for states to restart their NEVI programs after rescinding prior guidelines and approved plans in February. As a national leader, Pennsylvania will continue its competitive program and maximize available NEVI funds to provide a robust EV charging program in Pennsylvania. PennDOT submitted a new NEVI state plan and “build out” certification request to FWHA on August 27, 2025, in accordance with the new guidance.

National data on the status of the NEVI program by state is available at https://evstates.org/awards-dashboard/.

Aside from manufacturing, a charging infrastructure must be in place. PepsiCo, which has been running Tesla Semis in California as part of a pilot program, will be charged and ready to go in Denver, Colorado.

[Related: Pepsi spills the beans on Tesla Semi's real-world hauling performance]

Tesla, in partnership with PepsiCo, has filed permits to build a six-stall Semi charging station at its distribution center in the Mile-High City, according to Teslarati.

Tesla and PepsiCo have already established a mutually beneficial partnership over the past few years. As part of the pilot program for regional deliveries, PepsiCo helped test the Semi and provided valuable feedback to aid in its ongoing development.

With mass production of the Semi approaching at the Nevada Gigafactory, a broader charging infrastructure is now essential. PepsiCo, already using the electric trucks for deliveries across states like California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada, has both the deep pockets and strategic incentive to support this expansion.

The upcoming Denver site is not alone; the company has filed permits to install 18 Semi chargers at a facility near Charlotte, North Carolina.

It would be fair to assume that the Denver and Charlotte sites will also be equipped with Megawatt Charging Systems (MCS), which are critical for long-haul, heavy-duty battery-electric rigs, specifically the Tesla Semi.

The Case for Flux Power FLUX is benefiting from increasing demand for its energy storage solutions across material handling and ground support markets.","Plug Power Inc. PLUG and Flux Power Holdings, Inc. FLUX are both familiar names operating in the clean energy market. As rivals, these companies are engaged in manufacturing advanced energy storage solutions for the electrification of commercial and industrial equipment in the United States and internationally.

While Plug Power has been enjoying significant growth opportunities in the green hydrogen market, Flux Power is benefiting from rising demand for eco-friendly energy storage solutions in the material handling sector. But which one has the greater upside potential? Let’s take a closer look at their fundamentals, growth prospects and challenges to make an informed choice.

The Case for Plug Power

Plug Power is observing a declining trend in the number of hydrogen site installations, which reduced from 52 to 15 year over year in 2024. In the first six months of 2025, this number further reduced to four from eight in the prior-year comparable period. This has been hurting its revenues related to the sales of hydrogen infrastructure. Additionally, fewer liquefier projects and a slower rate of progress on the existing ventures have been hurting revenues from the sales of cryogenic storage equipment and liquefiers.

Another major issue that has plagued Plug Power is its inability to generate positive gross margins and cash inflows. It recorded a gross margin of negative 31% in second-quarter 2025 compared with a gross margin of negative 92% in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, its operating cash outflow totaled $297.4 million in the first six months of 2025 compared with $422.5 million in the year-ago period.

The weak liquidity position has compelled PLUG to sell shares to raise funds for its operations and invest in hydrogen plants. In first-quarter 2025, it received $267.5 million as net proceeds from equity sales and the amount totaled $857.9 million in 2024.

Despite this, Plug Power remains focused on scaling up its business and investing in hydrogen plants, given the long-term growth potential of the green hydrogen energy market. PLUG intends to capitalize on the opportunity with increased green hydrogen production at its new plant in Georgia, as well as a new joint venture with Olin Corporation OLN in Louisiana.

Also, in January 2025, it secured a loan guarantee worth $1.66 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to support the construction of six green hydrogen production facilities. This marks a significant step in the expansion of its hydrogen production capabilities.

PLUG launched Project Quantum Leap in the first quarter, with a target to generate more than $200 million in annualized savings. As part of the project, the company stands to benefit from sales growth, pricing actions, inventory and capex management, and increased leverage of its hydrogen production platform. It expects the project to boost its cash flow and reduce the cash burn rate in the quarters ahead.

The Case for Flux Power

FLUX is benefiting from increasing demand for its energy storage solutions across material handling and ground support markets. A solid pipeline of orders from renowned airlines, with six new airline customers, also bodes well. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended March 2025), the company benefited from strong revenue growth and margin momentum, backed by its product expansion efforts amid the growing popularity of lithium-ion solutions.

With an increasing move toward electrification across several commercial and industrial sectors, Flux Power is well placed with a diverse portfolio of advanced lithium-ion battery packs and software solutions that are likely to drive its growth.

The company remains focused on launching new products and upgrading the existing ones according to industry trends. FLUX recently launched the G-Series G96 High Voltage lithium-ion energy solution for the ground support equipment industry. It also received a patent for its Intelligent Battery Cycle Life Maximization, which is a proprietary AI-based algorithm. This is an important milestone in the company’s transition to a technology-led energy solutions manufacturer.

However, Flux Power is witnessing lower orders for its energy storage solutions across the new forklift category owing to the lower capital spending in the market. Also, given its weak liquidity position, the company has resorted to debt and equity financing to raise funds for its operations. It exited the fiscal third quarter with an accumulated deficit of $105.2 million, while its cash flows from operations totaled $2.2 million.

How Does the Zacks Consensus Estimate Compare for PLUG & FLUX?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLUG’s 2025 sales is $707 million, implying year-over-year growth of 12.4%. The consensus estimate for its bottom line is pegged at a loss of 63 cents per share.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 17:03:19.742437

Summary

First Solar has a 64 GW backlog and is the dominant leader at the confluence of U.S. manufacturing support, constraints on foreign-connected competitors, and autonomous technology increasing energy demands.

Thematic macro investors with a tolerance for policy volatility can reap 100% gains in 12 months in a bull case. I definitely estimate a 40–50% return.

Risks include long-term competition ramping, including advantages in novel crystalline silicon panels that counter the Levelized Cost of Energy advantage of First Solar's cadmium telluride at this stage.

Since my last First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) analysis, the stock has gained 32.5% in price. First Solar stands out as the greatest U.S. clean energy company of our time, based on policy, backlog, and technology.

AUSTIN, TX – Railroad Commission Chairman Wayne Christian today praised a new report showing that operators in the Permian Basin have reduced methane intensity by 50 percent since 2022, even as oil and natural gas production surged to historic highs. Commissioner Christian said the following:

“Texas’ reliable energy producers continue to prove that fossil fuel production and a clean environment can coexist. By embracing innovation and industry-driven solutions – not heavy-handed federal mandates – our state is reducing emissions while continuing to fuel America with reliable energy. As the nation’s largest producer of oil and gas, this milestone shows that we can produce affordable, reliable energy and achieve real environmental progress—without sacrificing jobs or energy security.”

“For years, radicle environmentalists and the mainstream media used out-of-context flaring images, from the Permian Basin, to scare average Americans and Wall Street. This fueled the false narrative of Net Zero and gave rise to ESG, which stifled oil and gas investment and left Americans with expensive and unreliable power. Thankfully, the Trump Administration has reversed Biden’s Green New Deal Agenda and prioritized increased U.S. oil and gas production.”

Background: In 2020, Christian convened a Blue Ribbon Task Force to prioritize reducing flaring and improving environmental outcomes while maintaining Texas’ role as the nation’s energy leader. The Task Force developed a comprehensive report with recommendations to minimize flaring, streamline regulatory processes, and increase transparency. Its work emphasized the importance of capturing natural gas that would otherwise be flared, leveraging new technology, and ensuring regulatory certainty to promote both economic recovery and environmental progress.

Under Christian’s leadership, Texas has achieved historic declines in flaring through improved infrastructure, better reporting, and voluntary industry action. The flaring rate in Texas dropped by 63 percent from June 2019 to May 2025. The monthly rates have consistently been below one percent, meaning more than 99% of natural gas produced in Texas is being beneficially used.

The latest report from the Texas Methane & Flaring Coalition underscores the success of these efforts, demonstrating that responsible energy development and emissions reductions are not mutually exclusive.

About the Railroad Commission:

Our mission is to serve Texas by our stewardship of natural resources and the environment, our concern for personal and community safety, and our support of enhanced development and economic vitality for the benefit of Texans. The Commission has a long and proud history of service to both Texas and to the nation, including more than 100 years regulating the oil and gas industry. The Commission also has jurisdiction over alternative fuels safety, natural gas utilities, surface mining and intrastate pipelines.

Tesla’s European sales fell in July, marking a seventh straight monthly decline, while Chinese competitor BYD posted sharp gains, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA).

Elon Musk’s company has been grappling with mounting challenges in Europe, where fierce competition and reputational damage tied to the billionaire’s political involvement has weighed on the brand.

Tesla sold 6,600 cars in the EU in July, down from 11,465 a year earlier, ACEA data showed. By contrast, Chinese rival BYD sold 13,503 units, a 225% annual increase. Tesla’s drop came even as overall battery-electric vehicle sales in the bloc jumped 39%.

Musk inflamed sentiment across Europe by wading into politics – expressing support for right-wing candidates, calling British Prime Minister Keir Starmer “evil” and saying he belonged in prison. He also warned Germans that “things will get very, very much worse” if they did not vote for the AfD party. The remarks triggered protests: in Milan, demonstrators hung an effigy of Musk, while in London posters were seen likening him to a Nazi.

Tesla’s global performance is also faltering, as vehicle sales revenue declined in the second quarter and Musk warned that they could face “a few rough quarters” ahead.

The US automaker also faces pressure from Chinese rivals rapidly expanding in Europe with aggressive model launches. BYD has been at the forefront, rolling out competitively priced cars and opening showrooms across the continent over the past two years. Chinese brands captured more than 5% of the European market in the first half of the year – their highest share on record, according to JATO Dynamics.

Experts note one challenge for Tesla is the lack of a major update to its lineup. Earlier this year, the company said it was developing a more affordable electric model, with volume production slated for the second half of 2025 – an announcement investors hope will help revive sales.

As it tries to compete with China in clean energy manufacturing, protectionist policies like U.S. tariffs threaten to stall momentum.","In short:

FEMA has laid off about one-third of its workforce under Trump and slashed funding for disaster preparedness and recovery, including grants aimed at vulnerable communities.

The president has signaled a shift to “state-led” disaster response, but former officials say states have always led — with federal backup — and many lack the resources to manage growing climate threats.

Trump’s appointee to lead FEMA has no prior disaster management experience, violating post-Katrina reform law and drawing sharp criticism from emergency management professionals.

Key quote:

“It has been so demoralizing to realize how closely aligned we have become again to what Fema looked like pre-Katrina, and how quickly we’ve backslid on the progress of the last 20 years.”

— Samantha Montano, disaster response expert at Massachusetts Maritime Academy

Why this matters:

After Hurricane Katrina exposed deep gaps in disaster readiness, Congress passed reforms to ensure the agency could respond more quickly and equitably. Those hard-earned changes are now unraveling. Layoffs, funding cuts, and politically driven leadership appointments are degrading FEMA’s capacity just as extreme weather becomes more frequent and more destructive. Poorer communities like New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward, which still bears Katrina’s scars, are at the greatest risk. Without strong federal support, states with limited budgets and infrastructure will struggle to respond, leaving vulnerable residents to fend for themselves when the next storm hits.

In short:

When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005, over 370,000 school-age children were displaced, thousands were reported missing, and many lost parents, homes, and community connections.

Survivors like E’jaaz Mason and Arnold Burks, both 13 at the time, recount trauma that went unspoken for years; a Harvard study found one in six affected children developed lasting mental health issues.

Despite post-Katrina infrastructure improvements, Louisiana’s coast continues to erode rapidly, and climate change is increasing hurricane risks while cuts to federal disaster agencies may leave future generations more vulnerable.

Key quote:

""Imagine someone just taking your brain and taking everything you know, shaking up your head, shaking up your memory, shaking everything, and then ripping it away. And putting it back after it was destroyed.""

— Eric Griggs, vice president of Access Health Louisiana

Why this matters:

Disasters can permanently affect the minds and health of those who survive them, especially children. Hurricane Katrina offers a stark example of how trauma and displacement ripple through generations, particularly in under-resourced Black communities that bore the brunt of the storm. In the years since, rising sea levels and increasingly violent storms have placed New Orleans and other Gulf Coast cities in the path of repeated disasters, while ongoing erosion strips Louisiana of vital wetlands that once buffered storm surges. Cuts to emergency response infrastructure and weather forecasting agencies further heighten risk, raising concerns that the failures of 2005 could repeat. The children of Katrina are now adults, and their stories raise hard questions about what, if anything, has changed.

In short:

The federal Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) can send urgent alerts to cellphones and media, but many communities don't use it due to high software costs, inadequate training, or fear of backlash from false alarms.

Since 2016, at least 15 federally declared disasters saw failures to send timely IPAWS alerts, with some alerts arriving only after catastrophic flooding, fires, or mudslides had already begun.

In recent tragedies, including the July 4 floods in Kerr County, Texas, local leaders either slept through the event or opted to use less-effective systems, resulting in over 100 deaths, many of them children.

Key quote:

“The most common mode of warning system failure is failure to initiate warnings in the first place.”

— Art Botterell, former senior emergency services coordinator, California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services

Why this matters:

In an age of intensifying climate disasters, fast, clear communication can mean the difference between life and death. Yet across the U.S., particularly in rural or underfunded regions, many emergency managers remain unprepared or hesitant to use IPAWS, the government’s most powerful public alert tool. Technical issues, budget constraints, and a lack of training often prevent its deployment when it’s needed most. Without federal requirements or standards for using the system, alerting remains inconsistent and fragmented — leaving communities vulnerable during floods, wildfires, and storms. As disasters increase, so does the human toll from these missed warnings, particularly in areas where families may be asleep, out of cell range, or unaware that danger is coming.

In short:

Democratic lawmakers and aligned advocacy groups are accusing President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” of gutting renewable energy incentives and driving up electricity prices for American households.

Messaging efforts emphasize that clean energy is not only environmentally beneficial but also cheaper and faster to deploy, a message Democrats hope will resonate in the 2026 midterms, especially with swing voters.

Energy prices have climbed faster than inflation, with Democrats citing utility data and industry studies to argue that states with more renewables have fared better than those that rely heavily on fossil fuels.

Key quote:

“The big ugly bill is going to mean a lot of big ugly energy bills arriving in the mail for Americans around the country.”

— Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.)

Why this matters:

Electricity prices are becoming a political flashpoint, but beyond partisanship, the debate reveals deeper questions about the U.S. energy system. Wind and solar have become the cheapest sources of new electricity in much of the country, yet the cost of building new infrastructure and managing power demand is rising. As the U.S. adds data centers and electrifies more sectors, demand for power is growing fast, and fossil fuel reliance can lock in price volatility. Renewable energy often delivers price stability, but its association with climate politics has made it a harder sell in some districts. Meanwhile, consumers are left paying higher utility bills, with the reasons why often obscured by misinformation and partisan spin.

In short:

In meetings and lobbying disclosures from May and June, oil and gas firms targeted regulations on clean fuels, electricity, methane, carbon pricing, and the proposed emissions cap, all core elements of Canada’s 2022 climate plan.

Companies including Enbridge, Suncor, Shell, and Imperial Oil lobbied Carney’s ministers, often citing competitiveness and U.S. tariffs under President Trump’s administration as reasons to weaken federal climate regulations.

The Carney government says it will update the climate plan by year’s end, citing economic changes and global pressures, but has not detailed which policies might be changed or retained.

Key quote:

“These are long-standing demands from these various industries: ‘Get rid of these things, we don’t want to be a part of this.’”

— Alex Cool-Fergus, national policy manager at Climate Action Network Canada

Why this matters:

Canada’s oil and gas sector is its largest source of industrial emissions, and lobbying efforts to dismantle or delay climate rules come as the country grapples with worsening climate impacts. Canada is warming at twice the global average — faster in its North — and 2024’s extreme heat and wildfire seasons bore the mark of human-driven climate change, according to government scientists. The 2022 climate plan aimed to cut emissions and reach net-zero by 2050, but ongoing pressure from the fossil fuel industry threatens to derail or dilute those commitments.

In short:

India recently announced it had increased solar manufacturing capacity 50-fold over the past decade, producing enough panels to generate 100 gigawatts of electricity.

The U.S., previously India's largest buyer of solar panels, imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods this week, making those exports financially unviable.

India now faces uncertainty over whether its domestic market can absorb the surplus, as it tries to scale up rooftop solar and reduce dependence on Chinese components.

Why this matters:

India is betting heavily on solar power to meet its energy needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but its reliance on global trade leaves it vulnerable to shifting geopolitics. As it tries to compete with China in clean energy manufacturing, protectionist policies like U.S. tariffs threaten to stall momentum. The sudden loss of the American market may push Indian solar firms to slash production or abandon expansion plans. And because most Indian solar panel makers still depend on imports from China for key parts like silicon wafers, the country's push for energy independence remains precarious.

In short:

Americans for Prosperity, funded by the Koch family, is pushing to overturn Vermont’s climate laws through digital campaigns, mailers, and public events, targeting measures like the Affordable Heat Act and the Global Warming Solutions Act.

The group’s New England director, Ross Connolly, said their mission is to counter “radical” progressive policies and promote deregulation, despite none of the group's key organizers living in Vermont.

Vermont has become a strategic testing ground for this approach, with Americans for Prosperity expanding its influence through local lobbying efforts and events while also settling a $3,000 fine for a campaign finance violation.

Key quote:

“The goal of the Affordable Heat Act is to help insulate Vermonters from fossil-fuel price swings, and to make it easier and more affordable for them to transition – if they want to – to more sustainable energy sources.”

— Jill Krowinski, Vermont House Speaker

Why this matters:

Vermont is on the front lines of a broader national strategy by fossil fuel interests to derail state-level climate action. The state's efforts to shift away from heating oil and toward electric heat pumps reflect a larger movement to cut carbon emissions from residential energy use. But this transition threatens the profits of entrenched oil interests, which are now using dark money groups to fight back. Americans for Prosperity, created and funded by Koch Industries, has long played a leading role in denying climate science and obstructing environmental regulation. Its entry into Vermont politics signals an intensification of these tactics in even the most progressive states.

Kaufman,,,,,https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/29/1122839/this-american-nuclear-company-could-help-indias-thorium-dream/,"For just the second time in nearly two decades, the United States has granted an export license to an American company planning to sell nuclear technology to India, MIT Technology Review has learned.
“This license marks a turning point, not just for Clean Core but for the US-India civil nuclear partnership,” says Mehul Shah, the company's chief executive and founder.
But at least some uranium fuel is needed to make thorium atoms split, making it an imperfect replacement.
Clean Core created a new type of fuel that blends thorium with a more concentrated type of uranium called HALEU (high-assay low-enriched uranium).
Compared with traditional uranium fuel, Clean Core says, its fuel reduces waste by more than 85% while avoiding the most problematic isotopes produced during fission.","For just the second time in nearly two decades, the United States has granted an export license to an American company planning to sell nuclear technology to India, MIT Technology Review has learned. The decision to greenlight Clean Core Thorium Energy’s license is a major step toward closer cooperation between the two countries on atomic energy and marks a milestone in the development of thorium as an alternative to uranium for fueling nuclear reactors.

Starting from the issuance last week, the thorium fuel produced by the Chicago-based company can be shipped to reactors in India, where it could be loaded into the cores of existing reactors. Once Clean Core receives final approval from Indian regulators, it will become one of the first American companies to sell nuclear technology to India, just as the world’s most populous nation has started relaxing strict rules that have long kept the US private sector from entering its atomic power industry.

“This license marks a turning point, not just for Clean Core but for the US-India civil nuclear partnership,” says Mehul Shah, the company's chief executive and founder. “It places thorium at the center of the global energy transformation.”

Thorium has long been seen as a good alternative to uranium because it’s more abundant, produces both smaller amounts of long-lived radioactive waste and fewer byproducts with centuries-long half-lives, and reduces the risk that materials from the fuel cycle will be diverted into weapons manufacturing.

But at least some uranium fuel is needed to make thorium atoms split, making it an imperfect replacement. It’s also less well suited for use in the light-water reactors that power the vast majority of commercial nuclear plants worldwide. And in any case, the complex, highly regulated nuclear industry is extremely resistant to change.

For India, which has scant uranium reserves but abundant deposits of thorium, the latter metal has been part of a long-term strategy for reducing dependence on imported fuels. The nation started negotiating a nuclear export treaty with the US in the early 2000s, and a 123 Agreement—a special, Senate-approved treaty the US requires with another country before sending it any civilian nuclear products—was approved in 2008.

A new approach

While most thorium advocates have envisioned new reactors designed to run on this fuel, which would mean rebuilding the nuclear industry from the ground up, Shah and his team took a different approach. Clean Core created a new type of fuel that blends thorium with a more concentrated type of uranium called HALEU (high-assay low-enriched uranium). This blended fuel can be used in India’s pressurized heavy-water reactors, which make up the bulk of the country’s existing fleet and many of the new units under development now.

Thorium isn’t a fissile material itself, meaning its atoms aren’t inherently unstable enough for an extra neutron to easily split the nuclei and release energy. But the metal has what’s known as “fertile properties,” meaning it can absorb neutrons and transform into the fissile material uranium-233. Uranium-233 produces fewer long-lived radioactive isotopes than the uranium-235 that makes up the fissionable part of traditional fuel pellets. Most commercial reactors run on low-enriched uranium, which is about 5% U-235. When the fuel is spent, roughly 95% of the energy potential is left in the metal. And what remains is a highly toxic cocktail of long-lived radioactive isotopes such as cesium-137 and plutonium-239, which keep the waste dangerous for tens of thousands of years. Another concern is that the plutonium could be extracted for use in weapons.

Enriched up to 20%, HALEU allows reactors to extract more of the available energy and thus reduce the volume of waste. Clean Core’s fuel goes further: The HALEU provides the initial spark to ignite fertile thorium and triggers a reaction that can burn much hotter and utilize the vast majority of the material in the core, as a study published last year in the journal Nuclear Engineering and Design showed.

Compared with traditional uranium fuel, Clean Core says, its fuel reduces waste by more than 85% while avoiding the most problematic isotopes produced during fission. “The result is a safer, more sustainable cycle that reframes nuclear power not as a source of millennia-long liabilities but as a pathway to cleaner energy and a viable future fuel supply,” says Milan Shah, Clean Core’s chief operating officer and Mehul’s son.

Pressurized heavy-water reactors are particularly well suited to thorium because heavy water—a version of H2O that has an extra neutron on the hydrogen atom—absorbs fewer neutrons during the fission process, increasing efficiency by allowing more neutrons to be captured by the thorium.

There are 46 so-called PHWRs operating worldwide: 17 in Canada, 19 in India, three each in Argentina and South Korea, and two each in China and Romania, according to data from the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 1954, India set out a three-stage development plan for nuclear power that involved eventually phasing thorium into the fuel cycle for its fleet.

Yet in the 56 years since India built its first commercial nuclear plant, its state-controlled industry has remained relatively shut off to the private sector and the rest of the world. When the US signed the 123 Agreement with India in 2008, the moment heralded an era in which the subcontinent could become a testing ground for new American reactor designs.

In 2010, however, India passed the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act. The legislation was based on what lawmakers saw as legal shortcomings in the wake of the 1984 Bhopal chemical factory disaster, when a subsidiary of the American industrial giant Dow Chemical avoided major payouts to the victims of a catastrophe that killed thousands. Under this law, responsibility for an accident at an Indian nuclear plant would fall on suppliers. The statute effectively killed any exports to India, since few companies could shoulder that burden. Only Russia’s state-owned Rosatom charged ahead with exporting reactors to India.

But things are changing. In a joint statement issued after a February 2025 summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump ""announced their commitment to fully realise the US-India 123 Civil Nuclear Agreement by moving forward with plans to work together to build US-designed nuclear reactors in India through large scale localisation and possible technology transfer.”

In March 2025, US federal officials gave the nuclear developer Holtec International an export license to sell Indian companies its as-yet-unbuilt small modular reactors, which are based on the light-water reactor design used in the US. In April, the Indian government suggested it would reform the nuclear liability law to relax rules on foreign companies in hopes of drawing more overseas developers. Last month, a top minister confirmed that the Modi administration would overhaul the law.

“For India, the thing they need to do is get another international vendor in the marketplace,” says Chris Gadomski, the chief nuclear analyst at the consultancy BloombergNEF.

Path of least resistance

But Shah sees larger potential for Clean Core. Unlike Holtec, whose export license was endorsed by the two Mumbai-based industrial giants Larsen & Toubro and Tata Consulting Engineers, Clean Core had its permit approved by two of India’s atomic regulators and its main state-owned nuclear company. By focusing on fuel rather than new reactors, Clean Core could become a vendor to the majority of the existing plants already operating in India.

Its technology diverges not only from that of other US nuclear companies but also from the approach used in China. Last year, China made waves by bringing its first thorium-fueled reactor online. This enabled it to establish a new foothold in a technology the US had invented and then abandoned, and it gave Beijing another leg up in atomic energy.

But scaling that technology will require building out a whole new kind of reactor. That comes at a cost. A recent Johns Hopkins University study found that China’s success in building nuclear reactors stemmed in large part from standardization and repetition of successful designs, virtually all of which have been light-water reactors. Using thorium in existing heavy-water reactors lowers the bar for popularizing the fuel, according to the younger Shah.

“We think ours is the path of least resistance,” Milan Shah says. “Maybe not being completely revolutionary in the way you look at nuclear today, but incredibly evolutionary to progress humanity forward.”

The company has plans to go beyond pressurized heavy-water reactors. Within two years, the elder Shah says, Clean Core plans to design a version of its fuel that could work in the light-water reactors that make up the entire US fleet of 94. But it’s not a simple conversion. For starters, there’s the size: While the PHWR fuel rods are about 50 centimeters in length, the rods that go into light-water reactors are roughly four meters long. Then there’s the history of challenges with light water’s absorption of neutrons that could otherwise be captured to induce fission in the thorium.

For Anil Kakodkar, the former chairman of India’s Atomic Energy Commission and a mentor to Shah, popularizing thorium could help rectify one of the darker chapters in his country’s nuclear development. In 1974, India became the first country since the signing of the first global Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to successfully test an atomic weapon. New Delhi was never a signatory to the pact. But the milestone prompted neighboring Pakistan to develop its own weapons.

In response, President Jimmy Carter tried to demonstrate Washington’s commitment to reversing the Cold War arms race by sacrificing the first US effort to commercialize nuclear waste recycling, since the technology to separate plutonium and other radioisotopes from uranium in spent fuel was widely seen as a potential new source of weapons-grade material. By running its own reactors on thorium, Kakodkar says, India can chart a new path for newcomer nations that want to harness the power of the atom without stoking fears that nuclear weapons capability will spread.

“The proliferation concerns will be dismissed to a significant extent, allowing more rapid growth of nuclear power in emerging countries,” he says. “That will be a good thing for the world at large.”

The grant program was designed under the Biden administration and recipients were announced in 2024.

In a video posted on Aug. 8, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cancellation of “Solar For All.” The program’s termination is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he said, which was passed in July.

The federal solar program was intended to develop installations in low-income communities. Some of the awardees, which reached nationwide, were in the late stages of their projects.

Oklahoma was one of a small handful of states that did not receive direct funding. Two nonprofits, Inclusive Prosperity Capital (IPC) and the Clean Energy Fund of Texas, were tasked with providing resources to Oklahoma and several other states. The organizations are investment funds that finance renewable energy development and other climate-friendly projects.

Tribal nations, including the Caddo Nation, were also subrecipients of the grants. The Oweesta Corporation was awarded $156 million to distribute financial support for solar panels, battery storage and workforce development opportunities to the tribal nations.

Zeldin’s cancellation of the program is one of several efforts by the Trump administration to obstruct renewable energy projects. Trump’s megabill set expiration dates for tax credits on wind and solar, electric vehicles and home energy efficiency products like heat pumps.

Some entities, including IPC, have indicated they plan to challenge the cancellation.

“We don't accept this termination,” CEO Kerry O’Neill said. “We believe it's illegal, and we are going to fight through all kinds of avenues that we're able to.”

A spokesperson for the Clean Energy Fund of Texas declined to comment on the state of the program.

O’Neill said IPC did not yet have specific plans for Oklahoma, but at least one organization from the state attended the group’s informational webinars.

“To me, this just speaks to, ‘Wow, we had these, kind of, carefully laid stage plans – we were going to be able to accelerate all that – it was going to happen much faster because communities want this,” she said. “People want this.”

“The small businesses who are trying to figure out how to grow their solar businesses in states like Oklahoma want it now.”

As projections for electricity demand soar, O’Neill said the solar installations would have saved families a minimum of 20% on their bills.

Welcome to the profoundly undemocratic world of the Rhode Island legislature.
But if you’re like me, and believe that the role played by state government is more important than ever, you can take action right here in Rhode Island.","The message from the federal government is clear – to hell with the planet.

On Aug. 22, the Trump administration ordered a halt to construction on a wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is 80% complete and has the capacity to produce enough clean energy to power 350,000 homes. The project also creates hundreds of well-paying union jobs (now hundreds of layoffs) and has the potential to control skyrocketing electric rates.

It’s further evidence that the current administration is determined to crush alternative energy.

The bully-in-chief is not going to halt his all-out attack on clean energy, so we need to step up our game on the state level. With this in mind, I urge you to turn away from the federal train wreck for a moment and focus on our own state legislature’s failure to address the climate crisis.

Earlier this year, 19 of the 20 climate bills championed by Rhode Island environmental groups died a silent death in the state legislature, most of them because leadership didn’t allow a vote. One of those 19 bills involved the purchase of clean energy from local offshore wind projects, which would have helped reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, save precious union jobs, and maintain Rhode Island’s position at the leading edge of renewable energy.

Instead, our state leaders exiled the bill to the Siberia of “further study,” where it died a silent death.

If the leadership in this state – the speaker of the House, the president of the Senate, and the governor – gave two hoots about the environment, they would have allowed legislators to vote on those 19 bills. They would have backed the proposal to buy additional energy from Revolution Wind.

It’s important to note that Rhode Island has several fine legislators who have fought hard for the environment. But rank-and-file legislators have virtually no power in this state because the power is concentrated in the hands of the House speaker and Senate president.

How can this be? How can two legislators be allowed to run the whole show while stripping the people you elect of the opportunity to cast a vote?

Welcome to the profoundly undemocratic world of the Rhode Island legislature. Here’s how it works.

Your legislator files a bill and it’s assigned to committee.

The committee holds a hearing but no vote is taken.

Instead, all bills are automatically referred to “further study.” Most are never heard from again. They just disappear – no public debate, no vote, and no public explanation of what happened to them. Just silence.

The only person with the authority to bring a bill out of the purgatory of “further study” and call a vote is either the Senate president or the House speaker. The committee chair can’t call a vote, nor can a majority of committee members.

The result?

Ordinary legislators – the people you elect to represent your interests – have virtually no power.

There is no public accountability because votes are rare and are always successful because they don’t take place until back-room negotiations have ensured victory.

If this sounds like a good system, you can go back to watching the federal trainwreck and crying out in horror at each day’s travesty.

But if you’re like me, and believe that the role played by state government is more important than ever, you can take action right here in Rhode Island. Your vote still has some influence here, so please, contact your legislators and tell them that 1) you want the state to take meaningful action on the environment and, 2) that you want changes to the rules that will return democracy to the state legislature.

So the company is cutting shifts at the factory that builds the full-size electric vehicles

General Motors’ largest electric vehicles (EVs) are among the most extreme automobiles ever produced. But, like other vehicles at the far ends of capability, they have a limited role in the market.

So, GM is slowing production of its electric monsters. The company will cut some shifts at its Michigan Factory Zero facility for a month.

The move will slow production of the Cadillac Escalade IQ, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Hummer, and GMC Sierra EV.

A company spokesperson told the Detroit Free Press that the move would help the company “align to market dynamics.”

Some of the Most Capable Cars on Earth, but Low Demand for Them

GM’s largest EVs offer extremes of power and capability

Dealers may be unusually motivated to negotiate on price

There just isn’t much demand for a $150,000 ultra-luxury SUV that comfortably seats eight adults, boasts over 500 miles of range in some circumstances, and can launch those eight adults from zero to 60 mph in under five seconds. Yes, the Cadillac Escalade IQ can really do all of that.

The Hummer EV can drive at a 45-degree angle at low speeds (useful navigating trail obstacles or parallel parking) and launch to highway speed as fast as some versions of the Porsche 911 despite weighing as much as two-and-a-half of those cars.

The two pickups, meanwhile, are among the longest-range EVs built yet and offer 510 horsepower in the least powerful trim and 760 in the most.

But they’re all selling slowly. Automakers aim to keep about a 75-day supply of most new cars in dealer inventory, counting those on order.

Take a look at how General Motors’ EPS estimates have been revised over the past 90 days.","U.S. legacy automaker General Motors GM is adjusting production at its Detroit Factory Zero plant. It is scaling back shifts for two EV models to align its output with demand. The company will temporarily cut one shift each for the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ from Sept. 2 to Oct 6. While production of the Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV pickups continues, the slowdown reflects weaker-than-expected U.S. demand for EVs.

Impacted workers will face temporary layoffs but remain eligible for subpay and benefits under GM’s agreement with the United Auto Workers. The shift cuts highlight a tough reality— EV adoption in the United States is not keeping pace with earlier industry optimism.

When General Motors set aggressive EV targets four years ago, federal incentives and supportive regulations under the Biden administration encouraged automakers to double down on electrification. Today, the landscape is very different. The Trump administration has rolled back emissions rules, ended EV purchase incentives and imposed high tariffs — moves that make it harder for automakers like GM to hit earlier production and sales goals.

The company has already been adjusting its EV plans. In April, General Motors temporarily slashed 200 jobs at Factory Zero. In June, it announced $4 billion in spending for mostly gasoline-powered vehicles, signaling that it isn’t going all-in on EVs just yet. Last month, it delayed a second electric truck plant and the Buick brand’s first EV by six months, pushing its earlier target of 1 million North American EVs by 2025 further out of reach.

CFO Paul Jacobson expects production and wholesale volumes of 200,000 to 250,000 EVs in North America this year, with profitability on a contribution-margin basis once output reaches 200,000 units in the fourth quarter. GM wholesaled about 75,000 EVs in the first half, so it has ground to cover.

Other Auto Giants Altering EV Plans

Ford F is also facing similar challenges as it balances EV investment with demand realities. Ford scaled back EV production last year, reducing its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn—where the F-150 Lightning is built—to a single shift, and scrapping plans for an all-electric three-row SUV at its Oakville Assembly Complex in Ontario. At the same time, Ford continues to lean on its hybrid truck lineup to protect margins. This cautious approach reflects the same recalibration GM is making, showing that even legacy leaders must pace their EV rollouts carefully.

Toyota TM has also delayed U.S. production of its planned electric SUV to 2028, a year later than expected, shifting manufacturing to its Kentucky plant. The move allows Toyota to boost output of the high-demand Grand Highlander, offered in gasoline and hybrid versions. With U.S. EV demand softening and federal tax credits ending, Toyota’s delay highlights its cautious strategy of prioritizing hybrids.

The Zacks Rundown for General Motors

Shares of GM have gained around 10% year to date against the industry’s decline of 13%.

From a valuation standpoint, GM trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 0.32, below the industry average. It carries a Value Score of A.

The plan, developed by the Energy and Geoscience Institute (EGI) at the University of Utah in partnership with CoolSky Energy Solutions LLC, applies to Class II underground injection control (UIC) wells at the Lisbon Valley Gas Plant near Moab. Approval ensures the project meets the standards of the Clean Air Act, qualifying it for the federal 45Q tax credit.

The MRV plan was designed by a multidisciplinary team at the University of Utah, including Professors Brian McPherson, Nathan Moodie, Ting Xiao, Eric Edelman, and Dr. Kevin McCormack, along with the Carbon Science Initiative group, working in close collaboration with CoolSky Energy Solutions.

“Bipartisan support is key to scaling carbon manag | RSS.com

According to Sharyn Lie, Director of the Climate Change Division at EPA, the agency reviewed and approved the Lisbon Valley MRV Plan in line with 40 CFR Part 98, Subpart RR of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

Industry stakeholders highlighted the significance of the decision. David Bullion, Chief Technology Advisor at American Helium, noted: “The EPA’s approval further enhances the value of American Helium’s holdings within the Paradox Basin and highlights the long-term commitment for carbon capture and storage of CO2 removed from the processing of our natural gas stream.”

EGI’s Professor Brian McPherson called the approval a “landmark achievement,” adding: “This first MRV Plan for Utah is a landmark achievement. It not only ensures rigorous accounting of carbon dioxide at the Lisbon Valley Gas Plant, but also highlights the University of Utah as a leader in advancing the nation’s goals for responsible carbon management.”

The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author alone.

Earlier this month, the US Department of Transportation re-released $3 billion in funding for electric vehicle fast charging stations. This funding, which had previously been released as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, was paused back in February of this year. Almost $298 million of those unobligated funds are allocated for distribution in Texas.

Building out electric vehicle fast charging stations is important to help our country keep up with technology that can help drive down electricity prices and stabilize our electricity grid while reducing transportation fuel costs and improving air quality.

In order to provide reliable electricity, electric utilities must build infrastructure to serve their highest peak demand. However, electricity grids frequently operate at half this capacity or less. If utilities can sell more electricity during times of low demand, they can spread out their infrastructure costs and reduce the price you pay per kilowatt hour of electricity.

Electric vehicles can play the role of a manageable electricity load that helps fill gaps during lower electricity demand. It doesn’t matter what time of day or day of the week you charge your electric vehicle, as long as your vehicle’s battery is charged enough for you to drive wherever you want to go that week.

Because of this, even if you choose not to own an electric vehicle, having a neighbor who owns one can help lower the cost of your electricity bill. In fact, in a 2024 shareholder update, Pacific Gas and Electric recently announced that, with higher electric vehicle adoption, PG&E expects to be able to reduce their electricity prices by two to three percent.

CPS Energy also recognizes the benefits that electric vehicles offer as a manageable electricity load. That is why they offer $10 off each monthly bill if you do not charge your electric vehicle during their high demand period of 4 pm to 10 pm. And for those who worry that you may forget to charge and then need to plug in during peak demand hours, CPS Energy allows you up to two cheat days per month while still qualifying for this incentive.

Even before a monthly utility bill discount, you can save money on your vehicle fuel bill by driving an electric vehicle. Electric vehicles are inherently more efficient than gasoline powered vehicles, and electricity costs far less than gasoline. For instance, you could drive a new Chevy Equinox EV for 300 miles for the same cost of 4 gallons of regular gas in San Antonio. If you want to compare how far you can drive your current vehicle on one gallon of gas to the distance you could drive any model of electric vehicle, try using this EV savings calculator.

Electric vehicles also help contribute to a more stable electricity grid. More and more electric vehicles are being manufactured with bi-directional charging capability. With bi-directional charging, in addition to charging your car in your garage, you can also transfer electricity from your vehicle’s battery to power your entire home when there is high demand on the grid and wholesale electricity prices are spiking. Powering your home off your vehicle battery during critical times reduces the demand on both your electric utility and the electricity grid. You can also power your home for several days during a blackout. Soon that same technology will be able to be used to not only power your home, but to also sell electricity back onto the grid at critical times, helping power your neighbor’s homes as well.

Owning an electric vehicle offers significant cost savings from both lower maintenance costs and lower fuel costs. By charging primarily at home, Texans can expect to save $1,213 on average per year on fuel costs as compared to gasoline vehicle drivers. However, not everyone can charge at home. For instance, many apartment buildings do not offer electric vehicle chargers. This is an access problem that we need to continue to work on.

You can also reap savings on the purchase of an electric vehicle if you buy before September 30. Federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used electric vehicles will expire after that date. And now that the federal government is re-releasing funds to build out electric vehicle fast charging stations, you can buy with confidence knowing that it will soon be much easier to fast charge your vehicle while on road trips across Texas.

Finally, electric vehicles have no tailpipe, so there are no emissions that come directly from the vehicle. There are still some emissions associated with the electricity that powers electric vehicles, but our electricity grid is getting cleaner every year. In fact, solar and wind generation powered over 40% of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’ electricity generation through June.

The other good news is that my organization, Texas EV Education Project, has been preparing for the re-release of electric vehicle charging station funding. Earlier this year, Texas EV Education Project along with the Alamo Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (the region’s transportation planning agency) hosted workshops with community members to get input on where their tax dollars should be invested to build charging stations.

We look forward to providing input to TxDOT on how to make it more convenient to charge electric vehicles in the San Antonio metro area. Higher electric vehicle adoption benefits all of us, even if you choose not to drive one.",https://i0.wp.com/sanantonioreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1000061150-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-29 13:09:30.681233

(News-Press NOW) -- One of St. Joseph's top employers and a global leader in battery production is engaging key cities and potential sites for development as it prepares to invest billions to advance energy manufacturing in the U.S.

Representatives with Clarios, the Chamber of Commerce and local media gathered for a meet and greet Thursday at the Chamber as an opportunity to strengthen ties with longstanding company cities and learn about its ambitious $6 billion U.S. energy manufacturing investment plan announced in March.

The long-term strategy is multifaceted -- vastly expand the company's footprint as a global leader and innovator in advanced battery production and other energy manufacturing, and strengthen the country's manufacturing prowess and workforce.

""It's almost a generational opportunity that we have here. There's a combination of demand in the marketplace for advanced batteries that we produce and then this resurgence in U.S. manufacturing and bringing manufacturing back to the United States,"" Clarios Chief Communications Officer Tom Downie told News-Press NOW.

The company has more than 900 employees in St. Joseph across its assembly plant and distribution center on Pear Street and Lower Lake Avenue, producing advanced batteries that are found in one out of every three cars worldwide.

Thursday's meet and greet included discussions about the city and the key role its facilities play in Clarios' domestic and global operation.

""St. Joe's a huge part of it. St. Joe is one of our larger facilities and probably one of the top three sites in the U.S.,"" Downie said. ""That's the key part of this ... to better understand what their needs are and how we might be able to work together in the future.""

A vital component of Clarios' investment plan includes a new state-of-the-art Manufacturing Technology & Training Center, designed as a hub for workforce development and the next generation of manufacturing research and development, including critical technologies like robotics, AI-augmented vision systems, autonomous material handling and manufacturing software.

Clarios views those technologies as key to improving its battery production network and energy storage capabilities for the years ahead.

""As vehicle technology advances, vehicles are becoming software dependent ... those vehicles require more input from the low voltage network,"" Downie said. ""Part of the $6 billion, there's $1 billion we've set aside to come up with new types of batteries to be able to serve those vehicles.""

The company is actively working to identify a location and hopes to make a decision by the by the end of the year.

The facility is one part of Clarios' $6 billion plan, which includes a massive $1 billion critical minerals processing and recovery plant, which is likely to be located in either Indiana, Texas and Utah, the company's first in the U.S.

""Keeping the battery components and the critical minerals that are in those batteries in the U.S., in our supply chain is very important,"" he said.

The processing plant will utilize advanced technologies to extract antimony and other minerals from recycled materials for use in defense and military production, boosting the country's supply of critical minerals and reducing its dependence on foreign sources.

(Trump is shockingly dumb about (electric) energy, Bill McKibben on Substack).","There is a lot of chatter in the national news media about the price of electricity. We are apparently in a war with China over dominance in artificial intelligence, which requires a lot of electricity. National Public Radio reported, “Electricity prices are climbing more than twice as fast as inflation.” We don’t hear that so much here in Iowa except on national media. Why? According to Bill McKibben, “The average Iowan will spend 39% less on electricity than the average American because it produces 57 percent of its electricity from the wind, the second-biggest wind state in the country.” If you throw solar arrays, and other renewable energy into the mix, Iowa’s total share of renewables is 64 percent.

Spoiled as I am by normally low electricity rates, when last month’s electric bill arrived it was 51 percent higher than the same period last year. What the heck? Although the total amount of the bill was comparatively low — typical for Iowa — I had to look at it.

The price per kWh of electricity from our regulated electric cooperative has been stable and predictable. It wasn’t a rate change that caused our increase. Our monthly usage increased from 429 kWh to 745 kWh. The average American household usage is much higher than that. The reason for higher costs was this increased usage.

What happened? The average temperature increased by four degrees year over year. We likely ran the air conditioner more because of it. It was also oppressively hot this July, which meant spending more time indoors and using more electricity with the washer, dryer, stove and our electronic devices. We also had a millennial house guest for an extended stay. They did online streaming from here with a multitude of electric devices which sucked more juice. In sum, the increase was explainable.

Why are people concerned about increasing electricity costs? Donald J. Trump is president. He does not seem well educated about electricity.

On Trump’s first day in office he declared an “energy emergency” for made up reasons. The unstated reason is he extorted oil, gas and coal companies. “Candidate Trump literally told the fossil fuel industry they could have anything they want if they gave massive contributions to his campaign, and then they did,” according to McKibben. Trump’s payback for the bribe was to hobble the renewable energy industry.

The Trump administration immediately began to do absolutely everything in in its power to stop this trend (to develop more sun, wind, and batteries) and replace it with old-fashioned energy—gas, and coal. They have rescinded environmental regulations trying to control fossil fuel pollution, ended sun and wind projects on federal land, cancelled wind projects wherever they could, ended the IRA tax credits for clean energy construction and instead added subsidies for the coal industry. Again—short of tasking Elon Musk to erect a large space-based shield to blot out the sun, they’ve done literally everything possible to derail the transition to cheap clean energy. (Trump is shockingly dumb about (electric) energy, Bill McKibben on Substack).

More than ninety percent of new electric generation around the world last year came from clean energy. This was not because everyone in the energy business had “gone woke,” McKibben wrote. Texas, arguably the most un-woke place in the U.S., installed more renewable capacity than any other state last year. It was because you could do it cheaply and quickly—we live on a planet where the cheapest way to make power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun.

I don’t know what happened to Republicans. Senator Chuck Grassley used to be one of the big supporters of wind energy in Iowa because of the way wind turbine arrays meshed with farm operations, giving a farmer another revenue stream.

Under Trump we have taken a step backward and let China, Europe, and literally everyone else take the lead in developing the electricity of the future which taps power directly from the sun.

We can and must do better than this as we consider our energy future.",https://blogforiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pexels-photo-356036.jpeg,N,,2025-08-29 13:12:40.301084

PosiGen laid off 78 people from its offices in Shelton, Danbury and Wethersfield on Sunday, Aug. 24.

In a letter notifying the cities of the layoffs, the company’s chief administrative officer wrote that the company was ceasing “most of its operations throughout the United States, effective immediately.” The company said it was experiencing “significant financial difficulties” made worse by the Trump administration’s spending and tax package, which will end solar tax credits by the end of 2025.

Connecticut Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff (D-Norwalk) criticized the Trump administration for the job losses.

“President Trump talks a big game about standing up for the working man, but the truth is he’s left 78 Connecticut families without a paycheck,” Duff said in a statement. “These are blue-collar jobs that built our clean energy future. Now they’re gone because Trump needed the money for tax cuts for billionaires and his corrupt circle.”

The layoffs at PosiGen come days after the Trump administration ordered a halt in construction on Revolution Wind, an offshore wind farm in Connecticut and Rhode Island, which could threaten more than 1,000 additional jobs.

An uncertain future for green jobs in the state

PosiGen is based in Louisiana and was set to supply more solar panels to Connecticut residents through Solar for All, a federal grant program that awarded $62.4 million to the state last year. But the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled the program earlier this month, terminating the funds that were sent to Connecticut.

Aziz Dehkan, executive director of the Connecticut Roundtable on Climate and Jobs, said the job losses stand to set the state’s green job economy back by years.

“We had a robust, green, renewable energy policy in the state that created green jobs and we're just losing them daily it seems like,” Dehkan said. “What's the next one that's going to happen is really the question here.”

U.S. Rep. John Larson, a Democrat, said the layoffs at PosiGen, and the Trump administration’s move to halt construction on Revolution Wind, would hurt the pocketbooks of consumers.

“If these misguided and vindictive actions are not reversed, thousands of Connecticut households will be stuck paying more for their electricity from an increasingly unreliable power grid for years to come,” Larson said in a statement.

Following the layoff notice, PosiGen now has eight employees remaining in Connecticut. Those workers are expected to be laid off by Sept. 13 if the company can't obtain financing or sell the company.

“The uncertainty that's being caused by the federal government, one by one, ending tax credits or closing down renewable energy projects, hurts everybody,” Dekhan said. “It hurts the economy. It hurts the climate.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/522f5ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4334+0+585/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F98%2Fab%2F21c190c4449fb5b6f359b1038d5c%2F230405-nenc-20230405-nhpr-community-power-keene-00001.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 13:12:49.254436

New EV sales in the U.S. have increased 8.7% month-over-month and 10.1% year-over-year. This may be driven by consumers rushing to qualify for federal EV tax credits before they expire on September 30th of this year.

As more electric vehicles hit the roads, raw materials will be needed for battery production.

At the same time, strategies need to be in place to handle the recycling of end-of-life lithium-ion batteries, which typically degrade after about eight to ten years, according to a study on ScienceDirect.

Syensqo and Cylib's optimized and efficient recycling process for EV batteries will help further the European Union's recycling objectives, which were set in place two years ago, according to the statement.

They require that recyclers recover 50% of the lithium content in battery waste by 2027, and no less than 80% by the end of 2031.

The market for EV battery recycling stood at $0.54 billion in 2024, but is projected to balloon to $23.72 billion by 2035.

Reducing the environmental impact of these components and the expected resource scarcity, particularly for lithium, cobalt, and nickel, are key factors for growth in the sector.

Recycled materials can often cost less than extracting more from the earth, and they help expand localized supply chains, enhance sustainability, and further reduce costs.

Companies like Porsche, Toyota, and BMW are working to recycle their old EV batteries to recover raw materials for production, while GE plans to give them a second life as grid-supporting energy storage systems.

Mining projects can impact habitats and biodiversity, while also polluting the soil and nearby waterways.

By reclaiming materials from old products, we can reduce the need for new mining operations and increase the circular economy, where waste becomes a new resource.

The build marks a key step towards supplying next-generation modular nuclear energy for data centres.

The Aalo-X is an experimental extra modular reactor (XMR), positioned next to INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

Aalo aims for the reactor to achieve criticality – the point at which a nuclear reaction becomes self-sustaining – by 4 July 2026.

The milestone follows the company’s selection by the US Department of Energy (DOE) as part of a competitive application process to participate in the new pilot programme.

Backing from federal government and national lab

The Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program was launched by the DOE in June 2025 following Executive Order 14301.

The initiative reforms reactor testing protocols, enabling advanced nuclear designs to be authorised for testing at sites outside traditional national laboratory settings. The programme is intended to accelerate commercial licensing and deployment of nuclear reactors across new use cases – including the rising power demands of the data centre sector.

Matt Loszak, Co-founder and CEO of Aalo Atomics, says the selection is a clear signal of public-private alignment.

“Our selection for the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program is a significant catalyst for achieving our goal of going from ‘founding to fission’ in less than three years – a feat many deemed impossible just a year ago,” Matt says.

“This milestone groundbreaking event is a testament to the potential that can be unlocked when public entities and private companies partner together in the critical interest of the nation. This is a pivotal time for the US nuclear energy industry and we are incredibly proud to be at the forefront.”

The pilot site at INL provides testing grounds for technologies designed to improve energy scalability, reliability and deployment speed. These features are becoming increasingly valuable as data centre operators search for secure, non-intermittent power sources with minimal environmental impact.

“Today’s groundbreaking symbolises the progress that can be achieved when innovation, vision and national purpose come together,” says John Wagner, Laboratory Director at INL.

“At Idaho National Laboratory, we are proud to support the Department of Energy’s efforts to accelerate advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen America’s energy security, provide reliable power, and inspire the next generation of innovators.

“Projects like Aalo-X reflect the promise of nuclear energy to meet our nation’s historic demand growth and help enable a more prosperous future for our nation.”

Designed to meet growing data centre demand

The Aalo-X reactor is a smaller-scale forerunner to Aalo’s commercial offering: the Aalo Pod. Designed specifically to supply power to data centres, the Aalo Pod is a 50 MWe XMR power plant built around five Aalo-1 sodium-cooled reactors. These use low-enriched uranium dioxide fuel, selected for its safety record and ready availability.

Unlike traditional nuclear plants, the Aalo Pod does not require an external water source and is built for direct onsite deployment. Its compact size and fully modular design allow operators to scale from megawatts to gigawatts with minimal disruption or permitting complexity.

The company will manufacture Aalo-X at its 40,000-square-foot pilot facility in Austin, Texas. Once complete, the reactor will be transported to INL for installation and commissioning. Lessons from Aalo-X are expected to inform the commercial deployment of Aalo Pods, which the company aims to bring to market by 2029.

Yasir Arafat, Co-founder and CTO at Aalo Atomics, previously led the MARVEL microreactor project at INL. He says: “When Aalo-X achieves criticality next year, it will become the first new sodium-cooled reactor to start operation in the US in over four decades. Aalo-X is just the beginning as we are poised to deploy nuclear power on a scale that far exceeds the first atomic age.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/0fec9fbc1369722e542ba16fb0b68e69:a61f6529665fadc8b4381bad6e52aef0/matt-loszak-co-founder-and-ceo-of-aalo-atomics.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 18:04:52.758219

From the July / August 2025 Issue

In June 2024, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry signed legislation that aimed to fulfill the state’s approach to economic development and revitalize business investment and job creation. SB 494, better known as the “Positioning Louisiana to Win” bill, modernizes the structure of Louisiana Economic Development so it can better attract new business and more effectively support the companies already in the state.

The legislation established a private sector-led board charged with developing an economic development strategic plan and advising on policies, programs and initiatives that promote economic growth in the state.

Supported by SB 494, Louisiana saw 183 active projects as of December 2024. These projects created more than 32,220 potential new jobs, 18,000 retained jobs, and more than $87.6 billion in potential capital expenditures. In total, Louisiana finished the year with $16.1 billion in capital investment, with over 9,000 newly created jobs and around 4,000 jobs retained.

Lafayette: Hub Of Innovation & Business Excellence

Located midway between Houston and New Orleans, Lafayette, Louisiana combines a pro-business climate, talent-producing universities, and small-town quality of life to create a Gulf Coast hot spot for business and talent.

With its strategic location at the crossroads of Interstates 10 and 49, Lafayette has positioned itself as an ideal destination for businesses in technology, manufacturing, and logistics sectors—paving the way for unprecedented growth and innovation.

The Lafayette Parish (county) business base spans manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, information technology, oilfield services, and other professional services industries. The region is anchored by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, a Carnegie R1 research institution, and South Louisiana Community College (SoLAcc), an Aspen Top 150 community college. Lafayette’s economic resilience stems from its entrepreneurial spirit, strategic growth in foundational sectors, and residents who embrace a strong work ethic. With this foundation, Lafayette fosters an economy that supports thriving and diverse industry sectors.

Recent business announcements underscore Lafayette’s appeal to innovative companies. Blueflite, a pioneering drone technology company, chose Lafayette as its base of operations to develop revolutionary medical logistics and emergency response technology. Backed by an investment from Ochsner Louisiana Innovation Fund and a strategic partnership with Acadian Ambulance, Blueflite exemplifies how Lafayette’s collaborative environment helps innovative companies thrive.

The partnership between global tech leader CGI, UL Lafayette, and SoLAcc demonstrates Lafayette’s commitment to workforce development. Together, they created new degree programs, collaborated on curriculum development, and launched Louisiana’s first Master of Science degree in Informatics. CGI’s Project Based Learning Program offers real-world experiences for Computer Science and Informatics students, while SoLAcc’s 2+2 transfer agreement for Software Application Development supports the pipeline. This collaboration helped CGI create more than 700 jobs at its U.S. Onshore Delivery Center in Lafayette.

Building on a decade of tech wins, Lafayette Economic Development Authority (LEDA) partnered with One Acadiana and prominent tech executives to launch the Lafayette Regional Technology Council through the Opportunity Machine, the regional tech business accelerator. The council focuses on retaining, growing, and attracting tech talent while advocating for tech-friendly public policy.

SafeSource Direct exemplifies Lafayette’s development advantages by locating on one of Lafayette’s Certified Sites. These sites undergo extensive review including environmental studies, soil analyses, and zoning analysis, ensuring compliance and development readiness. Building on a Certified Site allowed SafeSource Direct to launch operations in just 11 months.

Adding to Lafayette’s retail appeal, Buc-ee’s, the Texas-based travel center chain, announced plans for a Lafayette location on Interstate 10, recognizing the region’s strategic position for southeast expansion.

The LEDA Team works with state and local partners to support existing and prospective businesses seeking a low-cost, high-quality location. LEDA can offer competitive local incentives including performance-based cash grants, Tax Increment Financing (TIFs), and Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOTs) to complement state-level incentives.

The rule, which was implemented in 2023 intended to reduce emissions of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen, mandates roadside emissions screening and periodic emissions testing for non-gasoline heavy-duty vehicles operating in California.
The EPA’s proposal would allow California to implement the HD I/M rule for heavy-duty vehicles registered in the state.
The EPA’s disapproval comes after Congress recently revoked California’s vehicle emissions waivers, which included stringent emissions requirements for heavy-duty vehicles, and the federal government’s recent challenges to the state’s Clean Truck Partnership.
“California was not, and has never been, duly elected by the American people to run our great country,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to disapprove of California’s Heavy-Duty (HD) Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Requirements as it applies to out-of-state and out-of-country vehicles.

The EPA’s disapproval comes after Congress recently revoked California’s vehicle emissions waivers, which included stringent emissions requirements for heavy-duty vehicles, and the federal government’s recent challenges to the state’s Clean Truck Partnership.

“California was not, and has never been, duly elected by the American people to run our great country,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said. “The state’s power grab knows no bounds. EPA will not allow California to violate federal law, and we will not sit idly by while, in the name of climate change, they raise the cost of living on all Americans who rely on truck drivers and the products they deliver across the country.”

The HD I/M requirement is part of California’s State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted for approval to the EPA. A SIP, as mandated by the Clean Air Act, includes the regulations used by a state or local air district to implement and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) as required under the Clean Air Act.

The EPA proposes to disapprove of the state’s application of the HD I/M rule to out-of-state trucks “due to concerns that this requirement violates the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause and this inconsistency with Federal law also violates Section 110 of the Clean Air Act.” Additionally, the EPA states that California’s application of the HD I/M rule to foreign vehicles “appears to ignore the fundamental principal that powers related to foreign affairs are solely vested by the Federal government.”

“California’s approach,” according to the EPA, “appears to be part of a larger strategy to drive out affordable trucks and products based on an extreme climate ideology.”

The proposed partial disapproval and partial approval will be open for public comment for 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y3cU!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe96c6683-f89f-4e94-ae4e-420cf401bfa8_200x200.jpeg",N,,2025-08-29 13:11:40.573954

This is a heckuva time for a startup to launch a new EV into the market, but the Jeff Bezos-linked venture Slate Auto has just earned a fresh burst of attention from the automotive press, so let’s take a look and see how the company expects to motivate car shoppers to save their egg money and make room in their budgets for the company’s first EV, the Blank Slate pickup truck.

Slate Auto Dreams Of A New EV, Tax Credit Or Not

Slate Auto burst out of stealth mode in April with the unveiling of its first new EV, a pickup truck that earned the title “Anti-Cybertruck” from CleanTechnica’s Steve Hanley for its lightweight, stripped-down, low-tech footprint and price point of less than $20,000 with the $7,500 federal tax credit in play (see our complete Slate Auto archive here).

However, the tax credit will not be in play when the new EV finally rolls off the assembly line. Thanks to US President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress, the tax credit will expire on September 30.

Still, Slate Auto is forging ahead. As befits its new EV-on-a-budget business model, the company has been refurbishing a former printing plant in Warsaw, Indiana, to produce the Blank Slate pickup along with other variants on the same platform. As for how one might expect to squeeze an entire auto assembly line into a former printing plant, that’s the Slate penny-pinching model in action.

Stripped down to the bare essentials, the new EV only requires about 600 parts, compared to thousands of parts for a typical truck. Slate expects customers to take their new EV as-is, saving space on paint shops and trim stations.

Republican Welcomes New EV Factory — Shocker!

Slate Auto held an open house at the Warsaw factory earlier this week, where demolition work was still very much in evidence. Despite the somewhat bare-bones background, the mood among local officials was celebratory. When the printing plant closed in 2023, it wiped out 525 jobs. Once the new factory is up to full speed, more than 2,000 jobs will pour in, along with a $400 million investment on the part of Slate.

Well, money talks. Despite having voted to kill the $7,500 tax credit, US Representative Rudy Yakym of Indiana’s District 2 made sure to give himself credit for shepherding the new EV factory into life, having voted in to pass the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” along with the rest of the Republican majority in Congress.

The news organization Greater Fort Wayne Business Weekly was among those broadcasting Yakym’s enthusiastic endorsement of the vehicle electrification movement.

“Slate is proof that when we keep the made in America provisions strong, companies step up and they build right here at home. And thanks to things like immediate expensing and common sense tax reform in the One Big Beautiful Bill…new manufacturers like Slate can put shovels in the ground faster and hire workers sooner and get their trucks on the road without delay,” Yakym commented.

Here Comes The Anti-Cybertruck

It’s not clear how the timeline works out there. After all, the new bill was not signed into law until July, after Slate acquired the Warsaw space, organized its supply chain, and ordered up the assembly line equipment.

It’s also not clear how any ordinary run-of-the-mill new manufacturers are supposed to launch new operations in the fraught environment of Trump’s tariff wars, especially in the auto industry. Slate started life as an exception, not the rule. The company’s Series A haul totaled $111 million in 2023. In May, Newsweek reported that a Series B round brought the figure up to $700 million in 2024.

“The funding comes from Bezos Expeditions, General Catalyst and TWG Global, among other investors,” Newsweek noted, with Bezos Expeditions referring to the personal investment portfolio of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

“General Catalyst, a venture capital firm, has a varied portfolio that also includes cosmetics company Beauty Pie, image software company Canva and online travel search tool Kayak, among others,” Newsweek added.

Although Jeff Bezos and Amazon have acquired some brand reputation baggage to carry around, it’s difficult to find any bona fide brand reputation crisis that compares to the bonfire Tesla CEO Elon Musk lit when he bankrolled his way into the White House and proceeded to tear the US government apart, brick by prick and human by human, sparking a swift and sudden downturn in Tesla EV sales.

The reputational crisis is continuing to spin out in all directions as Tesla attempts to venture beyond its passenger car lineup with new EV platforms. The Cybertruck “pickup truck” began life with a respectable sales record only to devolve into an an Edsel-worthy flop in short order. Tesla’s only other distinctive new EV is the much-delayed Semi Class 8 heavy duty truck, which is already facing stiff competition from startups and legacy truck makers alike.

The Face Behind The New EV

With that in mind, if you can name the CEO of Tesla and the CEO of Slate Auto both off the top of your head, run right out and buy yourself a cigar.

There’s no shame in only getting as far as the Tesla part. After all, Tesla CEO Elon Musk helicoptered into the former Tesla Motors startup in 20024, fresh off a $175 million payout from eBay in 2002, soon cultivating the image of a high-flying engineering genius beloved by gearheads and technophiles around the world. Everyone knows who Elon Musk is.

Slate Auto CEO Chris Barman, not so much. Barman came to Slate with multiple decades worth of related experience under her belt, having earned master’s degrees in both mechanical engineering and business leading up to a slot at the Chrysler Institute of Engineering in 1994. By 2014 she was vice president of systems and component engineering at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles North America.

Reflecting Barman’s experience and reputation in the auto industry, Slate expects that its new EV will appeal to broad swaths of the auto-buying public that have been overlooked by the hype over “Full Self-Driving” and touch-screen controls. That includes the many modders and makers circulating around in the automotive aftermarket, as well as drivers in search of an affordable zero emission ride.

“When a natural disaster strikes, local communities need a public water system they can count on,” added EPA Regional Administrator Kevin McOmber.
“Clean, safe drinking water is something folks sometimes take for granted until disaster strikes.","Earlier in August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it would allocate $409.4 million to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) for public water systems to improve local drinking water utility infrastructure so their systems can better withstand natural disasters.

“In February, I visited communities in Asheville to witness firsthand the crucial role drinking water utilities have in responding to natural disasters,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “This funding to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality will help secure the infrastructure of these systems to ensure EPA can fulfill its core mission to protect human health and the environment.”

The funds are part of the 2025 Supplemental Appropriation for Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Hawaii Wildfires, administered by the State Revolving Fund.

“When a natural disaster strikes, local communities need a public water system they can count on,” added EPA Regional Administrator Kevin McOmber. “These funds will help local governments create resilient systems that can better withstand floods, fires and other weather events so the water keeps flowing.”

“As mayor of Hot Springs, I’ve seen firsthand how storms can disrupt the lives of every person in our small community,” said Town of Hot Springs Mayor Abigail L. Norton. “Clean, safe drinking water is something folks sometimes take for granted until disaster strikes. This funding means our town can protect our water and our people for years to come. We’re grateful to the EPA and NCDEQ for helping Hot Springs build a future where families can feel secure, no matter what nature throws our way.”

“Helene completely destroyed both of the Town of Burnsville’s raw water intakes, leaving residents, businesses, schools, medical facilities and government agencies without water,” said Town of Burnsville Mayor Russell Fox. “The town is still running on a temporary pumping system until the primary intake system can be rebuilt. The cost of providing water service to users has increased dramatically since the storm. The need for funding is always an issue but even more so now. We need to strengthen our systems against disasters, and the EPA funding has given us that opportunity. The Town of Burnsville is very grateful.”

“The Town of Old Forts water system was destroyed by Hurricane Helene,” said Town of Old Forts Mayor Pam Snypes. “Fortunately, our citizens were provided water as quickly as possible, but it was provided with Band-aid repairs. Over the last ten months the town has been working to make those repairs more efficient. Repairs are very expensive. The availability of these funds will provide a way to ensure going forward that out water system will be a stable system in the event another disaster occurs.”",https://waterfm.com/wp-content/uploads/flooded-road-e1756482030289.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 13:16:06.213545

“Seeing our floaters lowered into the water for the first time — and having it shared live on Good Morning America - is a moment of great pride, not only for Eco Wave Power but for the future of clean energy innovation” said Inna Braverman, Founder and CEO of Eco Wave Power. “This pilot station is a vital step in demonstrating how wave energy can be harnessed using existing marine infrastructure, while laying the groundwork for full-scale commercialisation in the United States.”

The Los Angeles project is designed as a demonstration station, with the following objectives:

Showcase Eco Wave Power's patented onshore technology in US marine conditions

Support environmental monitoring and regulatory processes in collaboration with local stakeholders and authorities, including the US Army Corps of Engineers

Serve as an educational hub for industry partners, regulators, and potential customers

Establish a foundation for future grid-connected commercial wave energy projects in the US

Eco Wave Power partnered with California-based companies to bring this project to life, including All-Ways Metal - which produced the innovative floaters - and C&S Welding Inc, which performed the installation.

Eco Wave Power's patented onshore wave energy system attaches floaters to existing marine structures. The up-and-down motion of the waves drives hydraulic cylinders, which send pressurised fluid to a land-based energy conversion unit that generates electricity.

The key advantages of this technology are that there is no footprint on the seabed, which minimises environmental impact, and that it features a modular, low-maintenance design optimised for prots and coastal environments.

The high-visibility pilot forms a key part of Eco Wave Power's US commercialisation strategy and strengthens the company's 404.7 MW global project pipeline, which also includes upcoming operational sites in Taiwan, India, and Portugal, alongside its grid-connected station in Israel.

Murray: “No lawmaker should accept this absurd, illegal ploy to steal their constitutional power to determine how taxpayer dollars get spent.”

Trump asks Congress to claw back billions in bipartisan national security investments—and incorrectly insists that the timing of his request allows him to zero out the funds unilaterally

Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, issued the following statement on President Trump’s new request to rescind nearly $5 billion in funding that Congress has provided and that has been signed into law:

“Donald Trump wants to zero out more bipartisan investments in our national security and global leadership. This time, however, he is attempting to do an end run around Congress altogether. No lawmaker should accept this absurd, illegal ploy to steal their constitutional power to determine how taxpayer dollars get spent.

“Russ Vought would like us all to believe that making this rescissions request just weeks away from the end of the fiscal year provides some sort of get-out-of-jail-free card for this administration to simply not spend investments Congress has made; it emphatically does not. Legal experts have made clear this scheme is illegal, and so have my Republican colleagues.

“Republicans should not accept Russ Vought’s brazen attempt to usurp their own power. No president has a line item veto—and certainly not a retroactive line-item veto. Congress should reject this request and this ridiculous, illegal maneuver—and instead insist on making decisions over spending through the bipartisan appropriations process.

“Illegally zeroing out these funds doesn’t put America first—it puts China first. Eliminating these investments will give up America’s seat at the table, retreating from key decision-making bodies and ceding ground to countries like China at a critical moment. Abandoning allies and partners around the world and cutting funding for peacekeeping efforts doesn’t make America more safe, it helps conflicts spiral out of control and threaten our own security. This should be rejected outright.

“Importantly, there are many billions of dollars more that this administration continues to illegally hold up, robbing communities across America. It must release all of these investments Congress has made.”

President Trump made the rescissions request under a fast-tracked process provided by the Impoundment Control Act (the same law President Trump and his budget director, Russ Vought, claim is unconstitutional). The process allows a president to request Congress rescind federal funding with a simple majority vote in each chamber. Under the law, if a bill rescinding some or all of the funding is not passed within 45 days of continuous session, the president must release the funding.

But Russ Vought and this administration have wrongly—and absurdly—insisted that making a rescissions request with fewer than 45 days until the end of the fiscal year (when the particular funds would otherwise expire) allows the president to cancel the funding with or without the approval of Congress—through what they call a “pocket rescission.” This fringe legal theory has been repeatedly rebuffed by legal experts, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike. GAO has plainly stated this gambit is illegal, as have top Republican lawmakers.

President Trump’s rescissions request asks Congress to claw back $4.9 billion in national security investments, including:

$445 million in security assistance provided in the Peacekeeping Operations/National Security Engagement account, which supports counterterrorism in Somalia and the Sahel, cybersecurity assistance for key African partners, and other military-centric initiatives to counter terrorist organizations and counter Russian and Chinese influence, particularly in Africa. No programs are specifically spared in the request.

$3.2 billion from the Development Assistance account (the entire remaining amount of funds), including to rescind the majority of funds from:

Food security and agricultural research programs, including the Innovation Labs at universities across the country;

The Countering PRC Influence Fund;

Efforts to limit irregular migration to the United States;

Initiatives to strengthen the investment climate and create opportunities for U.S. companies to expand and compete in overseas markets;

Support for clean water, efforts to sustain education in conflict environments, and other initiatives that save lives and mitigate insecurity; and

Many other bipartisan initiatives.

$322 million from the Democracy Fund, including funds used to counter repressive regimes.

$913 million from U.S. treaty dues to the United Nations, including to support peacekeeping missions. As a recent Trump administration report notes, failure to pay our dues can impair the ability of UN entities and peacekeeping missions to operate, which ultimately undermines U.S. interests. The Chinese government is actively seeking to expand its influence in these bodies, including through increased financial support.

Once again, the Trump administration is citing cherry-picked examples of past projects and initiatives that it finds objectionable and that were funded by these larger funding streams as a means of justifying cancelling billions of dollars in funding. The reality is this administration has flexibility to determine how exactly to fulfill the objectives provided by Congress for this funding—just as any administration does.

The NCDA welcomed the news, which will see the addition of more than 480 public and fleet chargers across the province to improve access for EV drivers. But the association also cautioned that charging infrastructure alone will not deliver the federal government and B.C.’s ambitious zero-emission vehicle targets “without action on affordability and policy timelines.”

“This investment is good news, but it won’t matter if British Columbians can’t afford the vehicles,” said Blair Qualey, President and CEO of the NCDA, in a statement. “The federal and provincial governments must re-establish EV rebate programs and put the brakes on unrealistic ZEV mandates. Without immediate action, these targets will remain out of reach — and consumers will be left behind.”

The NCDA said rebates are necessary. The ones under the CleanBC Go Electric program are currently on pause and pending review. And at the federal level, iZEV support is also under review. The association said the programs have been critical to making EVs more affordable for consumers and helping with uptake.

They also cautioned that mandates need a reality check, as the federal government’s national mandate/targets are not achievable due to the incentive situation, market readiness, and conditions that no longer exist. Rather, the association is advocating for a three-pillar approach to EV adoption: affordability through incentives, infrastructure, and education to build consumer confidence.

“All three must work together,” said Qualey. “Government cannot remove one leg of the stool and expect the system to stay upright.

Even though the Democrats managed to name their climate bill the “Inflation Reduction Act,” the administration and the climate movement continued talking about it in terms of jobs, jobs, jobs.
Even clean energy groups, which at first attempted to co-opt Trump’s “energy dominance” frame, can no longer parrot it with a straight face.
The two argue that the mid-transition is a period where fossil fuel systems persist alongside the growing clean energy sector.
“She's not just saying, oh, clean energy will automatically lower bills if you just unleash it.","During the August recess, while members of Congress were back home facing their constituents, climate and environmental groups went on the offensive, sending a blitz of ads targeting vulnerable Republicans in their districts. The message was specific, straightforward, and had nothing to do with the warming planet.

“Check your electric bill lately? Rep. Mark Amodei just voted for it to go up,” declared a billboard in Reno, Nevada, sponsored by the advocacy group Climate Power.

“They promised to bring down prices, but instead our congressman, Derrick Van Orden, just voted to make our monthly bills go up,” a YouTube ad told viewers in Wisconsin’s 3rd district. “It removes clean energy from the electric grid, creating a massive rate hike on electricity,” the voiceover says, while the words “VAN ORDEN’S PLAN: ELECTRICITY RATE HIKE” flash on screen. The ad, paid for by Climate Power, the League of Conservation Voters, and House Majority Forward, a progressive campaign group, was shown more than a million times from August 13 to 27, according to Google’s ad transparency center.

Both were part of a larger, $12 million campaign the groups launched over the recess in collaboration with organizations including EDF Action and Climate Emergency Advocates. Similar billboards and digital ads targeted Republicans in more than a dozen other districts in Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. There were also TV spots, partnerships with Instagram influencers, bus stop posters, and in-person rallies outside district offices — all blaming Republicans in Congress for the increasing cost of food, healthcare, and energy.

As others have observed, including Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin back in March, rising utility rates and the broader cost of living crisis are becoming a political liability for Republicans and President Trump. Clean energy advocates are attempting to capitalize on that, trying to get Americans to connect the dots between their mounting electricity bills and their representatives in Congress who voted to cut support for renewable energy.

Some of this is run-of-the-mill politicking, but it’s not only that. It also represents a strategic shift in how the climate movement talks about the energy transition.

It’s not new for green groups to make the argument that renewable energy can save people money. Relying on “free” wind and sun rather than fuels that are subject to price volatility has always been part of the sell, and the plummeting cost of solar panels and wind turbines have only made that pitch more compelling.

But it is new for the affordability argument to come first — above job creation, economic development, reducing pollution, and, of course, tackling climate change.

For most of the past four years, the climate movement has gone all in on trying to build an association in the American mind between the transition to clean energy and jobs. “When I think of climate change, I think of jobs,” then-candidate Joe Biden said during one of his 2020 campaign speeches.

It made sense at the time, Daniel Aldana Cohen, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, told me. Just two years earlier, the Sunrise Movement had emerged as a political force with a headline-grabbing rally in Nancy Pelosi’s office demanding “green jobs for all.” The group was joined by then-newly elected Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who soon introduced her framework for a Green New Deal that would offer a “just transition” for fossil fuel workers, ensuring them a place in the new clean energy economy.

The fossil fuel industry had seeded divisions between labor and environmental groups for decades by arguing that regulations kill jobs, and Democrats would have to upend that narrative if they wanted to make progress on climate. But the rationale was also more pressing: Unemployment was skyrocketing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and whoever won the presidency would be responsible for rebuilding the U.S. workforce.

Fast forward to the end of Biden’s first year in office, however, and the unemployment rate had snapped back to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, inflation was rising fast. Even though the Democrats managed to name their climate bill the “Inflation Reduction Act,” the administration and the climate movement continued talking about it in terms of jobs, jobs, jobs.

Cohen co-directs the Climate and Community Institute, a progressive think-tank founded in 2020, and admitted that “from the very start, we would just model every policy with jobs numbers,” partly because modeling the effects of policies on cost of living was a lot more complicated. Now he sees two issues with that approach. For one, it was always going to take time for new manufacturing jobs to materialize — much longer than an election cycle. For another, when unemployment is low, “everybody experiences inflation, but extremely few people experience a good new green job,” Cohen said.

During a recent panel hosted by the Institute for Policy Studies, Ben Beachy, who was a special assistant to Biden for climate policy, expressed some regret about the jobs push. “It wasn't addressing one of the biggest economic concerns of most people at that point, which was the rent is too damn high,” he said. But Beachy also defended the strategy, noting that all of the policies addressing cost of living in Biden’s big climate bill, like money for housing, public transit, and childcare, had been stripped out to appease West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin. “So we were left without a strong policy leg to stand on to say, this is going to lower your costs.”

When the moderator asked what message Beachy thinks climate candidates should run on today, Beachy replied, “affordability, affordability, affordability.”

Jesse Lee, a senior advisor at Climate Power who also worked as a senior communications advisor in the Biden White House, echoed Beachy’s account of what went wrong post-IRA. The cost of living crisis makes it almost impossible to talk about anything else now, he told me. “If you don't start off talking about that, you’ve lost people before you’ve even begun,” he told me.

Average U.S. electricity rates jumped 10% in just the year from 2021 to 2022, and have continued to rise faster than inflation. All evidence suggests the trend will continue. Utilities have already requested or received approval for approximately $29 billion in rate increases this year, according to the nonprofit PowerLines, compared to roughly $12 billion by this time last year. And these increases likely don’t reflect the expected costs associated with ending tax credits for wind and solar, hobbling wind and solar development, and keeping aging, expensive coal plants online.

In mid-July, Climate Power issued a strategy document advising state and local elected officials how to talk about clean energy based on the group’s polling. A post-election poll found that “more than half of Americans (51%) say the main goal of US energy policies should be to lower energy prices,” and that 85% “believe policymakers should do more to lower energy costs.” A more recent poll found that telling voters that “cutting clean energy means America produces less energy overall, and that means families will pay even more to keep the lights on,” was the most persuasive among a variety of arguments for clean energy.

This tracks with our own Heatmap Pro opinion polling, which found that the top perceived benefit of renewables in the U.S. is “lower utility bills” — though while 75% of Democrats believe that argument, only 56% of Republicans do. An affordability frame also aligns with academic research on clean energy communication strategies, which has found that emphasizing cost savings is a more effective and enduring message than job creation, economic development, or climate change mitigation.

The pivot to affordability isn’t just apparent in district-level campaigns to hold Republicans accountable. Almost every press release I’ve received from the climate group Evergreen Action this month has mentioned “soaring power bills” or “Trump’s energy price hike” in reference to various actions the administration has taken to hamstring renewables. Even clean energy groups, which at first attempted to co-opt Trump’s “energy dominance” frame, can no longer parrot it with a straight face. After Trump issued a stop work order on Orsted’s offshore Revolution Wind project, which is 80% built, the American Clean Power Association accused the administration of “raising alarms about rising energy prices while blocking new supply from reaching the grid.”

Several people I spoke to for this story pointed to the example of Mikie Sherill, the Democrat running for governor in New Jersey, who last week vowed to freeze utility rates for a year if elected. She immediately followed that statement with a promise to “massively expand cheaper, cleaner power generation,” including solar and batteries.

Dan Crawford, the senior vice president of Echo Communications Advisors, a climate-focused strategy firm, declared in a recent newsletter that Democrats should “become the party of cheap electricity.” He mused that we may be at an inflection point “where the old politics of clean-vs.-polluting makes way for a new debate of cheap-vs.-expensive.”

Debate is probably too tame a term — the claim to affordability is becoming a full-on messaging war. Last week, President Trump took to social media to declare that states that get power from wind and solar “are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS,” — a claim that has no basis in reality. The Trump administration is leaning heavily on affordability arguments to justify keeping coal plants open. In defense of canceling Revolution Wind, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told Fox News that “this is part of our drive to make sure we’ve got affordable, reliable energy for every American … These are the highest electric prices in the country coming off of these projects.” On Thursday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright posted a news story about his agency rescinding a loan for an offshore wind transmission project, writing that “taxpayers will no longer foot the bill for projects that raise electricity prices and ultimately don't work.”

Clean energy proponents aren’t just going up against Trump — the fossil fuel industry has leaned on affordability as a rhetorical strategy for a long time, Joshua Lappen, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Notre Dame studying the energy transition, told me. Lappen, who lives in California, said cost has been at the forefront of conflicts over climate policy in the state for a while. At the moment, it’s driving a fight over oil refinery closures that threaten to drive up gas prices even more. “I took a trip over the weekend and drove through the Central Valley,” Lappen told me, “and there are placards zip-tied to every gas pump at Chevron stations that are highlighting that state climate policy is increasing the cost of gas.”

I asked Lee, of Climate Power, how the climate movement could make a convincing case when clean energy has become so politically charged. He’s not worried about that right now. “I don’t think we necessarily need to win a debate about what’s cheaper,” he said. “All we have to do is say, Hey, we're in favor of more energy, including wind and solar, and it's nuts, nuts to be taking wind and solar and batteries off the table when we have an energy crisis and when utility rates have gone up 10%.”

That may work for now, at least at the national level. Americans tend to blame whoever is in office for the economic pains of the moment, even though presidents have little influence on prices at the pump and it can take years for policy changes to make their way into utility rates.

But there’s a difference between defensively blaming rising energy costs on the administration’s efforts to block renewable, and making a positive case for the energy transition on the same grounds. While there is an argument for the latter, it’s a lot harder to convey.

The factors pushing up energy prices, such as necessary grid modernization and disaster-related costs, likely aren’t going away, whether or not we build offshore wind farms. Meanwhile, the savings that large-scale wind and solar projects offer won’t be experienced as a reduction in rates — they won’t be experienced at all because they’re measured against a counterfactual world where renewables don’t get built. That’s a lot trickier to communicate in a pithy campaign. People may end up blaming the wind farms either way.

This dilemma is a hallmark of the so-called “mid-transition,” Lappen told me. The term was coined by his advisor, the energy engineer and sociologist Emily Grubert, and Sara Hastings-Simon, a public policy professor at the University of Calgary. The two argue that the mid-transition is a period where fossil fuel systems persist alongside the growing clean energy sector.

“Comparisons of the new system to the old system are likely to rest on experience of a world less affected by climate change, such that concerns about lower reliability, higher costs, and other challenges might be perceived as inherent to zero-carbon systems, versus energy systems facing consequences of climate change and long-term underinvestment,” they write.

To Cohen, advocates need to go a lot further than rhetoric to link clean energy with affordability. “We need to rebuild the brand and then rebuild the investment priorities of climate action so that working class communities see and literally touch direct, tangible benefits in their life,” he said. He described a “green economic populism” with much more public investment in helping renters access green technologies that will lower their bills, for example, or fixing up homes that have deferred maintenance so that they can eventually make energy efficiency improvements.

It’s not about abandoning industrial policy or research and development, Cohen told me, but rather about a shift in emphasis. He pointed to Sherill’s approach. “She's not just saying, oh, clean energy will automatically lower bills if you just unleash it. She's like, I'm going to assertively use the government to guarantee a price freeze, and then I’m going to backfill that with clean energy policies to bring down prices over time.”

To be fair, the IRA did contain policies that would have produced more tangible benefits. The $7 billion Solar for All program would have delivered the benefits of solar — i.e. energy bill savings — to low-income residents all over the country. The remainder of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, of which Solar for All was a part, was set to make a range of other green home upgrades more accessible to the working class, and the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program would have done the same for low-income housing developments and senior living centers. Electric school bus grants and urban tree-planting programs would have brought cleaner, cooler air to communities.

These were huge new programs that were never going to produce results in the span of two years, and now the Trump administration has made every effort to ensure they never do. Whether they would have paid political dividends eventually, we’ll never know. But a successful energy transition may depend on giving it another shot.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTUxMzI1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5Mjk2NTUwMn0.9v39PM-d_G1hescMWmtlo2ZHtprBw-qGtTVwxYHaTy8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-08-29 13:10:03.880134

⁠
September is the last month to claim tax credits that can cut thousands of dollars from new- and used-EV prices, after the sweeping Republican tax law signed in July curtailed the tax incentives. Available through Sept. 30, the tax credit for new EVs pays up to $7,500 for eligible purchases, while the credit for used EVs pays up to $4,000.⁠
⁠
And people inclined to buy an EV are pouncing, auto-industry data show. In July, sales of new and used EVs popped more than 20% month over month, according to Cox Automotive, the parent company of brands like Kelley Blue Book. New EVs sold for an average $55,689, while used EVs listed for $35,263 on average — both down month over month.⁠
⁠
Carmakers and dealers have also piled discounts on top of the tax credits. The value of incentives as a share of the transaction price broke records for EVs in July, Cox data showed. Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Ford and Honda were the top five car makes in new-EV sales, Cox noted.⁠

Companies across the globe are under mounting pressure to decarbonise and modernise. But they can’t do it alone.

Increasingly, they are turning to energy sector firms—those whose very business is helping others reduce emissions—for the tools and expertise to get there. In response, these companies are rapidly evolving.

They need to, to stay competitive and meet rising demand.

And to do so, they need to expand their capabilities—not just through organic growth, but through strategic mergers and acquisitions.

This allows them to absorb the technical knowledge, talent, and data they need to offer more sophisticated, integrated solutions to clients on the decarbonisation journey.

So said Tracy Herrmann, PwC US’s global energy, utilities and resources deals leader in their June report, Global M&A trends in energy, utilities and resources:

“In 2025, the energy, utilities and resources sectors are prioritising resilience and transformative growth as capital flows are crossing sectors to meet the demands of electrification, decarbonisation and digitalisation.

“Identifying strategic M&A opportunities and forging partnerships that leverage the increasing convergence between sectors will be a key differentiator and help companies capture value at speed and scale.’

Let’s look at some of the M&A announcements that demonstrate this.

More from the power playbook:?

Is the global switchgear market reaching an impasse?

Is the UK’s BESS market entering its next phase?

Nxzen

Just this month, a new company emerged in the UK from a merger by the name of nxzen, which combines energy consultancy Enzen’s existing enterprise solutions business, digital twin solution and their renewable infrastructure business with IoT provider NNNCo’s connectivity and data network expertise.

According to Simon Reid, the company’s Group CEO, who commented to me over email, their clients struggle to safeguard critical infrastructure, modernise ageing systems all while also facing fragmented data and cyber threats.

“Our clients want outcomes, not complexity.

“Yet today, to achieve those outcomes, they’re forced to rely on multiple partners, each offering data, digital, consulting or engineering capabilities that are difficult to connect and align. We bring these capabilities together in one place…”

This is where their tech comes in, providing “near real-time insights across distributed assets…Conflating this data with other surrounding environmental data like weather, soil, temperature, etc. will enable companies to identify patterns to predict the state of assets and operations in the future.

“This enables businesses to be better prepared to handle future challenges and react faster to resolve unplanned issues, in addition to delivering immediate operational efficiencies.”

nxzen is backed by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, and Stellex Capital Management, which Reid says allows them to “invest confidently in innovation…that create tangible client value.”

Magnus Energy & Ciratum

Although nxzen is a new player in the game (even if their legacy companies aren’t), they aren’t the only ones recognising the value of expertise consolidation.

In fact, exactly one year prior to me writing this column, Dutch consultancies Magnus Energy and Ciratum joined forces, creating a 100-person energy consulting business.

Magnus Energy claims a proven track record in areas such as strategy, regulatory, implementation, projects, and operations. Citrus focuses on business and IT transformations in the energy, water and telecom sectors. Energy, however, is the firm’s main area of focus; Ciratum supports projects at energy providers and electricity utility companies in the Netherlands and Belgium.

With the merger, the two consultancies deepened and extended their offerings, as well as gained scale, positioning the group as a stronger partner in the energy consulting landscape.

Commenting at the time was Alexander van der Mark, managing director of Magnus Energy: “The collaboration merges the unique strengths and expertise of both organisations. Designed to address today’s demands and future challenges of the ever evolving and increasingly complex energy transition related projects.”

“Our commitment to supporting the energy community with our insights, exceeding clients’ expectations, and collaborative synergy will position us at the forefront of the industry, in the Netherlands, but also across Europe.”

Rudolf Das, managing director of Ciratum, added: “It is a stimulating step to join forces with Magnus Energy in this strategic partnership. Our combined resources and shared vision will enable us to meet the pressing challenges of the energy transition head-on, delivering services that make a real difference.”

The deal, when announced, was presented as a ‘merger of equals’, although Magnus Energy formally acquired Ciratum for an undisclosed sum, backed by a Dutch private equity group.

An acquisition in Bilbao

In the same month as the Magnus and Ciratum acquisition, global, professional services company Accenture acquired BOSLAN, a provider of management services for large infrastructure projects, headquartered in Bilbao, Spain.

BOSLAN helps its clients engineer and oversee the construction of infrastructure for the net-zero transition, such as on- and offshore wind farms, solar power plants, smart grids, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and hydrogen plants. It also supports the construction of data centres and critical infrastructure.

The services BOSLAN provides include feasibility studies, project planning, cost and quality control, contract negotiation and management, design reviews, equipment purchase assistance and field work supervision.

Now part of Accenture’s Industry X team, Accenture says they will reinvent how clients engineer and execute net-zero infrastructure projects. Namely, by applying AI and other digital technologies to asset lifecycle management, Accenture and the BOSLAN team will help clients optimise their project investments and become carbon-neutral faster.

BOSLAN’steam joins Accenture’s infrastructure and capital projects practice within its digital engineering and manufacturing service, Industry X.

“European companies in the energy and utilities sector are leading the charge in transitioning to renewable energy and ensuring low-carbon emission power is competitive,” said Götz Erhardt, who leads Industry X in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Accenture.

“BOSLAN has helped pioneer many projects in this space. Their engineering and industry expertise will bolster our capabilities to help clients in Europe and globally realize their net zero ambitions. It will also grow our footprint as a global provider of infrastructure and capital projects services, including digital and AI solutions for asset lifecycle management, which are essential to the reinvention of infrastructure projects.”

This is merely three of many examples demonstrating a growing trend of merging competencies across fields.

But looking ahead, the success of these newly formed entities will hinge on how well they can navigate a fast-changing energy ecosystem.

What do you think? What will be crucial to their success in such a competitive environment?

Reach out and let me know so that I can feature your thoughts in the Power Playbook.

Connecticut Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff (D-Norwalk) criticized the Trump administration for the job losses.
“We had a robust, green, renewable energy policy in the state that created green jobs and we're just losing them daily it seems like,” Dehkan said.
Those workers are expected to be laid off by Sept. 13 if the company can't obtain financing or sell the company.","Dozens of Connecticut workers were recently laid off by PosiGen, a solar energy company known for leasing solar panels to low and moderate-income residents.

PosiGen laid off 78 people from its offices in Shelton, Danbury and Wethersfield on Sunday, Aug. 24.

In a letter notifying the cities of the layoffs, the company’s chief administrative officer wrote that the company was ceasing “most of its operations throughout the United States, effective immediately.” The company said it was experiencing “significant financial difficulties” made worse by the Trump administration’s spending and tax package, which will end solar tax credits by the end of 2025.

Connecticut Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff (D-Norwalk) criticized the Trump administration for the job losses.

“President Trump talks a big game about standing up for the working man, but the truth is he’s left 78 Connecticut families without a paycheck,” Duff said in a statement. “These are blue-collar jobs that built our clean energy future. Now they’re gone because Trump needed the money for tax cuts for billionaires and his corrupt circle.”

The layoffs at PosiGen come days after the Trump administration ordered a halt in construction on Revolution Wind, an offshore wind farm in Connecticut and Rhode Island, which could threaten more than 1,000 additional jobs.

An uncertain future for green jobs in the state

PosiGen is based in Louisiana and was set to supply more solar panels to Connecticut residents through Solar for All, a federal grant program that awarded $62.4 million to the state last year. But the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled the program earlier this month, terminating the funds that were sent to Connecticut.

Aziz Dehkan, executive director of the Connecticut Roundtable on Climate and Jobs, said the job losses stand to set the state’s green job economy back by years.

“We had a robust, green, renewable energy policy in the state that created green jobs and we're just losing them daily it seems like,” Dehkan said. “What's the next one that's going to happen is really the question here.”

U.S. Rep. John Larson, a Democrat, said the layoffs at PosiGen, and the Trump administration’s move to halt construction on Revolution Wind, would hurt the pocketbooks of consumers.

“If these misguided and vindictive actions are not reversed, thousands of Connecticut households will be stuck paying more for their electricity from an increasingly unreliable power grid for years to come,” Larson said in a statement.

Following the layoff notice, PosiGen now has eight employees remaining in Connecticut. Those workers are expected to be laid off by Sept. 13 if the company can't obtain financing or sell the company.

“The uncertainty that's being caused by the federal government, one by one, ending tax credits or closing down renewable energy projects, hurts everybody,” Dekhan said. “It hurts the economy. It hurts the climate.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/522f5ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4334+0+585/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F98%2Fab%2F21c190c4449fb5b6f359b1038d5c%2F230405-nenc-20230405-nhpr-community-power-keene-00001.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 12:11:00.361177

Notably, China has recently made moves to try to maintain its lead in the EV battery manufacturing sector; last month, the Chinese government began restricting exports of technologies integral to EV battery production, including battery lithium iron phosphate (LFP) preparation technology, battery lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) preparation technology and phosphate cathode raw material preparation technology.
Fragmented battery recycling regulations Furthermore, ZETA notes that several constraints are currently hampering the US battery recycling market, including fragmented regulations at state and federal levels, a lack of consistent standards for battery collection and processing and transportation barriers.
The report lays out several policy recommendations to support the growth of EV battery recycling in the US.
Corey Cantor, ZETA’s research director, notes that the advantages of boosting domestic EV battery recycling in the US are myriad.","A new whitepaper published by the Zero Emission Transportation Association (ZETA) Education Fund is advocating for a market-based approach and clearer federal guidance to support the growth of the EV battery recycling industry in the US.

The report, entitled Closing the Loop: Strategies for Electric Vehicle Battery Management and Critical Materials Recovery notes that the advanced battery recycling sector is currently booming in the US, with 18 advanced EV battery recycling facilities announced or operational across the US; the report cites data from the Clean Economy Tracker which notes that around US$9.65 billion has been invested into EV battery recycling plants in the US since 2020, supporting around 6,000 jobs in the process.

However, despite this significant growth rate, the US remains a laggard in the global EV battery recycling landscape. ZETA notes that the vast majority of end-of-life EV batteries are exported to China for recycling and processing, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) stating that around 80% of global battery recycling capacity is located in China as of 2023, with only 2% of capacity located in the US and Europe.

The growth of China’s battery recycling sector is partially attributed to the nation’s introduction of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) requirements, which stipulate that manufacturers must finance or manage the end-of-life processing of their products; similar legislation has also been introduced in the EU.

Notably, China has recently made moves to try to maintain its lead in the EV battery manufacturing sector; last month, the Chinese government began restricting exports of technologies integral to EV battery production, including battery lithium iron phosphate (LFP) preparation technology, battery lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) preparation technology and phosphate cathode raw material preparation technology.

Fragmented battery recycling regulations

Furthermore, ZETA notes that several constraints are currently hampering the US battery recycling market, including fragmented regulations at state and federal levels, a lack of consistent standards for battery collection and processing and transportation barriers. As such, ZETA states that developing a “market-based approach, backed by clear policy guardrails” is essential to capturing the future benefits of a strong US supply chain for battery recycling.

The report lays out several policy recommendations to support the growth of EV battery recycling in the US. Among these is a recommendation that a battery management hierarchy encouraging reuse, repair and repurposing of end-of-life EV batteries before material recovery and recycling efforts are considered. Repurposing end-of-life EV batteries for use in battery energy storage systems (BESS) has already been established with some success in the US by Redwood Energy, an offshoot of Redwood Materials focused on repurposing second-life EV batteries.

In June, Redwood Energy entered into a strategic partnership with Crusoe to develop a microgrid powered by large-scale solar PV installations and stored in second-life EV batteries to meet the energy demand from Crusoe’s AI data centres. The following month, Redwood signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with General Motors, which will see General Motors use second-life batteries from its EV range to develop new BESS units with Redwood Energy.

Additionally, the report recommends continued support for federal programmes which develop the battery recycling industry, such as the Federal Consortium for Advanced Batteries launched by the previous Trump administration to advance battery recycling technological developments.

Furthermore, it is recommended that clear definitions regarding who is responsible for end-of-life battery management be established, for example, in the form of battery management plans that require individual battery manufacturers to lay out their own methods for the proper collection, transportation, repurposing for second-life applications and recycling of end-of-life batteries.

Corey Cantor, ZETA’s research director, notes that the advantages of boosting domestic EV battery recycling in the US are myriad. Cantor stated: “Boosting the availability of these materials will improve supply chain resilience while mitigating the impacts of market fluctuations and geopolitical risks. At the same time, increasing the domestic supply of critical minerals and materials will reduce dependence on adversary-controlled supply chains, thereby enhancing energy and national security.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt452efb5f3e725f7e/bltb6a318dc8ee29647/68b1b91839719b27f9fee10c/battery_recycling_fortumv8.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-29 14:02:08.677176

Energy Global's Summer 2025 issue Dive into the latest renewable energy insights in the Summer issue of Energy Global, out now!","The AUS$3 billion development is expected to generate enough power for up to 500 000 homes, create up to 400 construction jobs, and deliver more than AUS$30 million annually into the Tasmanian economy, alongside a AUS$27 million community benefits programme for the Circular Head region.

ACEN Australia Managing Director, David Pollington, noted that the milestone was a key achievement for ACEN, and important for the Tasmanian economy, the nation’s energy transition, and the renewable energy industry more broadly.

Pollington added: “The decision shows that large, complex projects can be delivered responsibly, balancing overall impacts and conserving biodiversity, with the need for clean energy to address climate change. It comes at a time when Australia faces a stalling energy transition and looming power shortages as coal exits the system. It also reflects the depth and rigour of ACEN’s work to address the assessment criteria and scrutiny applied through the approvals process.”

The approval follows more than eight years of assessment by all levels of government, including detailed studies of Robbins Island’s natural values.

This has produced the most comprehensive understanding of its plants and animals to date, giving confidence that the project can proceed and manage any environmental risks.

The project will deliver jobs, training, and long-term community benefits. Wind then provides low cost baseload generation backed by hydro. As a result, hydro will be able to play to its real strength as flexible on-demand generation and storage, rather than a traditional baseload generation.

Pollington continued: “It means the state could still play a meaningful role in the energy transition and capture the benefits that come with private investments like ours – at AUS$3 billion one of the largest in the state’s history – if there is a timely decision on the transmission line.”

The transmission line to connect the project to the grid is following a separate approvals process anticipated to be completed in 2026, allowing the project to start generating power in 2030.

The project will also help the state and federal governments reach legislated emissions commitments, including Tasmania’s goal to double clean energy production by 2040, half by 2030.

Robbins Island Wind had an exceptional resource generating 30% more power than the average Australian wind project of comparable size.

Pollington concluded: “Robbins Island Wind will also make a significant contribution to Tamanian emissions targets, representing more than half of Tasmania’s 2030 target. The project supports Australia’s climate commitments, providing a lowest-cost clean alternative to fossil fuels in time to meet supply shortages. This is particularly important for Victoria, which will lose half of its coal generation by 2035, making investment in Marinus Link and the North West Transmission Developments a smart and timely move.”

ACEN will now work through the detailed approval conditions to understand their implications for project design and ongoing environmental monitoring while continuing preparations for its transmission proposal, scheduled for assessment in 2026.

With the opening of the two new charging locations, Pennsylvania is now tied for first in the nation in stations built using the federal funds.

“Pennsylvania is tied for the most operational NEVI stations in the nation, and more are coming,” said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. “Governor Shapiro set an expectation from the top that we get stuff done for Pennsylvanians, and delivering EV charging is just one example of our commitment to that idea.”

“Our stores are already the ultimate one-stop-shop for travelers – offering fresh food, clean facilities and dependable convenience whenever they need it,” said Trevor Walter, Sheetz EVP of Petroleum Supply Management. “We are bringing that same convenience to drivers of electric vehicles across Pennsylvania. Partnering with PennDOT through the NEVI program gives us the ability to grow our network faster, by adding charging options at even more stores our customers already know and love.”

The 19 stations opened under the NEVI program, representing a federal investment of more than $10.5 million, building upon the Shapiro Administration’s determination to ensure the reliability and accessibility of EV charging and get things done for Pennsylvania travelers.

The new stations are at the following locations:

Sheetz in Altoona, Blair County on along Interstate 99 (Exit 32);

Sheetz in York, York County on Route 30 along I-83 (Exit 21).

PennDOT completed three funding rounds over the course of 2023 and 2024 focused on identifying charging station projects to fill gaps along Pennsylvania’s Alternative Fuels Corridors. A total of 90 active NEVI projects in 43 counties are now in varying stages of implementation and include a total federal investment of $58.4 million. A list of all NEVI awards is available on PennDOT's website.

On August 11, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued new NEVI interim guidelines for states to restart their NEVI programs after rescinding prior guidelines and approved plans in February. As a national leader, Pennsylvania will continue its competitive program and maximize available NEVI funds to provide a robust EV charging program in Pennsylvania. PennDOT submitted a new NEVI state plan and “build out” certification request to FWHA on August 27, 2025, in accordance with the new guidance.

FAQ: Nippon Steel's Investment in US Steel How will the $11 billion investment be allocated across different facilities?","What Does Nippon Steel's $11B Investment in US Steel Include?

Nippon Steel's landmark $11 billion investment in US Steel represents one of the most significant capital injections into American steel manufacturing in decades. This comprehensive investment package targets strategic infrastructure upgrades across multiple US Steel facilities, promising to modernize production capabilities and boost overall capacity throughout the company's North American operations.

Major Infrastructure Projects and Capacity Expansion

The investment blueprint includes several cornerstone projects designed to revitalize US Steel's aging infrastructure while significantly expanding production capabilities. At the Mon Valley Works in Pennsylvania, plans include construction of a new state-of-the-art hot-rolling mill, a facility crucial for transforming semi-finished steel slabs into thinner, more versatile steel sheets.

In Indiana, the investment will fund a complete refurbishment of the No. 14 blast furnace at Gary Works, one of the largest integrated steel mills in North America. This renovation will extend the operational lifespan of this critical asset while improving its efficiency and environmental performance.

Perhaps most forward-looking is the planned construction of new electromagnetic steel sheet production lines. These specialized facilities will produce the high-grade electrical steel increasingly demanded by manufacturers of electric vehicles, transformers, and renewable energy infrastructure.

Looking beyond upgrades to existing facilities, Nippon Steel Vice Chairman Takahiro Mori has confirmed intentions to ""build a new mill from the greenfield,"" referencing the possibility of developing 3 million metric-ton electric arc furnaces similar to the Big River 2 plant in Arkansas. This represents a major commitment to electric arc furnace (EAF) technology, which offers more flexible production capabilities and typically lower environmental impacts than traditional blast furnaces.

The combined effect of these investments will be transformative for US Steel's production capacity. Currently standing at approximately 17 million tons of domestic crude steel capacity, the investment is projected to increase this figure to around 20 million tons—an 18% expansion that significantly strengthens the company's market position.

Technology Transfer and Operational Improvements

Beyond physical infrastructure, the investment includes a comprehensive transfer of Nippon Steel's advanced operational techniques and cutting-edge steelmaking technologies. This knowledge transfer represents a significant value component that extends beyond the headline $11 billion figure.

Japanese steelmaking is globally renowned for its precision manufacturing processes, quality control systems, and operational efficiency. The implementation of these techniques across US Steel's operations promises to elevate production standards while reducing waste and improving yield rates.

The technology transfer will focus particularly on high-grade product development, enabling US Steel to shift its product mix toward more specialized, higher-margin steel varieties. This strategic repositioning addresses growing market demand for advanced steel grades used in automotive manufacturing, electrical applications, and construction.

Production efficiency improvements will extend beyond individual process optimizations to encompass entire manufacturing systems. From raw material handling through finishing and distribution, Nippon Steel's methodologies aim to reduce costs while enhancing product consistency and quality.

Why Is Nippon Steel Making This Massive Investment?

The $11 billion commitment represents a strategic calculation by Nippon Steel, balancing short-term costs against long-term positioning in the global steel market. While the immediate financial impact is substantial, the company's leadership has articulated a clear vision for how this investment will generate returns over the coming years.

Financial Growth Projections

Nippon Steel has outlined specific profit contribution targets from US Steel following the investment. According to Vice Chairman Takahiro Mori, the company expects US Steel to contribute approximately 80 billion yen ($543 million) to Nippon Steel's bottom line in fiscal year 2025.

This profit contribution is projected to nearly double to 150 billion yen ($1.02 billion) by fiscal year 2026, reflecting the initial benefits of operational improvements and technology transfer. By fiscal year 2028, as major infrastructure projects reach completion, the profit contribution is expected to reach 250 billion yen ($1.70 billion).

Notably, Mori has emphasized that ""real effects from the investment will appear after 2028,"" suggesting that the company anticipates continued profit growth beyond these initial projections. This long-term outlook aligns with the substantial nature of the infrastructure improvements being undertaken.

The financial projections incorporate currency exchange considerations, with all yen figures calculated at approximately $1 = 147.33 yen based on exchange rates at the time of announcement. This exchange rate exposure represents both a risk and opportunity for the investment's dollar-denominated returns.

Global Market Position Enhancement

Beyond immediate financial returns, the acquisition and subsequent investment significantly advance Nippon Steel's global strategic positioning. The deal increases Nippon Steel's global annual crude steel capacity to 86 million tons, representing major progress toward the company's longer-term 100-million-ton production target.

This capacity expansion strengthens Nippon Steel's competitive standing against other global steel giants, particularly those in China, South Korea, and Europe. In an industry where economies of scale provide significant advantages in both procurement and operational efficiency, this increased scale improves Nippon Steel's relative market position.

The investment also achieves important geographic diversification, reducing Nippon Steel's historical concentration in Asian markets. By establishing a major production base in North America, the company gains protection against regional economic downturns while positioning itself to capitalize on investment strategy insights in the United States.

How Will This Deal Transform Both Companies?

The partnership between Nippon Steel and US Steel promises to be transformative for both organizations, creating new opportunities while addressing historical challenges. The $11 billion investment serves as the foundation for this transformation, enabling strategic initiatives that neither company could easily pursue independently.

Strategic Benefits for Nippon Steel

For Nippon Steel, the acquisition and subsequent investment dramatically expand its North American manufacturing footprint. Prior to the acquisition, Nippon Steel's presence in the US market was relatively limited compared to its global scale. The deal provides immediate access to US Steel's extensive production network, including its integrated blast furnace operations and electric arc furnace facilities.

This expanded presence provides Nippon Steel with direct access to US Steel's established customer base and distribution networks. Rather than building these relationships from scratch—a process that would typically take decades—the acquisition allows Nippon Steel to immediately engage with major North American steel consumers in automotive, construction, energy, and manufacturing sectors.

The deal also significantly diversifies Nippon Steel's revenue streams across global markets. This geographic diversification helps insulate the company from regional economic fluctuations, creating a more stable financial foundation. When demand weakens in Asian markets, stronger North American performance may help offset the impact.

The increased scale also enhances Nippon Steel's economies in procurement, allowing for more favorable terms when purchasing raw materials like iron ore and coking coal. These scale benefits extend to operational aspects as well, enabling more efficient allocation of capital, research resources, and specialized expertise across a broader production base.

Transformation Potential for US Steel

For US Steel, the partnership brings access to Nippon Steel's world-class technological capabilities and manufacturing expertise. This knowledge transfer addresses a historical challenge for US Steel, which has struggled to maintain technological competitiveness with newer, more efficient producers both domestically and internationally.

The investment enables comprehensive modernization of aging infrastructure and production facilities. Many of US Steel's core assets were constructed decades ago and require significant capital investment to remain competitive. The $11 billion commitment provides the financial resources necessary for this modernization without requiring unsustainable leverage.

Implementation of Japanese manufacturing techniques promises to improve operational efficiency throughout US Steel's production network. These improvements include enhanced process control, reduced energy consumption, lower maintenance costs, and improved yield rates—all contributing to stronger financial performance.

Perhaps most significantly, the partnership enables US Steel to enhance its product portfolio with higher-margin steel products. By leveraging Nippon Steel's expertise in specialized steel grades, US Steel can shift its production mix away from commodity products toward more technically demanding applications that command premium pricing.

These improvements collectively strengthen US Steel's competitive position in North American markets, allowing it to better withstand competition from both domestic mini-mills and international producers. The partnership creates a more sustainable business model built on technological advantage rather than protective trade measures.

What Challenges Does the Investment Face?

Despite its strategic rationale, the $11 billion investment program faces several significant challenges that will require careful management. These challenges span financial, operational, and cultural dimensions, each requiring dedicated attention from leadership teams at both companies.

Financial Considerations

The financing structure for both the acquisition and subsequent investment involves complex arrangements designed to balance multiple objectives. Nippon Steel has indicated it will raise 500 billion yen through a subordinated loan to partially repay a 2 trillion yen bridging loan that funded the initial $14.9 billion acquisition which closed in June.

Looking forward, Nippon Steel is evaluating multiple financing options for the investment program, including hybrid financing instruments, convertible bonds, and corporate bonds. Vice Chairman Mori has indicated the company will ""assess the optimal timing, interest rates, and whether yen or dollar denominations are preferable to pursue the best financing strategy.""

While equity financing remains an option, Mori has emphasized it would only be considered ""within limits to avoid shareholder dilution."" This constraint reflects the company's commitment to protecting existing shareholder interests while pursuing growth opportunities.

The initial funding responsibility for the $11 billion investment will fall to US Steel, with Nippon Steel prepared to provide support if resources prove insufficient. This arrangement leverages US Steel's existing financial capabilities while establishing a clear backstop for the investment program.

Operational Hurdles

Beyond financing challenges, the investment program faces significant operational hurdles as it moves from planning to implementation. One immediate challenge involves integrating different corporate cultures and operational philosophies between the Japanese parent company and its American subsidiary.

While implementing facility upgrades and expansions, both companies must carefully manage potential production disruptions to minimize impact on customers. This balancing act requires detailed planning and coordination across multiple facilities and production lines.

Recent operational challenges highlight the unpredictable nature of steel manufacturing. An August explosion at US Steel's Clairton plant in Pennsylvania could potentially reduce the expected 80 billion yen profit contribution for the current fiscal year. While Mori has indicated this impact would ""not be significant,"" it illustrates the operational risks inherent in steel production.

Throughout the investment program, leadership must balance modernization initiatives with maintaining current production levels to fulfill customer commitments. This dual mandate creates tension between long-term improvement and short-term performance that requires careful management.

How Does This Investment Impact the Global Steel Industry?

The Nippon Steel-US Steel partnership and subsequent investment program have significant implications for the broader steel industry. As one of the largest steel industry transactions in recent years, the deal influences industry dynamics from market structure to production technology.

Market Consolidation Implications

The acquisition accelerates the ongoing global trend toward steel industry consolidation trends. As major producers combine operations to achieve greater scale and efficiency, the industry's competitive landscape continues to evolve. This consolidation trend responds to persistent challenges including overcapacity, cyclical demand, and intense price competition.

The partnership will likely trigger competitive responses from other major steel producers seeking to maintain or improve their relative market positions. These responses could include similar cross-border acquisitions, strategic investments, or focused capacity expansions in high-growth product categories.

Market consolidation typically influences pricing dynamics as larger producers gain increased market leverage. While competition remains intense across most steel product categories, the reduced number of major producers may provide opportunities for more stable pricing in specialized market segments.

The partnership also potentially shifts global steel trade patterns as production decisions increasingly reflect the integrated operations of multinational producers rather than independent national companies. These shifts may alter traditional import-export relationships between major steel-producing and steel-consuming regions.

Production Technology Evolution

Beyond market structure, the investment accelerates the industry evolution trends across the industry. Nippon Steel's commitment to both blast furnace refurbishment and new electric arc furnace capacity reflects the industry's hybrid technological future, combining traditional and emerging production methods.

The emphasis on high-efficiency production methods establishes new benchmarks for operational performance throughout the industry. As competitors respond to these efficiency improvements, overall industry productivity will likely increase, potentially addressing longstanding concerns about steel industry competitiveness.

The investment's focus on specialized steel products, particularly electromagnetic steel sheet for electrical applications, highlights the growing importance of these high-value categories. Industry investment patterns will likely continue shifting toward these specialized products that support emerging technologies in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and advanced manufacturing.

The transfer of Japanese manufacturing techniques into US operations represents a significant diffusion of production knowledge across international borders. This knowledge transfer may accelerate the adoption of similar techniques by other North American producers seeking to remain competitive.

What Are the Economic and Political Implications?

The $11 billion investment program carries significant economic and political implications that extend beyond the steel industry itself. As a major commitment to US manufacturing infrastructure, the investment influences multiple aspects of the economic and political landscape.

Impact on US Manufacturing Sector

The investment promises to revitalize traditional US steel manufacturing infrastructure at a time when much industrial investment has focused on either service industries or emerging technology sectors. This commitment to core manufacturing capability helps maintain the industrial foundation that supports broader economic activity.

While specific job creation projections have not been released, the capacity expansion from 17 million to 20 million tons suggests meaningful employment growth across multiple facilities. These positions typically provide above-average wages and benefits, supporting middle-class employment in regions that have experienced manufacturing job losses.

The modernization of US Steel's facilities enhances the competitiveness of US-based steel production against both domestic mini-mills and international competitors. This improved competitiveness reduces reliance on trade protection measures while strengthening domestic manufacturing capabilities.

Enhanced local production of specialized steel grades strengthens supply chains for domestic manufacturing, providing more reliable access to critical materials for industries ranging from automotive to defense. This supply chain resilience has gained increased importance following recent global disruptions.

Political Considerations

The acquisition's completion in June 2025 followed a complex regulatory review process that bridged the transition between political administrations. This successful navigation of regulatory hurdles demonstrates the deal's perceived alignment with broader economic interests despite initial political concerns.

Foreign investment in strategic US industries continues to receive heightened scrutiny from policymakers across the political spectrum. The investment program's focus on expanding domestic production capacity and creating US manufacturing jobs helps address potential concerns about foreign control of critical industries.

The partnership potentially influences US-Japan trade relations by creating a significant Japanese manufacturing presence within the United States. This direct investment creates shared economic interests that may influence trade policy discussions between the two countries.

Policymakers face ongoing challenges in balancing the benefits of foreign investment with concerns about domestic industry protection. The Nippon Steel-US Steel partnership provides a test case for how these competing priorities can be reconciled through investment commitments and operational guarantees.

What Does This Mean for Steel Markets and Customers?

For steel markets and customers, the $11 billion investment program promises significant changes in product availability, quality, and supply chain dynamics. These changes will unfold gradually as infrastructure improvements and operational enhancements are implemented across US Steel's operations.

Product Portfolio Expansion

The investment emphasizes expanding the availability of high-grade steel products in the North American market. This expansion includes specialized steel grades for automotive applications, construction, energy infrastructure, and manufacturing. Customers in these sectors will benefit from improved local access to advanced steel varieties previously available primarily through imports.

Enhanced electromagnetic steel sheet production represents a particularly significant development for manufacturers of electrical equipment. This specialized steel, critical for transformers, electric motors, and power distribution equipment, plays an essential role in grid modernization and electrification initiatives.

Beyond these specific products, the investment enables US Steel to develop new specialty steel offerings that address emerging customer requirements. The technology transfer from Nippon Steel provides the metallurgical expertise necessary to formulate and manufacture these advanced steel grades.

Improved quality consistency resulting from technological upgrades benefits customers through reduced variability in material properties. This consistency enables more precise engineering specifications, potentially reducing material waste and improving end-product performance.

Supply Chain Implications

The investment strengthens integrated supply capabilities for North American manufacturers, providing more reliable access to both commodity and specialized steel grades. This enhanced reliability is particularly valuable following recent supply chain disruptions that highlighted vulnerabilities in global material sourcing.

Local production of specialized steel grades enables more responsive manufacturing, with shorter lead times and greater flexibility to address changing customer requirements. This responsiveness provides a competitive advantage compared to imported alternatives that typically involve longer supply chains.

The partnership enhances supply stability for critical US industries, reducing exposure to international trade disruptions, shipping delays, and foreign supply constraints. This stability is particularly valuable for industries with just-in-time manufacturing systems that depend on predictable material availability.

While specific pricing implications remain uncertain, the investment's focus on operational efficiency may help moderate steel price volatility. Improved production flexibility allows more responsive adjustment to demand fluctuations, potentially reducing the extreme price swings that have characterized steel markets in recent years following the iron ore price decline analysis and tariffs impact on metal markets.

What's Next for the Nippon Steel-US Steel Partnership?

As the partnership moves from acquisition to implementation, several key developments will shape its evolution and impact. The coming months and years will bring increased clarity about specific projects, timelines, and strategic priorities.

Upcoming Strategic Announcements

A detailed investment plan is scheduled for release later in 2025 as part of Nippon Steel's new medium-term business strategy. This announcement will provide greater specificity about project priorities, implementation timelines, and expected performance improvements.

Takahiro Mori, who served as lead negotiator on the deal and now chairs US Steel, will likely play a central role in articulating the partnership's strategic vision. His dual perspective provides valuable insight into how the investment program aligns with Nippon Steel's global objectives.

The companies may identify additional acquisition or expansion targets that complement the current investment program. These supplementary initiatives could address specific product categories, geographic markets, or technological capabilities not fully covered by the initial $11 billion commitment.

Further announcements regarding technology transfer and implementation phases will clarify how quickly operational improvements will be realized. These timelines will influence customer expectations and competitive responses throughout the industry.

Long-Term Vision

Beyond the initial investment period, the partnership envisions continued capacity expansion that builds on the foundation established through current projects. This expansion may include additional electric arc furnace capacity, specialized finishing lines, or enhanced logistics infrastructure.

Further integration of operations and management systems will likely occur as the partnership matures. While maintaining separate corporate identities, the companies will increasingly function as an integrated production network with coordinated strategy and resource allocation.

The partnership positions both companies to potentially develop next-generation steel production technologies that address emerging challenges in decarbonization, energy efficiency, and material performance. These innovation initiatives may attract additional investment beyond the initial $11 billion commitment.

Looking forward, the combined entity will continue evolving its product portfolio to address changing market demands across construction, automotive, energy, and manufacturing sectors. This evolution will reflect both technological developments and shifting customer requirements in each sector.

FAQ: Nippon Steel's Investment in US Steel

How will the $11 billion investment be allocated across different facilities?

The investment will be distributed across multiple US Steel facilities, with major projects including a new hot-rolling mill at Mon Valley Works in Pennsylvania, refurbishment of the No. 14 blast furnace at Gary Works in Indiana, new electromagnetic steel sheet production lines, and potentially a new greenfield mill with electric arc furnaces similar to the Big River 2 plant in Arkansas. The detailed allocation across facilities will be clarified when the companies release their comprehensive investment plan later in 2025.

When will the financial benefits of this investment begin to materialize?

According to Nippon Steel Vice Chairman Takahiro Mori, incremental profit contributions are expected to grow from 80 billion yen ($543 million) in fiscal year 2025 to 250 billion yen ($1.70 billion) by fiscal 2028. However, Mori has emphasized that ""real effects from the investment will appear after 2028,"" suggesting the most significant financial benefits will materialize beyond the initial implementation period. This timeline reflects the long-term nature of major infrastructure investments in steel manufacturing.

How will Nippon Steel finance this massive investment?

The financing strategy includes a 500 billion yen subordinated loan to partially repay a 2 trillion yen bridging loan that funded the acquisition. Additional options under consideration include hybrid financing instruments, convertible bonds, and corporate bonds. While equity financing remains possible, Mori has indicated it would only be considered ""within limits to avoid shareholder dilution."" Initially, US Steel will fund the investments with Nippon Steel providing support if needed.

What impact will this investment have on US Steel's production capacity?

The investment is expected to increase US Steel's domestic crude steel capacity from approximately 17 million tons to 20 million tons, representing an 18% expansion in production capability. This capacity increase will be achieved through a combination of efficiency improvements at existing facilities and construction of new production assets, including potential electric arc furnace capacity at a greenfield location.

In its report this week, Woodmac said that in 2024, regional grid operators experienced a 51% increase in withdrawals of non-viable projects since 2022 and 9% fewer new project entries.
“It’s clear that these reforms are showing early signs of promise in accelerating the pace of interconnection studies,” said Kaitlin Fung, research analyst, North America utility-scale solar for Wood Mackenzie.
Regionally, Fung said that interconnection rates and queue processing times “vary dramatically” across the US.
In October last year, PV Tech Premium spoke with grid reform expert Tyler Norris about the lessons that the rest of the country can learn from Texas’ grid processes.","Woodmac said the reforms have had “considerable impact” on the US interconnection process, “driving improvements through reducing speculative projects and clearing queue backlogs.”

A 2024 report from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California said the US had 2.6TW of project capacity waiting in interconnection queues, around 95% of which was renewable or clean energy technologies, including solar, BESS and wind. In January 2025, the Laboratory published data showing that around 80% of prospective projects withdraw from the US grid queue.

In its report this week, Woodmac said that in 2024, regional grid operators experienced a 51% increase in withdrawals of non-viable projects since 2022 and 9% fewer new project entries.

“It’s clear that these reforms are showing early signs of promise in accelerating the pace of interconnection studies,” said Kaitlin Fung, research analyst, North America utility-scale solar for Wood Mackenzie. “We saw a record year in 2024, with 75GW of secured capacity. 2025 is maintaining this momentum, as major grid operators have already secured 36GW through July 2025, positioning the year to match 2024’s record.”

Solar PV and BESS projects accounted for 75% of the interconnection agreements signed in 2024. This amounts to 58GW of capacity.

Despite a more challenging policy environment for renewables and the economic uncertainty which attends that, Woodmac said that 2025 is on course to see a similar distribution of technologies.

Regionally, Fung said that interconnection rates and queue processing times “vary dramatically” across the US.

Texas’ grid – the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) – has the fastest processing and highest rate of successful projects due to its “streamlined queue process through their connect-and manage approach,” the report said.

ERCOT has been a model for US interconnection management for some time. In October last year, PV Tech Premium spoke with grid reform expert Tyler Norris about the lessons that the rest of the country can learn from Texas’ grid processes.

ISO New England (ISONE) has the second-highest project success rate but the longest processing time “due to its delayed transition from serial to cluster-based processing.” California’s ISO (CAISO) comes in third, though high numbers of speculative projects have driven down its overall success rate.

“Regional disparities in processing times highlight the need for continued reform efforts,” Fung said.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ercot.jpeg,N,,2025-08-29 12:09:40.903675

A new map is exposing exactly where petrochemical pollution is most dangerous, and who's responsible.

What's happening?

The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) has launched the Petrochemical Air Pollution Map, an interactive tool that tracks toxic emissions from petrochemical plants nationwide. According to the Mom's Clean Air Force (MCAF), a nonprofit and nonpartisan group, the map pinpoints the locations of facilities, identifies the companies responsible for the pollution, and highlights the neighborhoods facing the highest health risks.

The release comes as federal regulators weigh policies that would roll back regulations on industrial and manufacturing pollution. ""EPA has recently offered to help industrial facilities pollute more rather than comply with existing clean air rules,"" said Michelle Allen, EDF's Manager of Petrochemicals. Industry groups have already asked for blanket exemptions for 218 plants, potentially opening the door to unchecked pollution.

Why is petrochemical pollution concerning? And where is it most concentrated?

Petrochemicals are used to produce plastics, pesticides, synthetic fabrics, and numerous other products we use daily. But producing them comes at a steep cost. Exposure to petrochemical pollution has been linked to asthma, respiratory illness, cancer, preterm birth, and developmental harm for infants and children.

These dangers are most concentrated in places like the Ohio River Valley, Louisiana, and Texas, where many of these petrochemical facilities cluster near historically marginalized communities. EDF's map displays gray and blue dots for facility locations, often surrounded by red hotspots that indicate health risks. The darker the red, the greater the danger.

""Every step of the petrochemical and plastics supply chain releases greenhouse gases and toxic pollutants that come at a steep cost to our health, our environment, and our climate,"" said Patrice Tomcik, National Field Director at MCAF. She pointed to western Pennsylvania, where dozens of new petrochemical plants are being planned, warning that ""our children are most vulnerable to these risks.""

What's being done about petrochemical pollution?

Across the country, communities are suing petrochemical giants. In Louisiana's ""Cancer Alley,"" residents have sued state and federal regulators for failing to protect them from toxic emissions. At the same time, other lawsuits have targeted chemical companies directly for polluting neighborhoods and endangering public health.

The Petrochemical Air Pollution Map builds on that momentum by giving parents, advocates, and local leaders a powerful tool to push back. By pairing hard data with lived experiences, it equips communities to demand accountability and spotlight the critical issues that often go ignored.

MCAF is helping lead that fight. They make it simple for families to get involved, from educating parents about health risks to organizing campaigns that call out polluters. Currently, they're urging people to sign a petition asking Congress to prevent petrochemical companies from exploiting loopholes in clean air regulations.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/petrochemical-pollutionimage-recIiwVx3dJZKHfRv.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 13:17:20.679137

They are called forever chemicals because they do not break down easily in the environment.
Of those, 11 are the types of industries that potentially handle forever chemicals, the letter said.
Carl Brzorad, an attorney with the law center, said environmentalists have had difficulty reaching Sumter officials about a meeting.
That caused the Southern Environmental Law Center to get involved, the Winyah alliance said.","An environmental group has asked the city of Sumter to clean up the flow of toxic forever chemicals from a wastewater treatment plant into an eastern South Carolina river that anglers depend on to put food on the table.

In an Aug. 25 letter to Sumter officials, the Southern Environmental Law Center says discharges from Sumter’s plant into the Pocotaligo River “pose a significant risk to human health and the environment.”

The Pocotaligo River has some of the highest forever chemical levels found anywhere in the state and in the country, according to studies by conservationists and state environmental officials.

The law center, a non-profit group that has won multiple legal victories intended to stop water pollution, wants city officials to meet with the organization’s attorneys to discuss how to resolve the problem.

If no progress is made, the law center could take legal action against Sumter. The group’s letter did not say a lawsuit would be filed, but it said not resolving the problem creates “potential liability for the city’’ from residents who use the river downstream. The letter also said Sumter’s discharges are illegal under the federal Clean Water Act.

The Pocotaligo River is popular with subsistence fishermen, who take home what they catch for meals. The river flows past Sumter and connects to the Black River, a larger stream that winds east to the coast at Georgetown.

A recent report by the national Waterkeeper Alliance said forever chemical levels in the Pocotaligo were higher than more than 30 other waterways it studied in the United States. The Sumter-Pocotaligo wastewater treatment plant likely caused much of the contamination because high levels of forever chemicals were found just below a plant discharge pipe, environmentalists say. Elevated forever chemical levels have also been found in fish from the Pocotaligo River.

Forever chemicals, formally known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, can cause an array of health problems for people exposed to them over time. Certain types of cancer, immune system deficiencies, thyroid problems and other ailments have been tied to PFAS exposure. They are called forever chemicals because they do not break down easily in the environment.

The State chronicled many of the threats from PFAS exposure in a 2023 series “Toxic Deals,’’ which looked at the effects of PFAS pollution in sewer sludge used as fertilizer in South Carolina.

But while forever chemicals can be found in sewer sludge used as crop fertilizer, the chemicals also can flow through wastewater treatment plants. Most treatment plants are designed to clean up basic pollution, such as harmful bacteria before discharging it to rivers. They rarely have systems to filter out chemicals, such as PFAS, that flow into plants from industrial users. Like many other cities, Sumter allows industrial users to release wastewater they generate into the city sewer system.

The law center’s letter says more than 20 industrial users discharge to Sumter’s sewer system. Of those, 11 are the types of industries that potentially handle forever chemicals, the letter said.

The law center’s letter said Sumter has the authority to clean up its plant and should take steps to do so.

First, the city needs to identify who is sending PFAS into the Sumter treatment plant. Industries have approval to flush treated wastewater into the Sumter system, but the city needs to know which ones are responsible for PFAS, the law center says.

Once that’s established, the city needs to exercise its authority to require companies using the sewer system to pre-treat wastewater for forever chemicals, the law center letter said.

Carl Brzorad, an attorney with the law center, said environmentalists have had difficulty reaching Sumter officials about a meeting. The Winyah Rivers Alliance, whose riverkeeper helped test the Pocotaligo River for PFAS, says it wrote Sumter officials twice “but we received no response to communications,’’ according to a text to The State newspaper.

That caused the Southern Environmental Law Center to get involved, the Winyah alliance said.

Repeated attempts by The State to reach officials with the city of Sumter were not successful.

Even though PFAS pollution that has already gotten into the river could last for years, Brzorad said the flow of contamination at least needs to stop to prevent further environmental problems.

“There’s no reason we shouldn’t be able to work together,’’ Brzorad said. “What we’re asking for doesn’t even require the city to spend any money. It’s just asking that they use their existing authority … to identify industrial users that are sending PFAS and require those industrial users to treat it or stop sending it.’’

She acknowledged these credits fuel job creation in wind, solar, and hydrogen industries, where Laborers’ International Union of North America (LiUNA) members build the infrastructure that powers our communities and puts food on their tables. As a union construction worker and proud LiUNA member, I’ve spent the last few years building clean energy projects here in Iowa, projects that bring good union jobs, strengthen our communities, and spark long-term economic growth.

But when it came time to act, Miller-Meeks sided with Washington politics over Iowa workers. She voted for the House budget bill that guts the very tax credits she claimed to support, credits that have been a lifeline for thousands of construction workers and their families, putting our jobs at risk

These credits aren’t just numbers on a page; they keep mortgages paid, groceries in the fridge, and kids in school activities. They’re the lifeline that keeps projects moving, projects that already had Project Labor Agreements in place and funding lined up for Iowa. Nearly one-third of our work hours are devoted to energy-related projects, underscoring just how central affordable and reliable energy is to both our economy and to our work. Now, because of these cuts, contractors and developers are scrambling to start work so they don’t lose funding altogether.

The impact is direct and devastating. The 2022 clean energy tax credits have driven record job growth in construction, supporting an estimated 1.75 million jobs, 3.15 billion work hours, and $148 billion in wages and benefits. They currently employ thousands of LiUNA members. These are the construction jobs we count on from March through December. And when those jobs disappear, it’s not just our members who lose - so do the local businesses we support and the people who would have worked in the new facilities we build. These projects create demand for local suppliers, sustain small businesses, and generate new permanent jobs in the facilities once they’re built. It’s a domino effect that hits our families, our neighbors, and our communities.

Iowa workers deserve better than political games that put our livelihoods at risk. If Rep. Miller-Meeks truly supports Iowa jobs, she should prove it with her votes - not just her press releases. Our state needs leaders who will fight for the livelihoods of Iowans, not just sign letters and then vote the other way when it counts. Miller-Meeks’s decision will not only hurt LiUNA members and their families, but also the communities they help build. Iowa deserves better than broken promises and lost jobs.

I’m calling on her and Iowa’s U.S. Senators: Restore the clean energy tax credits. Stop playing politics with the jobs of working people.

Approximately 5% of parking spaces are required to have an electronic vehicle charging station while another 5% must be EV-ready, meaning the conduit and wiring are ready for use but the charging equipment has not been installed.
An additional 10% of parking spaces are required to be EV-capable, defined as when the conduit is installed without the necessary wiring to connect to a charging station.
New single-family homes built in the Snyderville Basin must also be built with an EV-capable parking space.
The ordinance additionally differentiates between a short-term bicycle space, such as a traditional bike rack, and long-term bicycle space, such as a weather-protected locker.","Developers looking to build in the Snyderville Basin must now include electric vehicle charging stations and bicycle parking in their plans under a new ordinance approved by the Summit County Council last week.

The requirement, which was developed in conjunction with Utah Clean Energy, applies to all new commercial and multifamily developments. Approximately 5% of parking spaces are required to have an electronic vehicle charging station while another 5% must be EV-ready, meaning the conduit and wiring are ready for use but the charging equipment has not been installed.

An additional 10% of parking spaces are required to be EV-capable, defined as when the conduit is installed without the necessary wiring to connect to a charging station. New single-family homes built in the Snyderville Basin must also be built with an EV-capable parking space.

“Research provided by County Sustainability staff and Utah Clean Energy indicate that EV use will continue to grow, and, therefore, requiring infrastructure at the time of construction is much more economical than installing it after construction has been completed,” said a staff report on the ordinance.

There is one exemption, however.

Developers specifically working on affordable housing projects have the opportunity to ask the Snyderville Basin Planning Commission for an exception if they demonstrate that EV parking will be a “financial burden.”

The mandated number of bicycle parking spaces, meanwhile, is determined by the type of development under construction. The ordinance additionally differentiates between a short-term bicycle space, such as a traditional bike rack, and long-term bicycle space, such as a weather-protected locker.

For example, a retail store or restaurant is required to have at least two short-term spaces and one long-term space. The additional number of necessary spaces is then determined by the size of the development, with another short-term space added for every 2,000 square feet and another long-term space added for every 10,000 square feet.

In contrast, a hotel needs to have a minimum of five short-term spaces with an additional space for every 20 guest rooms. There’s a minimum requirement of four long-term spaces, with one additional space per 10 employees.

The ordinance also touches on solar power, establishing solar energy systems as an allowed use across all Snyderville Basin zoning districts and creating a set of standards for building-integrated, roof-mounted and ground-mounded solar panels.

The county code prior to the ordinance’s adoption did not include any information on solar energy systems, meaning they were prohibited by default despite the county’s goals related to sustainability and environmental stewardship, according to the staff report.

“Creation of these rules will legitimize solar structures and help prevent any issues with enforcement of the Code,” the staff report said. “Creation of the rules will enable property owners to reduce electric bills, receive tax credits and reduce pressure on the electric grid in a simple and efficient way.”

The County Council unanimously voted to adopt the ordinance.",https://i0.wp.com/www.parkrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240620-DJS21951-scaled-1.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-29 13:09:35.712347

This was achieved during a range test conducted by the GM engineering team. The company said this achievement surpasses the previous world record of 749 miles, set by Lucid earlier this year.

Real-World Testing

GM said its engineers started on a challenge in late 2024: optimizing the 2026 Chevrolet Silverado EV Work Truck to determine its maximum range. Initial guesses ranged from 800 to 1,000 miles.

The team drove a production Silverado EV Max Range WT on public roads near GM’s Milford Proving Ground in southeastern Michigan, concluding on Detroit’s Belle Isle.

GM said the truck’s hardware and software remained unchanged. Adjustments were limited to specific driving habits and small setting changes, all within the manufacturer’s guidelines:

Maintain an average speed of 20-25 mph and avoid hard braking or quick accelerating.

Drive without passengers.

Set windshield wipers to the lowest acceptable position to reduce drag.

Inflate tires to the highest acceptable pressure for lower rolling resistance.

Remove the spare tire to lighten the vehicle.

Optimize the wheel alignment.

Add an accessory tonneau cover for smooth airflow.

Turn off climate control.

Perform the test in summer for optimal ambient temperature for battery efficiency.

Record-Breaking Achievement

The engineers initially aimed to break a world record but found themselves pushing even further with a target of 1,000 miles on a full charge. They reached their goal, and to commemorate this accomplishment, they used the recharged truck to power a 3D printer that created a trophy for the team.

“Getting this kind of range on a full charge doesn’t happen by accident,” said Kurt Kelty, vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability. “It requires integration across battery chemistry, drive unit efficiency, software, and vehicle engineering. This achievement demonstrates our EV technology’s progress and the innovation we’re pursuing daily at GM.”",https://s18391.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chevy-Silverado-EV-Work-Truck-Range-Record-1400.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 11:00:42.539943

This ambitious initiative, administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA), represents a bold step forward in revitalizing and expanding the state’s manufacturing sector. By combining lessons learned from past programs with new strategies that reflect today’s economic realities, Next NJ positions New Jersey as a national leader in supporting manufacturing, clean energy, and job creation.

Key Takeaways

New Jersey is making a major investment in manufacturing with Next NJ’s $500 million tax credit incentive to attract capital investment and create high-quality jobs.

Eligible manufacturers can receive tax credits based on the lesser of:

0.1% of capital investment × number of new full-time jobs

25% of total capital investment

$150 million cap per applicant

Bonus credits (up to 5%) are available for organizations that meet equity and labor criteria.

The Program has a strategic emphasis on the clean energy sector with $100 million reserved for clean energy manufacturers in the first two years — aligning with the state’s climate and innovation goals.

Program Overview

Next NJ is designed as a competitive tax credit incentive to attract capital investment and generate high-quality jobs across New Jersey. Manufacturers from a wide array of sectors, including advanced manufacturing, non-retail food and beverage, defense, clean energy, and life sciences, are eligible to apply. The tax credit structure is carefully crafted to reward companies that demonstrate a significant commitment to both investment and job creation.

Tax credits are calculated based on the lesser of three criteria:

0.1% of the total capital investment multiplied by the number of new full-time jobs created

25% of the total capital investment

A hard cap of $150 million per applicant

In addition to these base criteria, companies may qualify for stackable bonuses of up to 5% if they meet specific criteria. These include certification as a Minority/Women-Owned Business, operating in an Opportunity Zone, or maintaining collective bargaining agreements. Such provisions enable the program to stimulate economic growth while also advancing equity and inclusivity within New Jersey’s business community.

Focus on Clean Energy

A defining feature of the Program is its strategic emphasis on the clean energy sector. Recognizing the critical importance of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, the state has reserved $100 million in tax credits specifically for clean energy manufacturers during the first two years of the Program. Eligible clean energy manufacturers include companies producing components and technologies that support renewable and sustainable energy solutions. This includes industries such as:

Solar

Geothermal

Green hydrogen

Offshore wind

Nuclear power

Fuel cells

Battery storage

By prioritizing these industries, New Jersey seeks to accelerate its progress toward ambitious climate and energy goals while simultaneously creating high-paying, sustainable jobs for residents. This initiative underscores the Murphy Administration’s broader vision of positioning the state as a hub for innovation in renewable energy technologies.

Program Requirements at a Glance

To qualify for the Next NJ Program, businesses must meet the following requirements:

Be engaged in manufacturing for more than 50% of business operations

Make a minimum capital investment of $10 million

Create at least 20 new full-time jobs

Provide a median salary of at least 120% of the county manufacturing median

Demonstrate environmental compliance

Maintain collaborative workforce relationships

Adhere to prevailing wage standards for construction and building service workers

These requirements promote the expansion of participating businesses’ own capacity while also contributing to broader community and workforce well-being.

Building on a Strong Foundation

New Jersey has long been a champion of its manufacturing sector, recognizing its vital role in driving economic growth, innovation, and job creation. Over the years, the state has introduced a series of targeted tax incentives designed to bolster both large and small manufacturers. Among the most impactful initiatives are:

New Jersey Manufacturing Equipment and Employment Credit – Encourages investments in qualified equipment while incentivizing job creation through a multi-year structure.

New Jersey New Jobs Investment Tax Credit – Rewards businesses that invest in new or expanded facilities and create significant numbers of new jobs, with eligibility thresholds tailored to company size.

New Jersey Research and Development Tax Credit – Stimulates innovation by providing credits to businesses engaged in cutting-edge research and development.

Under the new federal budget, tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act available to Wisconsin businesses, utilities and school districts are now ending much earlier than intended.

Casey Hicks, federal government affairs manager for the group Wisconsin Conservation Voters, said incentives for homeowners are being canceled even sooner than other entities, creating uncertainty which leads to project delays and cancellations.

""Without the tax credits, the grants, the incentives to help those projects along, we're going to be in a bind where we have way more demand for energy because of things like AI data centers,"" Hicks pointed out. ""And not being able to meet that demand.""

A grant which would have helped low-income residents in Milwaukee make their homes more energy efficient is being revoked.

Hicks noted now, utility rates for residents across the state are projected to increase by more than $450 a year by 2035.

Supporters of the repeal argued the tax credits were costly and fueled by misguided policy.Hicks explained Wisconsin has no natural resources of coal, oil or natural gas, which requires it to import energy, costing the state more than $14 billion a year.

Hicks argued incentives which were supposed to continue under the Inflation Reduction Act would have accelerated the transition to clean energy, saved the state money and increased Wisconsin's energy independence, while creating thousands of jobs.

""Because of this bill that was passed recently, Wisconsin could end up seeing about 11,000 jobs go away by 2030,"" Hicks reported.

Hicks urged residents to voice their concerns to their members of Congress, all of whom supported the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

From his yard, he saw neighbors pointing at the rising smoke, not knowing he had been inside the plant only minutes before.

Last Friday afternoon, Aug. 22, a catastrophic explosion erupted at Smitty’s Supply, a major lubricant manufacturing facility in a predominantly Black town about 60 miles northeast of Baton Rouge. The blaze swept through the 15-acre complex that housed half a million gallons of flammable materials.

Oily droplets spattered from the smoky sky as far as 20 miles away, coating rooftops, cars, and front lawns in a slick, shimmering film that glistened like tar. Cancer-causing air toxics such as benzene can be released in refinery and lubricant fires; officials say sampling is underway.

Although no deaths had been reported as of Thursday, the fire inflicted environmental anxiety, residents said. The inferno at Smitty’s Supply is just the latest flashpoint as states and the federal government make it harder to hold industrial companies accountable for damage by rolling back regulations and oversight.

“They don’t care about us,” said Taylor, referring to both the industrial company and government officials. “There is no way people don’t get sick, because we need help over here and we’re not getting it.”

Last year, Louisiana became the focal point for the erosion of civil rights protections against environmental injustice. A state court case stopped the federal government from using the Civil Rights Act to block the expansion of toxic facilities in Black communities.

Now, under the Trump administration, permits for polluting plants are being approved with little oversight. Facilities are also allowed to release more chemicals into the environment as parts of the Clean Air Act get weakened.

At the same time, the administration has moved to repeal a Biden administration rule that strengthened the country’s ability to plan for and address the fallout from hazardous industrial events. These disasters overwhelmingly burden Black families, who are more likely to live nearby and face the greatest health, economic, and environmental harms.

On Aug. 22, more than 80% of residents in the town, including Taylor, were forced to abandon their homes. Over 250 people crammed into a tiny community center overnight, with most sleeping on plastic chairs. Roseland’s mayor and housing director, who handled the evacuation, did not respond to requests for comment.

By Aug. 26, most of the community returned to their homes, but the air remained heavy with the pungent scent of petroleum.

“I’m probably already sick with something,” said Tevin Moore, 33, another former employee of Smitty’s Supply. On Sunday, Taylor and Moore were laid off, along with hundreds of other employees, from the plant. They both said they were offered about $250 in monthly severance.

In every reporting period since 2022, Smitty’s has been cited for significant Clean Water Act violations. The Clean Water Act is the nation’s governing law regarding water safety, but the Trump administration has proposed weakening the rule. Among those violations, the company reported polluting local waterways with organic chemicals, which may include benzene and toluene, at approximately 20 times the legal limit, oil and grease at over four times the cap, and fecal bacteria at four times the cap.

Residents here are exposed to more oil and gas facilities than 90% of Americans and face higher rates of respiratory illness than 95% of the country. As soot from the explosion settles on playgrounds and porches, many locals say the consequences of industry-friendly policies and the erosion of civil rights guardrails are evident.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry cautioned residents not to clean their homes until investigators have determined what chemicals are in the ash. He said at a press conference that the explosion had not caused an “immediate danger to wildlife or to human health.”

State health departments say breathing oil fumes for even a day can cause severe lung irritation, peeling skin, and chemical pneumonitis, and may also trigger neurologic effects and more serious health problems such as cancer, liver and kidney damage, and blood effects.

On Monday, the regional Environmental Protection Agency took over the cleanup of the disaster. Still, residents expressed distrust in the process. The current head of the regional department, appointed by President Donald Trump, is Scott Mason, a former energy official for the state of Oklahoma. Mason was also an author of the Project 2025 plan that called for ending certain pollution regulations, toxic chemical clean-up programs, and research on the impact of pollution on human health.

“I can’t trust them, and I also can’t do it myself,” said Mary, a 68-year-old resident. “I’m just going to have to leave it and hope for the best.”

In a statement issued Tuesday, Smitty’s Supply apologized to the community and its employees. One of the plant executives’ daughters, Bethany Tate, however, said in a Facebook post that “no one was to blame.” An investigation on the cause of the explosion is underway.

Taylor and Moore, who both said they routinely saw chemical fires in the plant, took exception to that comment.

“They never gave us [personal protective equipment] when we worked there, and it smelled just like this. Now we’re going to be walking in and touching oil for weeks,” Moore said.

Since 2020, Smitty’s has faced five serious labor violations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, including four for grease fires and one for a fatal incident, where a worker was struck and killed by a trailer.

The company has vowed to rebuild. Residents told Capital B they have mixed feelings about the facility’s possible return because of the health risks. Despite those concerns, some here would welcome the economic benefits of a new facility.

More than half of Roseland residents — and 90% of its children — live in poverty. In the town of 1,200, Smitty’s, which employed roughly 450 people, was an economic lifesaver. Without it, some residents said it will be harder for people to support themselves financially.

“People are gonna find themselves in the trenches,” Taylor said.

With environmental protections erased, residents fend for themselves

About 1.5 miles away from the plant, Patricia Thomas was mopping the black sheen from her kitchen floor on Tuesday morning when the smell grabbed her throat. Her eyes burned, and the oily grit stuck to her shoes, tracking in from her yard. In her front yard, her green bushes had turned gray, and the mailbox was stuck shut with the black substance that had rained down in the explosion. She has to keep her great‑grandbaby away now. Even her cats, who often go outside, often return to her house streaked in a tar-like substance.

The 65-year-old said she survives on her $450 per month Social Security income. A week ago, she charged over $1,000 on her credit card at Home Depot for new wood paneling for her trailer and paid roofers to lay fresh shingles to stop a leak. The panels are now speckled and tacky to the touch, the shingles already lifting.

“They’re acting like no one is responsible, but I know for sure who isn’t responsible — we didn’t do it,” she said. “Who is paying for it?”

Thomas, who retired early due to health reasons, said issues with her back and shoulders make it difficult for her to scrub the black mystery substance that now coats her porch, fencing, and floors. She is afraid to touch any of it, afraid not to.

“This stuff could kill me if I touch it,” she said, “but what about if I keep tracking it in my house, too?”

At a community meeting on Monday, where many attendees expressed anger that no representatives from Smitty’s Supply or its insurance company were present, neighbors were advised to consult a civil lawyer. Already, six residents have filed lawsuits against the company. But Thomas did the math and shook her head.

“I don’t have money for a lawyer,” she said. “I barely cover my bills.” If there is a class action, maybe she will be included, she said. Otherwise, she worries she will be left to choose between breathing toxic this air and going deeper into debt to clean a mess she did not make.

Both Thomas and Mary said their anxiety levels have already increased.

Following a similar chemical fire in Illinois in 2021, a government survey found that half of the neighboring city’s residents experienced new or worsened health issues. And in 2019, a similar explosion led to residents in France reporting increased stress, depression, insomnia, and anxiety for a year after the event.

Just a year ago, residents in this majority-Black, low-income town would have had the legal right and avenue to petition the government to investigate the company and the disaster for elements of discrimination and wrongdoing. It would also be more difficult for the company to secure pollution permits to reopen operations.

Today, they said they’re left with complimentary water bottles and cleaning supplies.

“In the long run, this is gonna mess up for a long time, and they don’t care because of who lives here,” Taylor said, referring to what she sees as discrimination against Black people. “We don’t know what’s in this air right now or what might be in our water and bodies.”",https://i0.wp.com/capitalbnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4746.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-29 10:04:35.283551

Canada's National Observer reported that Canadian experts reinforced the health benefits of an EV mandate, which requires hybrids and EVs to comprise 20% of car sales by 2026 and 100% by 2035.

Eliminating cars fueled by dirty energy will save money and lives, according to the experts. Canada's National Observer noted that The Atmospheric Fund, a climate change and air pollution nonprofit, has argued the policy will prevent $90 billion in spending and 11,000 premature deaths over the next 25 years in Canada.

""While the EV availability standard has been communicated from the beginning as a climate policy, we think it's equally, if not more compelling as a health policy,"" Bryan Purcell, The Atmospheric Fund's vice president for policy and programs, said, per the report.

Unlike EVs, traditional vehicles produce tailpipe emissions, which contain harmful chemicals. In the report, Health Canada warned that exposure to these chemicals through traffic-related air pollution contributes to the development and worsening of asthma in children, lung cancer in adults, and premature deaths, among other health problems.

Asthma alone results in nearly 300 deaths and 80,000 emergency room visits annually, according to Asthma Canada, via the report. The organization estimates the disease, which affects more vulnerable populations like children, seniors, and communities located near pollution centers, will cost the country $4.2 billion by 2033.

However, policies like Canada's EV mandate can curb traffic-related air pollution and the health issues associated with it. While the mandate faces resistance from the automotive industry, Purcell likened it to regulating seatbelts in cars. He explained the industry argued seatbelts were consumers' choices, but the government decided ""there was a role for public policy to protect the public interest and public safety and we really see this regulation very similarly.""

In the United States, policies promoting EVs have also faced opposition, and tax credits for the vehicles expire at the end of September. However, switching to an EV can still save you up to $1,500 on gas and maintenance, as well as protect yourself and your community from tailpipe pollution.

""When you look at these kind of numbers of avoided deaths that can be achieved and other health benefits, I think it could purely justify the policy on health grounds, even if we didn't have a climate crisis on our hands,"" Purcell said about the Canadian mandate, per Canada's National Observer.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EV-mandateimage-reca96CwmPh7R6vyt.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 13:09:38.966390

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced his agency’s proposal to grant primacy of the Coal Combustion Residuals program to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality at a press conference Thursday at the Capitol.

“Wyoming has been trying very hard for years to be able to take primacy, to take control over its own destiny in overseeing coal combustion residuals,” Zeldin told a roomful of reporters, EPA staffers and a handful of Wyoming lawmakers. “One of the principles at the EPA is advancing cooperative federalism. It is our desire to improve our relationship with states [and] local governments.”

Zeldin was joined by a trio of Republicans — EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western (a former Wyoming lawmaker), Gov. Mark Gordon and Wyoming U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis — along with Wyoming DEQ Director Todd Parfitt. Each praised Zeldin and the rest of the Trump administration for putting states in charge of federal environmental programs and for rolling back federal regulations on fossil fuel industries — most of which were an overreach by Democratic administrations that stifle innovation and the U.S. economy, they said.

“I couldn’t believe that Lee Zeldin was willing to take the EPA on,” Lummis said. “What a heavy lift, because it had been used in this country to thwart economic activity and to second guess the experts in this deal, and it changed in a heartbeat. It changed the minute that Lee Zeldin became the administrator.”

Gordon concurred.

“You are a marvelous breath of fresh air,” he said. “We dealt with an administration that used regulation to frustrate progress, and I think, today, it is a remarkable moment to talk about how regulation, in Wyoming, is about doing things the right way.”

Coal ash

When power plants burn coal, heavy residues, known as clinker and slag, accumulate within the exhaust systems. It also produces a finer ash, most of which is captured via various filtration methods. All of those residuals are toxic. The substances are typically stored in coal ash ponds, and federal regulations — specifically, the Coal Combustion Residuals program — require that the sites be lined with materials to prevent seepage into surface waters or aquifers.

The program also requires monitoring to ensure containment.",https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/coalashpresser.png?fit=1300%2C925&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-29 11:00:26.644531

“We offer more electric S.U.V.s than any luxury manufacturer, all with more than 300 miles of driving range.” But that momentum will soon be tested.
Range Rover has postponed an electric S.U.V., and Mercedes has paused the U.S. production of its EQS and EQE electric S.U.V.s because of sluggish sales.
Those plants have lowered G.M.’s costs and have helped it avoid some tariffs.
The roughly $340,000 Celestiq is largely hand-built by a team of skilled craftspeople from G.M.’s prototype department.","To people who remember gas-guzzling land yachts with tail fins, Cadillac isn’t the brand that springs to mind when they think of electric cars.

Yet, thanks to a wave of new models, Cadillac has passed BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Porsche in U.S. sales of electric luxury vehicles. Nearly one in four new Cadillacs sold in the country is now electric, leading the brand to its strongest first half of the year since 2008.

“Cadillac has done an amazing job converting its traditional customers to E.V.s,” said Sam Fiorani, the vice president of AutoForecast Solutions.

Along with Chevrolet, Cadillac has helped its parent company, General Motors, rise to the No. 2 spot in E.V. sales behind Tesla. In the first seven months of the year, G.M. more than doubled its E.V. sales compared with a year earlier, to 78,000, while Tesla’s sales fell 11 percent to 272,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.

A once-stodgy brand that struggled to lure younger, tech-savvy car buyers, Cadillac is increasingly drawing customers from Tesla and other brands. About 70 percent of electric Cadillac Optiq and Lyriq buyers are switching from other luxury brands, according to G.M., and 10 percent of them previously owned a Tesla.

“We’re in a position of great momentum,” said John Roth, the global vice president of Cadillac. “We offer more electric S.U.V.s than any luxury manufacturer, all with more than 300 miles of driving range.”

But that momentum will soon be tested. Sales of electric vehicles, which were already slowing before President Trump took office, could now tumble as the federal government dismantles Biden-era climate policies designed to get more people to buy such cars in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Trump administration has raised tariffs on imported cars and auto parts. And Republicans in Congress have repealed a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 available to people who bought or leased electric vehicles. Consumers are racing to snap up electric models before the credit ends on Sept. 30. Sales could be much lower for many months after that, based on what happened in other countries that made similar policy changes. In Germany, electric sales dropped 27 percent in 2024 after subsidies ended.

Analysts said Cadillac and other brands would have to figure out how to sell electric models entirely on their merits. American buyers who previously would have considered electric models might now opt for hybrids, many of which cost only a little bit more than gasoline cars. U.S. automakers could try to sell more electric cars overseas, but may struggle to compete with cheaper Chinese models.

As a result, many carmakers, Cadillac among them, are leaning more heavily on gasoline models.

“The gas-powered vehicles make the money, and the E.V.s bring them a new market,” Mr. Fiorani said. “They’ll have to have both for a number of years now.”

Among Cadillac’s electric S.U.V.s, the Escalade IQ may especially underscore the industry’s balancing act between electric and gasoline models. For more than 25 years, the gas Escalade has been Cadillac’s status symbol and cash cow. The Escalade IQ is even more of a mammoth, but it is also more powerful, innovative and luxurious, with 750 horsepower and a driving range of more than 450 miles.

G.M. sold about 3,800 Escalade IQs in the first six months of the year, a strong showing for a three-row S.U.V. that starts around $130,000. But the gas Escalade, which is powered by a V-8 engine and starts at about $87,000, found more than six times as many customers, with about 24,000 sales.

Mr. Fiorani said G.M. had planned to retire the gasoline Escalade. Now it will design a new version and extend its life well into the next decade. A General Motors factory in Michigan that was slated to produce electric vehicles will instead build gasoline Escalades and G.M. pickups beginning in 2027.

G.M. is even pulling back on its E.V. output. The company announced on Thursday that it would temporarily slow the production of the Escalade IQ and GMC Hummer E.V. at its all-electric car factory in Detroit through Oct. 6. That factory also produces the electric Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups.

Nearly every luxury brand that had vowed to go fully electric in the coming years has backtracked. But Mr. Roth said no prudent business could ignore a huge shift in the market.

“It’s not an abandonment of the strategy whatsoever,” he said. “E.V.s are still foundational to what we’re doing, because they’re fantastic to drive. The range, infrastructure and battery tech continue to grow and improve.”

Mr. Fiorani said there were now too many electric models chasing too few customers. The automakers that do well in the next few years will be those that produce most of their electric cars and key components, like batteries, in the United States. They will also have to find ways to reduce production costs and offer cars for lower prices.

Some Cadillac competitors have already called timeout. Genesis, the luxury brand of Hyundai Motor, is pausing the production of its slow-selling electric GV70 S.U.V. in Alabama. Range Rover has postponed an electric S.U.V., and Mercedes has paused the U.S. production of its EQS and EQE electric S.U.V.s because of sluggish sales.

Mr. Roth said Cadillac and G.M. were not as vulnerable as European or Asian luxury carmakers to tariffs and the loss of the federal tax credit. All but one of Cadillac’s electric models are built in the United States. The exception is its most affordable model, the Optiq, which starts at $54,390 and is made in Mexico.

G.M. set up two battery factories, in Ohio and Tennessee, through a joint venture with LG Energy Solution. Those plants have lowered G.M.’s costs and have helped it avoid some tariffs. These investments have helped them maintain or lower the prices of its electric vehicles.

“If the industry around luxury E.V.s does get smaller,” Mr. Roth said, “I fully expect that Cadillac will get a larger share of that portion.”

G.M. is also hoping to lower costs further in the coming years by producing batteries that use less nickel and cobalt, two expensive raw materials found in most electric vehicle batteries made in the United States.

One of the approaches that G.M. is pursuing replaces some nickel and cobalt with manganese. The company has said this could lower battery costs more than $6,000 while still allowing its large S.U.V.s and pickups to drive more than 400 miles on a full charge.

Cadillac is also trying to move into the more rarefied world of cars that sell for several hundred thousand dollars. It has recently started selling the Celestiq electric sedan, which aims to steal customers from companies like Rolls-Royce.

The roughly $340,000 Celestiq is largely hand-built by a team of skilled craftspeople from G.M.’s prototype department. Buyers typically spend a few months commissioning a bespoke model that ensures no two Celestiqs are alike. A dozen coats of paint take two weeks to apply, and 150 interior components are wrapped and stitched by hand. For the back seats, one customer chose sen wood, a Japanese ash whose fine-grained veneer mimics the style of an Eames lounge or other midcentury bentwood chair.

Customers can collaborate with design experts and see wall-size digital renderings of their car at Cadillac House.This special showroom occupies a suburban Detroit building originally designed by Eero Saarinen, the midcentury architect who created G.M.’s Tech Center campus.

The Celestiq “allows us to enter the ultraluxury segment, which Cadillac hasn’t been a part of for many, many years,” Mr. Roth said.

Cadillac is also trying to make itself more international. One way it’s doing so is by joining Formula 1 racing next year. Cadillac will become the first new team on the F1 grid since 2016. The move comes at a cost: Cadillac will pay a $450 million “anti-dilution” fee to compensate 10 other teams, including Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes, for revenue they will now have to share with Cadillac.

“You don’t do all that to sell Cadillacs to traditional buyers in the U.S.,” said Sam Abuelsamid, the vice president of market research for Telemetry. “You do it to sell Cadillacs everywhere.”

Until recently, Cadillac was selling more cars in China than in the United States, but those sales have withered as Chinese automakers have become a dominant force in electric vehicles.

Mr. Abuelsamid said G.M. and other Western automakers might never recapture what they had in China, but they can still do well in the United States, Europe and other places. But to succeed, he said, carmakers will have to keep investing in electric vehicles and not just rely on gasoline models.

“If these automakers are going to be part of the global auto landscape,” Mr. Abuelsamid said, “they have to have electrification, or they’re done.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/22/multimedia/00biz-cadillac-ev-01-jlkz/00biz-cadillac-ev-01-jlkz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 11:00:46.743881

A price war among China’s EV manufacturing giants has continued to push down the cost of China-produced batteries.
“Facing a demand falloff is actually very bad for the long-term health of the U.S. manufacturing of batteries,” Shih said.
The solar industry, for example, has a great need for batteries, Shih said.
However, the Trump administration has similarly gone after solar energy initiatives, saying earlier this month it would no longer approve wind or solar projects, claiming they increase energy prices.","“The president is delivering on his promise to stop subsidizing electric vehicles with Americans’ tax dollars,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Fortune in a statement. “The administration remains committed to an America First economic agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation that strengthens American manufacturing without forceful EV mandates.”

Losing ground on the U.S. manufacturing push

Trump has made U.S. reshoring efforts a focal point of his second administration through the implementation of steep tariffs intended to incentivize domestic manufacturing. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick called factory roles the “great jobs of the future.”

But increasing inventories of batteries threaten this vision, Shih said. Slowing demand and slowing manufacturing activity eliminates opportunity for innovation that comes with rampant production and iteration, meaning prices for locally produced batteries will likely tick upward.

These demand shocks create a “bullwhip effect” across the supply chain, according to Li Chen, professor of operations, technology, and information management at Cornell University’s SC Johnson College of Business. Declines in consumer demand eventually amplify, leading not only to a surplus, but a likely battery shortage down the line as a result of decreased manufacturing capabilities.

“The initial effect is the battery surplus as we are seeing now,” Chen told Fortune. “But after the battery manufacturers cut back their capacity in response, my prediction is that there will be a shortage of [batteries] down the road with very high probability.”

Meanwhile, the global battery industry has continued to overproduce lithium-ion batteries, with China’s announced manufacturing capacity for lithium-ion batteries surpassing the expected 2025 global demand about threefold, according to BloombergNEF data. A price war among China’s EV manufacturing giants has continued to push down the cost of China-produced batteries.

“Facing a demand falloff is actually very bad for the long-term health of the U.S. manufacturing of batteries,” Shih said. “And if you believe—as many people do—that batteries are a key technology as the world moves towards more electrification, that’s not a good scenario.”

Tenuous hopes for U.S. battery manufacturing

Because the EV sector is not poised for immediate growth, battery producers will likely look to other industries to offset low demand. The solar industry, for example, has a great need for batteries, Shih said. The industry is beholden to feed-in tariffs, a policy designed to support renewable energy by paying businesses a set rate for the energy they produce.

This is a profitable model when demand for solar energy is high, but when demand is low, companies will sometimes have to pay negative feed-in tariffs for their oversupply. Batteries that can store energy help eliminate the risk of oversupply and negative feed-in tariffs, according to Shih.

However, the Trump administration has similarly gone after solar energy initiatives, saying earlier this month it would no longer approve wind or solar projects, claiming they increase energy prices. Trump’s vision of continuing to rely on fossil fuels and natural gas is myopic, according to Shih.

“He looks at one thing at a time, as opposed to looking at the bigger picture,” he said. This bigger picture, according to Shih, includes the argument that the U.S. has a lot to gain in the long term by looking at the long-term cost of energy, which could be cheaper if the U.S. invested in battery manufacturing.

“The U.S. would benefit by being globally competitive, but in order to do that, you have to have somebody who’s willing to buy products so that you can invest in manufacturing and growing that capability, right?” Shih said. “So it’s a bit of a contradiction.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bv04K2lNyv8v.ImDtySQpA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/3c9a9bd07ee07036f70235fd7f2afe3c,N,,2025-08-29 13:10:38.570293

Singh and Raus agree that the future of US energy is not about picking one source but embracing a diverse mix.","Fair Observer Video Producer & Social Media Manager Rohan Khattar Singh speaks with Sam Raus, a political analyst and David Boaz Resident Writing Fellow at Young Voices, about America’s evolving energy strategy. They contrast the subsidies of former US President Joe Biden’s administration with the market-driven approach of current US President Donald Trump’s administration, and discuss the future of American energy.

Raus opens by critiquing the former president’s Inflation Reduction Act, calling it a misnamed policy that lavished billions of dollars in subsidies on solar and wind industries — what he labels “corporate handouts.” He argues these subsidies distorted the energy market by pre-selecting winners rather than letting innovation and consumer demand determine the most effective energy sources.

Raus says solar and wind were favored not because of their reliability or affordability, but because of ideological preferences. Simultaneously, more promising sectors like geothermal and nuclear were sidelined. He sees this as a prejudiced approach that inflated US debt and ignored real technological limitations, such as the poor performance of solar batteries.

The “Big Beautiful Bill Act” levels the playing field

By contrast, Raus praises the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill Act” for eliminating corporate tax credits for solar and wind. He believes this shift allows for a more level playing field, enabling all energy sources to compete based on merit rather than political support.

While state-level subsidies may persist, Raus emphasizes that the federal rollback signals a broader return to consumer-driven energy development — one focused on safety, reliability and affordability. He views the new policy as a correction to what he sees as the prior administration’s ideological overreach, putting economic concerns at the forefront amid ongoing inflation and post-pandemic recovery.

Reframing environmentalism: innovation vs. degrowth

Singh challenges Raus on environmental risks, mentioning that scientists fear Trump’s policy could “cook the planet.” Raus argues that both green and traditional energy projects are stifled by excessive environmental regulation under laws like the National Environmental Policy Act. He advocates for a “pro-growth, pro-innovation” mindset, suggesting that the reform and acceleration of development are key to resolving environmental challenges — not halting progress.

Raus opposes what he calls the “degrowth” movement, claiming it is incompatible with how market economies function. He maintains that removing subsidies doesn’t tilt the scales toward fossil fuels but rather ends government favoritism, allowing the most viable technologies to emerge organically.

Nuclear and geothermal are the next frontier

Raus sees promise in both nuclear and geothermal energy. Geothermal, he states, is finally nearing scalability. Nuclear is regaining public support after years of fear-driven opposition. With growing energy needs from emerging technologies like AI, he believes nuclear energy offers a viable, scalable solution. He notes openness to nuclear energy even among environmentalists and tech giants like Google and Meta, who are investing in that space.

However, Raus cautions that public opinion and geographic siting issues could still pose challenges. He urges broader participation and compromise to avoid turning energy policy into a cultural battle, expressing optimism about bipartisan acceptance of nuclear as a major player in the future energy mix.

The US vs. global energy strategies

Singh points out that the world is moving away from this idea, instead prioritizing green energy. Raus defends the United States’s more market-based approach. He contrasts it with the top-down, state-controlled strategies of the European Union and China — these produce inefficiencies like regulatory overreach, ghost cities and a lack of innovation.

The American system fosters dynamic competition, allowing diverse energy sources to fill specific roles — from residential solar to nuclear-powered AI infrastructure. Raus believes the US has stronger natural resources, international supply chains and modern infrastructure, giving it an edge in both energy and AI. He envisions the US leading by example with a balanced, decentralized approach that other nations may eventually adopt.

Singh and Raus agree that the future of US energy is not about picking one source but embracing a diverse mix. Traditional sources will remain important as newer technologies mature. Raus supports this pragmatic vision and sees it as a reflection of sound policy that prioritizes competition, innovation and consumer needs over government mandates.

She wrote, ""Tesla's distinctive advertising strategy warrants a departure from the typical approach,"" citing the company's reliance on its website for key claims.
Tesla says FSD requires active driver supervision and does not make its vehicles autonomous.
Better safeguards and transparency are essential in maintaining trust in electric vehicles.
Meanwhile, as the EV landscape evolves, shoppers interested in cleaner vehicles can more carefully evaluate electric vehicle options.","A federal judge has allowed a class action against Tesla to move forward after California drivers claimed the company misled them about its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assistance software for its electric vehicles. According to Reuters, Tesla owners who paid thousands for the feature can pursue claims as a group.

What's happening?

U.S. District Judge Rita Lin found that there were enough common questions for Tesla drivers to sue as a group, including whether the cars had the sensors for high-level autonomy or had ever completed a fully autonomous trip. She wrote, ""Tesla's distinctive advertising strategy warrants a departure from the typical approach,"" citing the company's reliance on its website for key claims.

The ruling split drivers into two groups. The first covers buyers from October 20, 2016, to May 19, 2017. The second includes those who bought between May 19, 2017, and July 31, 2024, but opted out of Tesla's arbitration rules. The FSD package costs thousands of dollars.

This isn't an isolated situation for Tesla. In recent years, it's dealt with a direct sales ban case and a Solar Roof price-hike lawsuit. In Sweden, workers went on strike against the EV giant. Each of these disputes has hit customers in different ways — unexpected price hikes, fewer buying options due to sales bans, and delivery/registration delays amid strikes.

Why is this important?

The case is a reminder of how risky it can be to spend thousands on high-tech features that may not perform as advertised. Joining together in a class action makes it cheaper for drivers to fight back and forces more accountability on the automaker.

And if people stop trusting self-driving vehicles, many might put off buying new cars. That kind of slowdown could drag out the move to cleaner vehicles, even though transportation already accounts for about 15% of global heat-trapping gases.

What's being done about it?

Judge Lin certified the case in federal court. Federal officials — including the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which probed the feature in 2024 — have examined whether FSD is safe. Tesla says FSD requires active driver supervision and does not make its vehicles autonomous.

The scrutiny could result in clearer standards and stronger disclosures, which would help provide buyers stronger protection. Better safeguards and transparency are essential in maintaining trust in electric vehicles.

A GM spokesperson said the move, which is temporary, will help the company align production to match demand. “Factory Zero is making temporary adjustments to production to align to market dynamics,” the spokesperson said.. “General Motors updates schedules as part of our standard process of aligning production to manage vehicle inventory.”

The production pause affects 160 employees, but it comes on top of another temporary staff cutback that was announced in April and affects a further 200 employees. The previous layoffs were the result of slowing sales for the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV, GMC Sierra EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ.

According to GM, the impacted workers will be placed on a temporary layoff and may be eligible for subpay and benefits.

“They have no way of getting [the natural gas] there because it’s been held up by New York,” Trump said in March.
Ayotte has shown reticence about offshore wind development, and signed a bill earlier this month that eliminated language requiring the state’s Office of Energy Innovation to support offshore wind development.
Lamont has also shown hesitance about offshore wind, with Connecticut opting not to procure any new offshore wind projects during a 2024 joint solicitation between Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.
Daymark’s report noted that the deployment of emission-free offshore wind “would have offset natural gas, oil and coal-fired generation, reducing fossil fuel burned by 34 million MMBtu over the 3-month period.”","Dive Brief:

If the 3.5 GW of wind energy projects currently contracted offshore New England had been operational last winter, it could have offset the surge in natural gas prices that season and saved ratepayers a total of $400 million on their energy bills, according to a Wednesday report from Daymark Energy Advisors.

The report estimated that “savings exceeded [power purchase agreement] costs across all scenarios, yielding annual bill savings of $1.32 to $2.68 per month for an average Eversource [Energy] residential customer.”

RENEW Northeast, the group that commissioned the report, noted that ISO New England released a report last month which found gas prices in spring 2025 averaged $3.40 per million British thermal units, 112% higher than the spring 2024 price of $1.60/MMBtu.

Dive Insight:

The report examines the “potential regional market and Massachusetts ratepayer impacts” if 3.5 GW of offshore wind had been generating power between Dec. 2024 and Feb. 2025.

“Even using the most conservative assumptions about cleared offers in Forward Capacity Auction 15 … clearing additional qualified capacity from OSW would have reduced FCA15 costs by at least $128 million, with 83% ($106 million) allocable to Massachusetts load zones,” the report said.

Daymark Energy Advisors found that “injecting near-zero marginal cost offshore wind into the energy market would have reduced ISO-NE Locational Marginal Prices by 11% ($12.60/MWh), reducing wholesale load costs across New England by roughly $400 million. Roughly $129 million of the regional savings would have been allocable to [Massachusetts electric distribution companies].”

Last winter was the “first since 2014 to see below-normal temperatures over the course of an entire season,” ISO-NE said in an April release, and natural gas prices rose in accordance with demand.

President Donald Trump and New England leaders like Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, D, and New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte, R, have suggested the region build a new natural gas pipeline to curb the high cost of energy.

“They have no way of getting [the natural gas] there because it’s been held up by New York,” Trump said in March.

Ayotte has shown reticence about offshore wind development, and signed a bill earlier this month that eliminated language requiring the state’s Office of Energy Innovation to support offshore wind development. Lamont has also shown hesitance about offshore wind, with Connecticut opting not to procure any new offshore wind projects during a 2024 joint solicitation between Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.

However, Lamont told CNBC on Tuesday that the Trump administration’s decision to halt work on the 700-MW Revolution Wind project under construction offshore Rhode Island and Connecticut was “sudden, erratic and insane” and said he will try to strike a deal with the administration to keep the project going.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in May that New York Governor Kathy Hochul had indicated “her willingness to move forward on critical pipeline capacity” for natural gas, after Hochul negotiated with the Trump administration to lift a stop work order on the 810-MW Empire Wind 1 project offshore New York.

On August 1, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published its proposed repeal of the “Endangerment Finding,” the scientific and legal predicate for federal rules to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from vehicles and other sources. The proposed action was billed as “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States,” an unverifiable but nonetheless directionally accurate statement. If EPA is successful in fully repealing the Endangerment Finding – something we will not know until the proposal is finalized and likely years of litigation play out – future administrations will face considerable barriers to regulating GHG emissions, if they can regulate at all. The EPA also proposes to repeal all GHG emissions standards for new motor vehicles—an action that would, on its own, have devasting climate consequences given that the transportation sector is the leading source of GHG emissions in the U.S. today.

EPA’s proposals to repeal the Endangerment Finding and the vehicle GHG standards it supports are currently in the administrative rulemaking phase. The rulemaking remains open for public comment through September 22, 2025, and anyone – cities, local elected officials, community groups and individual residents – may submit comment letters.

Participating in the public comment process has three potential benefits. First, public comments can inform EPA’s thinking as it finalizes its rulemaking, influencing revisions to its proposal. In this rulemaking, EPA seems determined to repeal the Endangerment Finding, and local leaders may not be the right stakeholders to convince the agency otherwise. But commenting can still have an impact. Indeed, the second benefit is that public comment letters help build the administrative record, which can then be drawn from by attorneys in the litigation that is sure to follow conclusion of the rulemaking. This is where the local perspective can be particularly useful: when cities, local officials, and community groups share the public health impacts, costs to adapt and respond to extreme weather, and their reliance on federal regulation to bolster their own climate and clean energy goals, groups challenging any eventual repeal of the Endangerment Finding or of the motor vehicles regulations can draw on those submissions to build their cases. And third, submitting a comment letter can be a communications opportunity, a chance for cities to express public support for robust GHG regulations.

This blog post is designed to help local leaders navigate the proposed repeal of the Endangerment Finding and the related GHG standards for motor vehicles. It explains what the Endangerment Finding is, what EPA has proposed, and what’s at stake for local governments and communities if EPA moves forward.

The Endangerment Finding, Explained

In 2009, the EPA made a formal determination that six greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) – in combination “may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations.” Referred to as the “Endangerment Finding,” the determination was based on extensive scientific evidence, and followed a 2009 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which held that GHGs fall within the definition of air pollution under the Clean Air Act, and thus could be regulated if an Endangerment Finding was made.

EPA’s Endangerment Finding had immediate legal consequence. Under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, the EPA Administrator is required to promulgate and periodically update regulations “applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in his judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” The EPA began regulating vehicles for model years starting in 2012.

The Endangerment Finding was later used as the scientific basis for greenhouse gas regulations for power plants and oil and gas wells, both under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. While the legal mechanics differ for these two regulations, without the Endangerment Finding, EPA would lack the scientific underpinning for them. (It is worth noting that each of these regulations are the subject to their own ongoing repeal processes or efforts to delay compliance).

The Endangerment Finding is the basis for all federal limits on GHG emissions from any source. Without it, EPA cannot regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles or from power plants, which together account for over 47 percent of all GHG emissions in the United States, and for much higher percentages in GHG emissions in many cities. GHG limits on these facilities have prevented and stand to prevent billions of tons of emissions.

The Endangerment Finding is more fundamental than the regulations it supports; GHG regulations have gone through successive rulemakings during each of the Obama, first Trump, and Biden administrations seeking to augment or weaken them based on administration priorities. A repeal of the Endangerment Finding, by contrast, would hinder EPA’s ability to regulate GHGs for years to come.

EPA’s Proposed Arguments

EPA’s rollback proposal can be thought of in three broad strokes. First, EPA proposes that its regulatory authority extends only to pollutants “for which the air pollution itself, through local or regional exposure to humans and the environment, endangers public health or welfare,” not to emissions like GHGs that operate on a global scale. Therefore, per EPA’s reasoning, the Endangerment Finding should never have been made. Both the text of the Clean Air Act and rulings from the Supreme Court contradict EPA’s assertions.

Second, EPA proposes that, even if it is authorized to regulate GHG emissions, scientific and judicial developments since 2009 “cast significant doubt on the reliability of” the Endangerment Finding. Of course, the science supporting a determination that GHG-induced climate change is dangerous to human health and welfare has only become more certain since then.

Third and finally, even if the Endangerment Finding stands, the agency argues that regulating GHG emissions from new U.S. motor vehicles would be “futile” as compared to the global problem of climate change. This is difficult to justify given that the United States is the largest historical emitter of GHGs, and that motor vehicles account for over 22 percent of all annual U.S. emissions. Essentially, EPA seems to argue, if it can’t fix the entire problem of climate change, it shouldn’t have to try.

The Local Perspective Matters Now

Local governments and elected officials are well-positioned to challenge EPA’s erroneous arguments by providing firsthand accounts and evidence of the impacts of GHG-induced climate change. Local leaders may not be climate scientists, but they are experts in how GHGs have contributed to dangerous extreme weather events, negative health outcomes, and destruction of critical infrastructure in their communities. They also can attest to the adaptation and disaster response costs their cities incur. The sky-high costs and other catastrophic consequences cities are already experiencing belie EPA’s assertions that GHGs from motor vehicles are not worth regulating. They also demonstrate that impacts from GHG-caused climate change are very much felt at the local level, even if GHG pollution is global in scale.

Local testimony is crucial for building the administrative record in this rulemaking. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), courts reviewing agency actions are largely limited to the record the agency compiles in its rulemaking. The APA requires EPA to consider all comments submitted (whether orally or in writing) in the Endangerment Finding rulemaking alongside other materials to reach a reasoned conclusion. If it fails to do so, plaintiffs can sue to challenge the final decision by pointing to relevant evidence, comments, or data that EPA ignored or only selectively considered.

To put it another way, if a local government or elected official doesn’t submit a comment to say what’s at stake in the Endangerment Finding rulemaking, challengers in court likely can’t use that information. Local governments have a wealth of data to share with EPA and with eventual challengers to EPA’s final rule: infrastructure damage that has been caused by storms or other extreme weather; incidences of health disparities or mortality due to air pollution or climate events; jobs and productivity losses due to extreme weather, and detail on the costs that have been or will be incurred to adapt and respond to the effects of GHG pollution.

Drafting a Comment Letter

Stakeholders – including local governments, elected officials, businesses, community groups, and residents – may upload written comment letters to the docket for the Endangerment Finding rulemaking on or before September 22, 2025. Comment letters should clearly state the rulemaking’s docket number, which is EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194-0093. While online submittal is recommended by the agency, mail-in options are also provided on the docket page. A template for local government comments developed by the Sabin Center is available here.

The proposed repeal of the Endangerment Finding and associated vehicle GHG standards represents a profound threat to federal climate protections and to the ability of local governments to safeguard public health and welfare. Cities and communities already bear the brunt of climate-related harms – from extreme weather and infrastructure damage to health risks and economic costs – and they rely on robust federal regulation to prevent further harm.

Local leaders have an opportunity to participate in the public comment process. By submitting firsthand accounts, they can ensure that EPA understands the real-world impacts of GHG pollution in their communities, build a strong administrative record for future legal challenges, and publicly affirm their commitment to the protection of public health and welfare.

The stakes are high: the Endangerment Finding underpins every federal regulation limiting GHG emissions. Its repeal would not only roll back existing protections but would make it far more difficult for future administrations to act. For cities, residents, and local governments, participating in this rulemaking is essential to defending the climate, public health, and the well-being of communities nationwide.",https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/files/2025/08/pexels-lenzatic-12330011-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 12:07:52.097581

I had written about this just a month back but registration wasn’t open then and I almost forgot. But in the nick of time I signed up and was issued a slot along with hundreds of other organizational representatives and concerned citizens. In fact, there were so many interested in speaking that the testimonies started Tuesday morning and went all the way until Friday, with all testimonies being limited to 2.5 minutes max (strictly enforced!).

I joined for my two hour block Wednesday morning (and Bart Everson joined the following day) and we both presented arguments to not repeal the Endangerment Finding. I’ll share those both below in a moment, but I’ll admit, I heard far more powerful statements than my own. I was truly awed by the passion of the climate scientists, nurses, clean air advocates, ministers, and many others who spoke. The best and most hopeful part was that in the two hours I listened, not one person spoke in support of repealing the Endangerment Finding. That doesn’t mean EPA won’t do away with it anyway (and there are already legal efforts proceeding to fight the basis for their action) but for a moment it made me feel less alone.

One presenter from California Interfaith Power & Light went and reminded the EPA representatives listening that “we are of the Earth” Even I didn’t go that route, trying to speak in language EPA might get through their heads. Instead, I quoted, with tongue firmly in cheek, a businessman I hope all of them recognized and made it about the economy, stupid, which is the stated focus of nearly all of the Trump Administration’s choices. Bart framed his comment around climate change being an existential issue, particularly for the Gulf Coast, which could be devastated if we don’t stabilize the climate soon. Anyway, enough context, below are my and Bart’s comments (well, with a bit more context there). And while it’s too late for you to speak publicly, it’s not too late for you to write a comment. The comment period is open until September 22nd. I strongly encourage you to write a comment here.

Public Comment by Erik Assadourian

I’m Erik Assadourian, the Director of the Gaian Way and I’d like to start with a quote from a prominent business leader: “Business is business! And business must grow regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.”

Most of you will recognize that infamous business mantra, spoken by Dr. Seuss’s The Onceler. This is a perfect representation of the short-termism embedded in the EPA’s proposal to stop regulating climate change and its detrimental effects on health and well-being.

It is an act of extreme naivety. Business, and the continued success of America’s economy depends on climate stability; it requires the coasts to remain unflooded; the woodlands to remain unburned; and the agricultural lands to remain productive. But as we destabilize the climate, the future of the U.S. and the world are imperiled.

The Club of Rome revealed this reality over 50 years ago with The Limits to Growth. James Hansen and thousands of climate scientists since have revealed that one of the most significant limits to Earth’s ability to provide for human society is the global carbon sink Earth’s atmosphere and oceans provide.

Denying reality—and intentionally creating research that cherry-picks the science to justify the removal of climate considerations from the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency is partisan politics at its worst. Republicans and Democrats will be equally affected by the horrors that uncontrolled climate change will bring.

To undermine the Endangerment Finding is a breach of government responsibility, one that will not lead to an improved future for even special interests like energy producers and car companies. This is true even in the short-term as in the aftermath of this repeal, states will inevitably create new and confusing state-wide vehicle CO2 emissions rules increasing businesses’ costs and further stifling innovation.

And in the long-term, if America’s agricultural lands, forests, coasts, and cities are crippled by climate effects, so too will America’s economy be crippled. I fear that just like the Onceler, those who supported this action will “throughout the years, while their buildings have fallen apart, they’ll worry about it with all their heart.” But by then, it will be far too late. Thus I urge the EPA to not go down this foolish road and uphold the Endangerment Finding.

Contextualizing Bart’s Comment

From Bart: Everyone knows what a “senior moment” is, but have you ever heard of someone having a “Katrina moment”? I’m old enough to have both, and that’s what happened on Thursday. To be fair, it’s not that I forgot that I’d signed up to make a public comment to the EPA, but I did the time-zone conversion wrong. If the government hadn’t sent me a friendly reminder via text message, I might have missed my slot.

I wasn’t particularly nervous about speaking to the EPA, I’ve addressed governmental panels before, and in this case I had my script all written out. Just 250 words, two and a half minutes, no sweat.

What I didn’t anticipate was how choked up I got. As soon as I started speaking about the floods of 2005, my eyes welled up with tears, making it hard to read my script, and my throat seemed to close up, making it hard to speak. But I got through it all right.

Normally I might have been embarrassed about such a public display of emotion, but honestly I was glad for it. I heard a lot of other comments from a lot of other people, all universally urging the EPA to retain the Endangerment Finding and do their job; they all made lots of really powerful, logical, insightful points, backed with evidence. But at this point, I wonder if logic or evidence has anything to do with it. Perhaps the only thing that will sway the decision-makers is a sense of moral shame. If seeing a grown man cry engendered a little shame in their hearts, so much the better, I suppose.

Public Comment by Bart Everson

Thank you for this chance to speak. My name is Bart Everson. I’m representing the Greater New Orleans Interfaith Climate Coalition, a nonpartisan, grassroots, volunteer-driven network of churches and mosques and synagogues and temples and just plain people who hold this Living Earth as sacred. As we approach the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, I don’t need to remind you that the Greater New Orleans area is particularly vulnerable to extreme weather and rising sea levels, both of which are associated with climate change.

While there are multiple factors behind the changing climate, a primary driver is the emission of greenhouse gases from our power plants, agricultural practices, vehicles and transportation, landfills, and so on. To be blunt, the continued emission of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane poses an existential threat to our region of south Louisiana and indeed the entire Gulf Coast. I’m not a legal expert, but I believe that’s what the Endangerment Finding of 2009 is all about. And now y’all want to repeal it? In our view, the Environmental Protection Agency wasn’t doing enough to regulate emissions in the first place, and now y’all are talking about doing less? We find that outrageous, and I stand before you angry, discouraged, and heartbroken. On a scale of one to ten, our opposition to this move is one thousand. Locally, we’re doing our part to encourage the resilience of our communities, to consume less, to reduce our footprint. We need you to do your part. Thank you.

Thanks for reading these two comments, now please go out and write your own!

The NRC held a series of public meetings from July 31 through August 6 to gather feedback about enabling a restart of a former Three Mile Island Unit 2 that permanently stopped operating after 40 years in September 2019.

Crane Clean Energy Center

This reactor is now called the Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center and is licensed by Constellation Energy Generation, a unit of Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Corp.

Last year, Constellation Energy Generation expressed an interest to bring back the nuclear power plant to operational status.

“This is only the second time a permanently closed U.S. nuclear power plant has attempted to return to operation. These restart efforts, if they meet NRC requirements, could significantly contribute to the country’s energy needs in the years ahead,” the NRC said in a July 21 notice.

In September 2024, Constellation announced it signed a 20-year agreement with Microsoft to purchase carbon-free energy from the plant for its data centers.

At that time, Constellation noted in a press statement that a restart would require the NRC approval, new permits from state and local agencies, and a comprehensive safety and environment review.

“To prepare for the restart, significant investments will be made to restore the plant, including the turbine, generator, main power transformer and cooling and control systems,” Constellation stated then. “Additionally, through a separate request, Constellation will pursue license renewal that will extend plant operations to at least 2054.”

Constellation bought the reactor in 1999 before “it was retired prematurely for economic reasons in 2019,” the company noted. The nuclear power was able to generate up to 837 megawatts—equal to provide sufficient electricity to power 800,000 homes.

“For the Crane Clean Energy Center, Constellation has suggested a timeline for the NRC to complete its reviews by the end of 2027. The agency will determine our review schedule once Constellation has submitted all of its relevant licensing requests, but at this point the agency believes the end of 2027 is reasonable for finishing our work,” said Scott Burnell, NRC spokesperson.

Palisades Nuclear Plant

On July 24, the NRC approved licensing and regulatory actions to greenlight restarting the Palisades Nuclear Plant in Covert, Mich, which stopped producing electricity in 2022.

“Following technical reviews that were completed on schedule, the NRC has approved the transfer of operating authority for the plant and its independent spent fuel storage facility from Holtec Decommissioning International LLC to Palisades Energy LLC,” the NRC noted in a public announcement.

These actions enable Holtec to load fuel, but the NRC has additional requirements before the plant can resume operations under its original operating license that expires in 2031.

The U.S. Department of Energy recently released its fifth distribution ($83.2 million) of a maximum $1.52 billion loan guarantee to Holtec for the Palisades Nuclear Plant to be the first restarted commercial reactor in the U.S.

DOE stated that the federal dollars support President Donald Trump’s Executive Order 14302: “Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base” by restarting nuclear plants.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated in an Aug. 7 media release that DOE is “working in tandem with our regulatory partners to accelerate the reopening of the Palisades Nuclear Plant and unleash a true American nuclear renaissance. These efforts will help reinvigorate our nuclear industrial base, deliver lower energy costs for millions of Americans and strengthen our nation’s energy security.”

The first plant to attempt to return to operations was Palisades in Michigan, the agency approved relevant licensing actions last month:

Three years ago, Florida-based Holtec International acquired the Palisades Power Plant and the Big Rock Point site from Entergy Corp. Palisades ceased operating in May 2022 after providing electricity for over 50 years in southwest Michigan. Also located in the state, Big Rock Point in Charlevoix shutdown in 1997 and was decommissioned a few years later.

Why it matters: Democrats see an opening to transform power prices into political baggage for Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections.

Prices are up across the country and projected to keep rising in 2026.

President Trump campaigned on pledges to sharply cut energy costs.

The GOP's signature budget law phases out incentives for adding new renewable power.

AI data centers' voracious need for energy keeps the topic in the news.

But electricity is only part of the equation when it comes to energy costs. And Republicans counter that the recent budget law will resonate with energy-minded voters.

""Democrats have a big job ahead of them connecting to everyday voters that the beautiful bill, and its removing subsidies, is equaling higher energy prices,"" said Casey Burgat of George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.

Driving the news: Democratic candidates, campaign arms and allied groups are placing digital and TV ads, billboards and more that hit Republicans over utility bills.

""Americans want lower costs and rising energy bills will be a regular, unavoidable reminder to voters that House Republicans have failed miserably at fulfilling their central campaign promise,"" Viet Shelton, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said via email.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer often points to analysis by the pro-renewables think tank Energy Innovation.

Its study estimates that the budget law will bring $130 annual increases in house energy costs by 2030.

The big picture: Electricity prices and demand have been rising since the pandemic thanks to several forces rowing in the same direction.

Think data center growth, wider digitalization of the economy, high temperatures, rising costs for natural gas used in power plants, power infrastructure investment, electric cars, manufacturing growth and more.

The Energy Department's independent stats arm projects a year-over-year increase of over 4% in residential costs per kilowatt-hour in 2025, and a similar rise in 2026.

Reality check: Gasoline prices are typically a much higher share of household energy bills than electricity.

The cost of filling up is tethered to oil prices, and right now ample supply and modest global demand growth could mean lower election-year prices.

The Energy Information Administration currently projects gasoline averaging under $2.90 per gallon next year, a 6% decrease from 2025.

Friction point: The battle over the budget law's energy provisions cuts both ways, and GOP officials say Biden-era policies put too many restrictions on fossil fuels.

GOP candidates and operatives will point to measures like the law's expansion of drilling access for oil and, more relevant to power, natural gas on federal lands.

""Republicans are unleashing American energy dominance and strengthening energy security, ultimately lowering everyday costs for American families and small businesses,"" Mike Marinella, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement.

State of play: One example of electricity bills' role is Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic candidate for governor in New Jersey, vowing to declare a ""state of emergency"" that freezes rate increases.

What they're saying: Home energy is part of the wider mix of expenses that are together critical in elections.

""I think the cost of living overall will dictate the extent to which Democrats can claw back support among voters who defected from Biden to Trump,"" said Dave Wasserman, senior editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.

""Fundamentally, Biden won in 2020 with the support of voters who were frustrated by the COVID economy, and Trump won in 2024 thanks to many of those same voters who were frustrated with inflation,"" he said.

Yes, but: Power bills, paid less often than most people fill up cars, may lack the day-to-day resonance of gasoline.

What we're watching: Look for the topic to surface in many of the tightest races.

Joanna Mendoza, the Democrat running against Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani in Arizona's highly competitive 6th District, says power costs are a big deal for people.

""We're in triple digits for several for several months, and you cannot live without some type of air conditioning or cooling,"" she said of the southeastern Arizona region.

WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, WV – On Thursday, Governor Patrick Morrisey told attendees of the annual West Virginia Chamber’s Business Summit, being held this week at The Greenbrier Resort, that it’s time to leverage the state’s energy resources.

“Right now, West Virginia has 16 gigawatts of baseload generating capacity,” Morrisey said. “Think about that. But a number are projected to shrink with some of the power plant retirements. For a state with over one-third of the coal and gas reserves, I don’t think that makes much sense. So, it’s important for part of our economic development to have a strategic plan to change that.”

The plan, according to Morrisey, is to “supercharge” the state’s power production by increasing the state’s current baseload generation capacity from 16 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts by 2050.

Although the Governor didn’t explain the plan in its entirety on Thursday, he did provide some details, and said more information will be made available in the coming weeks.

“It’s pushing to increase reliability by prioritizing stable sources of fuel, primarily coal, natural gas and nuclear,” Morrisey said of the plan. “By maintaining and building out our grid our ‘50 by 50’ initiative – that’s gonna make West Virginia, by far, the leading per capita exporter of energy in the nation.”

Morrisey continued that part of the plan includes the development and expansion of economical uses for coal that goes beyond power production, though no details on this were provided.

Additionally, Morrisey said that the plan will focus on investing in advanced power generation, including nuclear power plants, as well as the need for sufficient transmission lines and natural gas pipelines.

One day prior to Morrisey’s appearance, Aaron Walker, president and COO of Appalachian Power; Todd Johnston, deputy chief of staff for Gov. Morrisey and director of the state’s Energy, Infrastructure and Competitiveness Council; and Frank Macchiarola, chief advocacy officer for American Clean Power, gave a panel discussion on an “All of The Above Energy Approach.”

Macchiarola began the discussion by explaining that West Virginia is the nation’s second largest coal producer and the fifth largest natural gas producer.

When it comes to renewable energy sources, Macchiarola said that the state is growing – with seven percent of its energy coming from clean energy. However, this is an area the state could expand on.

“That is an opportunity for West Virginia, because it is a net exporter of energy,” Macchiarola said, adding that with the growth of artificial intelligence, the need for extra data centers, and the increase in manufacturing occurring nationwide, extra energy from all sources is going to be needed.

“That confluence of events has created a picture where in the next 15 years we’re . . . our power demand is going to increase by nearly 50%,” Macchiarola stated.

Aaron Walker added that data centers are “proliferating across the United States,” and will require a huge amount of energy to operate, but West Virginia is setting its wheels in motion to meet those energy needs.

“First, I’d say a thanks, really, to the [state’s] legislature, to the Governor’s administration – they’ve really positioned the state well in terms of inviting businesses to invest here and grow,” Walker said. “The West Virginia Public Service Commission [is] really proactive and forward thinking around how do we contract and bring those data centers online, but most importantly, how do we do it in a way that doesn’t transfer costs to all other existing consumers.”

As for Appalachian Power’s energy reliability, Walker said that data centers will create additional investment, and the greater the amount of energy sold means lower costs for West Virginia’s consumers.

“So, the data centers provide an opportunity to help us control costs [by providing] an opportunity for us to invest in the grid, to improve reliability for everyone. So, we’re just really excited about it.”

As for the “50 by 50” initiative, Walker explained that one megawatt of energy powers 900 homes.

“So, you’re talking about 50,000 megawatts of capacity and that’s just here. We’re seeing that demand across the entire nation,” Walker said. “The AEP CEO often talks about – it took us 100 years at AEP to build the capacity that we have currently –we’re talking about doubling that in six years, five years, right? So this is tremendous, tremendous growth.”

He said it’s important to consider permitting reform, environmental review, site challenges and more from a policy perspective to “make all this work.”

Lastly, Johnston said that energy is essential to Gov. Morrisey’s economic development strategy and the energy demand facing the nation is “unreal,” with an estimated 106 gigawatts of capacity in upcoming years to meet demand. But, West Virginia is working to fill half of that demand.

“It strikes me that [West Virginia] is an energy state, but it’s never had a comprehensive energy development policy,” Johnston said. “We’ve never had anything in place that looks specifically at the resources that we have in the ground and on the ground, and how we develop those, push those out, so they benefit the citizens of West Virginia and the country at large.”

Johnston added that West Virginia is one of the fastest states in turning permits around, but when issues arise in Washington that becomes a “problem.”

“Notwithstanding the permitting debate, I think we’re facing one of the best policy atmospheres for energy than we’ve seen in the past 16 or more years,” Johnston said, adding that a continuation of these policies is needed for regulatory certainty.

“[West Virginia] is 30th in electricity production, and that’s way behind where we should be given the amount of energy in BTUs that we’re sitting on. So, again, we’re looking at this as a major opportunity to increase our production rates and put the transmission lines and other infrastructure in place that’s necessary, but, really, for West Virginia to become the battery that fuels the growth of this nation,” Johnston said.",https://therealwv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WV-chamber-summit-012.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 10:01:58.810329

Over the past two decades, our region has been the principal driver of global energy demand and emissions.

Energy has powered prosperity, lifted millions out of poverty and transformed societies.

This progress, however, has come at a cost: widening inequalities, entrenched fossil fuel dependencies and increasing climate vulnerability – which make achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate objectives challenging.

The gaps we must close

What will it truly take for the region to realise the energy transition and achieve SDG 7 – clean, affordable, reliable and modern energy for all – by 2030? The new Regional Trends Report on Energy for Sustainable Development shows that universal access to electricity is within reach.

Yet other dimensions of sustainable energy require urgent acceleration.

Clean cooking remains the most pressing challenge. Nearly one billion people in Asia and the Pacific still rely on traditional fuels, exposing households – especially women and children – to dangerous levels of indoor air pollution.

Renewable energy is growing, although the pace still falls short of what is needed to meet rising demand and lower emissions at the scale required. Per capita, Asia and the Pacific’s installed renewable energy capacity remains lower than in other parts of the world.

At the same time, energy efficiency continues to be underutilized, leaving untapped potential to reduce consumption, lower energy costs and reduce carbon emissions.

These challenges are compounded by emerging pressures. Securing access to and sustainably developing critical raw materials is essential for advancing energy transitions, while expanded regional power grid connectivity is crucial to improving energy security and keeping electricity affordable.

Rapidly growing sectors, such as data centres, also need to shift toward low-carbon pathways. Meeting these priorities will demand strategic planning, coordinated action and a strong commitment to fairness and equity.

Emerging momentum

The Asia-Pacific region is showing encouraging signs in recent years with many emerging initiatives to draw inspiration from.

Subregional initiatives, including the ASEAN Power Grid and the Nepal-India-Bangladesh trilateral power trade, are fostering cross-border electricity exchanges, improving reliability and enabling greater renewable integration.

China and India are at the forefront of renewables, while Pacific countries such as Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have set targets for 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2030.

Indonesia and the Philippines are expanding geothermal capacity. Grid-scale battery storage in Australia is helping manage renewable fluctuations and strengthen system resilience.

Industries, urban centres and the transport sector are also driving change. Countries are rapidly expanding the adoption of electric vehicles through investment and infrastructure.

Japan and Singapore are improving building energy efficiency with strict standards and incentive programmes, and the Republic of Korea is deploying smart grid technologies to optimise usage. These examples illustrate that innovation, investment and cooperation are creating the conditions for scalable energy progress across the region.

A just transition for all

The energy transition is not only a technological shift, but also a social transformation. For many such as workers in fossil fuel industries, those in energy-poor households and youths entering the job market, the transition will be a lived reality.

Reskilling, education and social protection must accompany this shift, while creating decent jobs in the renewable and energy efficiency sectors.

Women are disproportionately affected by energy poverty and remain underrepresented in the energy workforce and decision-making roles. Unlocking women’s full participation in the sector is needed to accelerate innovation and inclusive growth.

A just energy transition must be gender-responsive, with policies and investments designed to close gaps in access, employment and leadership.

Turning ambition into action

Three ingredients stand out:

Ambition in policy and planning. Countries need bold, integrated policies that align national energy plans with climate commitments, including net-zero targets. This means setting higher renewable energy ambitions, phasing down coal dependency, embedding energy efficiency into every sector, and ensuring policies are just and inclusive.

Scaled-up investment. Delivering SDG 7 requires mobilising trillions in sustainable energy investment. Governments alone cannot bear this burden. De-risking mechanisms, innovative financing and public-private partnerships will be critical to unlock capital flows.

Regional cooperation. Regional grid integration and cross-border power trade, and shared approaches to the development of critical energy transition minerals and technology standards can create efficiencies and resilience.

The region has shown that transformative change is possible. Just twenty years ago, hundreds of millions lacked access to electricity.

Today, universal access is within reach, proving that the seemingly insurmountable gaps in clean cooking, renewable deployment and efficiency can be overcome with decisive political will and bold action.

As Asia-Pacific countries gather in September at the ESCAP Committee on Energy, the message is clear: we must act with urgency, ambition and solidarity, or risk being locked in high-carbon pathways.

The decisions made in the coming years will define the region’s energy future well beyond 2030.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/08/AP25238683773408.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 12:10:51.904691

While Europe’s automakers are lobbying for the 2035 proposals to be watered down in favour of net zero by 2050, Hyundai is all in for EVs, and its European EV rollout is slated to deliver wave after wave of zero-emission battery-electric vehicles.

“We have an avalanche of electric cars coming, and if we suddenly have to stop launching EVs, it would cost us a fortune,” Kia Europe CEO Marc Hedrich said at the start of production of the EV4 in its Slovakian plant.

""We have a plan to achieve 100% compliance in 2035,” he said.

Other automakers aren’t so sure, with Mercedes-Benz pulling back from its assurances on 2035 to now push a 2050 Net Zero commitment, while Volkswagen, Stellantis and the Renault Group are also skeptical.

The two viewpoints will go head-to-head on September 12, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acting as referee and judge.

On the one side will be companies like Hyundai that have invested in European manufacturing facilities for EVs, plus others with strong EV commitments like Volvo, Jaguar and Renault, along with Asian importers who have spent millions on sales and distribution chains.

On the other side are manufacturers who are already suffering from softer-than-expected European and US EV demand, plus Chinese competition that is targeting them not only on price, but quality and luxury, too.

Kia’s Hedrich clapped back at Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kallenius and his criticisms of the 2035 rollout by pointing out his former enthusiasm for it.

“That is the same guy who a few years ago promised his company would only sell EVs in Europe by 2030.”

The European automotive industry association, ACEA, has sent a letter, in conjunction with Europe’s automotive supplier association CLEPA, to the European Commission insisting the 2035 mandate be rolled back, or risk catastrophic consequences for the European automotive industry.

Kallenius, who also chairs the ACEA, wrote that the EU automakers were almost totally dependent on Asian firms like China’s CATL and South Korea’s SK, LG and BYD, and were hamstrung domestically by “uneven” charging networks and higher manufacturing costs.

Every top 10 EV battery supplier in the world in 2023 was Asian, split between China, Japan and South Korea, with even the Mercedes-AMG Formula 1 team getting its hybrid batteries from A123 Systems in Hangzhou, China.

Large-scale EV battery manufacturing in Europe took a huge hit when Sweden’s Northvolt collapsed into bankruptcy this year.

This combination of circumstances forced a rethink on the 2035 targets, according to the ACEA, and they argue it is no longer economically feasible for automakers to hit the two-stage emissions reductions legislation (a 55% reduction from 2021 levels by 2030 and a 100% reduction by 2035).

“Meeting the rigid car and van CO2 targets for 2030 and 2035 is, in today’s world, simply no longer feasible,” the ACEA and the CLEPA wrote.

“EVs will lead the charge, but there must also be space for [plug-in] hybrids, range extenders, highly efficient internal-combustion engine vehicles, hydrogen and decarbonized fuels,” the letter said.

But Hyundai disagrees, according to Hedrich, and is already rolling out plans to meet the two-tier targets.

It used to be that getting a perfect ear of corn just required the weather to cooperate. Now, climate change is making that far more uncertain.

Farmers in some parts of the country are seeing droughts, heavy rains and hot nights interfere with corn pollination.

Corn needs a delicate balance to grow. Hot, fast growth can trap the tassel inside the leaf, reducing pollen release. This results in a crop that isn't nearly as healthy. Too much rain brings another batch of problems, as fungi like corn smut can damage ears.

Thanks to lucky late-season weather, the U.S. may see a record corn yield this year.

But the weather is increasingly unpredictable. Farmers now use mechanical pollination tools more often to save their crops.

Climate experts warn that rising humidity and warming trends will make pollination harder in the future.

While Michigan was obligated $156 million for its own solar for all program, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated the federal Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which included Solar For All funding. Zeldin later announced the end of the program in a social media post, saying the agency no longer had the statutory authority to administer the program, nor the funds to keep it alive.

In the letter to Zeldin, Scholten, alongside Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City), Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) noted the program’s intent in lowering energy costs for families burdened by energy costs and its support for jobs in renewable energy.

“The Solar for All program is nowhere more important than in Michigan, where average residential electricity rates are among the highest in the Midwest and the nation.…With this federal investment, Michigan sought to reduce costs for an estimated 16,300 low-income households, providing an average benefit equivalent to a 20% reduction on residential electric bills, or around $400 per family per year,” the representatives wrote.

Without this funding, Michiganders could be saddled with increased energy costs and stifled economic development, they warned.

“The urgency and need for savings from Solar for All projects are clear. We stand ready to work with the EPA and the Trump Administration to reverse these terminations and ensure that Michiganders can benefit from lower utility costs, continued economic development, and heightened energy resilience,” the representatives wrote.

The future of energy storage lies not in scaling the same old models but in reimagining resilience as a core asset.","The recent delays in recommissioning Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)'s Elkhorn Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) at Moss Landing have exposed a critical vulnerability in California's energy infrastructure. Originally slated to restart in June 2025, the project was indefinitely postponed after a clamp failure and coolant leak were discovered in one of 256 Tesla Megapacks during testing. This delay, compounded by the facility's automatic shutdown in January 2025 following a nearby battery fire, underscores a systemic risk: the fragility of grid reliability in an era of rapid decarbonization.

The Systemic Risks of Over-Reliance on Lithium-Ion

PG&E's Elkhorn BESS, a 182.5MW/730MWh facility, is emblematic of the broader energy storage sector's reliance on lithium-ion technology. While lithium-ion has been a cornerstone of renewable integration, its susceptibility to thermal runaway and fire risks—exacerbated by aging infrastructure and extreme weather—poses a growing threat. The January 2025 Vistra Energy fire, which triggered PG&E's precautionary shutdown, is part of a troubling trend: California has seen multiple battery storage facility fires since 2021, prompting stricter regulatory scrutiny and public concern.

The delays highlight a paradox: as utilities and regulators push for decarbonization, they are increasingly dependent on technologies that lack the resilience needed to withstand the very climate-driven stresses they aim to mitigate. PG&E's conservative approach to recommissioning—prioritizing safety over speed—reflects a broader industry reckoning. However, this caution comes at a cost: delayed projects strain grid capacity during peak demand, undermine decarbonization timelines, and erode investor confidence in the scalability of current storage solutions.

The Case for Next-Gen Fire-Resistant Storage

The Elkhorn delays are a catalyst for rethinking energy storage strategies. Emerging technologies are now addressing the limitations of lithium-ion with fire-resistant designs and decentralized redundancy. Key innovations include:

Sodium-Ion and Iron-Air Batteries: Sodium-ion batteries, with material costs 300x lower than lithium, offer a safer, cheaper alternative. Startups like Peak Energy are pioneering sodium-ion systems optimized for grid-scale applications, while iron-air batteries eliminate reliance on rare-earth metals.

Membraneless Redox Flow: HalioGen Power's membraneless redox flow batteries eliminate flammable components and reduce maintenance costs, making them ideal for industrial and utility-scale use.

Gravity and Flywheel Storage: Green Gravity's gravity-based systems and Levistor's flywheel designs store energy mechanically, avoiding chemical hazards altogether. These technologies are inherently fire-resistant and require minimal operational intervention.

Hydrogen and Thermal Storage: eRevo's solid-state hydrogen storage and TheStorage's sand-based thermal systems provide long-duration, non-flammable alternatives for grid stability.

These technologies are not just safer—they are increasingly cost-competitive. Sodium-ion batteries, for instance, are projected to reduce upfront costs by 30% compared to lithium-ion, while hybrid systems like florrent's supercapacitors extend battery lifespans by 40%.

Regional Redundancy: The New Infrastructure Imperative

California's experience underscores the need for regional redundancy—a strategy that diversifies energy storage across geographies and technologies to mitigate localized failures. Distributed BESS systems, microgrids, and community-scale storage are gaining traction in fire-prone areas like Los Angeles, Sonoma, and San Diego. For example, schools and hospitals in these regions are deploying fire-resistant BESS to maintain critical operations during outages, reducing reliance on diesel generators.

The California Public Utilities Commission's (CPUC) updated General Order 167-C, which mandates fire safety protocols and emergency response plans for BESS, is accelerating this shift. The Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) further incentivizes non-residential projects in high-fire-threat districts, offering rebates of up to $1 million per megawatt.

Investment Strategy: Future-Proofing Energy Portfolios

For investors, the message is clear: capital must flow toward next-gen storage technologies and regional redundancy frameworks to future-proof energy portfolios. Here's how to position for the transition:

Allocate to Fire-Resistant Tech Pioneers: Companies like Peak Energy (sodium-ion), HalioGen Power (redox flow), and Green Gravity (gravity storage) are leading the charge. These firms are not only addressing safety gaps but also leveraging AI-driven battery management systems to optimize performance.

Support Regional Redundancy Projects: Invest in utilities and developers deploying distributed BESS in high-risk areas. PG&E's 1.8GWh offtake agreement with Aypa Power for the Dirac BESS project, despite permitting delays, signals long-term demand for resilient infrastructure.

Monitor Policy and Regulatory Shifts: The Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits and California's procurement reforms will shape the market. Track CPUC decisions and CAISO's 2028-2032 procurement framework to identify early movers.

Conclusion: Resilience as a Competitive Advantage

PG&E's Elkhorn delays are a wake-up call, but they also present an opportunity. The energy transition cannot succeed on outdated infrastructure. By prioritizing fire-resistant technologies and regional redundancy, investors can hedge against systemic risks while aligning with decarbonization goals. The future of energy storage lies not in scaling the same old models but in reimagining resilience as a core asset.

This get-together sheds light on where U.S. auto production stands and what investments major carmakers are eyeing down the road. The chat also dives into the debate over tariffs and how they’re shaping the domestic economy (a topic that’s got everyone—from lawmakers to everyday drivers—paying attention).

Trump’s take on automotive growth

During the meeting, Trump gave a thumbs-up to his economic strategies, saying tariffs on imported vehicles and parts are really pushing U.S. auto production, with an increase of 18,000 units each month. He explained, “The tariffs applied to imported vehicles and parts boost U.S. auto production and create new jobs.” He also pointed out that there’s plenty of room for growth: “And we haven’t even started yet, as many factories are not yet built.”

His remarks highlight his push to reinvigorate American manufacturing through trade policies that favor homegrown production over imports.

Big automakers stepping in

Trump mentioned several major players in the automotive world whose plans mirror his call for more domestic production:

Ford’s challenges is planning to add 4,000 jobs, showing its commitment to expanding operations in the U.S.

Hyundai rolled out an ambitious plan to invest $21 billion by 2028, a move that could create up to 14,000 jobs across various states.

Stellantis’s electric van market is pumping significant investments into its U.S. plants. Notably, it plans to reopen its Belvidere site in Illinois for new pickup truck production, and it has projects underway in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana aimed at shifting toward electric vehicle manufacturing.

General Motors also joined the conversation with strategies that support boosting domestic production.

These announcements point to a strong effort by automakers to boost their U.S. footprint, potentially generating thousands of jobs and giving a nice lift to local communities.

Doubts and industry checks

Despite the upbeat figures Trump shared, some experts aren’t completely convinced. Sam Fiorani, an analyst from AutoForecast Solutions, questioned the 18,000-unit monthly jump. According to him, between February and July, the actual increase was only about 1,000 vehicles. He suggested that this modest rise could be more about companies working around tariffs rather than a sign of all-out industrial growth.

Fiorani’s take adds a dose of skepticism and invites a deeper look at whether these tariff measures will keep pushing U.S. manufacturing forward in the long run.

What’s next

The conversations at the White House mark an important moment for the U.S. auto scene as it navigates through mixed economic strategies and pressures from global markets. With Ford, Hyundai, Stellantis, and General Motors laying out their investment plans, the outlook for domestic job creation and tech advancements in the automotive industry looks pretty promising.

As everyone—from consumers to policymakers—keeps tabs on these moves, the ongoing debate about tariffs and how they really influence production is something to watch closely as new developments unfold.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trump20economic20policy-automotive20industry-tariffs20impact.webp,N,,2025-08-29 13:17:04.878930

The nationwide average retail residential price for electricity is about 7% higher than this time last year and 32% higher than it was five years ago, according to Energy Department data.

Zoom in: These surging prices are driven by infrastructure problems, public policy and — increasingly — massive new AI data centers.

1. Outdated power grid. Experts say the pressure being put on the electricity grid to handle more transmission is a big reason.

Limited transmission capacity increases prices by creating ""congestion,"" with overloaded power lines unable to carry more electricity because of overheating risks. That leads to using higher-cost, less-efficient electricity to meet demand.

""It's like a two-way highway that was built decades ago that's now expected to carry rush-hour traffic to and from a major city every time — every day of the year [there are] more cars, bigger trucks, constant congestion,"" Sen. Mike Lee, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said at a July hearing.

""And if the road hasn't changed, but everything around it has changed, that's going to be an issue.""

2. Data-center demand. Many analysts point to power-hungry AI data centers as a driver of rising rates, especially in data center hot spots.

That's partly because of data centers' huge demand for energy. But it's because investments in new transmission lines and other gear are being passed on to customers.

Data centers consumed about 4% of the nation's total electricity in 2023. The Energy Department estimates it could increase to 12% by 2028.

But there are other demand drivers: Hotter summers, new manufacturing; EVs, and the wider electrification and digitization of the economy.

3. Generation capacity. That's the maximum amount of electricity that can be produced when going full-bore — and it's scarce. That has raised prices for equipment needed to meet the demand.

The country's largest grid operator announced price increases to try to encourage more power plant development. That will translate to a year-over-year increase of 1.5% to 5% in some customers' bills, it said.

4. Red tape. Energy projects regularly face bureaucratic delays and denials. Many in Congress and the Trump administration seek to overhaul permitting to speed up projects, though they disagree about how much priority fossil-fuel projects should get.

Natural gas plants and other sources ""are trying to connect and they are experiencing the same slow and complicated interconnection process that results from limited capacity,"" Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies LLC, told the Senate panel.

""Soon we may see nuclear, advanced geothermal, hydro, thermal, and other resources connect and the constraints will affect them as well.""

5. Mother Nature. Hurricanes, wildfires, high winds and other weather-related threats have spurred a need for investing in stronger — but costly — towers, poles and other equipment.

Between the lines: All of this is happening while Trump is tamping down on renewable energy, a major potential sources of electricity.

U.S. investment in renewables plunged by about 36% in the first half of 2025 — roughly $20.5 billion — as uncertainty over federal support chills the market.

The administration has halted or moved to block major offshore wind projects, decisions that could sideline enough electricity to power hundreds of thousands of homes.

Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" scrapped or significantly reduced incentives for electric vehicles, solar, and other renewables — locking in a ""drill, baby, drill"" preference for fossil fuels.

Zoom out: The price-raising perfect storm hasn't just been happening here.

In Europe, a confluence of soaring natural gas prices triggered by Russian supply issues, high coal prices, low wind speeds and scorching weather also led to skyrocketing rates in several countries.

State of play: Democrats' campaign arms and allied groups are placing digital and TV ads, billboards and more that hit Republicans over utility bills.

It's part of a wider message on consumer costs, flipping the script on the inflation that damaged Democrats and President Biden.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently acknowledged the GOP will get blamed — unfairly, he says — at the polls for rising prices. Democrats respond that Trump moves — such as halting an offshore wind project that's 80% complete — will hike rates.

My “Business As Usual, Electrified” (BAU Electrified) projection through 2040 includes two somewhat optimistic assumptions.
Modest changes to a “Business As Usual, Electrified” scenario would bring down car-fleet emissions by 71 percent by 2040.
I calculated that a Canada-wide EV fleet matching the BAU Electrified scenario would require 68 TeraWatts (TW) per year.
Business As Usual Is Killing Us There are many reasons besides carbon emissions to conclude that a “Business As Usual, Electrified” strategy is a bad route.","Auto industry voices in Canada have made headlines recently by urging a longer timeline for the transition to electric cars. We should hope that Prime Minister Mark Carney does not give in to this demand.

Yet even if Canada’s federal government sticks to the current policy, and Canadian new car sales are 100 percent zero-emission by 2035, carbon emissions will decline much more slowly than the world needs. That is due to the auto industry’s particularly pernicious strategy for continued growth.

The industry can’t keep boosting unit sales in a country where almost everyone who can drive, does drive. But they can boost revenue by selling bigger, heavier, more expensive vehicles when consumers need to swap their old vehicles for new ones.

With that strategy, Canada’s auto industry has done its part in maintaining the growth of gross domestic product (GDP). But the GDP isn’t all that’s growing. Pedestrian deaths and injuries are growing, tire particulate emissions are growing, traffic congestion is growing, and consumer debt (due to auto loans) is growing.

CO2 emissions from cars are holding steady and should start trending down over the next five years. However, a “Business As Usual, Electrified” transition will reduce emissions far too slowly to meet the climate-crisis challenge.

Car Bloat in Canada

Statistics Canada figures show that unit sales of passenger vehicles grew just over 20 percent between 2010 and 2024, while population grew 21 percent. Auto sales revenue, however, grew by over 100 percent.

Price tags have soared because the mix of new cars has changed drastically. Most new passenger vehicles are categorized as “light trucks”—SUVs and many models of pick-up trucks. But “light trucks” is a euphemism we should translate as “huge cars.” Most of them are used almost entirely to haul around one or two persons, just like small cars do.

In 2010, the huge-car segment was 54 percent of the Canadian market. By 2024, huge cars made up 87 percent of new passenger vehicles. This trend of “autobesity” or “car bloat” has significant implications for Canada’s strategy to reduce carbon emissions by electrifying vehicles.

First, if the auto industry maintains Business As Usual, the vast majority of internal combustion cars sold between now and 2035 will be huge. They will have correspondingly high tailpipe emissions well after 2035. These emissions are often termed “tank-to-wheel” emissions.

A second emissions category is termed “well-to-tank” emissions. Gasoline or diesel fuel goes from oil wells or mines through an extraction-refining-distribution chain. This adds significant emissions for every liter of fuel burned.

An analogous category—“well-to-grid” let’s call it—exists for electric vehicles (EVs) when electricity is produced by coal- or gas-fired generators. Canada’s grid is powered predominantly by hydro or nuclear power, though, so well-to-grid is not a major category of EV-fleet emissions. (That could change if Canada adopts the “all the above” approach to energy taken by the United States, for example.)

There are also substantial carbon emissions in the manufacture of cars. These emissions are higher for larger cars, and ironically, higher for electric cars than for gas- or diesel-powered cars. If most new cars continue rolling off the assembly lines huge, carbon emissions from auto manufacturing will go up between now and 2035. That will remain true until the carbon-intensive industrial processes in the manufacturing chain are also electrified.

Finally, if Canadians continue to buy as many cars as they do now and drive them as far each year, the fleet of huge cars will continue to take up more roadway surface. Road construction is itself a significant source of carbon emissions.

Beyond the Tailpipe

What will it really take for Canada’s auto industry to reach zero emissions by 2035? To answer this question, I projected six scenarios using a carbon-emissions calculator developed by the International Energy Agency. I estimated tank-to-wheel, well-to-tank, and auto manufacturing emissions in each of the six scenarios.

I incorporated road construction into my projections, using a Statistics Canada emissions-intensity per dollar estimate, multiplied by total road-construction expenditures for 2024. Passenger cars account for 91 percent of total vehicle kilometers driven, while heavy trucks and buses account for 9 percent. However, trucks and buses individually take more road space than cars. Therefore, I assigned 70 percent of road-construction emissions to the car fleet. (I did not find adequate data to estimate carbon emissions from road maintenance, which would make the analysis closer to complete.)

I estimated passenger-car fleet direct tailpipe emissions at about 72 megatonnes (Mt) of CO2 in 2024. This is slightly less than Environment Canada’s estimate of 74 Mt in pre-pandemic 2019. However, when I added the car fleet’s share of emissions from the extraction-refining-distribution chain, from auto manufacturing, and from road construction, car-sector emissions came to over 115 Mt. That’s a 60 percent increase over the tailpipe emissions alone.

If Canada’s goal of 100 percent EV sales by 2035 is met, total car-fleet emissions will still drop only 41 percent by 2040.

How will this change over the next 15 years? My “Business As Usual, Electrified” (BAU Electrified) projection through 2040 includes two somewhat optimistic assumptions. First, that electrification proceeds on schedule—20 percent of new cars being EV by 2026, 60 percent by 2030, and 100 percent by 2035. Second, that car bloat gets no worse (but also no better) through the coming years. The car/light-truck mix of new vehicles, and the vehicle sizes within these categories, remain exactly as in 2024. Importantly, however, this would mean that the average size of vehicles on the road would continue to increase. This is because the smaller sedans bought ten years ago would be replaced by large SUVs and pickup trucks.

Based on these assumptions, I projected that Canada’s car-fleet emissions would be 41 percent lower in 2040 than in 2024 in Scenario 1 (BAU Electrified).

A 41 percent drop may sound impressive. But climate experts have warned for years that we must reduce global warming emissions by at least 43 percent by 2030. So, a 41 percent drop by 2040 is dangerously inadequate.

Departures from Business As Usual

Making even modest changes to passenger-transportation rules could reduce these emissions significantly faster. I projected five additional scenarios, the best of which shows total car-fleet emissions dropping by 71 percent by 2040.

Modest changes to a “Business As Usual, Electrified” scenario would bring down car-fleet emissions by 71 percent by 2040.

Scenario 2 is only slightly different from BAU Electrified. It assumes a 98 percent zero-emission electric grid compared to Canada’s current national average of approximately 84 percent zero-emission.

In Scenario 3, the sedan/light-truck mix is dialed back to 2010 levels between 2026 and 2030. In Scenario 4, the sedan/light-truck mix is dialed back to 1979 levels between 2026 and 2030.

Scenario 5 builds on Scenario 4, except that vehicles within the sedan and light-truck categories drop modestly in size. In addition, I projected new-vehicle sales and average kilometers driven as dropping by 3.5 percent per year starting in 2030.

Finally, in Scenario 6 the annual vehicle-kilometer figure begins dropping by 3.5 percent per year in 2026. In Scenario 6, not only have CO2 emissions dropped by 71 percent by 2040, but the drop begins much sooner. The result is that cumulative emissions over the whole period are much lower.

Rising Demand for Electricity

More electricity means more infrastructure, such as the controversial, $16-billion Site C Clean Energy Project. (CC BY-NC 2.0, Province of British Columbia)

Car bloat is likely to pose one more serious challenge in the effort to shrink overall CO2 emissions. A fleet of huge electric cars will add greatly to demand for electricity, at a time when we are also working to electrify other important sectors, such as home heating. We won’t have enough renewably generated electricity to meet all these demands for many years. Therefore, a rational policy would conduce moderate levels of new electricity demand.

I calculated that a Canada-wide EV fleet matching the BAU Electrified scenario would require 68 TeraWatts (TW) per year. A fleet of mostly small EVs driving about 60 percent as many kilometers a year (close to Scenario 6) would require only 32 TW per year. Either way, this is an almost entirely new source of demand, as we scramble to convert other carbon-intensive sectors simultaneously. But it would be much less challenging to build out a grid capable of providing 32 TW rather than 68 TW. A smaller grid build-out will likewise require less environmentally destructive mining for critical metals.

Business As Usual Is Killing Us

There are many reasons besides carbon emissions to conclude that a “Business As Usual, Electrified” strategy is a bad route. The huge passenger vehicles now dominating the roads compound the danger to pedestrians, cyclists, and anyone driving a smaller car.

Huge passenger EVs need huge batteries—and thus demand a rapid, reckless increase in critical-mineral extraction.

Huge EVs, since they are heavier than corresponding internal-combustion vehicles, create more dangerous particulate emissions from tire wear.

A fleet of huge cars takes up more road space, increasing traffic congestion.

And, huge cars chew up the roads faster, entailing more road construction and repair.

So, we should support the Canadian government’s plan for new-vehicle electrification by 2035. However, we should also demand that new vehicles be smaller, that the number of cars on the road gradually drops, and that vehicles drive fewer kilometers annually. There is a wide range of policies designed to achieve these goals. CASSE’s Sustainable Transportation Act, for example, includes provisions to get passenger vehicles and freight trucks off the road. It also discourages the purchase and use of the largest passenger cars and trucks.

The sooner such policies are implemented, the better—for drivers, non-drivers, our cities, our roads, our waters, our atmosphere, our future.

Electrification is an important and necessary step for a sustainable, healthy future, but growth-driven Business As Usual—even Electrified—is killing us.

A recent LEED Gold certification makes NOENMCC the largest LEED-certified project in Louisiana and the largest convention center project in the U.S. certified under LEED v4.1 Operations and Maintenance, as well as the first convention center in the world to be awarded initial certification under LEED Gold v4.1 O+M.","NEW ORLEANS (press release) – In recognition of its sustainability achievements, the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center (NOENMCC) has earned its second Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification, making it one of only two convention centers in the country to be certified Gold twice in a row.

LEED is a globally recognized building rating system from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) that provides a framework for healthy, highly efficient, green buildings based on standards for energy efficiency, water conservation, indoor air quality and waste reduction.

After earning its first LEED certification in 2022, a big milestone for its sustainability program, the NOENMCC continued to innovate, optimize and increase its efforts to reduce the facility’s environmental footprint. The Convention Center expanded its recycling programs — diverting 378.4 tons of waste from landfills in 2024 — and reduced energy use by 11% and water use by 16% since 2019 following major equipment and lighting upgrades and other improvements.

“Being recertified as a LEED Gold facility is confirmation that all the energy-saving investments, building upgrades and green initiatives we’ve implemented are making a difference,” said Adam J. Straight, Convention Center Chief Operating Officer. “I am grateful to everyone on our team for the collective effort that’s helping us meet our sustainability goals. Because this is not about getting another green feather in our cap; it’s about working to be a good steward of the environment and making our facility better for our guests, employees and neighbors.”

As the largest LEED certified facility in Louisiana, the Convention Center is being recognized as a leader in sustainability across the region. In April 2025, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality presented the NOENMCC with an Environmental Leadership Program Award.

“The New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center’s efforts to operate more efficiently are not just impressive — they’re helping us compete,” said Walt Leger, President and CEO of New Orleans & Company. “Sustainability has become a key factor for today’s meeting planners, and our sales team is proud to showcase the Convention Center as a modern, energy-efficient facility that lives up to our promise: New Orleans is Built to Host.”

What Convention Center visitors enjoying interior improvements — including upgraded restrooms and 87 water bottle filling stations — might not notice is the massive exterior upgrade right over their heads. In 2024, the NOENMCC completed the installation of a new 40-acre “cool roof” with a special foam insulation and coating that creates a reflective sheen to divert heat away from the building, which reduces the urban heat island effect in the neighborhood and yields a small energy savings for the building. Rock ballast from the previous roof was repurposed for use in parking lots, one example of the Convention Center’s efforts to prevent construction waste from being sent to landfills.

During a 2023 interior renovation project, old carpet and ceiling tiles were sent to special facilities, where they were used to make new products, surpassing the NOENMCC’s goal of 50% waste diversion by diverting 84% of the waste produced during the project’s first stage.

Improving waste diversion for events was also instrumental in the LEED recertification. In addition to completing a major waste audit during a 2024 convention, the NOENMCC upgraded its ‘Know Where to Throw’ color-coded dock system to simplify the process of recycling cardboard, Visqueen, scrap metal and wood after events. Convention Center teams also collected nearly three tons of Mardi Gras beads, throws, plastic bottles and aluminum cans to be recycled after the 2024 Carnival season events at the facility.

“LEED certification is the industry standard for showing that our work is effective,” said the Convention Center’s Director of Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility Linda Baynham who spearheaded the recertification process. “Clients appreciate holding events in a facility that’s doing its part to reduce impacts. As a leader in the event industry, we want to show what’s possible when you make sustainability a priority.”

The Convention Center contracted New Orleans-based Green Coast Enterprises to set up a utility tracking program to monitor its energy and water use. Awarded based in part on a year’s worth of data tracking energy, water and waste, the facility’s 2025 recertification is confirmation that the NOENMCC has stayed on track with those metrics since its initial LEED Gold certification in 2022.

The NOENMCC is the largest convention center project in the U.S. certified under LEED v4.1 Operations and Maintenance and the first convention center in the world to be awarded initial certification under LEED v4.1 O+M.

The law is just one of many ways the federal government has weakened climate initiatives. Here are 10 of the most significant rollbacks.

1. Repealing the EPA’s endangerment finding

In its potentially most far-reaching move, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rescinding its 2009 Endangerment Finding. This finding determined that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, and it’s the legal basis for regulating emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sources. Without it, existing limits on greenhouse gas pollution will be eliminated, and future administrations will be prevented from reimplementing those limits.

2. Eliminating consumer clean energy tax credits

The OBBBA terminated a bunch of consumer tax credits created as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Electric vehicle tax credits for new ($7,500) and used ($4,000) clean vehicles were eliminated for any vehicle acquired after Sept. 30, 2025. Home energy upgrade credits were terminated for any property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025. This includes the 30% credit for rooftop solar and batteries and the $3,200 credit for efficiency improvements like windows and heat pumps. The credit for installing EV home charging equipment will end in June 2026.

3. Defunding major climate grant and loan programs

The OBBBA rescinded unobligated funds from dozens of Inflation Reduction Act programs, effectively ending them. The EPA’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, essentially a national green bank, was defunded and cannot be revived without new legislation. The Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office stopped making clean energy loans. A number of programs focused on low-carbon transportation, resilient retrofits, and coastal resilience at the Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were eliminated.

4. Accelerating the phaseout of wind and solar

tax credits

Under the OBBBA, wind and solar projects are no longer eligible for credits if they go live after Dec. 31, 2027. This compressed timeline is a huge challenge for developers, who often must wait years for permits to connect to the grid. In fact, this new deadline may make many existing projects unviable and will probably deter new ones from starting.

5. Repealing power plant greenhouse gas standards

The EPA proposed the repeal of carbon pollution standards for fossil-fuel-fired power plants. The agency’s argument was simple and flawed. They said that these new and existing plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.”

6. Tightening the rules for wind and solar tax credit eligibility

Following the passage of the OBBBA, the Treasury Department issued new rules that make it more difficult for wind and solar developers to qualify for the remaining tax credits in place until the end of 2027. Now, larger projects must demonstrate “physical work of a significant nature” to qualify, whatever that means.

7. Mandating increased fossil fuel leasing and logging

The OBBBA requires a significant increase in fossil fuel extraction and logging on public lands. The law mandates quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales in nine western states for the next 10 years; 36 offshore oil and gas sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska over the next 15 years; nine lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge over the next 10 years; and rapidly increasing timber sales by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.

8. Terminating the American Climate Corps

The administration, through an executive order, terminated the American Climate Corps. The program provided jobs in the climate sector to recent high school graduates.

9. Eliminating penalties for fuel economy noncompliance

The OBBBA got rid of the fines that car companies pay when they fail to meet the government’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. These standards require an automaker’s entire fleet of new vehicles to meet a minimum average miles-per-gallon. Without them, the program loses its primary enforcement tool, effectively halting progress on making new cars more fuel efficient.

10. Revoking an environmental quality executive order

An executive order revoked an order issued by President Jimmy Carter that had directed federal agencies to avoid supporting construction in wetlands wherever there is a practicable alternative.

These rollbacks, itemized above, speak for themselves. They represent a significant reversal of American climate policy, the full consequences of which are yet to be understood.",,N,,2025-08-29 10:01:20.054069

Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski told attendees at the annual Indiana Water Summit on Thursday that a pending statewide water plan must be “transparent, data-driven and developed collaboratively” in line with Gov. Mike Braun’s recent executive order.

“When I stepped into this role in January, the governor really painted a vision for his Freedom and Opportunity agenda, which includes delivering a more responsive, efficient state government, and a government that improves the quality and quantity of life for Hoosiers,” Jaworowski said. “That includes affordable and clean energy and water.”

She cited an executive order signed by Braun in April, which directs state agencies to create a statewide water inventory and management plan by the end of 2026. The planning framework is supposed to align utilities, industries, municipalities and other water users.

The executive order also mandates creation of a real-time, publicly accessible online data platform for water usage, infrastructure status and future demand projections.

“In essence, it means we’re coming together to collaboratively create an inventory of our current water usage, the future of water domains, and to better understand the availability of groundwater and surface water in all regions of Indiana,” Jaworowski continued.

Focusing on Indiana’s water resources

Braun’s order came amid growing concerns about Indiana’s water vulnerabilities.

A report released last week by the Alliance for the Great Lakes, for example, warned that Indiana’s water supply could soon face strain due to compounding demands from residents, agriculture, manufacturing, water-intensive data centers and climate change.

Environmental agencies, advocates respond to Braun executive orders

Indiana additionally grapples with nutrient and sediment pollution; wetlands losses; and waterway contamination.

The Hoosier State has historically lacked a comprehensive statewide water policy, unlike neighboring states, including Ohio, Michigan and Illinois — all of which have long-standing frameworks to guide water quality and usage management.

Jaworowski emphasized that water planning in Indiana should not come from “top-down mandates,” but instead be “a conversation that’s regionally driven.”

She said, too, that population growth is adding new pressure on resources, noting that Indiana gained more than 44,000 new residents in 2024 — marking the state’s fastest increase since 2008.

Involving ‘all stakeholders’

On flooding and wetlands, Jaworowski further acknowledged concerns about changing projections, though she emphasized that “the governor is extremely dedicated to preserving our wetlands and preserving our conservation areas.”

When asked for any standout solutions that have so far offered by stakeholders, Jaworowski specifically praised ongoing work with the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership but said that, “being able to look at what other states have done with policy … and regional water planning … has been most impressive to me.”

The secretary also made clear that local watershed commissions won’t be left out of the statewide planning process and are instead “key stakeholders in this discussion.”

“Our door’s open to all,” Jaworowski told the summit audience. “‘Stakeholder’ is not a hollow term. I recognize how important grassroots is in water planning.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/indiana_capital_chronicle_articles_227/dfeb8bcdd83606341cdcdc2343cf9197,N,,2025-08-29 07:59:29.596767

Mike Braun’s recent executive order.

“When I stepped into this role in January, the governor really painted a vision for his Freedom and Opportunity agenda, which includes delivering a more responsive, efficient state government, and a government that improves the quality and quantity of life for Hoosiers,” Jaworowski said. “That includes affordable and clean energy and water.”

She cited an executive order signed by Braun in April, which directs state agencies to create a statewide water inventory and management plan by the end of 2026. The planning framework is supposed to align utilities, industries, municipalities and other water users.

The executive order also mandates creation of a real-time, publicly accessible online data platform for water usage, infrastructure status and future demand projections.

“In essence, it means we’re coming together to collaboratively create an inventory of our current water usage, the future of water domains, and to better understand the availability of groundwater and surface water in all regions of Indiana,” Jaworowski continued.

Focusing on Indiana’s water resources

Braun’s order came amid growing concerns about Indiana’s water vulnerabilities.

A report released last week by the Alliance for the Great Lakes, for example, warned that Indiana’s water supply could soon face strain due to compounding demands from residents, agriculture, manufacturing, water-intensive data centers and climate change.

Environmental agencies, advocates respond to Braun executive orders

Indiana additionally grapples with nutrient and sediment pollution; wetlands losses; and waterway contamination.

The Hoosier State has historically lacked a comprehensive statewide water policy, unlike neighboring states, including Ohio, Michigan and Illinois — all of which have long-standing frameworks to guide water quality and usage management.

Jaworowski emphasized that water planning in Indiana should not come from “top-down mandates,” but instead be “a conversation that’s regionally driven.”

She said, too, that population growth is adding new pressure on resources, noting that Indiana gained more than 44,000 new residents in 2024 — marking the state’s fastest increase since 2008.

Involving ‘all stakeholders’

On flooding and wetlands, Jaworowski further acknowledged concerns about changing projections, though she emphasized that “the governor is extremely dedicated to preserving our wetlands and preserving our conservation areas.”

When asked for any standout solutions that have so far offered by stakeholders, Jaworowski specifically praised ongoing work with the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership but said that, “being able to look at what other states have done with policy … and regional water planning … has been most impressive to me.”

The secretary also made clear that local watershed commissions won’t be left out of the statewide planning process and are instead “key stakeholders in this discussion.”

“Our door’s open to all,” Jaworowski told the summit audience. “‘Stakeholder’ is not a hollow term. I recognize how important grassroots is in water planning.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47651/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/dsc_0551-1024x6831756463699.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=xjb1ppkh,N,,2025-08-29 07:59:18.377294

For India, this could be a critical moment to assert itself as a serious player in EV battery manufacturing.

In an interview with The Federal, Guru Punghavan, 24-year-old entrepreneur and founder of Boson, a high-energy density lithium-ion cell manufacturer, talks about supply chains, sustainability, and India’s future as an EV hub.

With Trump’s new tariffs on Chinese EVs and batteries, do you see global supply chains shifting—and could India benefit?

Yes. With the Make in India policy, local production gets a big boost. Just as Chinese manufacturers are scouting for new markets, we in India are positioning ourselves with high-quality products to capture demand. The focus now is to ensure supply with the best standards, which the Indian market expects.

Do you see Chinese manufacturers intensifying their competition in India and Asia? How will you respond?

There is already strong competition from Chinese manufacturers in Asian markets. But our edge lies in performance. Our batteries offer longer life cycles, better milliampere-hour (mAh) capacity, and sustainable solutions. These are factors that set us apart from Chinese products.

You’ve claimed Indian batteries outperform Chinese ones. Can you explain how?

Take NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) chemistry. Chinese NMC cells usually deliver only 350 to 400 cycles. Our NMC cells can provide over 1,000 life cycles. On top of that, we can deliver discharge current ratings of 11C to 15C, which Chinese cells don’t match.

Are these batteries multi-sector, usable beyond EVs?

Yes. NMC chemistry has multi-sector applications. Our batteries are suited for EVs, drones, and heavy power tools.

China wants to dominate rare earth supplies, especially from Africa. How do Trump’s trade policies affect your lithium sourcing?

At Boson, we are building independence from raw material dependence through recycling. By focusing on the circular economy, we ensure lithium and other critical minerals are recovered from end-of-life batteries. This helps us stay self-sufficient.

How do you ensure recycling doesn’t compromise quality?

Our recycling process guarantees purity levels of 99.9% for cathode active material (CAM). High-purity materials extracted from old batteries are fed back into production, maintaining both performance and quality.

Watch | VinFast vs Tesla: India's EV market turns into global battleground

Given Trump’s support for fossil fuels, could the global EV momentum slow down?

We don’t believe so. Trump’s policies change often and are time-limited. India is moving forward with its own EV policies, and that is where our focus is.

Do you see the US–China trade war as an opportunity for India to become an EV hub?

Yes. This is the right moment for India to establish itself. Indian products will soon set benchmarks in global markets. Beyond EVs, we’ve also shown success in defence—during Operation Sindoor, Indian drones performed exceptionally well. That should be seen as proof of our capabilities.

You mentioned drones. How does the drone sector fit into your company’s plans?

The drone sector is growing rapidly and provides a huge opportunity. We have decided to focus on drones as our primary market for the coming year. While we are in talks with EV original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), our immediate priority is high-energy density, high-discharge batteries for drones.

So India is still dependent on imports for lithium batteries?

Yes. India has been importing heavily from China and other countries. But with these policy shifts and domestic innovation, I believe this dependence will change soon.

Boson is positioned as India’s first high energy density lithium-ion cell maker. What sets your products apart globally?

We are producing cells in the 4,000 mAh to 6,000 mAh range with high discharge current. Our 21700 cells, for example, offer 5,500 mAh with discharge above 15C—specifications few global manufacturers can match. These cells can serve both industrial and defence requirements.

Any final thoughts on Trump’s policies and India’s future?

My takeaway is that India is becoming self-reliant. Over the next five to ten years, the country will emerge as a global power. Boson will be proud to serve India’s energy needs in that journey.",https://thefederal.com/h-upload/2025/08/28/558322-ev-cms.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 12:06:39.434775

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax.
Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340.
In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections.
Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.binghamtonhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2025/08/68b147dba13270.82708626.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 13:12:32.265635

From a practical perspective, one of the two “construction start” safe harbour rules will be removed, effective 2 September.
The rule remaining is the “continuous physical work” or “continuous construction” rule.
AH: We’ve been rushing to get projects to start construction since the initial draft of the One Big, Beautiful Bill.
I believe there will continue to be a rush for people to secure equipment and to start construction on site to the extent that they can.","This replaces an old provision, that a developer must spend 5% of a project’s total costs by a certain time, and industry figures have roundly criticised the move as one that will make it more challenging to secure tax credit support. The 5% threshold is still in place for projects under 1.5MW in capacity.

A report from market analyst Clean Energy Associates (CEA) forecast that the US could lose 60GW of planned solar capacity in the next five years due to the challenging financial environment created by the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill.

This week, PV Tech Premium heard from leading figures at two US-based developers, Aaron Halimi, founder and president of Renewable Properties and Matt Beasley, chief commercial officer of Silicon Ranch, about the new rules, whether they will affect their operations and what this could mean for the US solar project pipeline in general.

PV Tech: Treasury guidance published last week tightens the “start of construction” rules for solar developers seeking federal incentives. To what extent do the new rules represent a step change from previous guidance on this?

Aaron Halimi: The biggest change in the new rules is the removal of the 5% construction start rule, which effectively meant that if you spend 5% of the project, you’ve deemed the construction has started. That is now removed for projects that are greater than 1.5MW.

From a practical perspective, one of the two “construction start” safe harbour rules will be removed, effective 2 September. The rule remaining is the “continuous physical work” or “continuous construction” rule. There’s been little change, if any change on that rule, specifically.

Matt Beasley: The Treasury’s new framework represents a material shift from the previous guidance. With the phasing out of the existing 5% safe-harbour path for new utility-scale solar projects, the industry will have to prioritise front-end construction to qualify for federal incentives.

Though the guidance may be tighter and expectations for execution may be higher, we have worked diligently over a long period of time to position ourselves to navigate this transition effectively so that we can continue supporting the energy needs of our customers and keep delivering value to the communities where we locate.

How much harder will it be for you to get projects to the threshold, in the time available, than under the previous rules?

AH: It won’t be that much harder. The only material changes are the removal of the 5% equipment spend rule, which is black and white. Whereas the “construction of a significant nature” rule is not as black and white in terms how many hours or how many dollars are required to hit that threshold.

MB: Our industry has always been one with a lower barrier to entry but a higher barrier to execution, given all that is required to carry a project from a development concept to operational infrastructure supplying energy to the grid. The challenge of what we would define as successful execution has not changed, but the stakes certainly have.

To what extent do you now anticipate a period in which you will be rushing to get projects to the minimum level set of what’s been set out in the guidance?

AH: We’ve been rushing to get projects to start construction since the initial draft of the One Big, Beautiful Bill. I believe there will continue to be a rush for people to secure equipment and to start construction on site to the extent that they can.

MB: As you listen to industry participants react to the guidance, it certainly feels as though many are indeed “rushing,” but what happens when you scramble reactively is that mistakes can be made, and the need for electrons in this country is too great and the stakes too high for mistakes to be made.

Despite all the uncertainty and disruption over the past few months, now we have guidance, and the proverbial chessboard is set.

How likely is it that you will have to abandon projects that don’t stand a realistic chance of reaching the start of construction by the deadline?

AH: I do not foresee needing to abandon any of Renewable Properties’ projects in the immediate term. The better question is: “At what point in the cycle will you have to start abandoning projects because you will not be able to come online within four years of starting construction?” That’s an unknown that we won’t experience until closer to that four-year deadline.

MB: Our first imperative as we have considered the new legislative and regulatory framework has been to ensure that we can deliver our contracted capacity, and we are confident in our ability to do so.

As for our uncontracted development pipeline, we have carefully reviewed each project based on a number of market-based and site-specific criteria, including interconnection timelines and permitting schedules and risks, to determine how to prioritise our near-term investments.

While the recent Treasury guidance may impact each project’s economic viability for this sector based on its ability to qualify, the reality is that our country needs more electrons than ever before. This need will only intensify as our economy continues to grow and our country advances toward our critical goal of achieving American dominance in AI.

As other players in the market face the same deadline for reaching start of construction, what pressures will this place on the availability of components and personnel to carry out the necessary works?

AH: Over the next four to five years, in this window where we can start construction and have four years to come online, the people power—the skilled labour—is going to be the ultimate constraint on project deployment. But I don’t foresee that as an issue in the immediate term. Again, I foresee that as an issue in the medium- to long-term. But it absolutely will become the bottleneck.

In terms of components, over the last four months, a lot of the major transformer manufacturers are sold out in terms of their ability to deliver new transformers. Between now and the end of the year, a lot of equipment manufacturers are already sold out. We’re even seeing that from module providers. Renewable Properties is continuing to buy modules up and until 2 September, when the new guidance comes into effect, but there are already fewer modules available today than there were 30, 60, 90 days ago.

MB: Long before it was incentivised by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), we were working collaboratively to encourage our strategic US-based supply partners to onshore more of their manufacturing facilities to American soil as part of our long-term master supply agreements.

The IRA certainly helped to catalyse billions of dollars in announced investments to support domestic manufacturing, but that said, the US simply doesn’t have the manufacturing capacity to cover 100% of industry demand overnight, and the uncertainty that arises from policy decisions that pivot from one administration to the next only makes it more challenging for manufacturers to commit to new plants—which ultimately discourages investment in domestic solar manufacturing.

How likely is it that a spike in demand for labour and materials could lead to a surge in pricing or even scarcities of either?

AH: I’d say very likely, but it’s regional-specific. The market dynamics in New York might be different than the dynamics in California and in Illinois and in Texas. The labour markets are very much regional. But the supply chain is very much global. Even so, I foresee that there’s going to be supply chain shortages or constraints on both equipment and labour, but not in the immediate term, but more in the medium to long term.

MB: It is reasonable to assume that availability and cost of labour will become more challenging as the industry competes for resources to build plants in the near term. From a materials perspective, Silicon Ranch is well-positioned thanks to our domestic supply agreements, though many others will find themselves subject to the ensuing volatility.

Overall, how confident are you of being able to get at least some of your project pipeline to the qualifying threshold by the deadline?

AH: I’m confident that I’m going to be able to execute Renewable Properties’ original base case business plan for the next four to five years. Despite this revised guidance, we were already taking steps to safe harbour our pipeline and raise additional capital over the last four to five months while the Big, Beautiful Bill was working its way through the legislative process.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/renewable-properties.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 11:04:18.763851

I recognize how important grassroots is in water planning.”","Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski told attendees at the annual Indiana Water Summit on Thursday that a pending statewide water plan must be “transparent, data-driven and developed collaboratively” in line with Gov. Mike Braun’s recent executive order.

“When I stepped into this role in January, the governor really painted a vision for his Freedom and Opportunity agenda, which includes delivering a more responsive, efficient state government, and a government that improves the quality and quantity of life for Hoosiers,” Jaworowski said. “That includes affordable and clean energy and water.”

She cited an executive order signed by Braun in April, which directs state agencies to create a statewide water inventory and management plan by the end of 2026. The planning framework is supposed to align utilities, industries, municipalities and other water users.

The executive order also mandates creation of a real-time, publicly accessible online data platform for water usage, infrastructure status and future demand projections.

“In essence, it means we’re coming together to collaboratively create an inventory of our current water usage, the future of water domains, and to better understand the availability of groundwater and surface water in all regions of Indiana,” Jaworowski continued.

Focusing on Indiana’s water resources

Braun’s order came amid growing concerns about Indiana’s water vulnerabilities.

A report released last week by the Alliance for the Great Lakes, for example, warned that Indiana’s water supply could soon face strain due to compounding demands from residents, agriculture, manufacturing, water-intensive data centers and climate change.

Environmental agencies, advocates respond to Braun executive orders

Indiana additionally grapples with nutrient and sediment pollution; wetlands losses; and waterway contamination.

The Hoosier State has historically lacked a comprehensive statewide water policy, unlike neighboring states, including Ohio, Michigan and Illinois — all of which have long-standing frameworks to guide water quality and usage management.

Jaworowski emphasized that water planning in Indiana should not come from “top-down mandates,” but instead be “a conversation that’s regionally driven.”

She said, too, that population growth is adding new pressure on resources, noting that Indiana gained more than 44,000 new residents in 2024 — marking the state’s fastest increase since 2008.

Involving ‘all stakeholders’

On flooding and wetlands, Jaworowski further acknowledged concerns about changing projections, though she emphasized that “the governor is extremely dedicated to preserving our wetlands and preserving our conservation areas.”

When asked for any standout solutions that have so far offered by stakeholders, Jaworowski specifically praised ongoing work with the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership but said that, “being able to look at what other states have done with policy … and regional water planning … has been most impressive to me.”

The secretary also made clear that local watershed commissions won’t be left out of the statewide planning process and are instead “key stakeholders in this discussion.”

“Our door’s open to all,” Jaworowski told the summit audience. “‘Stakeholder’ is not a hollow term. I recognize how important grassroots is in water planning.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC_0551-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 06:59:19.464366

Through its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Grant program, FEMA awarded Forest City $2.6 million for improvements to the town’s water and sewer systems.
Princeville Mayor Bobby Jones told CPP that the town continues to draw BRIC funds to work on the project.
Other communities, like Salisbury in Rowan County, are actively searching for alternative funding sources to complete their BRIC projects.
The city intends to apply for FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which unlike BRIC is a post-disaster relief program.","Dozens of North Carolina communities are in limbo after FEMA canceled more than $200 million worth of grants for flood-mitigation projects earlier this year in the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Grant program, also known as BRIC.

For Forest City in Rutherford County, the now defunct grant program was meant to be a safety net. Flooding along the Second Broad River exposed the area’s vulnerability to heavy rainfall five years ago, when rising water smashed debris into a main line and cut off running water to Forest City and the nearby towns of Ellenboro and Bostic.

Repair work following the storm revealed more problems.

Erosion along the river left Forest City’s sewer system and raw water intake at risk of flood damage, but the town didn’t have the money to fix it. Federal emergency management officials told town officials that they would be a good fit for a new grant program aimed at pre-disaster mitigation.

Through its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Grant program, FEMA awarded Forest City $2.6 million for improvements to the town’s water and sewer systems. The project was well into the planning and design process when the federal government revoked the grant.

FEMA announced the end of the BRIC program and canceled all applications from fiscal years 2020 through 2023 on April 4, calling the program created during President Donald Trump’s first term “wasteful and ineffective” in press releases.

In total, 72 North Carolina communities with active BRIC-funded projects worth about $225 million were affected.

Town officials across the state told Carolina Public Press that the mitigation projects they view as essential to keeping their communities safe are now caught in a federal political battle in Washington.

“I don’t consider water and sewer projects to be political or woke,” Town Manager Janet Mason said.

Neither did a bipartisan group of 80 members of Congress, which released a letter addressed to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson shortly after the grant program’s termination, urging them to reverse the decision.

“BRIC funds are spurring communities across the country to strengthen their resilience to extreme weather, and forgoing these critical investments will only make it harder and more expensive for communities to recover from the next storm,” the letter read.

Instead, the legislators suggested that FEMA and Congress work together to improve the grant program’s application review and funding distribution processes.

Sen. Thom Tillis and Rep. Chuck Edwards, both North Carolina Republicans, helped craft the letter. Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat representing the northeastern part of the state, and Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat representing Charlotte, were the other two members of North Carolina’s Congressional delegation to add their signatures.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to CPP’s request for a comment on pushback from lawmakers and local governments over the ending of the BRIC program.

Meanwhile, the communities with active BRIC-funded projects have been left to wait as the future of those funds is litigated in court. North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined 19 other U.S. states in suing Noem and Richardson last month, arguing that FEMA’s termination of the grant program was illegal.

The lawsuit has three components.

First, it argues that a 2006 federal law protecting FEMA from being dissolved also prevents the government from “substantially reducing FEMA’s mitigation functions.”

Secondly, the complaint states that FEMA’s refusal to spend funds directed towards the BRIC grant program by Congress violates the legislature’s power of the purse, as granted by the Constitution.

Lastly, it claims that Richardson and his predecessor Cameron Hamilton, who was removed from his position as acting FEMA administrator on May 8, did not have legal authority to end the BRIC program because neither were ever confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

Those plaintiff states won a small victory on Aug. 5 when a United States District Judge placed an injunction on preventing the federal government from spending the BRIC funds until the court gives a final decision.

As noted in the lawsuit, FEMA had planned to return about $882 million of the BRIC funds to the U.S. Treasury and another $4 billion to its Disaster Relief Fund, which is reserved for post-disaster spending.

While many BRIC-funded projects in North Carolina have been put on pause as the federal money is withheld, some projects which have begun construction using already-obligated funds continue to advance.

Such is the case with Princeville, a low-lying community in Edgecombe County which was awarded $11 million to develop a 53-acre plot of land outside of the floodplain which encompasses much of the town.

Princeville Mayor Bobby Jones told CPP that the town continues to draw BRIC funds to work on the project.

Other communities, like Salisbury in Rowan County, are actively searching for alternative funding sources to complete their BRIC projects.

Salisbury was previously awarded $22.5 million through BRIC to relocate its existing water treatment facilities to a location more resilient to flooding. Utilities director Jason Wilson told CPP that the site of the new facilities is shovel-ready, which the city hopes makes it an attractive candidate for other grant programs.

The city intends to apply for FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which unlike BRIC is a post-disaster relief program. Salisbury is eligible to apply since Rowan County was included in the federally declared disaster area following Hurricane Helene.

The City of Lumberton is also searching for a new source of funding for stream restoration, wetland preservation and trail construction projects, which it received a $1.9 million BRIC grant for several years ago.

The Robeson County city, which sits on the Lumber River, has been working since 2016 to develop land it bought from property owners following Hurricane Matthew into an expansive public trails system.

Deputy City Manager Brandon Love told CPP that he’s optimistic that the city will find an alternate source of funding to keep the project moving forward, but it’s nonetheless a disappointing development after years of planning.

“Getting caught up in the politics of things going on in Washington is hitting home here at the local level,” Love said, “and that’s unfortunate.”

Because so many emissions regulations are based on the endangerment finding, environmentalists worry protections could go out the window if the finding were to go away.
And to then see the endangerment finding rescinded is such a smack in the face,” Kilgore said.

The “endangerment finding” concludes that vehicle emissions are threatening public health and welfare by adding to greenhouse gas emissions. It created a legal path for passing new emissions standards and other regulations.

State Representative Kristian Grant (D-Grand Rapids) said the endangerment rule has helped policymakers at all levels respond to threats of air pollution.

“Usually, a community doesn’t need a finding from the EPA to say, ‘Hey, something’s wrong. But it allows an opportunity to validate that to pinpoint what the issues are so communities and states can take action,” Grant said after a press conference Thursday outside a waste incinerator in Grand Rapids.

Because so many emissions regulations are based on the endangerment finding, environmentalists worry protections could go out the window if the finding were to go away.

Grand Rapids City Commissioner Marshall Kilgore said it’s wrong to pull back from environmental protection, especially as his city is ramping up its efforts.

“Our constituents gave us a huge thumbs up with passing the climate action adaptation plan, lowering our carbon emissions, just trying to fight for environmental justice. And to then see the endangerment finding rescinded is such a smack in the face,” Kilgore said.

The Environmental Protection Agency is leading the effort to rescind the endangerment finding. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the Obama Administration went too far when it issued the 2009 conclusions.

“[M]any stakeholders have told me that the Obama and Biden EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year,” Zeldin said last month during an announcement of the plan to rescind the endangerment finding.

Zeldin argues deregulation would save Americans a collective $54 billion each year. His department is proposing getting rid of greenhouse gas emissions standards for “light-, medium-, and heavy-duty highway vehicles.”

Over 99.9% of peer-reviewed studies have confirmed the existence of human-made climate change, according to an analysis in the Environmental Resource Letters journal. Meanwhile, researchers have linked air pollution to various health conditions like asthma, cancer, and heart disease.

In Grand Rapids, advocates say Black, Brown, and poorer communities feel the burden of pollution.

Maps from the Centers for Disease, Control, and Prevention show higher levels of asthma throughout Grand Rapids, including majority Black and Latino neighborhoods surrounding the incinerator where Thursday’s press conference was held.

Cases of COPD, another breathing condition, were also more highly concentrated in Census tracts for low-income communities nearby.

Kareem Scales works on environmental justice for the NAACP Grand Rapids chapter. Scales acknowledged getting the Trump Administration to change its mind will require allies beyond the areas hardest hit by air pollution.

“Although Black and Brown communities and other poor communities will be hit first, those communities are next in line. And so, for folks to understand that this is a human rights issue and that all of us will be impacted, I think is a good way,” Scales said.

The EPA is accepting public comment through September 22.

Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel the Answer?,Tim Wenger,,,,,https://matadornetwork.com/read/sustainable-aviation-fuel-future/,"Unlike kerosene-based jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable or recycled bio-organic sources and can lower total greenhouse gas emissions over time.
Importantly, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in today’s aircraft without engine modifications.
The fuel produces nearly the same amount of CO₂ as traditional jet fuel when burned.
Total SAF usage currently accounts for less than .2 percent of total global jet fuel consumption.
Still, Neste says global SAF production is sufficient to meet existing mandates in the EU and UK.","Unlike kerosene-based jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable or recycled bio-organic sources and can lower total greenhouse gas emissions over time. It can be produced from biomass like corn, used cooking oil, and agricultural residues, as well as from municipal waste or synthetic fuels made by combining captured CO₂ with green hydrogen (‘power-to-liquid’). Importantly, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in today’s aircraft without engine modifications. The fuel produces nearly the same amount of CO₂ as traditional jet fuel when burned. But because SAF is made from renewable or recycled carbon sources, net lifecycle emissions can be up to 80 percent lower, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Ultimately, the IATA estimates SAF could make up 65 percent of the emissions reduction need for aviation to reach net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. It’s an important piece of the pie in addition to improving technology like carbon capture.

The need for SAF is rising. Commercial aviation accounts for about 2.5 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions. As other sectors of the economy become more sustainable and the amount of flights around the world increases, the share of total emissions from flying will only grow – unless airlines can find effective ways to lower their environmental impact. In addition to carbon capture, which involves pulling carbon from the air and storing it underground, the adoption of SAF is increasingly viewed as a viable means for the aviation sector to reduce its emissions.

Still, a spokesperson for Neste, a Finnish energy company founded in 1948, told me there’s still a long way to go. Total SAF usage currently accounts for less than .2 percent of total global jet fuel consumption.

Neste, originally focused on securing Finland’s oil supply, has transformed over the decades into a SAF leader focused on renewable and circular energy solutions. Neste’s Singapore refinery is the world’s largest SAF facility, capable of producing 1 million tons annually. Neste isn’t alone. Boston’s World Energy, founded in 1998, became the world’s first commercial-scale producer of SAF in 2016, while Reno-based XCF Global recently became the first publicly traded SAF company in the United States.

The industry is gaining traction, though critics remain skeptical of SAF’s scalability and environmental value. Its future is far from guaranteed, and SAF alone is unlikely to erase aviation’s heavy carbon footprint. Still, momentum is building. Commercial aviation may be moving toward a cleaner future. What role SAF will play remains unclear.

How SAF works

SAF is straightforward in concept but complex to produce. The most common production method is known as HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), which uses renewable oils and fats such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and some non-food vegetable oils. These are treated with hydrogen at high temperature and pressure to remove oxygen and impurities, producing paraffinic hydrocarbons that closely resemble conventional jet fuel and can be blended directly (hence the term “drop-in” fuel).

Sustainability efforts are highly marketable these days. While companies that reduce their environmental impact deserve credit, consumers are wary of greenwashing. Delta Air Lines was the first US carrier to offer offsets when travelers book flights in 2007, and doing so is now an industry standard. It’s easy to see this as shifting the sustainability burden to consumers rather than the companies. SAF instead allows companies to take a bigger responsibility in reducing emissions.

Corporate entities can buy SAF certificates (SAFc) to document emissions cuts as their people and goods are flown around the world, known as Scope 3 emissions. SAFc uses a system called ‘insetting,’ which separates the verified emissions savings from the fuel itself. Airlines can then apply those savings to their overall carbon footprint from flights. This sounds similar to how carbon offset credits, which have been shown to be ineffective without strict monitoring, are applied. But the SAFc system is considered more reliable because it’s tracked through a ‘Book and Claim’ ledger. This helps prevent double counting of emissions reductions, ensure integrity, and allows SAF to be used where most efficient, all while still letting companies claim the associated emissions cuts in their supply chains.

This could prove to be the key difference in helping both the public and airlines get on board with developing and implementing more SAF use.

“Delivering the emissions reduction value of SAF with SAFc insets is increasingly recognized as the best tool to scale investment in the SAF industry,” Karen Boyd, director of product sustainability at World Energy, says.

Where does current policy on SAF stand?

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set a net-zero target for 2050. It introduced a Global Framework calling for a 5 percent emissions cut by 2030 through SAF and lower-carbon fuels. The European Union’s ReFuelEU regulation is the most ambitious program in the world, requiring airlines to blend their jet fuel with 2 percent SAF by 2025, 6 percent by 2030, and 70 percent by 2050, with dedicated targets for synthetic e-fuels. The UK has set a similar path with a 9.5% SAF target by 2030, while Ireland recently launched its first national SAF roadmap. In North America, the US Inflation Reduction Act offers SAF tax credits and $300 million for research and infrastructure, while Canada supports production through mandates, incentives, and public–private partnerships. Time will tell whether any of these benefits survive the current administration’s environmental rollbacks.

India, Brazil, and a handful of other countries also have SAF mandates in place. China, South Korea, Turkey, and the UAE are developing frameworks. By 2030, government mandates are expected to cover about 75 percent of global jet fuel use, requiring airlines to use roughly 2 billion gallons of SAF each year. That’s far more than the 1 percent of global jet fuel that SAF accounts for today, with production constrained by feedstock scarcity, high costs, and delayed projects.

The gap between policy goals and current supply means scaling up investment and infrastructure is essential. Still, Neste says global SAF production is sufficient to meet existing mandates in the EU and UK. That’s because these mandates are currently quite low – and because the ongoing expansion of Neste’s Rotterdam refinery will bring the company’s total SAF production capability to 2.2 million tons annually in 2027. XCF and other producers are scaling in the same manner.

Progress and making the costs make sense

In June 2025, XCF Global, a synthetic aviation fuel producer, took the vision for decarbonized air travel directly to Wall Street when it went public via a merger with Focus Impact BH3 Acquisition Company under the ticker SAFX. The company promotes “feedstock-agnostic technology” that isn’t reliant on corn or monocrop agriculture. At the company’s facility in Reno, Nevada, it produces SAF in the largest industrial park in the country.

“SAF in our opinion is going to be one of the most predominant ways to decarbonize the aviation industry,” Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF, told Matador. “I think that’s the purpose of why we intended on going public is we wanted to add to the legitimacy. To bring visibility to what’s happening in our business but as well as what’s happening in the market.”

Technological improvements and availability are one step to a more sustainable industry, but won’t have the intended impact if it’s still too expensive to implement. XCF Global’s business plan is key to growing the sector as a whole. The company reduces costs by having its facility in a location near a source for various types of feedstocks like tallow, cooking oil, the waste byproduct distillers corn oil, and soybean oil.

Dange acknowledges the challenges but feels like his business, and SAF more broadly, is well-positioned for growth. Meeting the 2050 goal of a 70 percent decrease in carbon intensity will require roughly 100 times today’s infrastructure, he said, adding “we’re just not building infrastructure that fast.”

“I don’t consider [other SAF companies] competitors” in the bigger picture of a more sustainable future, Dange said. “We need as much staff infrastructure as we can to come online to help meet the demands of the future, to help reduce the carbon intensity around aviation.”

He argues that success depends on industry and regulators working together to create consistent global standards. Clear reporting and verification will not only move the sector forward but also build public trust — a view echoed by World Energy and Neste.

“We take our Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) calculations very seriously, conducting rigorous evaluations that account for full cradle-to-grave emissions and vetting them through independent third-party audits on an annual basis to ensure transparency and accuracy,” says Boyd, of World Energy. “This approach aligns with industry standards. Where properly certified SAF achieves at least a 50 percent lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel, our SAF can achieve up to 85 percent in optimal cases using waste-based or advanced feedstocks.”

The case against sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel isn’t without critics who point out that SAF comes with its own inherent climate risks. For one, corn requires an immense amount of land and water to grow.

Chuck Collins, director at the Institute for Policy Studies, is a vocal critic of SAF. He coauthored the 2024 report “Greenwashing the Skies” that argued SAF is largely a marketing ploy and not a scalable solution for aviation emissions. He and his coauthors point out that current SAF production is nowhere near what would be required to meet US climate goals, a valid stance.

The report notes that scaling up would demand massive subsidies and land-use changes, and that the aviation industry has a poor track record of meeting its own SAF targets. Collins also warns that including fuels like corn-based ethanol could worsen climate impacts due to land clearance and soil loss.

To produce enough corn-based ethanol to replace just 10 percent of current US jet fuel demand, corn yields and production methods would need major improvements. Replacing 100 percent of jet fuel with corn-based ethanol would be far more damaging and would require vast new cropland that reduces forests and strains water supplies.

Other vocal critics include airline executives themselves. AirAsia co-founder Tony Fernandes has called SAF “stupid”, and, like Collins and the IPS, questions its scalability given feedstock limitations and cost. Breeze Airways CEO David Neeleman agrees, telling Skift that SAF is economically and environmentally inadequate.

Collins and other SAF opponents call for rejecting ethanol-based SAF due to the harmful lifecycle impacts, and instead push for independent, science-driven research rather than what Collins has described as industry-influenced standards. His warning that turning farmland into fuel crops would be disastrous has merit, though it may overlook other viable SAF pathways.

Even industry players recognize these concerns – and are working to address them.

“Critics’ worries about scalability and environmental trade-offs, such as those from biofuel competition with food crops, are being addressed through evolving frameworks like ICAO’s sustainability criteria,” Boyd says. “Ultimately, dismissing SAF entirely overlooks its role in aviation’s net-zero pathway, but ongoing scrutiny drives improvements in production and certification to maximize real-world decarbonization.”

Waiting for researchers to develop a silver bullet solution is an increasingly less viable option as the effects of climate change speed up. Still, for SAF to be viable, more production methods need to be embraced to turn waste into energy.

One place to find inspiration is Denmark. Copenhagen’s CopenHill (Amager Bakke) plant burns the city’s non-recyclable waste in a high-efficiency incinerator, generating both electricity and hot water for tens of thousands of homes. If similar waste-to-energy plants were adapted to produce jet fuel using advanced filtration and catalytic systems to capture pollutants, the result could be cleaner than today’s kerosene while also diverting waste from landfills and cutting methane emissions. CopenHill is especially notable for its design: the plant doubles as a recreation space, with a ski slope, climbing wall, and hiking trails built into its sloping roof, helping secure public support.

Technology isn’t the only challenge to increasing production, however. Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the industry’s biggest roadblocks.

“The primary regulatory obstacles to scaling SAF production involve inconsistent international policies and varying sustainability criteria across jurisdictions, which can hinder compliance and deter investment in certain pathways or regions,” Boyd says.

She adds that regulatory uncertainty in both the US and EU, such as delays in tax credits and blending mandates, continues to slow progress. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) provides a framework to standardize international aviation emissions reductions, but its impact is limited by patchy participation and uneven carbon pricing.

The future for SAF – and what travelers can do now

The core takeaway is clear: For SAF to both scale and notably reduce the emissions of the aviation sector, production must be done responsibly with consistent global regulation and enactment.

For travelers, small steps matter too. Airlines including Alaska, JetBlue, and Turkish now allow flyers to “purchase” SAF credits at checkout, effectively only contributing a couple bucks to the cause but importantly voicing their support.

“I would emphasize that while some concerns are valid and highlight the need for careful pathway and feedstock selection,” Boyd says, “the evidence shows SAF can deliver substantial net GHG reductions when produced responsibly.”

For travelers from the US, a successful way forward involves educating both the public and lawmakers on the benefits, and supporting organizations, politicians, and individuals advocating for responsible development. Each step to replace fossil fuels with a more sustainable alternative is a step in the right direction. When SAF-powered long-hauls like Virgin’s Flight100 become the norm is still years or decades away – but in the broad stroke of human progress, this time is a blink of the eye.",https://cdn1.matadornetwork.com/blogs/1/2025/08/SAF-2463328421-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 12:08:22.134763
