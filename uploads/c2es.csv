This means that Texas — and not the federal agency — will directly administer the permitting, enforcement and oversight of underground carbon storage facilities in the state.

While there’s no substitute for electrification, fuel switching and energy efficiency — which can achieve much of the emission reductions needed in our state — carbon sequestration also has a significant role to play in Texas. High levels of industrial emissions, significant economically viable pore space and deep industry expertise in doing this type of work coupled with increasing interest in low-carbon value chains for commodities produced here means carbon storage can be a huge player in climate solutions here. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded with high confidence that “[i]f the geological storage site is appropriately selected and managed, it is estimated that the [carbon dioxide] can be permanently isolated from the atmosphere.” This is easier said than done. Implementing and enforcing a robust Class VI permitting program is a critical ingredient that can help Texas agencies and operators ensure sites are “appropriately selected and managed” and meet permanence expectations.

Will Texas carbon storage primacy spark a world-class permitting and enforcement program, or will it merely check the boxes? Only time will tell - and the world is watching Share on X

Texas certainly has the industry and technical expertise to build a credible, science-based oversight program that delivers the environmental and public safety protection required by law, though doing so will demand advancements beyond EPA’s minimum requirements. And Texas has a far from perfect history in independently enforcing strong standards and holding industry accountable for a high bar of performance. So, now starts the critical test of whether the Texas Railroad Commission (the agency that will administer the process) will step up to this task and bolster both global credibility and local public trust in the program.

In other words, getting primacy was Step One. Now, Texas has to deliver.

We’ve learned a lot in the 15 years since the federal Class VI program was adopted, both technically and with respect to specific community concerns. If Texas wants to lead — if it wants to help industry continue to prove that commercial CO2 storage can be done with environmental integrity and be safe and permanent — it must commit to a stronger, smarter and more transparent regulatory approach.

During the EPA’s public comment period, EDF submitted a collection of eleven recommendations we believe will put Texas on the best path to meeting this objective. As the Texas Railroad Commission moves forward, EDF will continue to work with Texas regulators and elected officials to ensure the RRC builds and implements the best possible program.

In doing so, we’ll focus on four primary areas.

Aim higher than minimum standards

The EPA’s authority to regulate underground injection projects like carbon sequestration predominantly turns on preventing impacts to underground sources of drinking water — not every surface or subsurface issue that may arise — meaning Class VI standards are a strong foundation for environmental integrity for carbon storage, but not the final word. There’s much to be learned from both real-time experience and leading research on what best practices look like for subsurface activities to avoid impacts like felt earthquakes, containment leaks that don’t reach groundwater and over-pressurization, and much of that expertise is here in Texas. The RRC has the ability and, now, the authority to build a stronger-than-baseline technical program that protects more than just groundwater if it has the will to do it.

Specifically, EDF’s comments recommended that Texas:

Update monitoring well standards to reflect knowledge learned from recent incidents at ADM’s well in Decatur, IL.

Issue clear public guidance on how RRC will address seismic risks that may fall below EPA’s threshold for storage complex integrity but could still cause felt earthquakes.

Adopt more protective and proactive approaches to identifying undocumented wells in areas of review.

Adopt rules or establish guidance to prevent adverse impacts to storage facilities from other subsurface activities.

Assess the limitations of ‘pressure space’ in addition to pore space and risks that may increase as more projects come online.

Strong oversight and enforcement

Much of the excitement around Class VI primacy seems to stem from a desire to expedite the permitting process. But Texas’ program must not sacrifice oversight for speed, or it risks cutting corners and unsafe projects. We’ve seen with the Class II program how things can go wrong quickly if a flood of projects overwhelms staff and impacts enforcement, from seismicity to sinkholes. The RRC has to get Class VI right from the start and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past with other injection programs.

Specifically, EDF’s comments recommended that Texas:

Ensure the RRC has enough funding and trained staff to safely oversee the Class VI program.

Avoid changing liability laws in a way that reduces RRC’s authority to enforce Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.

Avoid backsliding

Primacy also gives Texas a bigger decision-making role when it comes to less clear and untested aspects of the Class VI program, such as how it will apply in coastal waters or at what point other types of wells that inject carbon need to upgrade to Class VI standards. It’s vital that the RRC avoid backsliding when it comes to answering these questions and, instead, show leadership in requiring best practices that provide the strongest protections for communities and the environment.

Specifically, EDF’s comments recommended that Texas:

Provide more formalized guidance or additional rulemaking to clarify how the RRC will make decisions on when and how other carbon injection wells, like enhanced oil recovery wells, can or must meet Class VI requirements.

Apply full Class VI rules to projects in coastal or state-water areas, even if underground sources of drinking water aren’t present, to prevent integrity loss.

Safety and people first

Lost in many discussions of primacy are safety and people — a core reason to have rules and regulations in the first place. Done right, carbon storage in Texas can provide many benefits — energy, climate, landowner revenue and others. Yet the RRC must ensure we do not chase these benefits at the expense of public safety and the people who will be affected by these new facilities.

Specifically, EDF’s comments recommended that Texas:

Strengthen emergency planning and coordinate with local responders.

Build a stronger public engagement program, including mandating outreach and public information sharing.

EDF stands ready to help — and to hold to account

We are cautiously optimistic that the RRC can and will, and in some cases may already, exceed the federal Class VI requirements. With primacy, Texas now has a responsibility to further build public, corporate and investor confidence in carbon management technologies. And doing so will require a stronger, smarter and more transparent regulatory approach.

Texas has a chance to get it right from the start. With thoughtful enhancements and a commitment to public accountability, the RRC can build a Class VI program that meets the moment — protecting people, water and climate while supporting economic opportunity. EDF stands ready to support this outcome. But we will also continue to hold regulators and operators accountable to the high standards this work demands.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//Screenshot-2025-11-13-131927.png,N,,2025-11-13 15:02:07.444466

The project will be fully online and generating energy by the end of the year.

Lafitte Solar was enabled through a long-term PPA with Meta, through which Meta also receives all environmental benefits associated with the project, including RECs. This follows another 385-MW Louisiana PPA for Meta earlier this fall.

The project was celebrated on Nov. 13 at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Monroe Mayor Friday Ellis, local officials from the Ouachita Parish Police Jury and Ouachita Parish Industrial Development Board, RWE leadership and employees and construction partner McCarthy Building Companies.

Construction of Lafitte Solar was completed in collaboration with RWE’s EPC partner McCarthy, supporting more than 150 full-time jobs on the project at its peak. During construction, workers supported local businesses and restaurants, and shopped at area stores, amplifying the project’s economic impact.

“We’re thrilled to see the Lafitte Solar project reach this important milestone — not only adding clean energy to the grid locally but adding jobs to the local economy,” said Amanda Yang, head of clean and renewable energy at Meta. “Projects like Lafitte Solar are essential to achieving our clean energy goals while strengthening communities.”

Lafitte Solar’s site design features natural and native vegetation around the perimeter, promoting biodiversity and habitat conservation to benefit the project’s land and surrounding farmlands. The project will also use a flock of over 600 sheep to maintain healthy vegetation onsite. This practice not only protects local farmland but deepens partnerships with regional farmers, demonstrating how renewable energy coexists with agriculture.

The new discounts, however, come less than two months before the federal tax credit for home energy upgrades expires.
If approved, participants should contact a contractor registered to participate in the rebate program, according to Raine Queenan, a senior program manager with the Colorado Energy Office.
Elephant Energy, a Boulder-based home electrification company, is still awaiting approval to participate in the state rebate program.
Based on those constraints, Toor expects the rebate program will provide benefits to at least 6,500 households.","Coloradans looking to make their homes more climate-friendly can now apply for up to $14,000 in rebates for electric appliances and energy upgrades.

On Thursday, the Colorado Energy Office opened applications for its Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate Program, or HEAR, which offers discounts for electric stoves, heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, insulation, wiring and panel upgrades.

The program is funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate and health care law signed by President Joe Biden in 2022. The $4.5 billion investment has so far survived the Trump administration’s attempts to claw back federal investments designed to slow global warming.

Along with support for electric vehicle chargers along highways, the discounts appear to be a rare example of a green energy initiative continuing under President Trump. Will Toor, the executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said the federal government hasn’t actively stopped Republican- and Democratic-led states from launching the rebate programs.

“We can’t predict what the federal government may do in the future, but both Congress and the administration have allowed the programs to move forward, and we have no indications that that’s going to change,” Toor said.

The new discounts, however, come less than two months before the federal tax credit for home energy upgrades expires.

What kind of home energy upgrades are covered by the rebates? And who qualifies?

The rebates offer discounts on all-electric appliances certified by the federal Energy Star program. It’s available to homeowners living in manufactured or single-family homes. Renters can also apply with the written authorization from their landlords.

To qualify for the maximum amount, a household must earn less than 80% of its county’s area median income. Households earning between 80% and 150% of the AMI can qualify for half the maximum rebate. Potential applicants can consult state income tables to determine their county’s AMI.

How can residents apply?

Anyone interested in the discounts should start with the online application.

The process involves submitting income verification documents. If approved, participants should contact a contractor registered to participate in the rebate program, according to Raine Queenan, a senior program manager with the Colorado Energy Office. A full list of registered contractors is available on the state website.

Those contractors will then help decide the full scope of upgrades. Once complete, the state will review the proposed projects and issue the rebates to installers, which would apply the discounts to the upfront cost paid by customers.

“There are a lot of requirements in this program, and we want to ensure Coloradans — especially low-income Coloradans — are receiving professionals who are trained and ready to support them,” Queenan said.

Are there even enough contractors to do the work??

Not yet.

Only four contractors have fully completed registration with the state to participate in the rebate program. Queenan said more than 40 additional companies spread across Colorado are now working their way through the registration process.

Ari Rosenblum, a spokesperson with the Colorado Energy Office, acknowledged many households might not be able to obtain a contractor through the program immediately. The sooner households apply and prove their eligibility, the sooner the state can connect participants with registered contractors, Rosenblum said.

Elephant Energy, a Boulder-based home electrification company, is still awaiting approval to participate in the state rebate program. Co-Founder D.R. Richardson said state communication about the program has been “hit or miss,” but he’s glad the incentive program is moving forward.

“Medium-term, this is amazing. This is money for low-income homeowners to electrify their homes,” Richardson said.

Have other states launched programs like this??

Besides Colorado, 12 other states and the District of Columbia have launched some version of the federally funded home electrification rebate program, according to an ongoing analysis published by the National Association of State Energy Officials.

David Terry, the president of the association, said other states are awaiting final approval from the U.S. Department of Energy to launch their rebate programs. Those efforts are now on hold while the federal government “streamlines” requirements for states receiving the federal funding.

It appears Colorado avoided the issue by launching an initial version of the program last year. Toor acknowledged that the move allowed the former Biden administration to approve Colorado's program — clearing the way for it to launch consumer-facing rebates more quickly than most other states.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

How many households can benefit from the program?

There’s a fixed amount of funding available for the program.

Out of an initial $70 million federal grant, Colorado has set aside $46 million for rebates earmarked for single-family homes, manufactured homes and small multifamily buildings. The program will last through 2029 or when the state exhausts its federal funding.

Based on those constraints, Toor expects the rebate program will provide benefits to at least 6,500 households. The final number could vary widely, however, depending on whether participants opt for cheaper upgrades like induction stoves or more expensive options such as a heat pump, or new insulation.

Are there other programs available to discount the cost of home energy upgrades?

Yes — and it’s not easy to figure out the full range of incentives.

Municipal governments like Boulder County offer rebates for home energy upgrades. Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest utility, also offers discounts on heat pumps through its Clean Heat Program, an incentive program ordered by state policy makers.

Additional rebates could also arrive in the next few months. In early 2026, Colorado plans to expand its new rebate program to include discounts for small multifamily buildings. In the first quarter of 2026, it will also launch its version of the Home Efficiency Rebate (HER) Program, a separate federally funded initiative offering $56 million in rebates based on the amount of energy saved by different building upgrades. The Denver Regional Council of Governments also received a $200 million federal grant to boost cleaner buildings around metro Denver.

It’s a rapidly shifting landscape Elephant Energy navigates on behalf of consumers and HVAC subcontractors. Richardson said the complexity has benefited his company, but he fears it’s holding back the larger home electrification industry.

“It’s really hard as a consumer or HVAC contractor to stay on top of it all,” Richardson said.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/03/20240813-home-electrification-event007-Cropped.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 15:01:44.038954

Key findings Florida, Louisiana, and Oklahoma — the most expensive states for home insurance per Insurify data — are also among the states with the highest rates of uninsured homes.
Since Mississippi has the lowest median household income in the country, homeowners spend a bigger percentage of that income on home insurance.
Home insurance costs are much more moderate in Arkansas than in nearby states like Louisiana and Oklahoma, Insurify data shows.
This report defines “uninsured homes” as owner-occupied homes with home insurance costs of less than $100 per year in 2024.","One in seven (14.1%) American homes are uninsured, according to an Insurify analysis of data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2024 1-Year Estimates. In the states most vulnerable to climate catastrophes, that ratio rises to 1 in 6 (16.2%).

For this analysis, Insurify defines “uninsured” as homeowners who reported spending less than $100 annually on home insurance — meaning they likely aren’t buying coverage at all. A mix of unaffordability and climate risk likely explains this lack of coverage.1

The 10 states with the highest uninsured home rates have average median household incomes that are at least $25,000 lower than average incomes in the 10 states with the lowest uninsured rates. For example, Mississippi, West Virginia, Louisiana, and Arkansas — the four states with the lowest average household incomes in the U.S. — are also among the 10 states with the highest uninsured home rates.

This is true even in climate-vulnerable states, such as Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas, which are also among the 10 states with the highest share of uninsured homeowners.

While forgoing home insurance coverage might save these homeowners some money in the short term, they risk not meeting mortgage requirements. It also leaves a critical financial asset unprotected when disaster strikes.

These are the 10 states with the highest percentage of uninsured homes.

Key findings

Florida, Louisiana, and Oklahoma — the most expensive states for home insurance per Insurify data — are also among the states with the highest rates of uninsured homes.

West Virginia has the highest rate of uninsured homes — nearly 1 in 4 (23.9%).

In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, which has a 24.9% uninsured home rate, the average annual home insurance cost is $16,872 — 22% of the county’s median household income.

In Arizona’s Navajo County, 51% of homes are uninsured — the highest county rate in the U.S.

West Virginia, New Mexico, Louisiana lead top 10 states with highest uninsured home rates

While homeowners can save money in the short term by forgoing home insurance, a damaging weather event or other disaster could threaten that asset. Climate change is increasing the probability of severe, destructive weather. It means that homeowners who may not have previously experienced severe weather now face the threat of significant damage.

Insurance companies are re-evaluating as risk shifts. Home insurance non-renewals increased by 267% in Louisiana between 2018 and 2023.2 And, when the cost of protection becomes unaffordable, some homeowners opt to go without insurance.

1. West Virginia

Percentage of uninsured homes: 23.9%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $1,387

Median household income: $60,798

West Virginia’s low housing costs likely contribute to its high rate of uninsured homes. Homeowners may be able to pay off their mortgages faster, which could explain why West Virginia has the highest share of homeowners without a mortgage, at 55.1%.

West Virginia also has a low cost of living and well-below-average home insurance costs, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC).3 It has the lowest average home value in the country, according to the Zillow Home Value Index, boosted by a high prevalence of manufactured housing. The state also has a 75.5% homeownership rate — the highest in the U.S., according to census data.

But West Virginia also has the second-lowest median household income, at $60,798 annually. Raleigh and Wood counties have the highest uninsured home rates in the state and the lowest median household incomes.

About 6.2% of homeowners without a mortgage statewide are “house poor,” meaning they spend 30% or more of their income on housing costs, according to an Insurify analysis of ACS data. The national average is 5.4%.

West Virginia also has a high overall climate vulnerability, according to the U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index.4 Dam failures, earthquakes, floods, landslides, levee/floodwall failure, and severe storms are all “hazards of concern,” according to West Virginia’s 2023 Hazard Mitigation Plan.5

2. New Mexico

Percentage of uninsured homes: 23%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $2,463

Median household income: $67,816

Like in West Virginia, New Mexico’s high uninsured home rate is likely partly due to 50.6% of homeowners not having a mortgage. A lower number of mortgages means fewer homeowners are required to buy insurance.

But New Mexico faces changing climate hazards, notably hail, riverine flooding, and wildfires, which can make going uninsured financially risky.6 New Mexico also ranks high in terms of climate vulnerability.

Home values and insurance costs in New Mexico rank below the national average. The low cost of living and high share of manufactured homes may contribute to the high 71.1% homeowner rate.

Still, the low median household income of $67,816 means home costs take up more of residents’ budgets. In New Mexico, homeowners spend 24% of their income on housing costs, including insurance, taxes, maintenance, utilities, and flood insurance, according to an Insurify report.

New Mexico has large Native American reservations, which often lack access to financial and mortgage products due to low lender participation.7 Federal land ownership and credit issues create other barriers.8 The uninsured home rate is 30% in San Juan County, home to a large Navajo Nation reservation. The median household income there is also below the state average.

3. Louisiana

Percentage of uninsured homes: 21.2%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $5,132

Median household income: $60,986

More than 1 in 5 Louisiana homes are uninsured, representing unprecedented financial risk given the state’s hurricane exposure. Around 48.2% of Louisiana homeowners don’t have a mortgage. Many mortgage-free homeowners may try to save money by going uninsured, especially as the state’s median household income of $60,986 is the third-lowest in the nation.

Louisiana is also the second most expensive state for home insurance, according to Insurify data. Insured homeowners carry the highest cost burden of any state, spending 8.4% of their income on home insurance. About 6.1% of Louisiana homeowners are house poor — more than the national average.

Terrebonne Parish, a coastal region southwest of New Orleans, has the highest uninsured home rate in the state, at 29.7%. Due to its hurricane exposure, the parish has a relatively high risk index, and insurance premiums reflect that risk. The average annual cost of home insurance is $8,316 in Terrebonne, according to Insurify data.

Louisiana has pushed for strong building codes and incentivized weather-mitigation renovations to help homeowners reduce damage and the possibility of expensive repairs.9 Homeowners who can afford to invest in resilience improvements can also save on their home insurance.

4. Alaska

Percentage of uninsured homes: 20.6%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $1,377

Median household income: $95,665

Alaska’s exceptionally high cost of living may squeeze budgets enough for homeowners to try to save money by going without insurance. Between April and June in 2025, Alaska ranked sixth for the overall cost of living, behind Hawaii, California, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., and New York, according to MERIC.

About 39.6% of Alaska homeowners don’t have a mortgage, and the state has a much higher median household income and lower-than-average insurance costs. But Alaskans — particularly those living in cities — face utility, healthcare, and grocery costs that exceed the national average, according to a 2024 survey by the Council for Community and Economic Relations.10

Climate risks, including avalanches, wildfires, volcanic activity, and earthquakes, can also compound the financial consequences of forgoing home insurance in the state.

5. Mississippi

Percentage of uninsured homes: 20.2%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $3,427

Median household income: $59,127

More than half of Mississippi homeowners (51.6%) don’t have a mortgage, and Mississippi is among the 10 most expensive states for home insurance, according to Insurify data. Since Mississippi has the lowest median household income in the country, homeowners spend a bigger percentage of that income on home insurance.

Jones and Forrest counties have the highest percentages of uninsured homes in the state, at 26.7% and 22.6%, respectively. They also have median household incomes below the state average: $48,298 in Forrest County, the lowest in the state, and $51,748 in Jones County.

Mississippi also faces several climate-related risks, including tornadoes, hailstorms, riverine flooding, and hurricanes, particularly along the Gulf Coast, according to FEMA. Homeowners may opt to go uninsured to save money in the short term, but damage from a weather event or a house fire could leave many struggling to recover.

Around 6.6% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor, so losing that asset could be disastrous.

6. Florida

Percentage of uninsured homes: 19.4%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $8,491

Median household income: $77,735

Florida is the most expensive state for home insurance, according to Insurify data, largely due to its climate risk. And even with a higher median household income, Florida ties Louisiana for the highest insurance cost burden.

Home insurance costs 8.4% of the median income in Florida, more than three times the national average. The state tops the list for homeownership costs, which take up 37% of household income, according to an Insurify report.

Around 44.2% of Florida homeowners don’t have a mortgage, which is higher than the national average but lower than most states on this list. But 7.8% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor, the highest share nationwide.

As in other states, affordability is likely a contributing factor to the high rate of uninsured homes. More than 1 in 3 (37.7%) homes in Putnam County are uninsured, the highest rate in the state. Putnam County also has the lowest median household income statewide, at $51,293.

Florida’s high hurricane exposure, as well as wildfire and tornado risks in certain areas, can drive up insurance costs. But those hazards also make opting out of home insurance exceptionally risky.

Miami-Dade County, for example, has a high uninsured home rate, despite its hurricane and wildfire risk. Its median household income is $76,184, close to the state average, but home insurance costs $16,872 per year — a staggering 22% of median household income.

7. Arkansas

Percentage of uninsured homes: 19.1%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $2,621

Median household income: $62,106

Climate risks have a less acute effect on insurance costs in Arkansas than in Florida. But weather events like severe hailstorms, tornadoes, and wildfires still threaten properties around the state.

Arkansas’ percentage of uninsured homes is likely linked to its high 47.6% share of homeowners who don’t have a mortgage. Home insurance costs are much more moderate in Arkansas than in nearby states like Louisiana and Oklahoma, Insurify data shows. But home insurance still costs 4.2% of the median household income, the seventh-highest nationwide.

White, Jefferson, and Garland counties have the highest uninsured home rates in the state. Jefferson and White counties also have the lowest median household incomes in Arkansas. The Garland County median income is closer to the state average, but Garland has the highest share of house-poor homeowners without a mortgage, at 8.4%.

8. Alabama

Percentage of uninsured homes: 18.9%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $3,190

Median household income: $66,659

Alabama’s high percentage of homeowners without a mortgage (46.5%) contributes to its 18.9% rate of uninsured homes statewide. But the picture shifts dramatically depending on different regions in the state. Alabama has the fourth-lowest median household income in the country, and, though costs spike along the Gulf, insurance costs are more moderate than in neighboring states.

Shelby County has the lowest rate of uninsured homes in the state, at 10.8%. The median household income there is $102,265, the highest in the state. And, despite its high tornado risk, Shelby County has the cheapest average insurance premiums in the state. Home insurance costs make up 2.2% of the median income. Just 2.7% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor.

In Walker County, on the other side of Birmingham, 32.6% of homes are uninsured, and 6.7% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor. Insured homeowners spend 5.6% of their median household income of $58,017 on insurance.

9. Oklahoma

Percentage of uninsured homes: 18.3%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $4,058

Median household income: $66,148

Oklahoma is the third most expensive state for home insurance, according to Insurify data. Hailstorms, tornadoes, and severe wind have increased insurer losses, which policyholders feel in premiums.

High insurance costs can squeeze the budget: Oklahoma has one of the lowest median household incomes in the U.S., and insurance costs can eat up 6.1% of that income. It also has a high rate of homeowners without a mortgage, which likely contributes to its higher percentage of uninsured homes.

Muskogee County, home to part of the Muskogee Nation reservation, has a 25.8% uninsured home rate. Oklahoma has the largest population of people who chose American Indian as their only race, according to the 2020 U.S. Census.11 As in New Mexico, Native American reservations can lack mortgage access, which may contribute to higher rates of uninsured homes. The county’s median income is also below the state average.

The Oklahoma county with the lowest uninsured home rate, Canadian County, also has the highest median household income. And, even though insurance costs are higher there than in Muskogee County, they account for 5.3% of the median income versus Muskogee’s 6.6%.

10. Texas

Percentage of uninsured homes: 17.7%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $3,610

Median household income: $79,721

In Texas, 44.5% of homeowners don’t have a mortgage — more than the national average. And, though the median household income is higher than in many states on this list, more costly premiums mean insured homeowners pay 4.5% of that income to home insurance.

Since Texas is such a large state, climate risks vary considerably. Galveston County, located southeast of Houston on the Gulf Coast, is the most expensive county in Texas for home insurance due to its hurricane exposure. But, likely due to that risk and its above-average median income, it has one of the lowest uninsured home rates, at 10.7%.

Three Texas counties — Liberty, Hidalgo, and Cameron — are among the 10 counties with the highest uninsured home rates in the country.

In Liberty, northeast of Houston, 45.6% of homes are uninsured — the second-highest percentage nationwide. Climate risks from lightning storms and tornadoes may contribute to the county’s above-average insurance costs. Homeowners with insurance pay 6.7% of the county’s median income of $60,963 to cover premiums, higher than the 4.5% average share that insured homeowners pay statewide.

Arizona’s Navajo County has the highest uninsured home rate in the U.S.

The average rate of uninsured homes in the U.S. is 14.1%, but county-level data shows just how much that percentage can vary based on local factors. Nearly 1 in 7 homes nationwide are uninsured, but in Arizona’s Navajo County, more than half of homes (51%) are uninsured.

Various factors, some similar and some distinct, influence the rate of uninsured homes among the 10 counties with the highest rates.

Almost 66% of Navajo County is reservation land.12 It’s home to the Hopi, Navajo, and Fort Apache reservations. Barriers complicating mortgage access on reservation land likely contribute to its high uninsured home rate. Nearly 74% of homes in Navajo County don’t have a mortgage, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.

Lack of mortgage lender participation and the challenges of mortgaging land held in a federal trust can make lending difficult, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Navajo County’s most significant climate risks are lightning storms and wildfires, according to FEMA. The average home insurance costs in the county are below the state average. Still, a lower median income means insured homeowners are paying a higher share of that income to cover premiums.

Tips: How homeowners can make home insurance more affordable

For homeowners already on tight budgets, home insurance may seem like an obvious line item to cut. But going without it comes with serious risks, especially as severe weather becomes more erratic.

“When budgets are tight, it’s understandable to question whether insurance is really necessary,” said Mallory Mooney, director of sales and service at Insurify. “But even a basic policy can make the difference between a manageable setback and a major financial hardship. The key is finding the right balance between protection and affordability.”

The most straightforward way to lower home insurance costs is to regularly shop around and compare quotes, enabling homeowners to ensure they have the best available deal. Talking to an agent can also help homeowners find the right policy for their needs.

Mooney recommends homeowners start by reviewing their deductible.

“Raising your deductible can lower your premium significantly, as long as you have enough set aside to cover that amount in the event of a loss,” she said. “It’s also important not to cut coverage too deeply. If your policy limits fall far below your home’s rebuild value, you could face unexpected gaps, even with smaller claims.”

Mooney also recommends homeowners take advantage of every available discount and make thoughtful adjustments while trying to avoid risky reductions.

“Remove coverage for items you no longer own, drop riders that no longer apply, and skip add-ons that duplicate benefits you already have elsewhere,” Mooney said. “The goal isn’t a fancy or even generic policy, but the one that gives you meaningful protection at a cost you can sustain. Personalized protection that you can afford keeps you from being one broken pipe or storm away from losing everything.”

Methodology

Insurify analysts used the U.S. Census Bureau 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-Year Estimates, published on Sept. 11, 2025, to determine the rates of uninsured homes. This report defines “uninsured homes” as owner-occupied homes with home insurance costs of less than $100 per year in 2024. The survey notes that the less-than-$100 category may include $0, and some escrowed homeowners may appear as $0.

To determine the rate of uninsured homes, Insurify analysts divided the number of owner-occupied homes with less than $100 in annual home insurance costs by the total number of owner-occupied homes nationwide and by state and county. The ACS 1-Year Estimates include only counties and metro areas with a population of 65,000 or more.

For the lead statistic, Insurify defines “climate-vulnerable states” as the 20 states with the highest national percentile for vulnerability on the U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index, a project from the Environmental Defense Fund, Texas A&M University, and Darkhorse Visualization.

Insurify data scientists turned to their real-time database of insurance quotes from partner carriers, as well as aggregated rate filings from Quadrant Information Services, to determine average home insurance costs.

Unless otherwise stated, home insurance rates in this report represent the average annual cost of an HO-3 insurance policy for homeowners with good credit and zero claims within the past five years, covering a single-family frame house with the following coverage limits: $200,000 to $750,000 dwelling coverage depending on the locality’s typical home value, $25,000 personal property, $30,000 loss of use, $300,000 liability, and a $1,000 deductible. Certain states also include a 2% hail deductible and/or a 5% wind/hurricane deductible.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wyomingnewsnow.tv/content/tncms/custom/image/b2e47b94-535a-11ef-8535-f7e71726e889.png?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-11-13 15:02:45.421015

Leading Light Wind cited “changing regulatory requirements” for their decision to pull the plug on construction. The news comes a week after a Democratic victory in New Jersey, where Governor-elect Sherrill centered on lowering utility costs and directly attacked Trump’s clean energy cuts in her winning campaign.

Donald Trump and Republicans have taken a sledgehammer to clean energy projects across the country while electricity demand skyrockets, jacking up energy costs for Americans. Far from delivering on his campaign promise to cut electricity prices in half, Trump’s own reckless energy policies are causing utility bills to soar, with household electricity prices up 11% under his watch. New Jersey has seen the highest increase in the country, with a 21% spike in electricity prices over the past year.

Climate Power Communications Director Alex Glass issued the following statement:

“New Jersey families have seen their utility bills climb higher and higher each month, and Trump and Republicans are to blame. Their war on clean energy is shuttering projects across the country and taking energy options off the grid, leaving hardworking Americans to pay the price. Trump and Republicans promised to lower costs, but in fact, life has gotten more expensive on their watch and last week, New Jersey voters held them accountable at the ballot box. We’re going to spend every day between now and November 3rd, 2026 making sure Republicans continue to pay the political price for their broken promises.”

Trump’s reckless energy policies are leaving a trail of shuttered projects across the country:

Earlier this week, a solar firm in North Carolina laid off 78% of its workforce after filing for bankruptcy due to renewable energy policy changes under the Trump administration.

QCells, a solar manufacturing plant in Georgia, announced that it would be furloughing 1,000 workers and permanently laying off an additional 300.

In just two months, six clean energy projects were closed in Michigan, including most recently, two electric vehicle battery plants that laid off 324 workers.

Last month, General Motors laid off 1,200 workers at its electric vehicle plant in Detroit, along with hundreds of additional permanent and temporary layoffs at battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

In October, Topsoe cited the repeal of clean energy tax credits as a reason for canceling 150 jobs and a $400 million investment in their Richmond, Virginia facility.

Earlier last month, Fox 2 Detroit reported that over 100 employees at Dana Incorporated, an electric vehicle battery component manufacturer in Auburn Hills, Michigan, had been laid off.

General Motors canceled a $55 million factory that would have created 300 jobs, citing “decisions of the DOE”.

Fortescue blamed U.S. “policy settings” and the elimination of “critical tax credits” in Trump and Republicans’ budget bill for the cancellation of their $210 million Detroit EV battery factory.

Trump used the government shutdown as an opportunity to sow even more chaos and uncertainty for American workers by cancelling $8 billion in investments in states that did not vote for him. The Trump administration has put $24 billion for energy projects on the chopping block since May.

Trump’s federal energy policies contributed to battery startup, Natron Energy, shutting down and canceling its planned $1.4 billion factory in Eastern North Carolina, which would have created 1,000 jobs.",https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Meta-Image_Climate-Power.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 15:01:24.418155

As Straight Arrow News previously reported, experts advise that Americans begin the open enrollment process as soon as possible.
Federal and state governments offer a service that helps Americans navigate the entire open enrollment process.","President Donald Trump signed into law a spending bill on Wednesday, ending the longest federal government shutdown in American history. For weeks, congressional Republicans and Democrats were deadlocked over extending expiring tax credits for more than 20 million people who purchase insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

The shutdown deal does not extend the tax credits. Instead, it calls for a December vote on the issue. The chances of extending the credits seem bleak, given that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not agreed to a vote.

Open enrollment season has begun for most Americans, and many are already facing steep cost increases. Premiums for Americans who receive insurance through their employer will increase by upwards of 7%, a reflection of higher spending on health care.

Meanwhile, premiums for individuals who purchase their insurance through the Affordable Care Act will rise by about 30%, not only due to rising health care spending but also because there are no more federal subsidies for most people.

Given the uncertainty and potential for large cost increases, here is how experts advise Americans to approach this year’s open enrollment.

What are the tax credits?

When the Affordable Care Act was first passed in 2010, it implemented federal subsidies that lowered the price of health insurance for low-income Americans. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 expanded the original subsidies to all Americans regardless of income and eliminated health insurance premiums for the lowest-income households. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended subsidies through 2025.

These provisions will expire in December unless the government votes to further extend them. Democrats and at least two Republican members of Congress have pushed to retain the subsidies, but many Republicans are resisting. Vice President JD Vance has said these credits fuel fraud.

Should Americans wait to purchase coverage?

As Straight Arrow News previously reported, experts advise that Americans begin the open enrollment process as soon as possible. Though chances are low, if Congress does vote to extend the subsidies, consumers can change their plans until Dec. 15 for plans beginning on Jan. 1, 2026.

Federal and state governments offer a service that helps Americans navigate the entire open enrollment process. Experts warn that numerous fraudulent websites offer these services.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-453041979_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 15:01:47.022322

Furthermore, permitting 10% of the carbon dioxide to escape into the environment is no longer tenable, he said.
A lower cost path to near-total capture Economic analyses show that PICC can capture and compress 99% of carbon dioxide emissions for $26 per metric ton.
At that level of capture, even the carbon dioxide from the combustion air is removed, Holtzapple said.
“Without adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, PICC allows us to use abundant fossil fuels on which our civilization is built.","A new, low-cost method for capturing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial facilities relies on a simple physical phenomenon — the same one that causes bubbles to fizz when popping a bottle of Champagne or cracking open a bottle of seltzer.

The process, called Pressure Induced Carbon Capture (PICC), uses water and pressure to pull carbon dioxide out of exhaust gases before it reaches the atmosphere, offering a cleaner and far less expensive alternative to traditional chemical methods.

Co-inventors Dr. Mark Holtzapple, professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&M University, and Jonathan Feinstein of ExcelThermic Enterprises have filed patents for licensing the technology to power plants, hydrogen facilities, cement kilns, steel blast furnaces and other industrial emitters worldwide. Holtzapple said PICC is a practical solution to an urgent problem because fossil fuel combustion — which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere — remains an important component of the global energy mix.

“Our invention is a cost-effective way to address one of the greatest challenges facing humanity,” Holtzapple said. “We can capture carbon dioxide from flue gas using only water and pressure, which makes the process simple, clean and less expensive than competing technologies.”

Traditional carbon capture systems rely on strong chemicals called amines that bind with carbon dioxide to remove it from exhaust gases. Amines struggle to pull more than 90% of the carbon dioxide out of the flue gas, Holtzapple said. Also, the amines are expensive and degrade when exposed to flue gases. Furthermore, permitting 10% of the carbon dioxide to escape into the environment is no longer tenable, he said.

In contrast, PICC uses physical absorption. Because PICC uses no chemical bonds, carbon dioxide pops back out of the water at reduced pressures just as easily as it dissolves in water at high pressure.

“Everybody knows that high-pressure carbon dioxide dissolves in water, and that when you open a bottle of Coca-Cola or beer you see that carbon dioxide bubble back out,” Holtzapple said. Once released, the carbon dioxide can be safely stored or utilized.

How the system works

In operation, flue gas from combusting coal, natural gas or biomass — like forest waste, crop residues or municipal solid waste — is first cooled and compressed. The high-pressure gas is then piped into an absorption column, where cold water flows downward while the gas moves upward through a structured packing that maximizes contact between the two streams. As the nearly clean gas reaches the top of the column, it contacts fresh water entering at the top. There, the last traces of carbon dioxide dissolve into the water, with clean gas releasing into the environment.

The water exiting the bottom of the column contains dissolved carbon dioxide and is transferred to a series of vessels, each operating at lower and lower pressures, where the carbon dioxide progressively bubbles out. Holtzapple said the released carbon dioxide is then ready for compression and injection into underground geological formations, such as saline aquifers, where it is permanently stored.

A lower cost path to near-total capture

Economic analyses show that PICC can capture and compress 99% of carbon dioxide emissions for $26 per metric ton. Other current technologies capture about 90% and cost $50 to $100 per metric ton, Holtzapple said.

Additionally, by adding a small amount of lime — an alkali — to the water, PICC captures 100% of carbon dioxide for an average cost less than $28 per metric ton. At that level of capture, even the carbon dioxide from the combustion air is removed, Holtzapple said.

“Without adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, PICC allows us to use abundant fossil fuels on which our civilization is built. Furthermore, by coupling PICC to biomass combustion, we can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere cost effectively,” he said.",https://stories.tamu.edu/wp-content/themes/aux-wordpress/images/tamu-icons/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-13 14:01:30.817381

Now, the state of Indiana and a major US nuclear company have announced that Indiana will be the preferred location for a new advanced small modular reactor energy park, setting the stage for a nuclear revolution in the United States.

The US is set to become a global leader in sustainable energy technology

For far too long, the United States nuclear sector has lagged behind the rest of the world, with oil and gas dominating the US energy production sector. However, following the recent announcement by First American Nuclear and the state of Indiana that the pair will develop a new advanced modular reactor park in Indiana, the future of the American nuclear sector is looking brighter than ever.

The plan would be for the new energy park to be the first in the United States to be a “closed-fuel cycle” facility, which means that any spent nuclear fuel will be reprocessed and reused on site. Additionally, First American Nuclear will also move its headquarters from Richland, WA, to the great state of Indiana. While the project is expected to pass the legal hurdles in place, no exact timeline or construction costs have been detailed by the company or by the state of Indiana.

The new energy park will focus on gas at first, with nuclear power coming second

The company has noted that the initial plan is for the site to produce gas for the international sector, which has become essential as the sanctions on Russian energy resources come into effect. After that, the co-located facility will process nuclear power using some of the same infrastructure, including grid connections.

“Our unique integrated gas and nuclear solution for quick deployment starts with gas then transitions to nuclear using the same systems bringing power to customers in 24-36 months.” – First American Nuclear press release

The state of Indiana is set to become the spiritual home of the US nuclear energy sector

First American Nuclear has stated that the planned process they will use at the new Indiana energy park eliminates 97% of long-lasting nuclear waste produced on site, a major problem that has plagued nuclear operations for decades. The 240 MWe EAGL-1 reactor is specifically designed to produce more fuel than it burns on an average day.

“Indiana and First American Nuclear joining forces to improve the quality of life for Hoosiers and the American people was an easy decision to make. FANCO has the ability to deliver affordable, sustainable power to light up our rooms, keep us warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and rise to the ever-increasing energy demands of an advanced manufacturing and computing economy.” – Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources

Other nations have also been experiencing significant progress in their nuclear energy ambitions, with the UAE’s first-ever nuclear facility reaching a milestone recently.

At least 36 states do not disclose the recipients of data center incentives, according to a new report from Good Jobs First. Statelines’ Kevin Hardy reports on why transparency is crucial when taxpayer dollars flow to these costly projects:

“Only when governments disclose information on which companies get public money and what they do with it can there be meaningful analysis, greater public participation, and wiser use of public financial resources,” the report says. Good Jobs First specifically examined sales and use tax exemptions that benefit data centers. The study does not account for local property tax abatements, corporate income tax credits and discounts on electricity and water rates.

Government shutdown ends

The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history ended late Wednesday when President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill. The move came after the House advanced a Senate-backed spending measure earlier in the day. The Washington Post’s team reports:

The deal will fund the government through Jan. 30, pass three appropriations bills, reverse more than 4,000 federal layoffs the Trump administration attempted to implement earlier in the shutdown and prevent future layoffs through the end of January. It will appropriate funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps, through September 2026. … It will provide backpay to 650,000 federal workers who have been furloughed since Oct. 1 and an additional 600,000 who have been forced to continue working without pay.

The New York Times’ Karoun Demirjian and Eileen Sullivan report on how long it will take the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and other federal programs, to return to normal:

Though the Trump administration fought efforts to force them to use contingency funds to pay out benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, during the shutdown, a spokeswoman for the White House’s budget office insisted this week that beneficiaries will see their accounts fully restored within hours of the federal government reopening.

States, such as Louisiana, that have administered partial SNAP benefits could run into technical issues when administering the remaining amount.

Louisiana’s infrastructure woes

Louisiana continues to suffer from poor infrastructure due to a trifecta of age, extreme weather and inadequate funding. That’s according to a new report from the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Times-Picayune | Baton Rouge Advocate’s David J. Mitchell reports:

The overall “C-” represents a slight improvement from what the society concluded in its 2017 analysis, but the group said the 2025 grade still means “Louisiana’s built environment is not keeping pace,” as infrastructure continues to age and is affected “by limited resources and increasingly frequent severe weather events.” The national average was a “C.” The society noted that the state has experienced 36 extreme weather events over the past decade that resulted in $200 billion in damages statewide.

While Louisiana’s overall infrastructure received a “C-,” the state’s roads and bridges received “D” and “D+” grades, respectively. Funding issues contribute heavily to this dismal score:

But the society pointed out that Louisiana roads and bridges still have a $33 billion maintenance and capital improvement backlog combined, a rising figure affected not only by continuing demands but also by inflated material and other costs over the past several years. … Louisiana highways and bridges rely on a 20-cent-per-gallon state sales tax that has lost two-thirds of its purchasing power since it was last raised in the late 1980s. The state road tax has seen total revenues decline due to greater gasoline engine efficiency and electric vehicles.

Don’t use TANF funds to plug budget holes

The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides states with federal dollars that are supposed to be used, in large part, to provide basic cash assistance for low-income families with children. But far too often states divert these dollars to other, unrelated priorities. A new blog from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explains why some states, such as Kentucky and South Dakota, are being tempted to use TANF dollars to plug budget holes:

Fiscal pressures on states have been growing in recent years, often because of state-enacted tax cuts. This pressure is predicted to get worse due to the harmful Republican megabill drastically cutting food assistance through SNAP and health coverage through Medicaid. The cost implications of the megabill will intensify over the next two to three years, creating enormous pressure for states to fill in gaps of support that many families with low incomes depend on to meet basic needs.

CBPP’s team explains why this is a bad idea:

Cutting a vital income source like TANF makes it harder for families to meet their children’s basic needs — such as food, housing, and medical care — which are often the factors considered in child neglect cases. … With fewer resources, families are forced to make impossible choices: paying the rent or buying groceries, buying their kids’ school supplies, or keeping the lights on. Cuts to already low TANF benefits deepen hardship and undermine parents’ ability to care for their children at home.

These percentages offer only a limited insight into the current state of the electric car market, leaving several questions unanswered. Read on to better understand what's happening in the EV market.

What percentage of electric cars are on U.S. roads?

2024, 9.2% of new car registrations were for electric vehicles, according to an Experian Automotive report. This is an increase of 1.2 percentage points from 2023. If we fly higher to a bird’s eye view of the roughly 292.3 million cars on the road in 2024, 1.4% of those were electric vehicles.

What is each company's EV market share?

Here are the latest EV market share percentages, from 2024 and through February 2025, according to Edmunds data. Tesla has enjoyed a comfortable lead with the highest market share over the past five years. In recent years, however, Tesla's market share has dwindled from nearly 80% in 2019 to 45.2% in February 2025 as other automakers entered the playing field and introduced more rivals for customers to choose from. Ford maintains a distant second place in market share (7%), while Chevrolet (5.5%) is in third but has made significant progress in just a few years. Volkswagen (4.2%) and Hyundai (3.8%) round out the top five currently, but these automakers could easily switch places as the year goes on.

What are the best-selling electric cars in the U.S. by percentage?

Although Tesla's market share has been falling, the electric carmaker still dominates the market. According to Experian Automotive, the Tesla Model Y was the best-selling electric car in the fourth quarter of 2024, making up 26.1% of new EVs sold. The Model 3 was second with 15%. The Honda Prologue came in third with 5.3%, and the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Ford Mustang Mach-E held fourth and fifth place with 4.7% and 4.4% market share, respectively.

With world leaders gathered on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon to spur action on climate change, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has released its annual World Energy Outlook, the “most authoritative source of global energy analysis.” The outlook explores how the global energy system could evolve through scenarios with different assumptions about government policies, technology costs, and climate targets. The range of scenarios has never been wider — reflecting ongoing shifts in the global energy transition — but only the net-zero scenario achieves the broadest benefits.

Given the breadth of possibilities, many are asking which scenario represents the most likely future. Some think it is the new Current Policies Scenario (CPS), despite its lack of policy improvement “even when governments have indicated their intention to do so.” Others continue to focus on the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), a “dynamic reading of today’s policy settings.”

However, IEA is clear that no scenario is a forecast; none should be assumed to foretell the future. Instead, it is crucial to compare these scenarios to recent trends on the ground, where progress has outpaced expectations — with vast potential to accelerate. Here are five charts and takeaways along those lines.

1. Cleantech has often outperformed “current policy” outlooks

To evaluate these scenarios, it is helpful to assess how past versions have performed against recent reality. In the case of solar power, wind power, and EVs, deployment has been up to two to three times faster than the previous CPS had projected in 2019. That year’s STEPS wasn’t much closer.

Other metrics are mixed; coal demand and its emissions were still rising until a recent plateau. But it’s clear that for fast-improving clean energy technologies, progress has greatly outpaced scenarios tied to “current” or “stated” policies.

This makes sense given how the scenarios are designed. According to the IEA, the CPS expects constraints that lead it to “project slower adoption of new technologies than has been seen in recent years.” This year’s CPS is similar, assuming a lack of policy implementation such as the planned emissions trading schemes in India, Turkey, and Brazil. Treating this as a “business-as-usual” forecast would ignore the history of clean energy progress.

2. The world continues to be off track for net zero

On the other hand, progress has not nearly been fast enough for IEA’s Net Zero Energy (NZE) scenario, a world that reduces CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050. In recent years, emissions have continued or increased across CO2, methane, and other key climate pollutants — a far cry from the latest NZE scenario, which requires a 2x decline for CO2 and a 5x drop in energy-related methane by 2035.

The reasons are many, but a major one is the lack of progress on energy efficiency. Feasible efficiency improvements across the system could save trillions while accelerating the pace of the energy transition by a decade or more. As a result, more than 130 countries pledged in 2023 to double the rate of annual efficiency improvements, from the 2 percent baseline in 2022 to 4 percent every year as in the NZE scenario. But rather than doubling, annual improvements have fallen below that baseline, putting those savings further out of reach.

At the same time, baseline electricity access remains a consistent issue. While the original NZE scenario in 2021 trended toward universal electricity access by 2030, the number of people without electricity has remained above 700 million ever since. Falling behind that scenario imperils far more than emissions progress; it hinders prosperity for communities around the world.

3. Still, some technologies are accelerating ahead of net-zero trajectories

However, not all metrics are behind pace. Compared to previous Net Zero Energy scenarios, solar and battery deployment are actually running ahead of schedule, although other assessments may differ in methodology.

Both metrics have roughly reached the original net-zero scenario’s 2030 deployment rate already, in 2025 — and although this rate stagnates under the newest “current” or “stated” policy scenarios, history shows a different story. If manufacturing can continue to outpace expectations, while confronting crucial challenges from concentrated supply chains, these positive trends could continue.

4. Overperformance in some areas can reduce the strain on others

In theory, these success stories can reduce the scale-up requirements for more nascent solutions, as in the case of carbon capture and storage (CCS). As the potential for renewable electricity deployment rises in each net-zero scenario, the need for CCS in the power sector has usually fallen slightly. Achieving this shift requires many enabling conditions, from grid deployment to the full portfolios required for reliability, but the trend is moving in a positive direction.

IEA and RMI both recognize that carbon removal will be required in the long term to alleviate the carbon already in the atmosphere, but neither it nor point source carbon capture is needed where clean energy alternatives exist. If less CCS is required for electricity, it can focus on areas that are harder to solve, scaling at a more reasonable rate.

5. We can benefit people’s lives by securing a clean energy future

Above all, it’s important to remember why these trends matter for people around the world. As UN leader Simon Stiell has said, humanity can only win this fight “if we connect stronger climate action to people’s top priorities in their daily lives.”

At RMI, the key is transforming the global energy system to secure a clean, prosperous, future for all. Each of those words matters, and each has a corollary in IEA’s data that shows a drastic difference between the new scenarios in 2035 alone.

For the three in four people who live in fossil fuel importing countries, a path with more domestic renewables means that fossil fuel import costs could be two-thirds less than today’s. A clean future would mean less than half as many deaths from air pollution, along with three to five times the job growth for a more prosperous energy sector. Climate pollution could be halved, on the way to net zero by 2050, and electricity access could still be achieved for all.

With these far-reaching data points, the choice is clear. If we treat IEA’s scenarios not as forecasts but as futures to compare, we can learn from their findings and chart a path to reach the broadest benefits.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-1561104545-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 15:01:00.254811

DRRS Plus is a capacity market.
ERCOT wants to carve out a more than $4 billion capacity market to give more money to thermal resources at a time when thermal resources are doing quite well.
When the Legislature passed it, DRRS was not intended to be the vehicle to establish a capacity market in Texas; to the contrary, it was meant to be a tool that would help increase reliability and deal with uncertainty as an alternative to a capacity market.
DRRS should be implemented as it was intended – as another operational reserve, not as a capacity market.","The Texas energy market is in a massive boom cycle right now. Electric consumption is up 25% in four years. There are 48 gigawatts of gas plants in the interconnection queue, up from just 16 gigawatts in May 2024.

There are over 400 gigawatts of total generation and over 200 gigawatts of large load waiting for interconnection. Planned investment in the grid is at an all time high.

Which makes the timing of ERCOT’s DRRS Plus proposal curious. DRRS Plus is a capacity market. It looks very similar to the ill-fated Performance Credit Mechanism. It’s expensive and likely unnecessary when compared to the other things we could be doing.

ERCOT wants to carve out a more than $4 billion capacity market to give more money to thermal resources at a time when thermal resources are doing quite well. Here’s a look at the stocks of the two biggest thermal generators in Texas:

Looking to protect consumers, in 2023, the legislature put a gross cap of $1 billion on the controversial Performance Credit Mechanism. This DRRS Plus proposal looks very similar and would cost more than $4 billion.

ERCOT leadership is doing a very human thing: they’re looking for the one solution that will make our grid bullet-proof. But the models Aurora Energy Research ran for ERCOT show that there would still be outages if DRRS Plus is put into place.

There’s no silver bullet, only silver buckshot. ERCOT and the PUC – the PUC will be the decision maker unless the Legislature decides to intervene – should implement DRRS as it was intended: as an operational reserve which will be one tool among many in the toolbox.

When the Legislature passed it, DRRS was not intended to be the vehicle to establish a capacity market in Texas; to the contrary, it was meant to be a tool that would help increase reliability and deal with uncertainty as an alternative to a capacity market.

Interestingly, according to Aurora’s model if there was a silver bullet – and there isn’t – it’s data centers. They show that outages – in both summer and winter – fall to zero under a large load growth scenario if 60% of data centers are flexible.

Of course, data center load may not reach the requisite scale (22 gigawatts) by the end of 2030. It’s also possible – with the right regulations – that a much higher percentage of data centers will be flexible with a combination of onsite resources, flexibility of demand, and the purchase of demand reductions from residential and small commercial customers. With the potential to participate in demand side markets for energy efficiency and demand response, all data centers could be flexible or purchase flexibility, meaning we would need only 13 gigawatts of data centers to get to “0.0” “max load shed” by 2030, according to the models run for ERCOT.

Texas regulators, policymakers, and ERCOT will have to do many things right. We’ll need strong, clear, and consistent requirements for data centers to bring flexibility – from whatever source – but we’ll also need to speed their interconnection, an area where ERCOT lags.

We’ll need robust demand response from big and small customers alike, clean firm resources like nuclear and geothermal, more renewables and battery storage, more gas peakers, and – perhaps most importantly of all given the impact on winter reliability – energy efficiency. In fact, though it isn’t even mentioned in the 100+ slides of Aurora’s presentation, a report Aurora released only six months ago found that “in a winter storm, heat pump adoption can lower load and prevent load shed.”

DRRS Plus is another distraction (like the PCM was) and would likely set up an epic battle between the PUC and the Senate (like the PCM did) if the PUC goes down this path.

Last week, energy affordability took center stage in elections in Georgia, Virginia, and New Jersey. Consumers are angry about high energy costs.

Texas should prioritize actions that increase reliability and reduce costs. If we exhaust actions that achieve both goals, then, and only then, should we look to artificially increase costs, as DRRS Plus would do. But we are nowhere near that point now.

At a time when Texas is attracting investments in generating resources at a scale other states and regions can only dream of, it would be a mistake to throw more money at generators at the expense of consumers. DRRS should be implemented as it was intended – as another operational reserve, not as a capacity market.

The PUC and ERCOT need to prioritize solutions that strengthen the grid and ensure that Texans can actually afford to pay for power.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Kf!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7ab7a9-cfdd-4b55-9f5e-0cd7bcb0f66a_1600x966.png",N,,2025-11-13 14:01:01.703806

The proposed bid by BCP to purchase the gas utility is part of a larger national trend in which private equity firms are seeking to buy utility companies. This includes another much larger acquisition attempt in New Mexico, that one by Blackstone to buy Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), the state’s largest electric utility company.

The BCP acquisition would place NMGC under the ownership of Saturn Utilities Holdco, LLC (Saturn), a subsidiary of BCP, which is based in Louisiana. As a private company, BCP is not subject to the same legal and financial transparency as NMGC’s current owner, the publicly traded energy holding company Emera. The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (PRC) must approve the transaction.

Testimony: Bernhard Capital Partners’ ownership of Louisiana water utility included sludge buildup, bloodworms

Advocates and customers have raised concerns about what they say is BCP’s problematic and limited track record of utility ownership.

New Energy Economy (NEE), a New Mexico climate advocacy group opposing the BCP acquisition, drew attention to National Water Infrastructure (NWI), a small Louisiana water utility which BCP has owned since 2020.

Since then, NWI has been subject to an enforcement action resulting in a settlement with Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality (LA DEQ).

NEE’s witness, Louisiana-based attorney Jesse George, testified that the LA DEQ settlement and numerous other non-compliance matters at NWI are evidence of BCP’s business track record of exposing its utility customers to harm and its inexperience in operating utilities. The LA DEQ cited NWI under BCP’s leadership for failing to operate and maintain the treatment facility properly. LA DEQ’s inspection found a build-up of solids in the treatment equipment, close to the surface of the wastewater. Further, the inspection revealed a large amount of sludge build-up, with bloodworms observed throughout the sludge – indicative of stagnant water containing organic matter often associated with sanitary waste.

BCP denied committing any violations, but agreed to pay the LA DEQ a total of $12,817.75 in settlement costs. George’s testimony noted that NWI is a significantly smaller utility than NMGC, with 23,000 customers compared to NMGC’s 556,000. George stated, “The Joint Applicants have not attempted to minimize the risks posed by their ownership and lack of regulated gas utility experience by offering customer protections, like automatic penalties or performance failures. I don’t see any financial insulation for customers if performance declines. Or if reliability declines.”

George testified that BCP’s track record at NWI was important evidence for the PRC to consider as it applied its six-factor test to evaluate whether the transaction “satisfies the public interest,” as required under New Mexico law. Those factors include “Whether [the transaction] provides benefits to utility customers,” “Whether the quality of service will be diminished,” “Careful verification of the qualifications and financial health of the new owner,” and “Adequacy of protections against harm to customers.”

But at the request of BCP, the NM PRC Hearing Examiners ruled to deny an exhibit of George’s testimony, in addition to denying his qualifications as an expert witness, instead granting his testimony in part as a lay witness.

During a public comment hearing, the majority of comments came from NMGC customers in opposition to the purchase. Many cited BCP’s lack of experience and past mishaps running NWI among their concerns.

BCP donated to decision makers on previous bid for Entergy’s Louisiana gas system

Though BCP is new to gas utility management, NMGC would not be the firm’s first gas utility acquisition. Earlier this year, through its subsidiary – Delta Utilities – BCP received final approval from the New Orleans City Council to purchase Entergy’s Louisiana and New Orleans gas systems, following unanimous approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission last year. The sale did not receive a full hearing before the council, but nearly a dozen people and organizations provided comments while approximately 80 people submitted comments online, all of which were in opposition.

BCP and its executives donated to all five of the Louisiana Public Service Commissioners over the seven years prior to gaining approval of the acquisition, according to the investigative newsroom Floodlight. $149,000 of the total $200,000 in contributions went to Commissioner Craig Greene, whose district covered Entergy Louisiana’s gas service territory. Delta Utilities – backed by BCP – purchased Entergy’s gas systems for $484 million in July 2025, acquiring 200,000 customers. The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the purchase by a 5-0 vote. Greene told Floodlight before the vote that the contributions from BCP did not affect his decision. After the vote, Greene announced he would return the donations he reported receiving from BCP that year, totaling $36,500.

The company also purchased CenterPoint’s gas systems in Louisiana and Mississippi, which serve 380,000 customers for $1.2 billion. The deal was closed in July of this year.

BCP founder formed private equity firm after selling firm that mismanaged multiple costly projects

BCP’s troubles in managing NWI are not the company founder’s first brush with mismanagement. BCP’s founder, James Bernhard Jr., formed the private equity firm Bernhard Capital Partners in 2013, following the sale of an engineering, construction, and industrial firm, The Shaw Group. Shaw was involved in several business fiascoes under Bernhard Jr.’s leadership.

After Hurricane Katrina, FEMA awarded Shaw and three other companies no-bid housing contracts of up to $100 million each to support recovery efforts in the disaster-stricken area in 2005. In the proceeding backlash, with many concerned that the Bush administration was not doing enough to respond post-hurricane, FEMA pledged to rebid the contracts. Years later, audits revealed that the contract recipients, including Shaw, wasted tens of millions of dollars across those deals. In addition, after the BP oil spill along the Gulf of Mexico in 2011, the state legislative auditor found that Shaw may have overbilled the state of Louisiana by nearly $500,000 for costs of building sand berms to block oil from washing ashore.

Shaw, led by Bernhard Jr., was the main subcontractor to Westinghouse Electric Company for construction of the Vogtle nuclear power plant in 2012. The project stalled for years, resulting in cost overruns estimated at $13 billion, and ultimately led to a bankruptcy filing by Westinghouse. By the end of 2012, Bernhard Jr. sold The Shaw Group for $3 billion.

Other BCP executives have a history of cost overruns and overpromises on project deliverables in the energy sector. BCP executive, and Saturn Holdco President Jeffrey Baudier was the former CEO of Petra Nova LLC, an NRG company capturing carbon dioxide from one of four coal units at W.A Parish Generating Station near Houston, Texas. The carbon capture project stopped operating in 2020, signaling a major setback for proponents of coal carbon capture. The $1 billion project, including $195 million of public funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), claimed to reduce emissions by 90%. However, a report submitted to DOE found Petra Nova was capturing only 7% of the coal plant’s carbon dioxide, according to EPA data.

NM PRC staff recommend substantial changes to the application for approval

NM PRC staff found that, as proposed by NMGC and Saturn, the transaction provides “no long-term tangible direct benefit to NMGC’s customers. Staff recommended the inclusion of substantive financial long-term commitments that directly benefit customers, a further commitment to addressing safety issues and staffing, and specific cost allocation to mitigate future rate increases, including the non-recovery of costs associated with the acquisition. The staff’s position is that the transaction should only be approved if BCP agrees to enact those changes. Staff member Naomi Velasquez notes that “this transaction is, at best, one denoted by status quo with benefits to NMGC and its ratepayers being nebulous under the most optimistic of scenarios.”

Proposed transaction draws concern over state’s climate commitments

Many opponents to Entergy’s sale of its Louisiana gas system to BCP’s Delta Utilities voiced concerns over Delta Utilities’ plans to make additional investments in gas infrastructure, which they believe would hinder greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. Similar opposition is growing in New Mexico. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an executive order in 2019 committing New Mexico to reduce GHG emissions by at least 45% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.

Another New Mexico clean energy advocate, the Coalition for Clean Affordable Energy, testified that the building of any new data centers powered by gas in New Mexico does not align with the state’s climate commitment. BCP CEO Jeff Jenkins said in an interview that BCP sees a “generational investment opportunity” in providing power to the nation’s growing number of data centers.

Private equity acquisitions carry high stakes for captive customers

Private equity interest in utilities is on the rise, largely focused so far on utilities poised for major infrastructure buildout to accommodate projected load growth from artificial intelligence and data centers. The value proposition comes when utilities make capital expenditures – they recoup from their captive customers the costs of qualifying projects plus an additional profit margin.

Additionally, the moves to own utilities come after many of the same private equity firms have built up robust portfolios of large power users – and look to add data centers to the mix. Given the expansiveness of private equity holdings, potential conflicts of interest loom large. For example, a firm that owns a utility might also hold a stake in a large industrial customer of that utility. In that scenario, the private equity firm could have an interest in keeping rates low for the industrial customer – potentially at the expense of captive residential and small business customers.

Such concerns over customer impacts were prominent in BlackRock’s recent bid to take over Allete, whose largest subsidiary Minnesota Power serves electricity to the northeastern corner of the state, an area that includes a potential new data center. Minnesota utility regulators signed off on the contentious deal in October over the objections of consumer advocates and an administrative law judge who warned that the multitrillion-dollar firm’s aggressive pursuit of profits could stick captive utility customers with higher costs. Supporters of the deal mostly included organizations and individuals with financial ties to the utility.

Shortly before Minnesota regulators signed off on the Allete transaction, news broke that BlackRock is also targeting Virginia-based AES, a substantially larger energy company that operates electric utilities in Indiana and Ohio while also providing renewable power to large tech companies – including ones looking to expand their data center portfolios. When deal rumors came to light, again prompting concerns from consumer advocates, AES was valued around $38 billion. Around the same time, reports surfaced that BlackRock was planning to buy Aligned Data Centers – a developer worth as much as $40 billion.

While the flurry of private equity interest lately is new, investment firms’ snapping up utilities is not entirely unprecedented. Consumer advocates in the Minnesota proceeding pointed to an earlier example of a utility take-private deal that did not turn out well for customers. Michigan’s Upper Peninsula Power Company, known as UPPCO, was sold to a private equity firm in 2014 and since then has seen a series of successive rate hikes and a sale to another private equity firm. Its customers now pay rates 9 cents higher per kilowatt than the state average, as cited in the Minnesota proceeding.

“A utility is not like a Burger King”

During an evidentiary hearing on November 4, the NM PRC hosted on the acquisition of NMGC on Nov. 4, Saturn Holdco President Jeffrey Baudier was cross-examined by Commissioners and intervening parties in the docket. When questioned about his testimony regarding the acquisition premium, an intervenor asked Baudier to explain his position on the staff’s recommendation that NMGC establish a regulatory liability equal to the goodwill or acquisition premium resulting from the transaction, or $100 million. In his written testimony, Baudier claims the staff proposal is based on “the flawed premise that the acquisition premium is due solely to the government monopoly granted to the utility and that the amount over the book value of the utility should be given to customers.” During the hearing, Baudier goes on to say, “That would be the legal equivalent of me going to Burger King and buying a hamburger and saying, ‘I own part of Burger King because I paid for the hamburger.’”

Later, Commission Chair Gabriel Aguilera addressed Baudier’s comment, saying the analogy “completely misses the mark.” Chair Aguilera stated, “Burger King operates in a competitive environment, and the Gas Company is a natural monopoly. I heard you explain your view on the regulatory compact. Nothing like that exists for Burger King, but it does exist for the Company that you are seeking to purchase.”

30%: Toyota Will Sink $10 Billion Into U.S. Manufacturing

Photo by: Toyota

Toyota is investing a whopping $10 billion into its U.S. manufacturing footprint. The automaker announced its investment into ""future mobility efforts"" as it celebrated the opening of its new battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina.

And, sure, while popular U.S.-market models like the Camry, Corolla Cross and RAV4 hybrids will all benefit from the battery factory, there's another more subtle reason for the investment. No, it's not the unannounced electrified three-row that Toyota still plans to pencil into its lineup (although I guess that technically is part of it)—it's that Toyota's investment could turn the U.S. into a manufacturing hub for its market back home.

Automotive News explains:

Late last month during a visit to a U.S. naval base in Japan, President Donald Trump said that Toyota was preparing to invest $10 billion to build “auto plants all over” the United States.

At the Japan Mobility Show, which coincided with Trump’s remarks, a Toyota Motor Corp. spokesperson said Chairman Akio Toyoda met Trump at a dinner for business leaders. However, the spokesperson said Trump and Toyoda talked only general economic and industry topics, not specifics about investing in the U.S.

Toyota did say at the time that it “plans to export its U.S.-made vehicles to Japan and open its distribution platform in Japan to U.S. automakers, as a result of Japan’s commitment to accept for sale in Japan U.S. manufactured and U.S. safety-certified vehicles without additional testing.”

What Toyota hasn't said is what projects it plans to use that $10 billion for, or what models are on its export radar. Toyota's lineup does have some overlap in both markets—think the bZ, Corolla, Crown, Highlander, Prius, Rav4 and a few other models. Given that the automaker has been committed to its ""multi-pathway"" approach to electrification, it could be anything from a new BEV, to a hybrid or even a full on gas car. Given that Japan's consumption of BEVs is relatively low compared to other heavy car markets, it might be a fair assumption

It's worth calling out that Toyota's battery plant is absolutely massive. Its 14 production lines will pump out batteries for mild and plug-in hybrids, as well as the mysterious unnamed BEV. All of them will be getting Liberty-grade electrons. But it gives a glimpse into Toyota doing electrification its way: slow and steady.

60%: Xiaomi Wait Times Plummet—But It's Not Why You Think

Photo by: Motor1.com

Suspicions have been mounting after wait times for the Xiaomi SU7's electric sedan dropped from 30 weeks down to just 6. The reason? Well, no official answer exists, however, speculation from analysts is that Xiaomi is good at scaling production. Really good.

New reporting from CNEV Post of a note from Goldman Sachs flagged the automaker's recent efforts to bolster production as the reason for an 80% reduction in delivery time. Their logic is that that factory has finally just caught up the demand (mostly) as the brand is committed to making sure that as many cars hit the road this year as possible.

CNEV Post tells us the forecast from Goldman Sachs:

""We believe the shortened waiting time for SU7 Pro/Max demonstrates Xiaomi's consistent execution in ramping up manufacturing capabilities, and echoes our earlier view that the tax subsidies announced on Oct 24 reflect Xiaomi's confidence in manufacturing capacity ramp-up,"" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Timothy Zhao's team in a research note yesterday.

The team noted that SU7 new order volume has been softening recently which helps digest the order backlog, and expected Xiaomi's capacity expansion plans to achieve further official progress in the coming months.

With a 6 week wait, the backlog clearly hasn't let up entirely. But it's important to recognize that production capacity is finally starting to get to a point that makes China's Xiaomi-crazed market tenable.

Xiaomi said earlier this year that it was planning to double its output of SU7s in 2025—it sold 135,000 last year. Xiaomi is estimated to have delivered more than 100,000 vehicles in Q3, bringing its total annual sales to more than 257,000 units. Earlier this year, the rapid growth and sales success led Xiaomi's CEO Lei Jun to raise its delivery target to between 300,000 and 350,000 vehicles, or over 250% of its 2024 EV sales figure.

Meanwhile, the automaker surpassed Tesla in sales volume in China last month and is eyeing up expansion into global markets. If this trend (and demand) continues, Xiaomi's automotive unit could be headed for profitability earlier than anybody expected.

90%: Rivian's Partnership With VW Could Extend To Gas Cars

Photo by: InsideEVs

Volkswagen has spent the last half-decade wrestling with software problems a la its Cariad spin-off. But now, the Germans have a renewed lift into what makes a car's software good—and you can thank Rivian for that.

Rivian entered the chat bringing with a modern, cohesive vehicle architecture that powers its own cars. But CEO RJ Scaringe has another agenda that could make it billions. By becoming a whitebox manufacturer, the startup knows that it could make the software underpinnings for the entire industry. And with VW's funding, it might be able to do exactly that.

VW announced last year that it would inject a whopping $5.8 billion into a partnership in order to lean on Rivian's Software-Defined Vehicle platform. The effort was launched as an EV-first venture, but it's been quietly mutating into something bigger. Maybe much bigger.

Reuters reports on recent statements from the joint venture that hints at what could be coming:

The German automaker is counting on its partnership with Rivian to accelerate development of a scalable, next-generation vehicle platform and close the gap with rivals like Tesla and Chinese rivals.

""For sure, it is an extremely capable architecture and we could allow for future use to also use it for ICE, but as we already outlined our clear focus is on BEV implementation and whatever comes after that is to be decided at a later stage,"" Carsten Helbing, co-CEO of the joint venture RV Tech, said.

[...]

“The architecture is highly capable of also driving additional drivetrain configurations. So we do not see a huge issue there, but of course it’s additional work on the component side and on the platform side,"" Helbing told Reuters.

In case it wasn't obvious, the JV's words mean VW's next-gen combustion cars could eventually end up on the same underlying software architecture that its EVs will ride on.

The first car launching with the joint venture's software is the Volkswagen ID.Every1 (don't worry, that's not its final name). That rollout begins in 2027, but the juicy bit is what comes next. First are other EVs built on its Scalable Systems Platform, but maybe—just maybe—ICE cars could follow.

100%: Should Tesla Get Into The White-Lable game?

Photo by: Tesla

With Rivian and Lucid both aiming to be the suppliers supplying the electrified automotive industry, it's almost a surprise that Tesla—the OG in the EV game—hasn't gone down the same road. Now, sure, it's open-sourced the NACS standard so other automakers can make use of its Supercharging network and has talked about licensing its Full Self-Driving software to other automakers, but that's the extent of what we've seen so far.

Tesla happens to be extremely good at software. In fact, one of the hardest things about shopping around for another EV and leaving the Tesla ecosystem is deciding just where you want to compromise in the software world. Is it partial autonomy? An app that just works? An intuitive, quick UI? No other automaker has seemed to nail EV software quite like Tesla.

That being said, is Tesla missing out here? And would other automakers benefit from this? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/7Z28zq/s1/toyota-corolla-cm.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 14:02:51.267636

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday granted Texas permission to authorize companies to capture and store carbon dioxide underground, fulfilling a key wish for the state’s oil and gas industry.

The approval comes after a two-year federal review of the Railroad Commission of Texas, the agency regulating oil and gas. The agency needed to prove it could enforce federal rules, a requirement that supporters of the effort said it could do better than the EPA. Critics have said that state regulators have a history of being too lax on the oil and gas industry.

In a statement, the Texas Oil and Gas Association, which represents the industry’s political interests, lauded the approval.

“Today’s approval is a watershed moment that launches the next chapter of Texas energy leadership,” said Todd Staples, the association’s president. “Texas is now poised to lead the world in (carbon capture and sequestration), which means more investment and more jobs for Texans.”

There are more than 60 pending applications for carbon dioxide injection wells before the EPA. It’s unclear whether the EPA or the Railroad Commission will review those applications.

Carbon capture and sequestration is the process of trapping carbon dioxide molecules, which contribute most to climate change. Oil companies ordinarily retrofit their field equipment, such as pipes, with technology to prevent gas leaks. The technology has been around for decades.

But in recent years, oil companies in Texas began building facilities dedicated solely to absorbing ambient carbon dioxide, known as direct air capture facilities. Inspiring this effort were generous tax credits offered under President Joe Biden, which continue under his successor, President Donald Trump.

Oil companies capturing the gas had nowhere to put it. The permit required to store it underground, known as a Class VI permit, is notoriously hard to obtain, with yearslong review periods. Advocates of the oil and gas industry said the lengthy review kept oil companies from expanding their efforts, which they say are aimed at combating climate change. Some scientists researching carbon capture and sequestration said the Permian Basin, the oil-rich desert in West Texas, has the right geology for permanently injecting carbon.

Industry observers are skeptical. State regulators, eager to take over the permitting process, could rubber-stamp permits much more quickly, said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, an oil and gas watchdog group. Palacios added that the commission has not set a strong example with saltwater disposal wells, built to store industry wastewater underground, some of which have ruptured through abandoned wells, sending torrents of water above ground.

“The Railroad Commission is getting this new authority that is just another form of injection in overpressured formations,” Palacios said. “We’re looking at an agency that handles bad actor companies with kid gloves.”

In a news release, an agency commissioner said in matters of oil and gas, the state is best positioned to make decisions.

“Obtaining Class VI primacy marks an important step forward for our state’s energy sector and our citizens by recognizing the Railroad Commission’s unmatched expertise when it comes to matters of energy production, geological knowledge, and safety,” said Railroad Commission of Texas Chairman Jim Wright.

NYCHA has 177,569 apartments in 2,411 buildings across 335 conventional public housing and PACT developments.","Copper to Develop New Class of Induction Stoves and Produce 10,000 Units

New York City, N.Y.— The New York Power Authority (NYPA), the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), and the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) today announced that the next phase of the Induction Stove Challenge is moving forward following a contract signing with Copper, an appliance manufacturer, as part of a $32 million commitment to develop, pilot and produce 10,000 new energy-efficient induction stoves for use in New York City public housing facilities. The competitive innovation challenge—spearheaded by NYPA, NYCHA and NYSERDA—seeks to replace existing gas stoves to improve air quality in apartments, eliminate service outages and avoid costly gas infrastructure and electrical upgrades in NYCHA buildings. The initiative aims to develop a new class of induction stoves that can be installed in older buildings using standard 120-volt, 20-amp outlets.

Copper will design and produce 100 units for performance evaluation during the challenge’s pilot phase. In July 2024, the NYPA Board of Trustees approved $32 million in short-term financing for the project based on NYCHA’s $30.8 million commitment to purchase additional stoves if the pilot is successful. The product development and pilot phase, supported by $1.2 million in NYSERDA funding, will kick off this month.

The prototype units will be installed in 100 NYCHA apartments—with new cookware provided to each participating household—with the intent of eliminating service outages due to deteriorating gas plumbing, and providing best-in-class, comfortable cooking as well as health and quality of life benefits to NYCHA residents. Copper will work with industry testing and safety standards organizations, such as Underwriter Laboratories, to achieve certification for novel technologies prior to the pilot phase.

Successful testing of the developed product will trigger a large-scale purchase order of up to 10,000 units from NYCHA. The effort will demonstrate to building owners the promise of an affordable conversion to efficient induction cooking, and to manufacturers regarding the potential of a broader residential market for the new induction stove products. This purchase will support dozens of NYCHA buildings, eliminating the need for costly capital investments in gas plumbing infrastructure, and fully electrifying their energy systems and displacing fossil fuel use.

To ensure that the new induction stoves can serve a large, national market, NYSERDA is engaging other states, municipalities and housing providers across North America to generate interest in the results of the challenge. In this way, the challenge will create a pipeline of potential demand from others pursuing cooking electrification, aligning NYCHA’s product specifications with the needs of the broader market. Twelve organizations representing more than 300,000 housing units have already signed up to support the initiative.

NYPA President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “Through the Induction Stove Challenge, NYPA is collaborating with its partners to develop a new class of cooktops that can operate in buildings where electrical systems would have been otherwise unsupportive—an important innovation on the path to the responsible electrification of buildings. The $32 million in funding support reflects the Power Authority’s commitment to drive innovation and strengthen New York’s rapidly growing clean energy economy.”

NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “This investment is a major step in New York’s ongoing collaboration with the manufacturing community to develop and bring to market new technologies that can make residential electrification more affordable. By expanding access to modern, energy-efficient appliances in NYCHA buildings, we are improving quality of life, promoting cleaner indoor air, and helping to lower energy bills for families who need it most.”

NYCHA Chief Executive Officer Lisa Bova-Hiatt said, “The execution of this contract brings us closer to the production and piloting of affordable, energy-efficient induction stoves, which will alleviate the amount of service outages and the need for costly capital investments caused by the deterioration of aging gas plumbing infrastructure in our properties. We thank Governor Hochul, and our partners at NYPA and NYSERDA, for their partnership in this innovation challenge, and look forward to employing these new stoves to improve the quality of life for many NYCHA residents while catalyzing uptake of this product in the broader residential market.”

Copper CEO and Co-Founder Sam Calisch said, “Copper is proud to partner with New York on a project that puts residents first. Together, we’re showing how clean technology can create healthier homes, avoid costly upgrades to aging gas infrastructure, and strengthen the city’s electric grid. Governor Hochul and the State of New York are demonstrating real leadership in accelerating this shift to cleaner, more resilient energy solutions. We share in that vision and are honored to serve the people of New York as we work to build a cleaner, safer future.”

Senator Kevin S. Parker, Chair of the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee said, “The partnership between NYPA, NYCHA, and NYSERDA represents real progress toward our state’s clean energy and public health goals. By electrifying cooking in NYCHA buildings, we are addressing decades-old infrastructure issues, improving indoor air quality, and reducing harmful emissions all while lowering long-term costs for residents. This initiative shows how smart investment and innovation can deliver immediate benefits for working families and move New York closer to a fully decarbonized, equitable energy future. The State Legislature has worked tirelessly to advance policies and secure funding that make projects like this possible, ensuring that the transition to clean energy reaches every corner of our state and every household that calls New York home.”

The challenge is modeled after another successful state-city partnership, the Clean Heat for All Challenge , in which NYCHA, NYPA and NYSERDA invited manufacturers to develop and produce a new electrification product to better serve multifamily buildings’ heating and cooling needs, reduce capital investment required to renovate and maintain existing heating systems, and hasten the transition to fossil-free heating sources at NYCHA campuses.

The two companies’ joint venture, known as RV Tech, said it has made solid progress on delivering the EV electrical and software platform that Volkswagen needs to compete with Tesla and Chinese rivals. The JV is focused on delivering models for Rivian and VW but is keeping communication open with third parties about the scalability of its platforms.

“We’re solving a problem for the larger automotive industry,” Wassym Bensaid, Rivian’s software chief and RV Tech co-chair, told journalists at an event in Palo Alto, California, on Wednesday. “That could become an opportunity” for others as well, he said.

The platform is designed to be scalable across vehicle sizes and segments in Western markets.

The earning potential from licensing the technology “is a very different ballgame,” Bensaid said, “and a very different margin profile from a business standpoint than making cars.”

RV Tech also said it will begin testing the system in winter conditions on Audi, VW and Scout models starting in the first quarter of 2026.

Volkswagen has licensed its technology to other carmakers in the past, with Ford Motor Co. and Mahindra & Mahindra using the German carmaker’s first-generation platform for their own electric models.

Volkswagen is grappling with tariffs in the U.S., shrinking deliveries in China and muted demand in Europe. As part of its push to cut costs and bolster sales, it’s turning to Rivian for the kind of software and EV technology its initial battery-powered models were missing. The automaker is investing as much as $5.8 billion into the alliance, making it one of Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume’s biggest strategic bets.

The partners formed a joint venture one year ago that brings together software developers and engineers from both companies. They’re working with Rivian’s centralized electronics layout with fewer computing units that’s meant to help Volkswagen simplify development and cut costs. For loss-making Rivian, the investment is a financial lifeline as manufacturers rethink strategies in a slowing EV market.

While the JV is prioritizing the ramp-up and delivery of the underpinnings for electric models, there are parallels that would allow the technology to be used for combustion engine cars as well, JV co-chair Carsten Helbing said.

The first car to get the new technology will be Rivian’s R2 sport utility vehicle, out early next year. VW’s compact EV, called ID. EVERY1, expected to cost around €20,000 (about $23,000), will follow in 2027, with rugged vehicles from the Scout brand due after that. Volkswagen has a similar partnership with Xpeng Inc. for the Chinese market.

Volkswagen’s earlier efforts to develop software in-house largely stumbled, first by holding up launches of its namesake brand’s ID models, then by handicapping those vehicles’ sales because of buggy features. The group, which also includes Audi and Porsche AG, has seen EV sales rise in Europe this year after improving software and updating models.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/08/PDTN/86050219007-bizautorivian-20250908-la.jpg?crop=2997,1686,x0,y404&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-13 13:01:39.723974

Solar Eclipse | What Pine Gate’s Bankruptcy Says About Renewables

Utility-scale solar and storage developer Pine Gate Renewables filed for bankruptcy last week, underscoring the growing pressure on renewable developers. The announcement follows months of speculation around the financial health of independent developers navigating a rapidly changing policy landscape.

Developers have faced mounting challenges this year after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) slashed project economics across the wind and solar sectors. The rollback of key tax credits has sent project levelized costs of energy (LCOEs) soaring, in some cases doubling. This undermines returns and jeopardizes financing pipelines, separating resilient portfolios from those dependent on federal incentives to maintain profitability.

Enverus Intelligence® Research’s portfolio resiliency analysis ranks developers based on the share of capacity with merchant power and renewable energy credit (REC) revenues exceeding before-tax LCOEs, excluding the impact of tax credits. Projects in markets with generation-weighted price premiums demonstrate greater insulation from the phaseout of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives. Against this benchmark, Pine Gate Renewables falls on the lower end of the resiliency spectrum, with just 18% of total capacity remaining economical without tax credit support.

While some projects remain eligible under the safe harbor provision — requiring construction to begin within 12 months of the OBBBA’s passage — prolonged interconnection timelines lower the likelihood of success. Pine Gate Renewables illustrates the pressure felt among mid-tier renewable developers as the market resets around a leaner, post-incentive reality.

Overall U.S. wholesale electricity prices are expected to continue rising next year, the Energy Information Administration said in its latest short-term energy outlook, published Wednesday.

The agency forecast the load-weighted average of the 11 regional wholesale prices it tracks to be $47/MWh in 2025 — 23% higher than the 2024 average — and to reach $51/MWh in 2026, another 8.5% increase.

Driving the rise in wholesale prices next year is primarily a projected 45% increase at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas-North pricing hub. “Natural gas prices tend to be the biggest determinant of power prices,” the EIA said. “But in 2026, the increase in power prices in ERCOT tends to reflect large hourly spikes in the summer months due to high demand combined with relatively low supply in this region.”

Dive Insight:

As prices go up, demand is also rising, EIA said, with much of it concentrated in the West South Central region that includes Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas, as a result of “data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities,” it said.

Electricity sales are set to increase across the U.S. by 2.4% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026. But in the West South Central region, sales will grow 4.4% in 2025 and 9.2% in 2026, due in large part to commercial customers.

The increases in Texas and nearby states “contribute 34% of the growth in U.S. electricity sales in 2025 and 66% of the growth in U.S. electricity sales in 2026,” the report said.

Some price increases can be attributed to fuel costs. Natural gas prices are forecast to rise to an average of almost $3.90/MMBtu this winter and an average of $4/MMBtu in 2026, “primarily due to increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports amid flat production growth.”

The EIA forecasts U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to increase by 1.8% in 2025, followed by a decrease of 0.7% in 2026.

“The largest changes in emissions for both years are attributable to shifting coal consumption for power generation,” it said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-IptqRhrKcXsFjUyORmVSEjFKTIb4oZhxE6balPVTgo/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Ob3ZlbWJlcl9zaG9ydC10ZXJtX2VuZXJneV9vdXRsb29rX0VJQS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-13 13:01:18.125558

Entities potentially affected, such as chemical manufacturers, importers, and article assemblers, should review the proposed text carefully and assess whether their PFAS reporting obligations could change.","Overview

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released a proposed rule that would amend the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting and Recordkeeping Rule, originally finalized on October 11, 2023. The proposal responds to widespread industry criticism over the rule’s broad scope and reporting burden, particularly for companies lacking knowledge of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) content in imported goods or low-volume mixtures. Most critically, the proposed amendments introduce targeted exemptions, technical clarifications, and an abbreviated reporting window designed to reduce compliance costs while still enabling EPA to collect meaningful PFAS manufacturing data. This shift reflects EPA efforts to balance data collection with administrative practicality—streamlining compliance, clarifying key provisions, and reducing unnecessary costs while maintaining the integrity of PFAS reporting.

Key Exemptions to Reporting Requirements

EPA’s proposal would add several categorical exemptions that significantly narrow the universe of entities subject to reporting.

De Minimis Exemption. PFAS present below a concentration of 0.1 percent in a mixture or article would be exempt, regardless of total annual volume. The agency explained that such concentrations are unlikely to represent meaningful exposure or risk and that the exemption would align PFAS reporting with other TSCA chemical data collection standards.

Imported Articles. Imported articles containing PFAS would be excluded from reporting obligations. EPA noted that importers typically lack “known or reasonably ascertainable” information about PFAS content in complex articles, and compelling such reporting would impose substantial burdens with limited informational value.

By-Products, Impurities, and Non-isolated Intermediates. PFAS unintentionally manufactured as by-products or impurities—or formed as non-isolated intermediates during a reaction sequence—would be exempt if not used for commercial purposes. This exemption recognizes that many such substances are generated in trace amounts incidental to manufacturing processes.

Research and Development (R&D) Chemicals. PFAS manufactured in small quantities solely for R&D would be excluded from reporting. EPA reaffirmed that R&D-only production poses minimal potential for exposure or environmental release and that tracking these quantities adds little value to the agency’s data objectives.

Technical Corrections and Clarifications

The proposal also includes several technical and procedural updates aimed at improving clarity and consistency in reporting. For example, EPA proposes to clarify the data elements required in specific fields of the TSCA § 8(a)(7) reporting form and to correct minor inconsistencies that appeared in the 2023 final rule. The agency would revise the submission period, establishing a three-month reporting window beginning 60 days after the effective date of the final rule, rather than the six-month period previously adopted. EPA anticipates that the reduced time frame will streamline implementation and align reporting schedules with other TSCA data collection efforts. In addition, the proposal clarifies how submitters should employ the OECD Harmonized Template (OHT) when reporting environmental and health-effects data. The OHT format is intended to facilitate international data comparability and electronic submission through EPA’s Central Data Exchange (CDX) portal.

Economic Impact and Burden Reduction

EPA estimates that the proposed revisions would yield a net industry burden reduction of 10 million–11 million hours, translating to $786 million–$843 million in cost savings compared to the 2023 rule. Much of this reduction results from exempting imported articles and de minimis concentrations, which were previously expected to generate substantial compliance costs for companies with limited PFAS information. The agency explained that the amendments aim to “lessen the economic impact of the TSCA and better allow EPA to carry out the statute in a reasonable and prudent manner.” By exempting entities least likely to possess relevant data, EPA seeks to preserve the quality of collected information while avoiding disproportionate burdens on small businesses and downstream users.

Legal Rationale and Statutory Context

EPA’s preamble references both the plain language of TSCA § 8(a)(7) and stakeholder feedback as justification for adopting exemptions. The agency noted that § 8(a)(7) differs from other TSCA reporting provisions because it lacks an explicit statutory purpose directing EPA’s use of the PFAS data. In contrast, § 8(b)(10) explicitly instructs EPA to compile and act on a mercury inventory.

Because Congress did not define how PFAS information under § 8(a)(7) must be used, EPA concluded that it has discretion to balance information gathering with administrative feasibility. Many commenters argued that the expected informational benefits did not justify the extreme reporting costs, particularly for sectors without PFAS expertise or supply-chain visibility. EPA therefore determined that a “reasonable and prudent” implementation required a narrower scope.

This reasoning may invite further debate during the public comment period, as environmental groups could challenge whether the proposed exemptions conflict with TSCA’s overarching goal of ensuring that EPA possesses adequate chemical data to evaluate risks. Nevertheless, EPA emphasized that the amendments retain the “majority” of PFAS manufacture reporting requirements, maintaining comprehensive coverage of intentional PFAS producers.

Public Comment and Next Steps

EPA is soliciting public comment on every major component of the proposal, and comments will be accepted for 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. Following the review of stakeholder input, EPA may modify or finalize the exemptions and clarifications in a subsequent final rule.

Entities potentially affected, such as chemical manufacturers, importers, and article assemblers, should review the proposed text carefully and assess whether their PFAS reporting obligations could change. Companies that previously prepared submissions under the 2023 rule may find their compliance burden significantly reduced, but they should remain attentive to recordkeeping obligations and any retained requirements for intentional PFAS manufacture.

Conclusion

EPA’s proposed amendments represent a notable shift toward risk-based pragmatism in the federal government’s PFAS data-collection efforts. By introducing de minimis and imported-article exemptions, clarifying reporting procedures, and shortening the submission window, EPA seeks to balance transparency with economic feasibility. Whether these revisions ultimately withstand stakeholder scrutiny will depend on the agency’s ability to demonstrate that streamlined reporting can still achieve TSCA’s goal of providing EPA with sufficient information to manage PFAS risks “in a reasonable and prudent manner.”

We have been fighting for nearly a year to protect jobs and keep energy costs affordable in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, and now time is running out. If the State Senate does not act before the end of the year, a recent decision by an Administrative Law Judge could raise energy costs for residents and put hundreds of Steelworker jobs at the Tilden Mine in danger.

Here is what is at stake:

On October 27, a judge issued a recommendation on Upper Michigan Energy Resources’ plan to expand renewable energy. This recommendation would harm customers in the Upper Peninsula (usw.to/5i9).

Future energy cases could bring even higher increases, making energy unaffordable for families and threatening nearly 900 Steelworker jobs at the Tilden Mine.

The judge recommended approval of the plan for 2026 and 2027. This means Tilden Mine would pay 5.3 million dollars more in 2026 and 6.4 million dollars more in 2027, mostly for a solar project that does not benefit the mine.

The company proposed adding over 1,300 megawatts of renewable energy and battery storage over the next ten years at a cost of 4.3 billion dollars to local energy customers.

All Upper Peninsula customers would see 10.6 million dollars in extra charges in 2026 and 12.9 million dollars in 2027, with these costs starting to be collected in January 2026.

The Senate must act now by passing House Bills 4007 and 4283, bipartisan bills that already passed the House. These bills would fix Michigan’s Clean Energy Law and stop the crushing costs that could devastate the U.P. economy.

This is about people, not politics. Lawmakers on both sides already came together in the House. Now the Senate must finish the job before the end of the year. Senators McMorrow and McCann can help make that happen.

As U.S.–China tensions escalate, General Motors is steering its suppliers toward a full exit from China by 2027.

By Felecia Stratton | November 13, 2025

When one of Detroit’s big three automakers tells thousands of its suppliers to get out of China, logistics and supply-chain professionals sit up and take notice. That’s exactly what GM is reportedly doing: setting a hard deadline of 2027 for many of its parts suppliers to eliminate China from their sourcing playbook.

According to multiple reports, GM began nudging suppliers in late 2024 and escalated the directive in 2025 as U.S.–China trade storms intensified amid the Trump Administration’s tariff policies. The move is part of a broader effort by the automaker to bolster resiliency in its supply chain, given the fact that global sourcing ties have grown long, complex, and vulnerable.

As a result, GM suppliers of raw materials and parts—from lighting assemblies to electronics modules and rare-earth components—are being asked to reconfigure long-standing networks and explore non-China sourcing alternatives.

Braking for Impact

GM’s pivot means lanes, loads, and lead times are all in motion. As suppliers work to shift sourcing from China to regions like Mexico, Vietnam, and India, inbound freight patterns will change, forcing teams to validate new routes, carriers, and customs processes.

Suppliers are also likely to build buffer inventory and dual-source parts to hedge against disruption, which could ripple into higher warehouse demand and increased domestic transport volumes.

Meanwhile, new sourcing regions bring fresh visibility challenges. Ensuring that rerouted shipments still hit just-in-time delivery windows will require tighter coordination across 3PLs, forwarders, and manufacturers.

A Sign of the Times?

GM’s push to decouple from China isn’t an isolated tactic, it may be a bellwether for the wider industry. As auto supply chains rewire, logistics teams at every level—from Tier 1 carriers to material-handlers—should gear up for stratified sourcing destinations, greater regional complexity and tighter synchronization.

4 Takeaways for Logistics and Supply Chain Teams:

Network redesign ahead. GM’s directive signals major reconsideration of one of the world’s deepest supply-chain wells. China has long supplied everything from custom tool-and-die sets to electronics modules for vehicles built in North America. Suppliers now must rapidly reroute—or rebuild—supply chain links. “In some cases this has been 20 or 30 years in the making, and we’re trying to undo it in a few years,” Vehicle Suppliers Association head Collin Shaw told The Times of India.

Cost and timing pressures mount. Reshoring or nearshoring parts production isn’t simply plug-and-play. Suppliers face new capital investment, logistics rerouting, and the risk of parts shortages or launch delays during transition. The directive to “deliver alternatives by 2027” means shorter execution timelines than typical multi-year sourcing shifts.

Regionalization and geo-optimization. GM reportedly prefers sourcing parts from within the same region where vehicles are built, especially for its North American vehicle base. This could mean increased production and logistics activity in North America and allied regions, while sourcing footprints in China shrink.

Strategic leverage and geopolitical hedging. GM’s move is as much about reducing geopolitical exposure as it is about operations. Steering clear of China content helps shield the automaker from trade volatility, tariffs, rare-earth supply risks, and sudden export restrictions.

The energy agencies are adjusting their forecasts even as they still do not agree but all seem to be moving closer to the oil balance center. Still OPEC and the report was bearish for oil but very bullish for natural gas. The Fox Weather says our weather is changing. That will add even more excitement as we digest all the conflicting data we get from the EIA, the IEA and OPEC with seeming different outlooks or perhaps just different agendas.

Oil prices took a nosedive on Wednesday as OPEC tossed out its earlier deficit forecast and now says the global market is headed for balance in 2026. OPEC made the change because they say that non-OPEC producers—like the U.S., Brazil, and Guyana—keep cranking out more supply, pushing inventories back up. So much for those carbon targets, eh Brazil? Maybe cut down another rain forest so we can land some more private jets.

OPEC’s crystal ball does not exactly predict world swimming in oil. OPEC also says that global thirst for crude will hitting 106.2 million barrels daily, but even that can’t flip the OPEC script to a deficit. So, OPEC’s October prediction of a supply deficit has been replaced by a forecast of a perception so supply and demand being in balance and one with the universe, I guess.

The Energy Information Administration is seeing even more barrels sloshing around out there than OPEC, but in true government fashion, they’ve gone and bumped up their price and demand forecast anyway. According to the EIA, global oil inventories are on track to keep rising through 2026—which should be a recipe for lower prices. Yet, Brent crude is now pegged to average $54 a barrel in the first quarter of 2026 and $55 for the full year. That’s a $3 jump from last month’s call, and you can chalk it up to a couple of plot twists: China’s inventory growth isn’t as wild as first thought, and those Russian sanctions are still mucking up the math. So, while we keep looking for their predicted oil glut, their price outlook is still climbing.

While low prices are good, it’s not necessarily good for US shale oil production. Are low prices starting to cure low prices? Is it possible that the Energy Information Administration’s latest STEO signals that oil production from the US Lower 48—primarily driven by shale—has reached its peak? What could this mean for the future of American energy? Is this just a temporary plateau, or are we witnessing a turning point in the shale revolution? Of course the shale revolution will not end as long as prices are high enough to support it. The US energy engineer is the best in the world and they can meet every challenge but one of the challenges that they can’t are low prices. Yet with the reduction of inflation and tariffs that should make it easier for shale oil producers to keep producing.

Where the shale revolution was truly most amazing was in transforming the U.S. natural gas market from a devastating production peak and shortage to an abundance unlike anything the world has ever seen. From almost no supply to becoming the largest producer globally, with upward production projections that are nearly unimaginable. While U.S. energy producers can increase output even further and are already setting record production levels, what the Energy Information Administration says about the market is one of the reasons we’re seeing supportive prices. In fact, that might not be a bad thing, because U.S. energy producers need higher prices to keep those drills running.

Remember when the U.S. used to be at the mercy of the world for natural gas? Well, those days are long gone. Now, thanks to American ingenuity, we’re shipping liquefied natural gas (LNG) to every corner of the globe. The Energy Information Administration says U.S. LNG exports will rocket to 14.9 billion cubic feet per day this year—a jaw-dropping 25% jump over last year. Give a tip of your hard hat to Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana, which fired up exports faster than anyone expected, forcing the EIA to hike its fourth-quarter export forecast by 3% compared to last month. And it’s not stopping there—U.S. LNG exports are on track to surge another 10% in 2026. The U.S. isn’t just meeting domestic needs; we’re powering the world’s furnaces, one super-cooled shipment at a time.

The Energy Information Administration also looking at the America’s power surge as it moves to win the global AI race. Electricity demand in the U.S. is off the charts, and if you think it’s over, it may just be getting started. The EIA says that sales of electricity to end-users are set to jump a wild 2.4% in 2025 and another 2.6% in 2026. And if you want to see where the real action is, look no further than the West South Central—yes, Texas, I’m looking at you. Thanks to a boom in data centers and the relentless power appetite of cryptocurrency miners, this region’s electric meters are spinning like slot machines in Vegas. Forget the grid of the past—America’s energy future is being built one server room and mining rig at a time!

Fox Weather is predicting record high temperatures expected for 200+ million Americans after early week polar plunge. They say that after a pre-winter arctic blast set more than 70 record low temperatures across the eastern U.S. earlier this week, a major warmup is on the way, with parts of the Heartland expected to surpass the 80-degree mark by the weekend. So, turn off the heater and turn on the AC. Regardless of the weather, it will still burn natural gas. Yet the real key is December.

Much like the international markets, market conditions are softening, capacity is stable and underwriting appetite is increasing moderately, which is fuelling the competitive pressures to maintain and grow market share among underwriters in the region. Without any major losses since our last review in April, upstream energy companies with good loss histories can expect rate reductions of 5%-15%.

Regulatory changes are holding the door open for upstream energy companies to ramp up operations and exploration in oil and gas, but an uptick in activity needs to be addressed with a responsive and tailored risk strategy.

The downstream energy property market remains competitive

In the downstream refining and chemicals sector, echoes from the international downstream energy insurance market aren’t quite stretching to the U.S.. Headline losses from refinery fires are not impacting premium reductions. Major losses have been covered by catastrophe bonds, and the downstream energy property insurance market fin North America has maintained its profitability streak.

“Several hurricanes in the last five years have ranked among the costliest in U.S. history”, but largely due to a benign 2025 hurricane season, underwriting profitability is cascading through the commercial market—even in typically catastrophe-prone areas such as the Gulf Coast.

Without any withdrawals from the market, capacity remains stable and placements are oversubscribed, keeping competitive forces at play.

Accurate asset valuation and transparent risk management remain prerequisites for smooth renewals.

U.S. casualty

In 2025, the North American energy casualty market has faced varying conditions across different sectors.

Primary liability market capacity is stable. Manageable primary limits, risk-transfer attachment points, and ample overall capacity has kept capacity stable across the primary liability market, including workers’ compensation (WC), general liability (GL), and auto liability (AL). Most sectors are experiencing flat-rated WC and GL renewals in 2025, although carriers have pushed for low single-digit rate increases on GL. AL remains the lone exception, continuing to see high single-digit to low double-digit rate increases due to claims inflation and increase in litigated claims.

General liability rates for upstream, midstream/downstream and chemical segments are seeing low single-digit increases or flat renewals. After the uptick in primary liability/lead umbrella capacity in 2024, some uncertainty remains in 2025 for offshore operators regarding available domestic capacity, as most of the capacity is now coming from the London market.

Workers' compensation remains profitable and stable for most sectors, with small rate increases requested at renewal. This line of business has kept many overall primary liability portfolios profitable for many carriers, offsetting the increasing pressure of social inflation on the AL and GL. OFS companies and industrial contractors are seeing larger rate increases if they have negative loss records, driven by an uptick in severity of workplace injuries.

Auto liability profitability is still a significant challenge for primary insurers after an uptick in litigated auto claims and settlements, particularly in areas like the Permian Basin, Louisiana, and South Texas. A well-funded plaintiff’s bar continues to focus on commercial auto litigation, and accident frequency continues to trend upwards for many insured in the energy industry.

Excess liability market (lead umbrella and first $25 million of programs) is impacted by claims inflation, causing lead umbrella carriers to focus on acceptable limits and more conservative premiums. Lead umbrella capacity remains limited for many industries, with a key market reducing lead capacity from $10 million to $5 million on energy risks. Capacity within the first $25 million remains cautious due to lawsuit abuse issues in the U.S..

Excess liability market (above $25 million) capacity remains stable, with most segments seeing a surplus of options in both the domestic and London markets. While the domestic excess liability market appears to be contracting somewhat, the London market has stepped in to fill the void in 2025.

Trends to watch in 2026

LIBERTY, N.C. — Toyota (NYSE: TM) has begun production at its new $13.9 billion battery plant in Liberty, approximately 20 miles southeast of Greensboro, N.C. The 7 million-square-foot facility, which broke ground in 2021, is Toyota’s first and only battery plant outside of Japan and the company’s 11th U.S. plant.

Toyota will also make an additional investment of up to $10 billion over the next five years to “support future mobility efforts,” according to company representatives. Toyota has invested nearly $60 billion since the company began its U.S. operations nearly 70 years ago.

“Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the United States and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities and suppliers,” says Ted Ogawa, president and CEO of Toyota Motor North America (TMNA).

Toyota North Carolina is expected to create as many as 5,100 jobs.

“This new facility will bring new opportunities and long-term growth to our state. It’s another sign that North Carolina continues to lead the way in manufacturing and innovation,” adds U.S. Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina.

The 1,850-acre site can produce 30 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually at full capacity and will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries needed for its electrified vehicles.

The plant will house 14 battery production lines that support hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Additional production lines at Toyota North Carolina are set to launch by 2030.

Batteries assembled at Toyota North Carolina will power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric BEV — the first of its kind for Toyota to be manufactured domestically. The plant currently ships HEV modules to both Toyota Motor Manufacturing in Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama.

Upon completion of construction, the new facility will feature a range of amenities for its employees, including onsite childcare, a pharmacy, medical clinic and fitness center.

Toyota has sold more than 6.6 million hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell and BEVs in the United States since 2000.

The United States needs additional natural gas pipeline infrastructure and storage opportunities to reliably meet the growing demand for energy, a National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners task force report concluded on Wednesday.

NARUC’s Gas-Electric Alignment for Reliability task force, or GEAR, was formed in 2023 in an effort to improve coordination between the two interwoven energy sectors, with an ultimate goal of bolstering grid reliability.

The report includes nine recommendations but stopped short of advocating for a Gas Reliability Organization akin to electric grid efforts, and concluded changes to the gas-electric market day and force majeure contract provisions were unnecessary.

Dive Insight:

Rising electricity demand, extreme weather and a reliance on gas-fired generation has at times left the power sector scrambling when necessary fuel was not available.

During Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, some Texas electric companies cut power to gas production and transportation facilities as part of their emergency conservation response. That reduced fuel supplies to gas-fired power plants, contributing to energy shortages and blackouts. Almost 250 people in Texas died in the storm.

And in 2022, unplanned generator outages reached 90,500 MW during Winter Storm Elliott, with gas fuel supply issues accounting for 20% of unplanned generating unit outages, derates and failures to start, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corp.

The GEAR report parses diverse policy perspectives around the future of gas and gas infrastructure expansion, NARUC said. However, task force participants found common ground “on the need for harmonization between the electric and natural gas sectors to ensure reliable and affordable electricity service,” the report said.

“The need for harmonization is crucial, regardless of one’s long-term perspective about future energy policy in various regions of the country,” it said.

Recommendations include: creation of a natural gas “readiness forum”; development of additional gas pipeline infrastructure and gas storage opportunities; new and enhanced market tools to improve supplier performance in extreme weather; demand response initiatives for gas utilities; and market changes to incentivize gas pipeline capacity releases.

Regulators and grid operators “should apply a strategic approach to expand opportunities for increased or new storage investment consistent with empowering end-users to exert greater control over supply needs,” the report found.

There was some support for the formation of a Gas Reliability Organization, similar to the North American Electric Reliability Corp., but not enough to advance the recommendation, the GEAR report noted. “A majority of members [concluded] that such an option (on a national, regional or state basis) is unnecessary or not the best means to efficiently enhance gas-electric reliability,” it said.

Similarly, discussions around aligning the timing of gas or electric days were not advanced. Gas and electric market schedules are typically several hours apart, though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has historically tried to better align them.

“While it is obvious that the current bifurcated system is not how anyone would design the combined system from scratch, we are unaware of any systemwide outage that has occurred due to scheduling issues or mismatches,” the report said.

And possible changes to standard force majeure contract provisions, which cover supply disruptions, were found to be “neither viable nor productive,” the report said.

The task force noted that the primary driver for changes to the force majeure provisions “is aimed at expanded winterization of the production system,” and noted there are two recommendations that “facilitate a better understanding of force majeure and provide greater opportunities to mitigate its use.”

The recommendations provide an “ideal starting point for state regulators to ponder future steps to enhance reliability,” Dwight Keen, vice chair of the GEAR working group, said in a statement. Keen is also a regulator with the Kansas Corporation Commission.

A coalition of gas-electric groups supported the report’s findings. “The biggest challenge affecting interoperability across the systems is not operational; it is economic,” the Reliability Alliance said in a statement,

The group consists of the Electric Power Supply Association, Interstate Natural Gas Association of America and Natural Gas Supply Association.

“Competitive power suppliers have invested significantly to strengthen winter readiness, but we need continued alignment between gas and electric systems,” EPSA President and CEO Todd Snitchler said in a statement. “That’s the measure of success we’re all working toward, and GEAR’s work has been an important step to bridge that gap.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/wUPJ3t0M9_xbY0IU7rUaEhhstO1CIX5CDi86trFxZIc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy01MjUzMzk5NzMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-13 13:01:23.511619

Speaking to PV Tech, the company’s CEO Louise Hurll emphasises the need for Australia to bolster its domestic solar manufacturing capabilities.
Building an end-to-end solar manufacturing supply chain is becoming a strategic imperative for Australia,” she says.
“The Solar Sunshot Programme funding is fundamental to establishing solar manufacturing in Australia.
“Our goal is to demonstrate that advanced solar manufacturing can thrive in Australia, combining technical excellence, low-carbon production, and reliable delivery,” she adds.","In September 2025, ARENA launched the second round of the AU$1billion programme, allocating AU$150 million to further support domestic manufacturing and scale-up projects.

Among the companies selected in the first round was Stellar PV, a Queensland-based silicon ingot and wafer manufacturing start-up. Speaking to PV Tech, the company’s CEO Louise Hurll emphasises the need for Australia to bolster its domestic solar manufacturing capabilities.

“Today, more than 90% of the world’s polysilicon and 98% of its wafers – key building blocks of photovoltaic cells – are produced in China. Building an end-to-end solar manufacturing supply chain is becoming a strategic imperative for Australia,” she says.

Hurll believes the Solar Sunshot Programme is helping lay the foundation for a competitive domestic solar manufacturing industry, not just in terms of financial backing, but as a statement of intent: “The Solar Sunshot Programme marks a turning point for Australia’s solar industry, building on our strengths in research and deployment to develop home-grown manufacturing capability.”

From raw materials to finished products

Australia’s current position in the solar value chain is primarily as a raw materials supplier. “We ship our quartz overseas to be processed. By the time it returns to us in the form of finished solar panels, its value has multiplied many times over,” Hurll explains. “The programme is a transformational opportunity for Australia to move from being a consumer of clean technology to a global supplier.”

Through the Solar Sunshot Programme, ARENA is providing funding and production credits to help projects like Stellar PV’s progress from feasibility to commercialisation. The company has already received AU$4.7 million from ARENA to conduct a feasibility study for a 2GW silicon ingot and wafer facility in Townsville, Queensland.

“The Solar Sunshot Programme funding is fundamental to establishing solar manufacturing in Australia. Private investment alone would not be viable for several reasons,” Hurll emphasises. “Our ARENA-funded feasibility study has been critical in understanding the true costs and financial structure needed to establish manufacturing here. We could not have progressed this far without that support.”

She adds that government backing also provides “vital validation that helps attract private investors who see government as a committed partner in de-risking the project”.

Learning from global manufacturing models

Hurll highlights that every successful solar manufacturing nation has relied on strong government intervention to reach scale. “China’s dominance was built on decades of industrial policy, from low-cost energy and land access to preferential loans, tax incentives and direct support for manufacturing expansion,” she says.

The United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has further reshaped the competitive landscape, offering up to US$12 per square metre in production tax credits for solar products. Australia’s Solar Sunshot Programme, Hurll notes, “is now positioned to provide a similar kind of investment support and production credits that can accelerate our entry into large-scale solar manufacturing markets”.

While cost competition with China remains difficult, she believes Australia can carve out a niche based on sustainability, transparency and high performance. “Australia is well positioned to compete on both sustainability and cost, supported by abundant renewable energy and growing global demand for traceable, low-carbon materials.”

Stellar PV: From feasibility to full-scale production

The company’s feasibility study, due to be completed by mid-2026, will deliver a bankable engineering and business plan to guide construction, with production expected to begin in late 2028, Hurll says.

The company’s facility will employ the Czochralski (Cz) method for ingot pulling, the global standard for photovoltaic-grade silicon, and the diamond wire sawing process for wafering. Both technologies are mature, efficient and align with Stellar PV’s focus on sustainability.

“The technology itself is not the barrier; these processes are mature and well understood. The challenge lies in building the industrial and economic capability to support them,” she adds.

Polysilicon production and crystal growth, Hurll highlights, are capital- and energy-intensive processes that require specialised expertise and strong policy certainty. “Establishing them in Australia will require coordinated investment, long-term policy certainty and access to affordable renewable energy,” Hurll says.

Stellar PV’s Townsville site’s access to low-cost, behind-the-grid renewable electricity, combined with co-location near Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners’ planned polysilicon facility, creates “ideal conditions for supply chain integration and a strong competitive advantage,” she emphasises.

Initially, polysilicon may be imported from trusted international producers, but Stellar PV intends to transition to domestic supply as soon as local production is ready.

Stellar PV also aims to achieve a green price premium for its wafers by offering verified low-carbon and fully traceable manufacturing. “By combining transparency, certification and technical performance, we aim to position our wafers as a trusted, premium input for manufacturers seeking cleaner and more traceable supply chains,” Hurll explains.

Townville facility and its ‘stellar’ future

Automation will be central to the facility’s operations, but Stellar PV is equally focused on workforce development. The company expects to create a high-skill, regionally based workforce in North Queensland, contributing to economic diversification and long-term community benefits.

“Automation will play a major role in managing high-precision processes, but the human workforce remains central,” Hurll says. “We are building local capability through training, apprenticeships and continuous upskilling, ensuring automation enhances rather than replaces local employment.”

By 2030, Stellar PV aims to be a global benchmark for sustainable wafer manufacturing, exporting to US and European markets while helping build an integrated Australian solar supply chain.

“Our goal is to demonstrate that advanced solar manufacturing can thrive in Australia, combining technical excellence, low-carbon production, and reliable delivery,” she adds. “This is about proving that Australia can compete in advanced low-emissions manufacturing on the world stage.”

Thanks to federal energy-efficiency incentives, homeowners can currently save thousands of dollars on new HVAC systems. But there’s a catch: these valuable tax credits expire on December 31, 2025, and your new system must be installed by that date to qualify.

That deadline might sound far away, but the reality is very different. With demand for qualified installers, potential delays in scheduling, and the complexity of ordering equipment, waiting too long could mean missing out on significant savings.

What’s at stake: Up to $2,600 in tax credits

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, homeowners who invest in energy-efficient upgrades, including qualifying HVAC systems, may be eligible for federal tax credits worth up to $2,600. These credits directly reduce your tax liability, which means money back in your pocket at tax time.

With a new Hisense HVAC system, you’re not only investing in comfort and performance, you’re also ensuring your home is eligible for these savings. Many Hisense models meet or exceed the efficiency standards required for federal credits, giving you both peace of mind and a financial advantage.

But after December 31, 2025, these credits disappear. If you’ve been waiting to replace an aging furnace, air conditioner, or heat pump, delaying could mean paying full price without the benefit of these generous incentives.

Why you need to plan ahead

It’s not enough to simply buy a new system before the deadline. The installation must be complete by December 31, 2025, to claim the tax credit. This end-of-year date is why many homeowners are caught off guard.

Most people wait until their system breaks down to schedule a replacement. By then, installers are often booked solid, especially during peak heating and cooling seasons. Combine that with supply chain delays or limited equipment availability, and suddenly, the end of 2025 isn’t so far away.

The smartest move is to schedule an estimate now with a trusted Hisense HVAC dealer. That gives you time to explore your options, compare systems, and lock in your installation well before the rush. Check out these local HVAC dealers:

The hidden costs of waiting

Beyond losing out on tax credits, delaying a replacement can cost you in other ways:

Higher energy bills: Older, less efficient systems use more energy, which means monthly utility costs that add up.

Unexpected breakdowns: HVAC systems tend to fail on the hottest or coldest days of the year, leaving you scrambling for emergency service.

Limited availability: As the deadline nears, demand will surge. The later you wait, the harder it will be to find a qualified contractor with time on their schedule.

Why choose Hisense HVAC

Hisense is a global leader in home comfort, offering efficient, reliable, and innovative HVAC solutions for every type of home. With Hisense, you’re choosing advanced technology designed for year-round comfort and the efficiency levels that help you maximize today’s federal tax credits.

Act now before the deadline

Replacing your HVAC system is an investment in your home’s comfort, efficiency, and value. With Hisense HVAC and federal tax credits still available, you have a rare opportunity to offset the cost and maximize your savings. But time is running out.

Remember: the system must be installed, not just purchased, by December 31, 2025. Schedule your consultation today with a Hisense HVAC professional, secure your spot on the installation calendar, and lock in your savings before the window closes.

After December 31, 2025, the opportunity is gone, and so are the savings.

Jeremy Furr is senior vice president of strategic sourcing at Stryten Energy.

The U.S. energy storage sector is navigating a critical turning point. As energy demand surges and grid modernization accelerates, utilities and developers are dealing with the twin pressures of global trade uncertainty and grid reliability. At the same time, the push to localize battery manufacturing is intersecting with a growing need to diversify energy storage technologies.

Together, reshoring the battery supply chain and broadening the mix of battery chemistries are redefining what it means to build a resilient, future-ready energy storage ecosystem.

Tariffs continue to drive up the cost of imported battery materials and components, especially those used in lead and lithium-based systems. These rising costs aren’t limited to finished products; they also impact many U.S.-based battery manufacturers and component suppliers that rely on foreign raw materials. As a result, many in the energy storage supply chain are rethinking their procurement strategies and looking for ways to reduce exposure to volatile international markets.

China’s restrictions on exporting key minerals have added further disruption, especially where it serves as the primary global supplier. With trade challenges expected to continue, I am seeing many companies exploring onshoring and nearshoring solutions.

Onshoring and nearshoring activities are vital to securing a reliable energy storage supply chain. Are there challenges? Yes, but they can be overcome.

Constructing a lithium cell plant can require an investment of half a billion dollars, a major hurdle for most companies. Larger original equipment manufacturers and automakers have addressed this issue by partnering with established battery manufacturers that already have U.S.-based production facilities in place. For smaller battery providers, localization is tougher to manage. To fund domestic manufacturing, many are turning to consolidation strategies, including joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, and partnerships of their own.

Remember, too, that even before recent trade shifts, battery manufacturers and system integrators had started moving from importing complete battery packs to assembling modules domestically, with longer-term goals of localizing cell production and raw material sourcing.

The industry has already been hard at work proving that building a domestic supply chain is doable. While the transition can be costly and complex, it’s laying the groundwork for a more resilient domestic energy storage ecosystem. If more companies and leaders in the sector step up to lead the change, in a matter of years a strong domestic energy storage supply chain won’t be just wishful thinking — it will become a reality.

Technology diversification to ensure grid resilience

The U.S. electrical grid is also under increasing strain due to aging infrastructure, more frequent extreme weather events, and the rising share of renewable energy sources. These factors are making it harder to maintain consistent power delivery, with brownouts and blackouts becoming more common. Because of these challenges, grid operators are under pressure to modernize and stabilize the system.

This reality highlights the need for smarter energy storage integration to provide backup power, smooth grid fluctuations and support clean energy deployment. Lithium continues to play a dominant role in energy storage. However, broadening our chemistry portfolio further strengthens grid reliability and supply chain resilience.

To strengthen U.S. grid resilience and reduce exposure to supply chain risks, battery manufacturers, system integrators and project developers must seek out new and different types of battery energy storage systems technologies. Two complementary technologies to lithium that are gaining momentum are vanadium redox flow batteries and advanced lead BESS.

VRFBs are well-suited in long-duration applications, particularly in renewable energy projects. I’m seeing rising interest, especially among data centers, and a domestic supply chain for VRFBs is already being developed. Lead BESS also presents a formidable option for medium-duration, decentralized applications, especially when domestic sourcing is a priority. It can help integrate renewable energy sources into the existing power mix by providing stable and dependable backup power and reducing grid dependency during peak hours. With its already mature U.S. supply chain and fully established circular economy, in which nearly 100% of battery materials are recycled, lead BESS provides both resilience and sustainability.

Consider this example of a successful lead BESS installation at Georgia Tech earlier this year. The purpose of the installation at the university’s Carbon Neutral Energy Solutions Laboratory was to create an on-campus living-learning lab to support research and real-world applications of medium-duration energy storage solutions. Lead BESS was chosen because of its proven cost-efficiency, high discharge capabilities and recyclability.

Lead BESS and VRFBs are two proven alternatives that deserve a larger role in the energy storage mix. While lithium-based systems remain essential to many applications, we can’t afford to rely on a single technology to meet the full range of grid needs. A diversified portfolio of chemistries is key to building a more resilient, flexible and domestically sourced energy infrastructure.

A more resilient energy future will be built on two pillars: strategic sourcing and technology diversification. Tariffs, supply chain constraints, and geopolitical uncertainty are here to stay, but so is the rising demand for reliable, scalable energy.

To meet that demand, we must look beyond reliance on any single battery chemistry or offshore supply chain.

Pennsylvania lawmakers voted on Wednesday to withdraw the state from a regional effort that cuts carbon emissions from power plants, a move baked into a deal on the state’s long-overdue budget.

An ongoing legal battle kept Pennsylvania from participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative since former Gov. Tom Wolf directed the state to join the pact in 2019. But it was technically in the collaborative of 11 Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states and would have significantly reduced the region’s climate-damaging emissions if it had become an active member, experts say.

Almost five months after the new $50.1 billion budget should have been voted into law, the bill was passed by large majorities—156 votes to 47 in the Democrat-controlled House and 40 votes to 9 in the Republican-led Senate—in a move that critics said made meaningful climate action a victim of lawmakers’ need to restore normal state funding to services such as education and transportation.

“They didn’t offer it as a free-standing bill, which would have been easier to vote against, but as part of a must-pass budget bill,” said David Masur, executive director of the advocacy group PennEnvironment. “Yes, it was a hard vote for many members who said, ‘I don’t want to vote against RGGI but my school districts need money, transit agencies need money.’ Voting no also would mean voting against those things.”

Masur said the vote was one of the most far-reaching environmental rollbacks in recent state history and is a “huge blow” to climate action. Power generators in states participating in RGGI must buy carbon allowances for their greenhouse-gas emissions, incentivizing a shift to clean energy and raising money for climate efforts.

According to a 2023 analysis by the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, active membership in RGGI would have reduced the state’s electricity-sector emissions by 84 percent from 2020 levels by 2030. The state would also have raised $101 million to $148 million in the auction of emissions allowances in 2030, the study found.

Implementing RGGI membership would have little effect on retail electricity prices, cut coal use and encourage the uptake of renewables, the Kleinman analysis said.

But the Consumer Energy Alliance, an advocacy group that opposes RGGI membership, welcomed the legislature’s vote, which it contended will keep retail energy costs affordable and improve reliability.

“Pennsylvania lawmakers recognized that RGGI was a barrier to affordability, reliability, jobs and economic opportunity for families and businesses across the Commonwealth, and their common-sense bipartisan action leads the way for other states to do the same,” said CEA President David Holt in a statement.

“Getting out of RGGI means Pennsylvania can better compete for the data centers, advanced manufacturing facilities and energy investments that are driving 21st-century economic growth,” Holt added.

Since 2005, the other 10 RGGI states have cut power-sector emissions by 50 percent, which is almost 50 percent faster than the U.S. as a whole, while raising some $8.6 billion to invest in communities, the group said in January this year. Participating states set a regional cap for emissions, which declines over time. Each state issues allowances in proportion to its share of the regional cap.

Pennsylvania’s implementation of RGGI has been blocked by litigation brought by some Republican lawmakers over whether the levy on power producers constitutes a tax or a fee. Opponents of membership argued that it would be a tax, and therefore could not be imposed by a governor; only the legislature has the authority to impose a tax. That argument was backed by a state appeals court, a ruling appealed by Gov. Josh Shapiro and advocates to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

Shapiro, a Democrat, sought to deflect criticism of the RGGI withdrawal by calling for support for his “Lightning Plan,” a package of energy-related measures designed to create jobs, cut costs for consumers and curb climate change.

Environmentalists urge Shapiro, lawmakers not to compromise on climate to end budget impasse

“For years, Senate Republicans have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy,” Shapiro said in signing the bill. “Today, that excuse is gone. It’s time to look forward—and I’m going to be aggressive about pushing for policies that create more jobs in the energy sector, bring more clean energy onto the grid and reduce the cost of energy for Pennsylvanians.”

Advocates for RGGI membership think it was a bad deal.

“By trading away RGGI, Governor Shapiro has sacrificed progress on climate and air pollution based on politics that prioritizes industry over our children’s health,” Patrice Tomcik, the senior national field director for advocacy group Moms Clean Air Force, said in a statement.

In recent decades, environmental laws have not only been challenged in courts and Congress; they’ve also taken a verbal beating. They’ve been denounced as “job killers”, “government overreach,” “radical environmentalism,” a “war on coal,” and, lately, just “woke.” It’s become all too easy to focus on the costs of regulation and forget why we adopted them in the first place. Or worse, to take their benefits for granted. This is a consequence of politics, of course, but also of a kind of amnesia.

Many Americans today have no memory of the world that spurred modern environmental law. When Time magazine declared “Lake Erie is a dead lake” or named “The Endangered Earth” as its Planet of the Year, it was no joke. Air quality was so poor in Los Angeles that schools routinely cancelled recess. Piles of trash lined highways. Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River famously caught fire in 1969 (the 12th time it had burned in a century!).

Put simply, there were plenty of good reasons why the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970, energized the nation. In the largest single-day public demonstration in U.S. history, roughly 10% of the nation’s population took to the streets to shout together: Enough is enough! Politicians listened. Over the decade that followed, all our foundational environmental laws were passed – the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and more.

This is an important history to tell. But when I do so in class, putting up Powerpoints of charts and graphs and listing dates and disasters, decrying the blight and pollution of decades ago, I sometimes feel like a Simpsons character railing that “You don’t how bad things used to be!”, somewhere between Moe and Troy McClure. It doesn’t really connect: students seem numb.

That’s why I was excited to learn recently about the Documerica project, courtesy of a wonderful photojournalist article by Gideon Leek. Conceived by Bill Ruckelshaus during his first stint as EPA Administrator, Documerica was inspired by the famous photographs of depression-era farmworkers commissioned in the 1930s by the Farm Security Administration. Ruckelshaus’ newly-created EPA commissioned a nationwide photo record in order to, as Leek describes, “provide the EPA with a great deal of qualitative environmental data, create a ‘visual baseline’ against which to judge their efforts, and introduce the agency to the country through art.”

Documerica was formally charged to “pictorially document the environmental movement in America during this decade.” In its five years of operation, it produced over 20,000 photographs, from rivers and farms to highways and city streets.

The photos, now housed at the National Archives, provide a vivid window into the state of the environment in the 1970s. For me, they are at once sobering and inspiring. They bring back memories from my childhood of how we took pollution and trash for granted. And a reminder of why I went into this field. For our students, it provides an important baseline of the conditions that led to the Modern Era of environmental law and shows how much has been achieved. They still need to see the charts and the graphs and I still need to offer up the lists of dates and disasters. But the pictures, the pictures are visceral.

I’d recommend you see for yourself, starting with Gideon Leek’s article explaining the Documerica Project. For more detail, you can view the photos by category or searchable.

Environmental laws and regulations have their costs, to be sure, but Documerica’s photos show just how far we’ve come, and the loss we risk through forgetting.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/412-DA-001-1024x697.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 13:01:30.775018

The analysis spans 27 countries, linking 35 portfolio companies to 147 gas plants worldwide.
If this private equity-backed fleet were its own country, it would rank as the seventh-largest gas power producer on Earth.
“Gas plants owned by private equity are substantial contributors to climate change and public-health costs,” said Alex Hurley, Project Manager at Global Energy Monitor.
In the United Kingdom, more than one-fifth of gas plants in development already have private equity ties.","A new analysis from the Private Equity Climate Risks (PECR) research consortium, “Mapping Private Equity’s Gas Fleet: Climate Footprint, Health Impacts, and AI-Driven Demand,” reveals that the world’s largest private equity firms collectively own or finance nearly 60 gigawatts of gas-fired power capacity—producing an estimated 82 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year, roughly equivalent to the annual electricity use of 17 million U.S. homes. As nations gather for COP30 to stress the urgent role of private finance in funding a clean energy future, private equity’s growing gas empire shows how Wall Street capital is instead steering billions toward fossil expansion, undermining climate goals and prolonging pollution.

The findings expose the scale of private equity’s large investment in the global gas power sector. The analysis spans 27 countries, linking 35 portfolio companies to 147 gas plants worldwide. If this private equity-backed fleet were its own country, it would rank as the seventh-largest gas power producer on Earth. These facilities carry a significant and largely hidden public toll; a typical mid-sized gas plant in the dataset could generate $21 million – $28 million in estimated annual health damages from air pollution alone.

“Gas plants owned by private equity are substantial contributors to climate change and public-health costs,” said Alex Hurley, Project Manager at Global Energy Monitor. “Understanding who finances these plants is a critical step toward accountability.”

The report also finds that private equity’s gas assets are increasingly intertwined with the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and data centers. As demand for electricity surges, private equity firms are not only financing the data infrastructure that powers AI, but they are also buying the power plants that keep it running. Since 2022, private equity firms have invested nearly $200 billion in data center companies, driving the majority of global mergers and acquisitions in the sector. At the same time, firms are acquiring utilities and fossil-fuel power generators to secure energy supply for the digital economy.

BlackRock and Blackstone illustrate how this convergence between fossil fuel power and digital infrastructure is accelerating. BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners recently won approval for its $6.2 billion acquisition of Minnesota-based energy utility ALLETE and is now pursuing a $38 billion takeover of AES Corp.—the largest utility acquisition in U.S. history. Blackstone has announced an $11 billion deal to acquire New Mexico’s largest utility, TXNM Energy, further consolidating private equity control over both the data and energy systems that underpin modern life.

“Private equity is accelerating fossil fuel buildouts to power the AI boom, and the public is paying the price,” said Amanda Mendoza, Senior Climate and Energy Researcher at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “These firms are keeping gas plants online and taking over utilities to secure energy for data centers, locking in pollution and higher bills while delaying the shift away from fossil fuels.”

Private equity’s reach is especially concentrated in smaller and developing economies. In Togo and Panama, more than half of national gas-fired capacity is owned or financed by private equity firms; in Jamaica and the Philippines, the figure is roughly one-third. In the United Kingdom, more than one-fifth of gas plants in development already have private equity ties.

“The growth of private equity-owned gas power plants cuts into hopes of progress on renewable energy,” said Hibba Meraay, Research Analyst at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund. “By backing these gas power plants, private equity contributes to global warming while placing an uneven burden of health risks and increased emissions on the global south where many of the plants are located.”

The report, developed through the PECR collaboration between Global Energy Monitor, the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, and Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, combines financial data with facility-level emissions tracking to provide one of the clearest pictures to date of private equity’s fossil fuel footprint.",https://pestakeholder.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/cropped-Gas-plant-with-pollution-dark-clouds.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 15:01:12.551154

HARRISBURG, Pa. — In a major setback for Pennsylvania’s environment, economy, and public health, Governor Josh Shapiro and House Democratic leadership agreed to the demands of Senate Republicans to abandon the 11-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) as part of the state budget deal.

Finalized on Earth Day in 2022, the regulation linking Pennsylvania to RGGI would have placed a cap on climate-disrupting carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution from power plants that declined by 3% per year. Generators would comply with the emissions limits by purchasing and retiring an allowance for each ton of CO2 they release, and proceeds from the sale were to be deposited in the state’s Clean Air Fund for investment in projects to further improve air quality, such as clean energy development and energy efficiency measures.

Coal and gas interests and Republican legislators immediately appealed the rule, and it has been tied up in the courts for over three years. The state Supreme Court heard oral arguments in May, and was expected to issue a ruling on the constitutionality of the rule soon. Since RGGI implementation has been on hold, Pennsylvania has missed out at least $3 billion dollars in allowance proceeds that could have been re-invested to transform our energy economy.

This deal leaves Pennsylvania with no policy in place to limit the amount of climate disrupting pollution from any sector of our economy.

In response, Tom Schuster, Director of the Sierra Club Pennsylvania Chapter, issued the following statement:

“It is unconscionable that Senate Republicans’ top demand in this budget negotiation was continued, unfettered climate destabilization for the sake of polluter profits. And it is beyond disappointing that Governor Shapiro and House Democrats gave in to that demand.

RGGI is the single most effective tool available to achieve the Governor’s own stated goals to “address climate change, protect and create energy jobs, and ensure Pennsylvania has reliable, affordable, and clean power for the long term.” When introducing his Lightning Plan, Governor Shapiro himself said, “Doing nothing at this moment is not an option.” Yet giving up RGGI without a replacement is doing exactly nothing.

As states across the country drive the clean energy revolution, Pennsylvania is mired in 49th place in renewable energy growth. Walking away from RGGI and its billions of dollars in targeted investments betrays Pennsylvania workers, communities, and families who are counting on clean, reliable, affordable power and a fair shot at the new energy economy. The Commonwealth deserves leadership that fights for a liveable future, rather than selling out for short-term political bargains. ”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-13 12:02:05.815551

In fact, North Carolina added 3,254 clean energy jobs last year – which ranks eighth in the United States, above Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Colorado.

“These numbers demonstrate that clean energy continued to be a workhorse for workforce growth in North Carolina in 2024, far outpacing the state’s economy as a whole on job creation,” said Zach Amittay, E2’s Southeast Advocate. “It’s an economic imperative that policymakers recognize this and take action to support the continued growth of clean energy jobs. Unfortunately, we’re seeing the opposite from too many of our state and federal government leaders.”

Jobs in energy efficiency, renewable generation, storage and grid, and other clean energy subsectors continued to grow faster than the broader economy, accounting for an increasingly large share of the state’s workforce. Energy efficiency accounts for over 70 percent of North Carolina’s clean energy jobs, supporting 80,817 jobs in 2024.

However, clean vehicles-related jobs saw a slight dip in 2024, losing 234 jobs after hitting a record high of 9,522 workers at the end of 2023. Clean vehicles-related jobs took a similar hit across the country, as did jobs related to internal combustion engine vehicles.

“North Carolina’s deep bench of skilled workers is one of the things that keeps solar and storage a low-cost source of electricity,” said Chris Carmody, Executive Director of the Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association.

Though not reflected in the 2024 data, recent policy actions by Congress and the Trump administration—to kill projects, revoke tax credits, cancel permits and add new regulatory red tape—have already caused major job losses in the clean energy industry, with more expected to come. According to separate E2 research, since January 2025 companies canceled $1.4 billion in planned clean energy related factories and other projects in North Carolina that were expected to create over 1,000 new jobs.

“Clean energy jobs in North Carolina are more than careers—they’re catalysts for thriving communities,” said Jen Weiss, Co-Director at the Clean Energy Fund of the Carolinas. “By embracing clean energy, we’re creating local wealth, strengthening neighborhoods, and building a future where prosperity is shared by all.”

As clean energy companies and investors are reeling from federal decisions to slash clean energy support, the sector’s importance to the region’s overall economy is clearer than ever. Clean energy now accounts for nearly half of all energy and vehicle-related jobs in the state, and over 2 percent of all jobs. Industry-wide, nearly 67 percent of the sector’s jobs (over 75,500 jobs) are in construction or professional services.

“Renewable energy projects offer significant economic mobility and workforce development opportunities to our communities across the state,” said Mozine Lowe, Center for Energy Education’s Executive Director. “Education and sound strategies inform real-world perspectives that facilitate and promote conversation, collaboration and action plans, highlighting opportunities for us to grow and thrive in our environmental path toward a zero-carbon future.”

Mecklenburg County is home to more than 19,700 clean energy workers, tops in North Carolina.

Methodology

This analysis of U.S. clean energy employment is based on employment data collected and analyzed by the BW Research Partnership for the 2025 U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER). The USEER analyzes data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) to track employment across many energy production, transmission and distribution subsectors. In addition, the 2025 USEER relies on a unique supplemental survey of 42,800 business representatives across the United States. Created and conducted by BW Research, the methodology has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This survey is used to identify energy-related employment within key subsectors of the broader industries as classified by the BLS and to assign them into their component energy and energy efficiency sectors.

A full methodology on the sectors and types of jobs this analysis includes and does not include is available in E2’s Clean Jobs America report here.

Mike Stivala, President and Chief Executive Officer, Suburban Propane Partners: Thanks, Devin, and thank you all for joining us today. Fiscal 2025 was another outstanding year for Suburban Propane. In our core propane business, propane demand was strong as a result of a sustained period of more normal winter weather in the heart of our footprint from mid-December through February, the most critical months for heat-related demand, as well as strong demand in our southeast operations in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the first fiscal quarter, and incremental volumes from our acquisition of a well-run propane business in our southwest territory, which we closed in November 2024. I’m extremely proud of how our field personnel at every level worked tirelessly to meet the surge in demand when our customers needed us most, while also opportunistically taking on new business when some of our competitors were unable to keep up.

This was a real testament to the preparation by our operations teams and the flexibility of our operating model to ramp up when demand dictates. With safety as our highest priority, what’s even more impressive is how our employees performed during a prolonged stretch of very high activity levels and some harsh operating conditions while not compromising on our highest standards for safety. As a result, propane volumes for the fiscal 2025 increased nearly 6% compared to the prior year. Strong volumes, combined with effective margin management during a rising commodity price environment, and good expense discipline contributed to a $28 million, or 11.2%, increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to the prior year. In addition to the higher earnings, we had a number of key accomplishments in fiscal 2025 in support of our long-term strategic growth initiatives.

Just to highlight a few, we acquired and integrated a well-run propane business in strategic markets in New Mexico and Arizona for a total consideration of approximately $53 million. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2025, just in October of 2025, we further invested in the growth of our core propane business with the acquisition of two high-quality businesses in attractive markets in California for a total consideration of $24 million. We created a dedicated sales and business development team focused on specific propane verticals that are less weather-sensitive and present opportunities for growth, as the advantages of propane become a bigger part of the conversation. These verticals include opportunities in material handling, agriculture, power generation, and over-the-road vehicles. We continue to identify and foster new market expansion opportunities to establish and extend our presence in certain attractive markets.

We secured incremental supply of renewable propane and exceeded 2 million gallons of renewable propane sales, focused primarily in the California market, coupled with expansion into the Florida and Virginia markets to meet customer demand for a renewable alternative. We entered into a multi-year partnership with NASCAR and Speedway Motorsports, making Suburban Propane the official propane partner of NASCAR and Speedway Motorsports, reflecting the reliability of our national presence and demonstrating the power and versatility of propane at one of America’s top spectator sports.

In our R&G operations, we continue to implement several operational improvements at our Stanfield, Arizona facility to stabilize and grow R&G production, enhance safety protocols, modify feedstock intake practices, and improve our overall plant efficiency to strengthen the long-term performance and returns of the facility, while also advancing the capital projects at our Columbus, Ohio, and upstate New York facilities, both of which are expected to come online in the first half of fiscal 2026. We also expanded our R&G management team with dedicated safety, construction, and compliance personnel to bring more expertise in-house. Focusing on our balance sheet, we launched an at-the-market equity program to sell up to $100 million of newly issued common units, raising $23.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of 1.3 million common units at attractive prices during fiscal 2025.

Proceeds from the ATM program are being used to support our ongoing pursuit of opportunistic growth and to accelerate debt reduction. During the year, using excess cash flows and proceeds from the ATM program, we deployed nearly $53 million for propane acquisitions, over $25 million for our growth projects in the RNG business, and reduced our overall debt by nearly $2 million. With the increased earnings and slightly lower outstanding debt, we ended fiscal 2025 with a leverage ratio of 4.29 times, a significant improvement from 4.76 times at the end of the prior year. In addition to the strong operating and financial performance, during fiscal 2025, we embarked on a multi-year technology modernization initiative that will simplify the way we operate, consolidate our systems platform, and improve the tools we use to serve our customers, delivering a better experience for both our employees and our customers.

This initiative will not change our personalized hyperlocal business model that sets Suburban Propane apart as best-in-class operators within the propane industry. Fiscal 2025 was a very successful year for Suburban Propane, both in terms of our financial performance and from executing on our long-term strategic growth plans, while remaining patient and disciplined to maintain financial flexibility through a strong balance sheet. A little later, I’ll provide some closing remarks. However, at this point, I’ll turn the call over to Mike Kuglin, who will discuss our full-year and fourth quarter results in more detail. Mike.

Mike Kuglin, Chief Financial Officer, Suburban Propane Partners: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I’ll start by focusing on our full-year results, link us in color in the fourth quarter toward the end of my remarks. To be consistent with previous reporting, I’m excluding the impact of unrealized non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on our commodity hedges, which resulted in an unrealized gain of $2.4 million in fiscal 2025, compared to an unrealized loss of $14.6 million in the prior year, along with certain other non-cash items we’ve identified in the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA in the press release. Including these items, net income for fiscal 2025 was $128.4 million, or $1.97 per common unit, compared to $107.7 million, or $1.68 per common unit in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2025 was $278 million, an increase of $28 million, or 11.2%, compared to the prior year.

Retail propane gallons sold for fiscal 2025 were 400.5 million gallons, an increase of 5.9% compared to the prior year. The volume increase was driven by sustained widespread cold temperatures during the most critical months for heat-related demand, increased demand for backup power generation and other applications in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, continued growth in our counter-seasonal national accounts business, and incremental volumes from our recent propane acquisitions. With respect to the weather, average temperatures for fiscal 2025 were 9% warmer than normal and 4% cooler than the prior year. During January and February, average temperatures were comparable to normal and 13% colder than the same period last year. From a commodity perspective, average wholesale propane prices for fiscal 2025 were $0.79 per gallon, based at Mount Belvieu, which was 5.8% higher than the prior year.

According to the most recent report from the Energy Information Administration, U.S. propane inventories at the end of last week were at 106 million barrels, which was 6% higher than a year ago and 13% higher than historical averages for this time of year. Given the strength of inventories, wholesale propane prices have trended down from the end of the fiscal year and are currently in the $0.60 range, compared to the $0.80 range at the same time last year. Excluding the impact of the mark-to-market adjustments on our commodity hedges that I mentioned earlier, total gross margin of $866.4 million for fiscal 2025 increased $46.8 million, or 5.7%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher propane volumes sold and higher propane unit margins.

Excluding the impact of the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, propane unit margins for fiscal 2025 increased 2 cents per gallon, or 1%, with margin expansion experienced across all customer categories. In our RNG operations, average daily RNG injection for the fiscal year was approximately 13% lower compared to the prior year, primarily due to downtime experienced, several operational improvement projects designed to enhance future RNG production, as well as the multiple power outages and extremely cold ambient air temperatures in the Arizona area during the winter that impacted anaerobic digestion. While we remain focused on executing controllable operational improvements, revenues at the Stanfield facility continue to face headwinds from lower prices, both California LCFS credits and federal D3 RINs. California LCFS credit prices remain depressed relative to historical levels, though average prices for fiscal 2025 increased 2.5% compared to the prior year.

We were encouraged to see the finalization of amendments to the LCFS program implemented by CARB made effective as of July 1, 2025, which accelerated carbon reduction targets and aimed to create a better balance in the LCFS credit bank. Since the amendments were finalized in June 2025, LCFS credit prices have increased over 30%. Conversely, average federal D3 RIN prices for fiscal 2025 decreased 25% compared to the prior year. With respect to expenses, combined operating and energy and expenses increased $23.7 million, or 4.2%, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll, benefit-related expenses, overtime, and other variable operating costs to support the increased activities associated with incremental customer demand, as well as higher variable compensation expense associated with the increase in earnings and costs related to the technology initiative that Mike mentioned earlier.

Net interest expense of $76.3 million for fiscal 2025 increased $1.7 million compared to the prior year due to higher average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by lower benchmark interest rates. Total capital spending for fiscal 2025 of $72 million was $12.5 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to advancing construction efforts at our RNG facilities in Columbus, Ohio, and upstate New York. For fiscal 2026, capital spending for our propane operations is expected to be consistent with historical levels, which is between $40-$45 million, and CapEx for the RNG projects is expected to range between $30-$35 million, with the spending concentrated in the first half of the fiscal year.

We expect the capital spending at our RNG facility in upstate New York to qualify for investment tax credit under Inflation Reduction Act at a rate of 30%, which equates to a range of $7-$9 million in tax credits, which could be earned and monetized when the asset is placed into service. Turning to our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, assisted with the seasonality of our business, we typically report a net loss for the fourth quarter. With that said, and excluding the effects of certain non-cash items in both years, we reported a net loss of $35.7 million for the fourth quarter, or $0.54 per common unit, which was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $700,000, which was also essentially flat compared to the prior year.

Retail propane gallons sold during the fourth quarter increased 1.8% compared to the prior year. Total gross margin increased $5.3 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher volume sold and higher unit margins. Combined operating and GMA expenses increased to $5.8 million, or 4.5%, primarily due to higher volume-related variable operating costs, higher variable compensation, and costs related to our technology initiative. Excluded from adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is an impairment charge of approximately $6 million to fully write down the carrying value of our investment in an early-stage energy technology company, as well as income from the reversal of an earn-out reserve associated with the R&G acquisition. The earn-out was contingent upon the acquired assets achieving a certain EBITDA threshold over a certain period. During the fourth quarter, we determined that the contingent consideration would not be earned.

These non-cash items were reported within other net and statement of operations. Turning to our balance sheet, during the fiscal year, we utilized a combination of cash flows from operating activities and net proceeds of $23.5 million from mutuals and common units under the ATM program to fund a propane acquisition for a total consideration of $53 million, with gross capital expenditures of $25.5 million to advance the construction activities at our RNG production facilities and repayment of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $1.8 million. With the improvement in earnings and debt reduction, our consolidated leverage ratio for fiscal 2025 improved 4.29 times. We have more than ample borrowing capacity under our revolver to support the completion of our planned capital expansion projects, as well as our ongoing strategic growth initiatives.

As we continue to focus on the execution of our long-term strategic goals, we also stay focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet. With that, we’ll turn it back to Mike.

Mike Stivala, President and Chief Executive Officer, Suburban Propane Partners: Thanks, Mike. As announced in our October 23rd press release, our board of supervisors declared our quarterly distribution of $0.325 per common unit in respect of the first fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. That equates to an annualized rate of $1.30 per common unit. The quarterly distribution was paid yesterday, November 12th, due to the Federal Reserve closing on the 11th for Veterans Day, to our unit holders of record as of November 4th. Our distribution coverage continues to remain healthy at 2.13 times for the trailing 12 months ended September 2025. I also want to take a moment to thank and honor our great American veterans for their service, including so many that are part of the Suburban Propane family now that we just passed Veterans Day. So just a few closing remarks regarding our long-term strategy.

Our long-term strategic growth plan remains to foster the growth of our core propane business while making strategic investments in lower carbon renewable energy alternatives through our Suburban Renewable Energy subsidiary, leveraging our core competencies in safety, customer service, and logistics, especially in the localized energy distribution markets. The energy evolution is a long journey, one that requires a pragmatic and balanced approach to identifying and fostering energy solutions that can lower greenhouse gas emissions and our country’s overall carbon footprint. It requires solutions that can deliver energy that is reliable, affordable, and sustainable. We have definitely seen a shift in the conversation that is benefiting the propane industry by recognizing propane’s versatile, affordable, on-demand nature, and its clean qualities as an immediate and long-term solution to helping lower the carbon footprint.

We are very well positioned to take advantage of this growing respect for propane, given our operational and financial strength and stability. We are also maintaining our focus on innovation to ensure that Suburban Propane continues to be regarded as a trusted local distributor of energy for decades to come. That innovation includes our advancements in delivering renewable propane and renewable natural gas as direct drop-in replacements for their traditional energy equivalents. The energy evolution is in the early innings. The investments we have made have been very measured and focused on long-term growth and sustainability. It is great to see a more pragmatic approach toward the energy evolution, and also great to see a supportive regulatory and policy framework that contemplates a more deliberate and inclusive environment to drive down emissions over time, and within all of the above philosophy for energy solutions.

We’re very excited to be starting a new heating season, and our people and platform are very well prepared to handle whatever this year’s weather dictates. With that, I want to thank our more than 3,300 employees for helping make fiscal 2025 another outstanding year for Suburban Propane, and for their unwavering commitment to safety for our customers, our employees, and the communities we serve. I hope you and your families remain safe and healthy, and I wish everyone a very happy holiday season. We appreciate your support. We’d now like to open the call up for questions. Rob, if you could help us with that.

The decision, which was announced Thursday morning in London, appears to be an effort to create a British nuclear champion and a move to increase the government’s role in the economy, especially the energy sector.

The Wales plant would also be the first of this type of nuclear plant to be built in Britain. Modular designs are promoted as cheaper and quicker to construct.

Rolls-Royce SMR, an affiliate of the jet engine maker that is one of Britain’s few remaining large industrial companies, will design the power station at Wylfa, a rocky headland on the island that overlooks the Irish Sea.

Rolls-Royce is trying to parlay its experience designing and building the reactors for Britain’s nuclear submarines into a new business line. It has brought in investors, including the Qatar Investment Authority, the Persian Gulf emirate’s sovereign wealth fund; Constellation, an American utility; and CEZ, the Czech Republic’s power company.

The Wales plant will consist of three units, known as small modular reactors, or SMRs, whose power output will add up to a little less than half that of one of the current generation of giant power stations.

These “mini-nuclear reactors are smaller and quicker to build” than some larger ones, the government said in a news release. The plan is to lower costs through assembling modules from components in factories and then setting them up on site.

The government is betting that these smaller reactors will give Britain a technology with low carbon emissions and “global export opportunities.” It has pledged 2.5 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) for preliminary work on the site and other preparation. The additional cost of completing the plant may be financed through charges on electric bills, a strategy the government is using to draw investors to another plant, Sizewell C, being built in eastern England.

The government said the plant would support 3,000 local jobs and power three million homes. By comparison, Sizewell C is projected to create 8,000 jobs at peak construction and light six million homes.

The government, though, is taking something of a gamble. Small modular reactors like the one proposed by Rolls-Royce are relatively new in the global nuclear industry. Such leadership could bring both advantages and unexpected problems.

Britain, which is trying to construct nuclear plants after a long hiatus, has already been badly burned by delays and cost overruns at a giant plant being built on the west coast of England at Hinkley Point.

In addition, some critics say the government is making a mistake by not building a larger plant at Wylfa that would generate more electricity and create more jobs. The nuclear industry considers Wylfa the most advantageous of potential British sites because of its bedrock location and easy access to deep water for cooling.

In a statement on Wednesday, Unite, a large trade union, said building the small modular plant at Wylfa was “a missed opportunity.”

The union said that although the smaller plant would provide “some employment opportunities,” those from a larger model would be “far greater.”

In addition, the choice is likely to disappoint Washington, an important ally, and the American nuclear industry, which has been courting Britain. The United States recently signed an ambitious nuclear cooperation deal with Britain.

“We are extremely disappointed by this decision, not least because there are cheaper, faster, and already-approved options to provide clean, safe energy at this same location,” Warren Stephens, the U.S. ambassador to Britain, said in a statement.

The British government, though, is eager to move forward with small nuclear reactors and may have calculated that lining up an American giant would take years.

Keir Starmer, the prime minister, also probably wanted something to happen quickly at Wylfa, whose future has been in doubt since Hitachi walked away from building a power station there in 2019 after spending around £2 billion. A 1960s-era plant at Wylfa closed in 2015.

“It might simply be that Wylfa is the fastest site they can possibly bring online for SMRs, so they’ve gone for that,” said Adam Bell, a former senior British energy official who is now director of policy at Stonehaven, a consulting firm.

Edward T. Jones, a senior lecturer in economics at Bangor University in North Wales, said the local community, which was stunned by Hitachi’s departure, might not be prepared to cash in on the opportunities offered by the new plant. “They’ve been burnt once and don’t want to be burnt again,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12biz-uk-nuclear-htfb/12biz-uk-nuclear-htfb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 13:01:27.153943

Streamlining Oversight for the Carbon Storage Economy

The ruling follows a comprehensive technical and legal review confirming that Texas’ Underground Injection Control (UIC) program meets federal standards.

“Approving Texas’ request to be in charge of this critical program is a big step forward for cooperative federalism—as big as the state of Texas,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “The Railroad Commission of Texas has demonstrated that the state is ready, willing, and able to add Class VI wells to its underground injection control program.”

With primacy, the state can directly issue permits for new carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, cutting wait times and removing bureaucratic hurdles that have slowed deployment nationwide.

By making clean energy the foundation for job creation and economic opportunity, we can turn today’s milestones into a future where clean power drives growth and ensures prosperity for all.","WASHINGTON, DC – This year marks a historic milestone: for the first time, global renewable-energy production has surpassed coal. In the first half of 2025, renewables accounted for more than 34% of the world’s electricity, while coal’s share fell to just above 33%. Notably, these gains were largely driven by emerging economies.

As the world’s attention turns to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30), this milestone serves as a powerful reminder that the clean-energy transition is already underway. Having led investments at the US International Development Finance Corporation and now serving as chief investment officer at the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, I know a promising business opportunity when I see one.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 91% of new renewable-energy projects are now cheaper than their fossil-fuel counterparts. This finding provides clear evidence that, despite the ongoing growth in coal and oil use, renewables are both economically and technically viable throughout much of the world.

We cannot afford to let today’s momentum slip away.

To reduce climate pollution, promote sustainable economic growth, and strengthen energy resilience where it is needed most, we must build on these achievements. As we approach the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, meaningful global climate action is still possible, even in the face of escalating geopolitical tensions and competing national priorities.

Yet such progress is inherently fragile. All too often, clean-energy adoption stalls once the infrastructure is in place. Solar projects, for example, can fail when communities lack the necessary tools and financing to make full use of the electricity they produce.

Providing solar panels is not enough. To lock in the benefits of renewables, governments must invest not only in power generation but also in systems, training, and equipment – such as electric mills and water pumps – that enable communities and countries to harness clean energy for business growth and job creation.

When implemented effectively, such investments deliver benefits across the board. Climate goals advance as renewables replace costly, polluting fuels. Communities gain access to affordable power, enabling them to improve education and health care, create jobs, and raise incomes. And with energy companies profiting from rising demand, emerging economies can attract new investment.

The challenge is enormous, but so is the opportunity. The World Bank projects that 1.2 billion young people in developing economies will reach working age over the next decade, but that only 420 million new jobs will be created by then. Access to clean energy, and the opportunities it brings, offers a way to bridge this gap before it becomes a global crisis. The World Economic Forum estimates that the renewables industry alone could generate more than 30 million jobs and mobilize $2.2-2.8 trillion annually. Embedding renewable technologies into other downstream sectors such as industry and agriculture could create a further 500 million new jobs and improve the quality of 700 million existing ones.

To succeed, we must align energy policies with broader development objectives, integrate renewables into local industries, and accelerate investment in the equipment and training needed to use it effectively.

Across Africa, this approach is already delivering tangible results. In Nigeria, farmers and traders are increasingly using solar-powered irrigation pumps, cold-storage facilities, and mills. These investments, in turn, have fueled a wave of distributed renewable-energy projects that are rapidly transforming local power systems.

In the Amazon, where COP30 is underway, the government of Brazil is investing $800 million to expand energy access and transition away from reliance on diesel. My organization is helping to ensure that this new renewable energy creates jobs and powers sustainable economic development for thousands of farmers and entrepreneurs.

India offers a useful model for emerging economies seeking to strengthen their power grids and absorb growing renewable capacity. In New Delhi, the country’s first commercial, utility-scale battery-energy storage system – the largest in South Asia – now guarantees a reliable supply of clean electricity to 100,000 low-income households and businesses. Meanwhile, solar plants in Rajasthan provide steady daytime power to 40,000 farmers. And in Uttar Pradesh, a women’s entrepreneurship program aims to help 500,000 women-owned businesses adopt clean-energy technologies by 2030.

Together, these examples show that the clean-energy transition is within reach. But with 685 million people worldwide lacking electricity, and more than a billion relying on unaffordable or unreliable supply, there is still a long way to go.

The choice before us is clear: continue investing in renewables or slide back into fossil-fuel dependence. By making clean energy the foundation for job creation and economic opportunity, we can turn today’s milestones into a future where clean power drives growth and ensures prosperity for all.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/c048b7cdf1aac36ce0acb52e1f091bd5.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:02:12.219780

Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) slammed the Trump Administration after a new report showed that energy prices are increasing under the Trump Administration. In Virginia, households are paying on average $130 more– a 7.3 percent increase – in annual energy costs compared to last year. This comes after President Donald Trump declared an “energy emergency” to cancel clean energy projects across the country.

“President Trump promised Americans lower costs, energy independence, and more good paying jobs, yet he is canceling energy projects across Virginia and the country, triggering higher utility bills, weakening the American power grid, growing our reliance on foreign energy, and cutting jobs,” said Warner. “In the Senate, my Democratic colleagues and I are focused on diversifying America’s energy sources, and we’re going to continue doing everything we can to lower utility costs for families.”

“The U.S. was producing more energy than any country in the world, but on President Trump’s first day in office, he declared an ‘energy emergency’ to cancel clean energy projects across the country, including in Virginia. I’ve forced votes in the Senate to overturn this sham emergency, but my Republican colleagues have refused to do so,” said Kaine. “Now, Americans are paying the price. This new report underscores what I’ve been saying all along: we must stop President Trump’s war on American-made energy that is killing jobs and raising energy costs for Virginians.”

Democrats have made significant investments in clean energy, spurring the highest levels of factory construction in U.S. history with more than 400,000 new jobs announced across the country. However, Trump’s “energy emergency” and Republicans’ rollback of provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act are killing these new jobs, weakening the power grid, increasing our reliance on foreign energy, and raising energy costs.

The announcement, made on Thursday (Nov 13), was described by Labour as “proof that two Labour governments working together are delivering for Wales.” The project is expected to create thousands of skilled jobs, attract billions of pounds in investment, and re-establish Anglesey as a hub for energy generation.

Labour: “A new era for Wales”

Welsh Labour said the move marks the start of a new era for clean energy, aligning with its target of meeting 100% of electricity demand from renewables by 2035.

A spokesperson said: “The Welsh Labour Government is seizing the green opportunities of the future, making the most of our landscape, and taking action to deliver clean energy, good jobs, and cheaper bills. This is Labour’s vision for renewable energy — made here in Wales.”

The party highlighted recent initiatives including Trydan Gwyrdd, a publicly-owned renewable developer aiming to power 350,000 Welsh homes with new wind farms by 2030, and Ynni Cymru, which supports local hydro and solar energy projects.

Anglesey Council: “Prosperity for decades to come”

Anglesey Council Leader and Economic Development portfolio holder, Councillor Gary Pritchard, welcomed the decision, calling it “an important step forward for new nuclear build on Ynys Môn.”

He said: “If, as we hope, these plans come to fruition – it will mean economic certainty and prosperity for decades to come. Despite past disappointments, we remain committed to hosting a new nuclear on the condition that it delivers long-term transformational benefits – in terms of local jobs, supply chain opportunities, and prosperity for our communities and residents.”

Anglesey’s Chief Executive, Dylan J. Williams, added that the development could “transform the economy of Ynys Môn, particularly the north of the Island and North Wales,” but stressed that the council would “work to mitigate negative impacts” on local residents and ensure “the voices of north Anglesey are fully taken into account.”

Lib Dems: “Local jobs and training must come first”

Welsh Liberal Democrat Westminster Spokesperson David Chadwick MP said he welcomed steps to improve energy security but warned against the use of outside contractors.

“I welcome any moves to improve our energy security, but this must translate into real jobs for local people, not outside contractors flown in for a few years,” he said.

“The focus should be on training, apprenticeships, and long-term opportunities that strengthen communities. Wales has the natural resources to lead a green energy revolution through tidal energy and offshore wind, but we need to see this same level of investment extended to projects like the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon.”

Unite: “A step forward but a missed opportunity”

Trade union Unite said the announcement was welcome but criticised the government for not opting for a larger gigawatt-scale nuclear station at Wylfa.

General secretary Sharon Graham said: “Unite is a strong supporter of the development of SMRs, but a failure to support a giga-watt nuclear power station at Wylfa would be a huge missed opportunity in securing the UK’s energy security.

“The UK is crying out for a joined-up energy strategy that ensures long-term energy security while maximising well-paid, highly skilled jobs for British workers.”

Unite national officer Simon Coop added: “While there are several places where SMRs could be sited, Wylfa is by far the best placed for a giga-watt nuclear power station. This would bring substantial jobs and investment to Anglesey.”

Reform UK: “Long overdue”

Reform UK Wales also welcomed the news but accused successive governments of dragging their feet.

A spokesperson said: “This announcement is long overdue and, if the political will had been there, we could have been well on our way to generating nuclear power from Wylfa by now.

“With energy costs soaring and unemployment rising in Wales, we should be taking a lead on nuclear power, not dawdling as we have done now for many years. Sadly, lukewarm support from Plaid Cymru for nuclear has also played a role in slowing this down.”

A new chapter for Wylfa

The original Wylfa Nuclear Power Station, near Cemaes, provided stable employment from the 1960s until its decommissioning in 2015. If the new project goes ahead as planned, it would mark the revival of one of Wales’ most iconic industrial sites — bringing new life and purpose to Anglesey’s north coast.

However, with questions over scale, local employment, and community impact still to be resolved, the challenge now is to ensure that Wylfa’s future truly delivers for the people of Wales.",https://herald.wales/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wylfa-nuclear-power-station-e1758076733193.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:02:17.464757

Create’s ambitious plans to bring the US solar supply chain under one roof reflect a broader consolidation trend in the hardware and BOS sector.
In offering simplified procurement options – Solon’s “one-stop-shop” – firms such as Nextpower and Create Energy will anticipate strong positions in the US renewables market.","The company said the connector will be designed to withstand the mechanical stress and environmental conditions unique to solar trackers, and Create said it would harness Stäubli’s expertise and material strength to “enhance connector longevity, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall energy yield”.

“The misuse of PV connectors in the tracker market has been a huge issue, compromising EBOS [electrical balance-of-system] integrity and long-term performance,” said Dean Solon, founder and CEO at Create Energy.

Production is slated to begin in 2026, Tennessee-based Create said, with distribution in North America and international markets.

“I have been friends with Ian Pratt and the North American Stäubli team for over 20 years,” Solon said. “This partnership with Stäubli allows us to deliver a purpose-built solution that not only solves this problem but also pushes the industry forward. Another partner in our un-evil empire!”

Create Energy is aiming to establish a US solar and renewables manufacturing “one-stop-shop” for PV hardware, balance-of-system components, energy storage solutions and electric vehicle infrastructure. Its OnTrack programme “allows customers to purchase everything they need directly from Create”, the company said.

Stäubli has also announced plans to expand its US manufacturing base, investing millions in its California and South Carolina manufacturing plants last year.

US solar supply consolidation

Create has established other partnerships with European manufacturers to establish US production lines. In September it unveiled a partnership with German solar inverter producer SMA Solar to establish US inverter production, specifically aiming to produce SMA’s Sunny Highpower PEAK3 string inverter and PowerSkid turnkey solution. If successful, this plan would result in the first US-produced SMA products since it abandoned its previous facility in 2016.

In comments to PV Tech, Solon outlined his plans for Create’s “one-stop-shop” supply model.

His aim is to change the current market landscape, where “the typical company buys this module, buys this tracker, buys this e-bos, buys this inverter, buys this blah, blah, blah, right?” And at each step of the procurement process, each supplier adds a profit margin. “The project becomes expensive as hell,” Solon said in an interview with PV Tech following the announcement of SMA partnership.

“So what we’re doing is… we have a menu board. Like McDonald’s. I want a burger, I want burger and fries, or I want a combo meal. You drive up, you order what you want, you pick it up at the window, right? So, with us, we have a menu board; take what you want.”

The “menu” in this case consists of modules, trackers, EBOS systems, connectors, inverters; any part of the solar array a developer might need.

“And then we’ll have a lot of this material just sitting in warehouses ready to ship,” he says.

Create’s ambitious plans to bring the US solar supply chain under one roof reflect a broader consolidation trend in the hardware and BOS sector. US tracker producer Nextracker announced a rebrand this week to reflect its shifting focus towards “full-platform” energy solutions.

Now known as Nextpower, the company has been on an acquisition spree in recent months, broadening its offering from tracker production to include module frame manufacturing, EBOS solutions and solar project foundations. Fellow US tracker firms, Array Technologies and FTC Solar have also made acquisitions in recent months.

The already complex US solar supply landscape became harder with the election of Donald Trump and the passage of the “One, Big, Beautiful” budget reconciliation bill, which introduced more stringent supply criteria for renewable energy projects alongside the US president’s imposition of global tariffs on imports.

This project not only delivers clean and reliable energy to the national grid, but has also been a driving force for employment, training, and development for the communities in Tolima,” said Rubén Borja, country manager at Atlas Renewable Energy in Colombia.

A power purchase agreement for the project was signed with an unnamed “leading Colombian company” last year, when Atlas acquired the project from Colombian solar company Rayo Energia.

Moreover, the Shangri-La Solar Plant is part of a partnership with Colombian energy company Isagen, which is a subsidiary of Canadian asset owner Brookfield Asset Management, to develop, build and operate 1GW of solar PV projects in Colombia over the coming years.

The firms’ joint venture, RV Tech, is making advancements on an EV electrical and software platform for Volkswagen.

It has begun engaging third parties on its scalability.

RV Tech’s near-term focus is delivering the platform for Rivian and Volkswagen models, with testing scheduled on Audi, VW and Scout vehicles from the first quarter of 2026.

The partners set up the JV a year ago, combining developers and engineers from both companies.

They are adopting Rivian’s centralised electronics architecture with fewer computing units to simplify development and reducing expenses.

Rivian software chief and RV Tech co-chair Wassym Bensaid said: “We’re solving a problem for the larger automotive industry.

“That could become an opportunity.”

The technology is engineered to be scalable across multiple vehicle sizes and segments in Western markets.

It also shares elements that could be applied to combustion-engine models, RV Tech co-chair Carsten Helbing said.

The inaugural model to use the solution will be Rivian’s R2 SUV, due early 2026.

Volkswagen’s compact ID. EVERY1, anticipated to cost around €20,000 ($23,000), is slated for 2027, followed by Scout-branded models.

Volkswagen also maintains a separate partnership with Xpeng for China.

Volkswagen has previously licensed its first-generation EV platform to Ford and Mahindra & Mahindra.

The German group is turning to Rivian as it faces US tariffs, softer demand in Europe and declining deliveries in China, investing up to $5.8bn in the alliance under CEO Oliver Blume, as per the Bloomberg report.

For Rivian, which is loss-making, the deal provides critical funding amid a broader EV market slowdown.

Volkswagen’s earlier in-house software efforts delayed launches and hurt sales, though recent updates have lifted EV deliveries in Europe.",https://www.just-auto.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/11/JA-shutterstock_2320911447.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:02:58.584980

“It was data centers that really brought it all together.” Olson’s organization is running a campaign to persuade Indiana lawmakers to place a moratorium on new data centers and to redesign electricity rates to protect residential consumers from rate increases related to data center development.
While much of the discussion is about data centers, the underlying issues are broader, touching on the power of tech companies.
For people who live near proposed data centers, there is an additional sense of powerlessness, which Inside Climate News has documented across the country, including the backlash to a plan for a huge data center in Bessemer, Alabama.
Olson said he agrees that there is some overlap between opposition to data centers and large renewable energy development, but he views the latter as more of a rural phenomenon, while concern about data centers is rising almost everywhere.","It’s not a novel observation to say that supporters of President Donald Trump and supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders find common ground on many issues. They often share a skepticism of entrenched power and a desire to dismantle systems that they think have ceased to serve everyday people.

In Indiana, this agreement includes a distrust of data centers.

“The MAGA crowd and the Bernie bros have both figured out that they’ve been getting duped,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer and environmental advocacy nonprofit. “It was data centers that really brought it all together.”

Olson’s organization is running a campaign to persuade Indiana lawmakers to place a moratorium on new data centers and to redesign electricity rates to protect residential consumers from rate increases related to data center development.

He has received an emphatic response, with groups from the left, right and in-between booking him for speaking engagements and offering their assistance.

Election results last week confirm a similar dynamic in much of the country. Democrats won races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and for two open seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, campaigns in which data centers and rising electricity costs were issues. Media outlets noted this pattern, including in an insightful report from Jael Holzman of Heatmap and a look ahead to next year’s elections from Marc Levy and Jesse Bedayn of the Associated Press.

While much of the discussion is about data centers, the underlying issues are broader, touching on the power of tech companies. For people who live near proposed data centers, there is an additional sense of powerlessness, which Inside Climate News has documented across the country, including the backlash to a plan for a huge data center in Bessemer, Alabama.

“It’s about big tech,” Olson said. “To steal Bernie’s words, [it’s about] these big tech oligarchs that are calling all the shots at every single level of government right now.”

I also see some similarities with local opposition to large wind and solar projects, a subject I’ve written a lot about over the years. A common theme is that residents feel frustrated when powerful companies want to make changes that would alter local landscapes.

Olson said he agrees that there is some overlap between opposition to data centers and large renewable energy development, but he views the latter as more of a rural phenomenon, while concern about data centers is rising almost everywhere.

Google scrapped its plans for a large data center in Indianapolis in September amid local backlash. In northwest Indiana, residents in the small city of Hobart have organized to oppose two data centers, raising concerns about the projects’ electricity and water consumption.

It’s notable that the opposition tends to highlight concerns about high electricity bills, but doesn’t talk as much about data centers’ negative climate impacts. Indiana can see the ramifications as officials push to delay the retirement of coal-fired power plants so the state can meet an expected surge in electricity demand, driven, in part, by data centers.

Political candidates can harness this mounting opposition and data center companies will need to devote more resources to engaging with the public.

Vivek Shastry, a senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told me that it’s important for the AI and data center industries to find ways to provide local benefits to host communities and to minimize any negative effects on household electricity costs.

He touched on these subjects in a recent blog post, co-written with his colleague Diana Hernández. When I read this, my first thought was, “Wait, there are local benefits?”

He explained that there are opportunities in terms of energy and money. He pointed to examples in Denmark and Finland of data centers harnessing their waste heat to contribute to district heating systems for local communities.

Beyond that—which I think would be a challenge to do in the United States—he said AI and data center developers can make community benefits part of their proposals. This could mean working with local leaders to find ways to address local needs through philanthropy.

“To the extent that there is a partnership with communities, and there are these pathways to enable tangible co-benefits,” he said.

The opposite can also be true, with local communities feeling like they are bearing the burden of a data center with few, if any, benefits.

Shastry’s larger point is that government officials and corporate leaders need to make sure that development does not harm the most vulnerable consumers by driving up costs of water and electricity. To do otherwise would feed into consumer unrest.

“It’s important to get those processes and protections right early on, because the pace of this growth is such that once you lock into certain kinds of rates and other pathways, it then becomes harder to reverse,” Shastry said.

Voters are already getting upset about electricity rate increases that they blame on data centers, even though the AI industry is in its infancy. The negative effects, if left to fester, could get much worse.

But there also is evidence that state officials have a sense of the challenge before them. The NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University shows this in its most recent quarterly report, the 50 States of Power Decarbonization.

From July to September, state regulators or legislators took 55 actions in 29 states related to laws or rules for large electricity users, which were usually motivated by the growth of data centers.

Some highlights:

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved a proposal from the utility American Electric Power to create a new rate category for data centers that have electricity demand of at least 25 megawatts. Businesses in this category have special requirements, including that they must sign a 12-year contract. The practical effect is that data centers that close or use much less power than planned will still need to pay, which can help to shield other customers from covering the costs of lines and other infrastructure built to serve these large projects.

Florida Power & Light, a utility, entered into a settlement with other parties in a rate case that includes new rate categories for large power users such as data centers. The rates would cover new projects that need at least 50 megawatts, with provisions requiring companies to pay even if they use less power than planned. The Office of Public Counsel has said the settlement is “disproportionately favorable” to corporate interests.

In Delaware, the Public Service Commission staff and the Division of the Public Advocate jointly requested that the utility, Delmarva Power and Light, institute a new rate category for customers that need at least 25 megawatts. Delmarva responded by saying it would like the commission to hold a hearing on the subject.

As recently as two years ago, there was almost no activity in this policy area. Next year at this time, I expect to see action in nearly every state.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

IEA Report Points to Oil Peak and Continuing Renewables Surge, But Trump Has Hurt Progress: The world remains on track to reach peak oil in about 2030 if countries stick to their stated policies, according to the new edition of the World Energy Outlook from the International Energy Agency. But this outlook is worse for the climate than the one issued last year, due in large part to changes in climate policy by President Donald Trump, as my colleague Blanca Begert reports. One key difference is that the drop-off from the peak would be more gradual than the agency had previously indicated. The peak and ensuing decline in fossil fuels would be driven by the rapid growth of carbon-free electricity sources such as wind and solar.

How the Trump Administration Is Seeking to Gut the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations: The Trump administration is proposing a $0 budget for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, underscoring how far the office has fallen since it was a key part of planning for the country’s energy future, as Maria Gallucci reports for Canary Media. The office, which is part of the Department of Energy, was created by Congress in 2021 and received $27 billion to fund projects to scale up clean energy technologies. The sudden shift in funding priorities is ceding leadership to other countries, especially China, and is baffling to people who were connected to the office.

Sunrun Reports a Quadrupling of Participation in Virtual Power Plants: Sunrun, the rooftop solar and battery company, said 106,000 of its customers are now participating in home-to-grid virtual power plant programs, which is an increase of more than 400 percent from a year ago, as Brian Martucci reports for Utility Dive. Sunrun also said its business model, which encourages solar leasing and monthly subscription fees, positions the company to maintain growth even after an expected sales cliff in the rooftop solar industry when federal tax credits expire at the end of the year.

Green Steelmaking Advocates Look for Paths Forward Without U.S. Government Support: The Trump administration’s policies are reducing support for green steelmaking, leading companies and advocates to figure out how to maintain momentum in the short run, as my colleague Kiley Bense reports. The Ohio River Valley Institute, a nonprofit that promotes economic growth and clean energy in Appalachia, issued a report summarizing the effects of federal actions, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s phaseout of a tax credit for clean hydrogen in 2027 rather than the previous 2032. Despite the setbacks, companies are still moving forward with plans to use hydrogen to produce steel, including a plant in Louisiana being built by Hyundai.

The highly anticipated start of production at its all-new battery plant in Liberty, N.C., will supercharge Toyota’s multi-pathway approach to global vehicle electrification, according to a news release.

It is Toyota’s 11th U.S. plant and the company’s first and only battery plant outside of Japan. The nearly $14 billion facility will create up to 5,100 jobs.

This will bring the company’s total U.S. investment to nearly $60 billion since beginning operations here nearly 70 years ago.

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first U.S. battery plant and additional U.S. investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” said Ted Ogawa, president and chief executive officer, Toyota Motor North America. “Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers.”

The 1,850-acre mega site can produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity, Toyota said. It will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries needed for its ever-growing portfolio of electrified vehicles.

Nationally, EV sales hit a record 10.5% of the market this past quarter, according to Cox Automotive.
Obviously, taking away a $7,500 tax credit doesn’t help,” Doll said of the auto market under the Trump administration.
“The other 92% of inventory that dealers sell isn’t affected by that tax credit,” he said.
Anecdotally, he said, he’s already hearing about a dropoff in EV sales at Illinois dealerships.","Illinois squeaked in a record share of electric vehicle sales last quarter, on par with a national trend tied to the Trump administration’s decision to end lucrative federal tax credits.

Still, the state remains far short of Gov. JB Pritzker’s ongoing push to get 1 million electric vehicles on Illinois roads by 2030.

“Sales definitely went up,” Jeff Foltz, president of the independent market analysis firm Auto Outlook, said of purchases both in Illinois and across the country as the end of the tax credit pulled demand forward. “We saw it measured here in market share, and to me, it does speak to demand for battery electric vehicles.”

The third quarter of this year saw EV sales grow to 8.4% of overall vehicle sales in Illinois, a record, according to data from Experian Automotive published in Illinois Auto Outlook, a local publication of Foltz’s group. That was up a percentage point from the same period last year and from 7.1% the previous quarter, the data showed.

The bump in EV purchases followed President Donald Trump’s administration and congressional Republicans’ decision to end federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and $4,000 for used EVs at the end of September, part of a broader tax and spending plan signed over the summer.

Analysts had expected the looming deadline to drive up sales — and it did, in Illinois and across the U.S., as people on the fence about getting a new all-electric vehicle were incentivized to buy before the credit expired.

Nationally, EV sales hit a record 10.5% of the market this past quarter, according to Cox Automotive. But the group also forecast a sales slump in the current quarter as automakers pull back on their plans.

Early state data suggest that pattern is already playing out in Illinois. The secretary of state’s office recorded more than 4,100 EVs purchased in August and 5,400 in September — a sharp increase from earlier months — but only about 1,100 in October, after the federal tax credit expired, according to the office’s data of confirmed and pending vehicle titles.

While the federal tax credit is gone, Illinois still offers a state rebate of up to $4,000 on all-electric vehicles for low-income applicants, according to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, Commonwealth Edison, the state’s largest electric utility, offers rebates to commercial EV buyers and incentives for people charging EVs at home.

The EV purchases in Illinois overall remain about on par with the national average for EV adoption, which hovers around 8.5% to 9%. That national percentage has been pulled up by a few select states, such as California and Oregon, which have rates above 20%, said Foltz, who works on dozens of markets nationwide.

The goal of getting 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030 is etched into Illinois’ Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, the ambitious climate legislation Pritzker signed in 2021 that also phases out fossil fuels over the next two decades.

But even with the recent uptick in EV purchases, Illinois is not on track to hit that goal.

The state has roughly 156,000 fully electric vehicles registered, up from about 33,000 the day Pritzker signed CEJA, but hundreds of thousands short of the 2030 goal, according to the secretary of state’s office data, and now without the benefit of a federal tax credit unless it’s reinstated.

The 156,000 EVs in Illinois, as tracked by the secretary of state’s office, do not include plug-in hybrids, which Pritzker spokeswoman Andres Correa said count toward the 1 million EV goal; however, the governor’s office was unable to provide a total count that includes plug-in hybrids. Nationally, plug-in hybrid adoption represents a far smaller share of the market than battery-only electric vehicles, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

There does not appear to be any consequence laid out in state statute if the state can’t reach 1 million EVs in the next five years. Correa said the state is still working toward the goal with or without buy-in from the federal government.

“Illinois has seen unprecedented growth of electric vehicles in 2025, thanks in part to the state’s leadership and incentives that make it easier for families to make the switch,” Correa said in a statement. “While Donald Trump and his allies have rolled back federal clean energy incentives, Illinois is moving in the opposite direction — continuing to invest in jobs, infrastructure, and consumer savings that come with a clean energy economy.”

Correa said Illinois is “strengthening our EV manufacturing base, maintaining some of the most generous state-level incentives in the nation, and keeping Illinois on the road to a cleaner, more affordable transportation future.”

Illinois’ EV rebate plan, which began in 2022, offers $4,000 to low-income applicants and $2,000 to others. The incentive is expected to drop in 2028.

The state this year restricted the rebate to middle-income and lower-income buyers at 500% or less of the federal poverty line, and it capped the price of eligible vehicles at $80,000, said Brian Urbaszewski, director of environmental health programs at Respiratory Health Association. The goal of that change was getting more EVs into lower-income communities that are disproportionately affected by climate change, he said.

As lower-income buyers are pulled to the front of the line to access a limited rebate pool, some people who apply each year for the state rebate may never receive it, he added.

There have also been bumps in the road as the Trump administration opposes what it describes as EV “mandates” and a rushed transition away from traditional cars.

The Trump administration earlier this year withheld more than $18 million in grants for EV charging stations in Illinois, according to the Pritzker administration, before Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and other state attorneys general successfully sued to restore the funds.

The most recent round of those grants announced in September will fund 167 chargers at 25 charging stations, according to the state. The administration has highlighted that many of the charging stations expected under the grant program are outside Cook County, as it seeks to expand EV adoption statewide.

There are 106 state-funded charging station locations currently online, with more public chargers expected next year through CEJA and federal funding, according to the governor’s office.

Making sure existing federal funds get out the door is a key priority for the Respiratory Health Association, which, as a member of the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, helps shape state policy, Urbaszewski said. The association isn’t specifically pushing for more money in the EV rebate program at this point but is evaluating it and many incentives for EV chargers and adoption, he said.

Getting a million EVs on the road seemed like “a modest goal at the time,” Urbaszewski said, as the state looks to phase out fossil fuels. Now, the federal government is “stopping resources cold that were anticipated to still be there when that goal was set,” he said.

The Illinois Automobile Dealers Association is not currently pursuing any new state incentives to make up for the loss of the federal credit, legal counsel Larry Doll said.

“There are a lot of headwinds right now between the uncertain tariff situation. Obviously, taking away a $7,500 tax credit doesn’t help,” Doll said of the auto market under the Trump administration.

Still, dealers are more focused on other policies, such as a franchise tax issue, and some are readjusting their inventory after they sold off many of their EVs in August and September, he said.

“The other 92% of inventory that dealers sell isn’t affected by that tax credit,” he said.

Anecdotally, he said, he’s already hearing about a dropoff in EV sales at Illinois dealerships.

The program aims to attract $2.8 billion in private investment, add 2.8 GW of renewable capacity by 2028, and create 30,000 jobs.

Tunisia targets a 23% cut in power supply costs, improved STEG cost recovery from 60% to 80%, and a $698 million reduction in public subsidies.

The World Bank has approved $430 million in financing to support Tunisia’s energy sector reform and transition. The funding will go to the Tunisian Energy Reliability, Efficiency and Governance Enhancement Program (TEREG), designed to boost efficiency, governance, and renewable energy deployment, the bank said in a statement on November 11, 2025.

The five-year program includes $30 million in concessional financing from the Climate Investment Funds. It aims to help Tunisia establish a sustainable, reliable, and affordable electricity supply while cutting carbon emissions and improving sector governance.

TEREG will accelerate the development of renewable energy projects and strengthen the operational and financial performance of the Société Tunisienne de l’Électricité et du Gaz (STEG), the state-owned utility.

“By promoting renewable energy development, the TEREG program will help position Tunisia as a regional leader in clean energy, create economic opportunities, and secure long-term energy stability,” said Alexandre Arrobbio, the World Bank’s Country Operations Manager for Tunisia.

Tunisia, now a net importer of hydrocarbons, faces a widening energy deficit due to falling domestic oil and gas production. The country is intensifying efforts to diversify its energy mix and reduce dependence on imports.

The TEREG program is expected to attract $2.8 billion in additional private investments to install 2.8 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity by 2028. It will also create more than 30,000 jobs while improving cost efficiency and reducing state subsidies.

According to the World Bank, the reforms will lower electricity supply costs by 23%, raise STEG’s cost recovery rate from 60% to 80%, and cut government subsidies by 2.045 billion dinars ($698 million).

The new funding complements ongoing initiatives such as the Tunisia–Italy power interconnection project (ELMED), the Energy Sector Improvement Project, and advisory services from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

TEREG aligns fully with Tunisia’s updated national energy transition strategy, which seeks to establish a low-carbon, economically sustainable energy model. The government aims to raise the share of renewables to 35% of total energy generation by 2030.

EXPLORATION BET What perhaps best highlights Chevron’s long-term bullishness is its increasing investments in oil and gas exploration.
In recent months, Chevron expanded its exploration activity in several basins including Namibia, Egypt and South America.","When warnings abound about an imminent collapse in oil prices, one would not expect the CEO of a major oil company to boast that he has never been more confident.

Yet that was precisely the message conveyed in Chevron’s updated strategy, unveiled by CEO Mike Wirth on Wednesday. He shrugged off concerns about oversupply in the near term and exuded confidence in the sector’s long-term outlook, brushing aside doubts that hovered over the industry only a few years ago as momentum built for the transition away from fossil fuels toward low-carbon energy.

It appears that U.S. President Donald Trump’s strong support of the fossil fuel industry and his “energy dominance” agenda have provided Chevron – like its Big Oil peers – with a meaningful tailwind.

“Never in my career have I seen a higher confidence outlook,” Wirth told investors. “The best is yet to come.”

Such confidence is striking when the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects oil prices to average $55 a barrel next year, down from $69 this year.

NEAR-TERM RETRENCHMENT

What a company says is one thing, though. What it does is far more important.

Oil and gas companies’ spending plans are a strong gauge for their near- and long-term risk appetite as many energy projects such as offshore oilfields or liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants require billions of dollars and years to develop, and many more years to generate returns.

It is therefore notable that Chevron is paring back its capital expenditures by $1 billion from previous guidance to a range of $18 billion to $21 billion per year into 2030.

The U.S.’s second-largest oil company also appears to be retrenching – albeit modestly – in the face of significant uncertainty over the supply and demand balance in the global oil market.

The International Energy Agency is currently forecasting a huge oversupply next year of 4 million barrels per day, around 4% of global supply, which, if accurate, could cause oil prices to crater.

Chevron’s minor pullback, however, suggests its thinking may be more aligned with OPEC analysts, who expect supply to roughly match demand next year, or others who believe any oversupply will be modest and short-lived.

LONG-TERM BOOM

Further out, Chevron’s actions seem to more closely match its messaging, as the company is clearly betting on continued growth in oil demand and a race to offset shrinking supplies.

Chevron plans to grow oil and gas production by 2% to 3% per year through 2030. It currently produces around 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

“There is need for significant investment to close the oil supply gap, equivalent to five Saudi Arabias” over the next decade, Wirth said.

Crucially, Chevron noted it plans to keep production in the U.S. Permian shale basin stable at 1 million bpd through 2040 while also reducing investment to around $3.5 billion per year from $4.5 billion to $5 billion currently.

Chevron argues that improved drilling techniques will enable it to maintain production without having to drill new wells at the current pace – a fairly bold forecast given standard practices for shale oil drilling, also known as fracking.

Chevron is not the only big shale producer to indicate that it can profitably sustain and even grow shale production for many more years. Both ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips suggest they can do the same, another indication of the industry’s growing confidence.

EXPLORATION BET

What perhaps best highlights Chevron’s long-term bullishness is its increasing investments in oil and gas exploration. This high-risk, high-reward business requires heavy investment, and it often takes over a decade or more to move from first drilling to the start of production.

In recent months, Chevron expanded its exploration activity in several basins including Namibia, Egypt and South America. The company plans to increase its annual exploration budget by 50% over the next few years. What’s more, it poached TotalEnergies’ exploration chief, Kevin McLachlan, in October to lead its exploration programme.

Does this mean we should expect a repeat of the start of this century, when huge, almost unimpeded investments in new oil and gas resources led to massive overspending and poor returns?

Probably not, as Big Oil companies are now hyper-focused on profitability and have instituted cost-saving practices that can allow them to generate profit even if oil prices hit $50 or below. Chevron aims to reduce structural costs by $3 billion to $4 billion by the end of 2026, including by laying off over 15% of its global workforce.

This spending discipline should enable Chevron and its peers to continue investing with greater confidence through peaks and troughs in the market over the coming years. That, in turn, also indicates that the market is apt to remain well supplied for the foreseeable future.

What is missing from all of this is a serious consideration of the energy transition. It is perhaps fitting that Chevron’s strategy update came on the day the IEA published a new long-term outlook that suggests oil demand may continue rising into 2050, having previously suggested it would begin to plateau in 2030.

This may be music to Big Oil’s ears, but if the energy transition picks up steam again – as many expect it will – Chevron and the rest of the industry could be in for a harsh reality check.

The suit alleges that the law, which restricts investor access to expert advice and penalizes consideration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, violates the First Amendment. It also contends that the law’s broad language may have a chilling effect on the investor community and related organizations.

COMPLAINT

1. Plaintiffs challenge a recently enacted Texas law, Senate Bill 2337 (“SB 2337” or the “Act”), which unconstitutionally chills shareholder advocacy, including research and analysis, that seeks to influence corporate behavior toward long-term value. For two of the three plaintiffs, SB 2337 also chills speech about value-based investing, including investing based on their religious beliefs.

INTRODUCTION

2. In enacting SB 2337, the Texas Legislature devised a solution in want of a problem. Institutional investors that partner with organizations to engage in shareholder advocacy and obtain proxy voting information do not require protection from the free flow of such information. But under the pretext of protecting Texas investors, the Legislature passed this law to suppress growing shareholder demands that companies consider important issues that can affect long-term performance. In doing so, SB 2337 attacks shareholder rights that are embedded in the relationship between our democracy and the free-enterprise system.

3. Central to an investor’s rights is the right to invest consistent with one’s goals, investment discipline, and values—and to gather information to meet these investment goals. Yet SB 2337 penalizes firms and non-profit organizations for providing this type of information and advice when it is inconsistent with the State’s beliefs. The State defines the type of speech it disfavors as “nonfinancial,” and requires that organizations that provide so-called “nonfinancial” information and advice publicly pronounce that this information and advice is not “solely in the financial interest of the company’s shareholders.”

4. Setting aside the wisdom of SB 2337, the law is indefensible because it violates the Constitution on three levels: first, it restricts speech on the basis of its content and viewpoint without a compelling state interest for doing so; second, it compels private actors to speak against their will and communicate messages reflecting the State’s viewpoint; and, third, its vagueness oversteps the limits of due process because, among other things, the Act could be construed to sweep in activity that is not by any objective definition proxy advising.

SUMMARY OF THE CASE

5. Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that, as part of their missions, partner with institutional investors to engage with companies to seek strong long-term financial performance. As part of seeking that performance, Plaintiffs consider the environmental and social impacts of company practices, as well as strong corporate governance and other factors, because they believe that these factors can be central to the long-term financial success of companies. Those considerations include sustainability and, for two of the Plaintiffs, their religious beliefs.

6. Plaintiff Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) is a coalition of investors who believe their faith or their values should—and as fiduciaries must—guide their investing decisions, including their investment stewardship. Plaintiff United Church Funds (UCF) is a faith-based organization that provides investment services to United Church of Christ (UCC) churches and other faith-based nonprofit organizations nationwide. Plaintiff Ceres is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the notion that accounting for sustainability is a financial imperative for companies.

7. The State of Texas can disagree with Plaintiffs’ view that sustainability-related risks have financial effects on investment portfolios and corporate bottom lines, and Plaintiffs ICCR’s and UCF’s view that their values and religious beliefs are relevant to investment-related decisions. What it cannot do is compel Plaintiffs to speak in furtherance of Texas’s views about these issues. Yet the recently enacted SB 2337 does precisely that.

a) First, SB 2337 divides proxy voting advice into two arbitrary categories that are not used by organizations engaged in proxy advising—advice that is based solely on the financial interest of investors and advice that is based in whole or in part on nonfinancial factors. The Act does nothing to define what “financial interest” of the shareholders means.

b) Second, SB 2337 establishes a definition for “nonfinancial factors” that includes factors that are widely recognized in the financial sector as pertinent to financial interests, such as “environmental, social, or governance (ESG)” goals and “diversity, equity, or inclusion (DEI).” SB 2337 also fails to recognize that the terms “ESG” and “DEI” have a wide variety of meanings and applications to different entities within the investment community and fails to define them in the Act.

c) Third, the Act imposes burdensome disclosure requirements on organizations that render advice that is based to any degree on the consideration of “nonfinancial factors” as defined by the statute. Chief among them, the Act forces Plaintiffs to say something that is both contrary to their core principles and with which they disagree: that environmental and social risks are unrelated to financial interest. These disclosure requirements will undermine those organizations’ credibility with their clients and members, mandate that they disclose detailed financial analyses, and force them to report nonpublic communications with their clients to the companies being evaluated.

d) Fourth, the Act deems failure to comply with any aspect of SB 2337 as a violation of law that can be pursued by the State, shareholders who did not receive the advice, or the company that is the subject of the advice. Additionally, SB 2337 authorizes the Attorney General to pursue steep penalties—$10,000 per violation—under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act for any violation of SB 2337.

8. This Court has already found that SB 2337 is likely unconstitutional and unenforceable against the two firms that dominate the proxy advisory business: Glass Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis) and Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc. (ISS). See Glass Lewis & Co. v. Paxton, 25-cv-01153 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 29, 2025); Institutional S’holder Servs., Inc. v. Paxton, 25-cv-01160 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 29, 2025). But the Act’s definitions of “proxy advisor” and “proxy advisory service” sweep much broader than those two firms and include small organizations and non-profits that engage in shareholder advocacy, public education, investing consultation, and investment research. The “proxy advisor” definition does not define “compensation.” And the Act’s overbroad definition of “proxy advisory service” includes research and analysis (even without recommendations) and generic recommendations (not applied to a particular company). SB 2337 could therefore apply to Plaintiffs and many other organizations like them.

9. Because SB 2337 is written both so vaguely and so broadly, every application of the Act creates an impermissible risk of the suppression of ideas. Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief barring any enforcement of SB 2337.

PARTIES

10. Plaintiff Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization chartered in the State of New York. ICCR is a coalition of faith- and values-based investors that engage with corporations as shareholders on the impact of corporate policies and practices on people and the environment, and the risks and opportunities therein, with the goal of enhancing the long-term value of companies. Their membership includes faith communities, asset management companies, pension funds, foundation endowments, and other institutional investors engaging in sustainable investing strategies.

11. Following their guiding principle “that sustainable corporations must look beyond the next earnings report to account for the full impact of their business on society,” ICCR and its members believe that sustainability is integral to the long-term value of a company.

12. ICCR’s membership includes a broad range of both religious and secular organizations concerned with the impacts of corporate practices on people, communities, and the environment, and a collective commitment to bring these concerns to companies through direct, collaborative engagement. Approximately three hundred institutional investors currently belong to ICCR, including asset owners and asset managers holding or managing over $4 trillion in invested capital. These members make both the moral and business case for improved corporate performance along certain metrics, including some metrics that can be characterized as ESG.

13. ICCR’s faith-based members, which account for more than half of its total membership, have investment policies based on their faith and the values of their religious institutions. These members have a fiduciary obligation to invest in accordance with the principles of their religious denomination, including through shareholder engagement with companies. Shareholder proposals are a critical type of such engagement. ICCR views shareholder proposals as both a fundamental investor right and a critical tool to bring issues of concern to the boards and management of companies. ICCR members use the shareholder engagement process, including shareholder proposals, to be in dialogue with companies on issues of concern and advocate that companies consider their impact on stakeholders over the long term to build financial success.

14. ICCR members have engaged with publicly traded companies for more than 50 years through dialogue about issues important to their beliefs and in alignment with their fiduciary duties. Although ICCR does not recommend to its members how they should vote on specific shareholder proposals, ICCR’s activities are designed to make members aware of shareholder proposals of interest and assist with the shareholder proposal process. As part of those activities, ICCR publishes a proxy book containing all shareholder resolutions ICCR members have filed, disseminates information on shareholder proposals, issues press releases on resolutions deemed important to ICCR membership, and leads webinars where members can provide information to other shareholders about resolutions that they have filed. It also maintains a confidential database accessible only to its members that tracks company engagements and helps to evaluate the impact of those engagements.

15. Plaintiff United Church Funds (UCF) is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit affiliated with the United Church of Christ (UCC). For over 100 years, UCF has served churches and other faith-based nonprofit organizations, helping the faith community steward their financial resources in ways that align with their values. It seeks strong financial performance while advocating for ethical and just corporate behavior, including sustainability. For UCF, its investment work is an extension of its faith-rooted mission to care for creation, uplift human dignity, and ensure that capital serves the common good.

16. UCF provides investment services to over 1,100 local churches, judicatories, denominational ministries, seminaries, and healthcare institutions affiliated with the UCC, as well as to faith-based organizations beyond the UCC. UCF offers sustainable and responsible investments and maintains funds that enable clients to customize their portfolios according to risk tolerance and return objectives. It has over $1.3 billion in assets under management, held in 11 professionally managed and socially responsible funds.

17. UCF’s investment work is an extension of its faith-rooted mission. Since its founding, the ethical principles of the Christian faith have guided UCF, which believes that responsible investing should be connected to purpose. UCF is committed to seeking a more just and sustainable world and views that work as essential to its mission. As part of its mission, UCF engages in active ownership. It engages with companies in which it invests, votes its shares, files proposals, and works with others (including ICCR) to raise questions about sustainability, governance practices, and more.

18. UCF clients are unitholders in the organization’s pooled funds (not shareholders with voting rights), meaning UCF votes the shares in the pooled funds. Therefore, UCF does not recommend how its clients should vote on specific shareholder proposals. In explaining how UCF has voted its own shares, however, UCF includes analysis that considers a number of social, environmental, and economic issues. In addition, UCF signs investor letters and occasionally files exempt solicitations with the SEC (communications from one shareholder to others) describing how UCF itself has voted or intends to vote on particular proposals.

19. Plaintiff Ceres is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit advocacy organization working to accelerate the transition to a cleaner, more just, and resilient economy. It makes the business case for taking action on sustainability issues, including climate change, water scarcity, and pollution. As part of its work, Ceres engages with investors and companies to promote its belief that “sustainability is the bottom line.” That is, the organization views sustainability as a necessary component of business, and one that is critical to long-term profitability.

20. Because Ceres believes that sustainability financially impacts investment portfolios and long-term corporate profitability, the organization thinks it is critical that investors and companies address sustainability risks and opportunities as part of their financial analysis. Ceres believes that taking sustainability seriously presents a tremendous business opportunity to drive innovation and economic growth, and that investors and companies are well positioned to help further that innovation and growth.

21. Ceres thus engages with investors, companies, policymakers, and regulators to build responsible leadership that helps further the idea that sustainability is good for business. That engagement includes, among other things, providing data-driven research on the financial risks and opportunities associated with sustainability issues, supporting investors and companies as they set practical goals, developing transition plans, implementing strategies that boost profitability, and engaging policymakers across the political spectrum to advance market-based sustainability policies.

22. Defendant Ken Paxton is the Attorney General of Texas, sued here in his official capacity. The Attorney General leads the Consumer Protection Division. He is expressly charged with enforcing SB 2337. See S.B. 2337, 89th Leg., R.S., § 6A.201 (Tex. 2025); Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 17.47 (West 2025).

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

23. This action arises under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988; 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, and the U.S. Constitution. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

24. Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1)–(2). The Texas Attorney General resides in this District for purposes of official-capacity suits, and a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in this District.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

25. Purchasing shares of a publicly traded company makes the buyer an owner of the company, even if the ownership is a very small percentage. Equity ownership entitles an investor to vote on matters required by state and federal law, stock exchange listing requirements, and a company’s organizational documents. It also confers the right to submit proposals for consideration by fellow shareholders and vote on company and shareholder proposals. Importantly, shareholders may exercise these voting and proposal rights consistent with their investment objectives, values, and beliefs regarding the factors that promote the creation of long-term value.

26. If a shareholder or group of shareholders wants a company to take some action—say, provide more transparency regarding its spending on lobbying to see if those dollars are consistent with public statements—they can introduce a resolution to do so, subject to certain regulatory limitations. After the resolution is introduced, the proponent can decide to engage with other investors to highlight the proposal or otherwise encourage support. Because institutional investor portfolios include hundreds or thousands of companies, institutional investors often rely on proxy advisors to review the shareholder and management proposals presented for vote and provide guidance according to objectives articulated by those institutional investors.

27. SB 2337 interferes with shareholder rights, making it harder for shareholders to obtain information from advisors and other investors or sources that would help them vote their shares. As discussed herein, the State’s mode of interference—chilling and burdening the speech of proxy advisors—violates the Constitution in several ways.

The Backdrop Behind Passage of SB 2337

28. In advocating for passage of SB 2337, legislators made clear that restricting certain viewpoints and repressing certain voices was the goal of the bill.

29. SB 2337 was meant to target “activist shareholders who bring resolutions that are opposed by the management of the company,” in the words of one of its sponsors. See Tex. Senate, Senate Session (Part II) at 1:35:07–1:35:14 (May 8, 2025), https://senate.texas.gov/videoplayer.php?vid=22094&lang=en (Statement of Sen. Hughes).

30. The Act also targets firms that—in its sponsor’s view—“are basing their advice to clients on factors other than shareholder return, such as in many cases environmental, social, and governance—political hot button issues—[and] DEI factors.” See Tex. H. Comm. on Trade, Workforce & Econ. Dev., Hearing at 1:13:57–14:09 (Apr. 23, 2025), https://house.texas.gov/videos/21855 (statement of Rep. Leach) (emphasis added).

31. “The point here is to make sure that proxy advisory firms, when they’re rendering advice . . . that they’re focused on economic factors. So, when they’re focused on non-economic-type factors, whether it’s ESG, whether it’s DEI . . . that’s what we want to prevent.” Texas H.R., 89th Leg., R.S., Floor Debate on H.B. 4079 (May 27, 2025), at 9:47:36-9:48:25 (video at https://house.texas.gov/videos/22298) (statement of Rep. Leach).

32. And as Senator Hughes stated in the Texas Senate, “proxy advisory firms have become increasingly political with a hard left bent. . . . Some are basing their advice on ESG standards, other times on DEI priorities.” Texas Sen. Comm. on State Affairs, 89th Leg., R.S., Debate on S.B. 2337, (Apr. 24, 2025), at 0:58:46-59:27 (statement of Sen. Hughes) (video at https://senate.texas.gov/videoplayer.php?vid=21888&lang=en ).

The Material Provisions of SB 2337

33. To accomplish the goals set out above, SB 2337 imposes burdensome requirements on proxy voting advice that is based in any part on what the Act calls “nonfinancial factors” or “in opposition to company management.”

Counter-factual and Overbroad Definitions and Undefined Terms

34. SB 2337 defines a “proxy advisor” as anyone “who, for compensation, provides a proxy advisory service to shareholders of a company or to other persons with authority to vote on behalf of shareholders of a company.”

35. “Compensation” is undefined.

36. “Proxy advisory service” is defined to include: 1) “advice or a recommendation on how to vote on a proxy proposal or company proposal”; 2) “proxy statement research and analysis regarding a proxy proposal or company proposal”; 3) “a rating or research regarding corporate governance”; or 4) “development of proxy voting recommendations or policies, including establishing default recommendations or policies.” As such, “proxy advisory service” is not limited to rendering actual proxy advice.

37. SB 2337 begins from the premise of protecting the “financial interest of the shareholders,” but never defines “financial interest of the shareholders.” Nevertheless, SB 2337 exempts from its requirements advice that is “provided solely in the financial interest of the shareholders of a company.”

38. SB 2337 declares that advice based on consideration of “nonfinancial factors” is, by definition of the Act, not provided solely in the financial interest of shareholders of the company. These “nonfinancial factors” specifically include “a commitment, initiative, policy, target or subjective or value-based standard” based on: “an environmental, social, or governance (ESG) goal, factor, or investment principle; diversity, equity, or inclusion (DEI); a social credit or sustainability factor or score; or membership in or commitment to an organization or group that wholly or partly bases its evaluation or assessment of a company’s value over any period on nonfinancial factors.” None of these terms are defined.

39. SB 2337 declares that voting recommendations that are “inconsistent with the voting recommendation of the board of directors or a board committee composed on a majority of independent directors” are not provided “solely in the financial interest of the shareholders of the company.”

40. For the purpose of determining the scope of SB 2337, the statute also defines “company” and “shareholder.” A “company” is a business that was formed in Texas, maintains its principal place of business in Texas, or has made a company proposal to become a Texas entity. A “shareholder” is a person who has any form of equity ownership in a Texas company, regardless of whether the shareholder lives in Texas or is otherwise connected to the state.

Compelled Statements About “Nonfinancial” Advice

41. Proxy advisors whose advice is deemed “not provided solely in the financial interest of shareholders” are compelled to issue a series of warnings to their clients or members and the Texas company that is the subject of their advice, as well as post that warning to their websites. As to the clients or members and the Texas company that is the subject of the advice, the proxy advisor must (1) “conspicuously state[] that the service is not being provided solely in the financial interest of the company’s shareholders because it is based wholly or partly on one or more nonfinancial factors”; (2) explain “with particularity” the basis of the advice; and (3) state that “the advice subordinates the financial interests of shareholders to other objectives, including sacrificing investment returns or undertaking additional investment risk to promote one or more nonfinancial factors.” Sec. 6A.101(b)(1). The proxy advisor must also “conspicuously disclose” on the front page of its website that its services “include advice and recommendations that are not based solely on the financial interest of shareholders.” Sec. 6A.101(b)(3).

Enforcement of the State’s Viewpoint

42. SB 2337 allows any “affected party” to seek declaratory and injunctive relief. An “affected party” is defined to include “any shareholder” of any Texas company that is the subject of a proxy advisor’s advice. Private plaintiffs must “provide notice to the attorney general, who may intervene in the action.” S.B. 2337 § 6A.202(b).

43. Any violation of SB 2337 is deemed a per se deceptive trade practice under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (DTPA). SB 2337 explicitly authorizes the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney General to seek both injunctive relief and civil penalties, which can be assessed in the amount of “not more than $10,000 per violation” under § 17.47 of the DTPA for violations of SB 2337. SB 2337 allows the Attorney General to seek penalties against organizations that fail to make these disclosures to sophisticated institutional investors.

The Harmful Impact of SB 2337

44. SB 2337 is facially unlawful. It violates the First Amendment and is unconstitutionally vague under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It will harm Plaintiffs and other organizations like them by depriving them of their constitutional rights.

Impermissible Vagueness in Covered Entities and Conduct

45. The definition of proxy advisor is vague with regard to any entity other than Glass Lewis or ISS. It is unclear under the language of the Act if any or all Plaintiffs qualify as proxy advisors subject to SB 2337, though both the language of the Act and its legislative history indicate that they very well might.

46. SB 2337 does not define compensation, so it is also unclear whether the word was intended to cover only fee-for-service engagements or if it could encompass membership fees or other payments Plaintiffs receive for the work they do, though they do not receive them for providing “proxy advisory services” specifically.

47. SB 2337 defines “proxy advisory service” and “proxy advisor” so broadly that it may apply to many of the informational services Plaintiffs provide. “Proxy advisory service” is not limited to advice and recommendations regarding specific proxy votes; it includes research, analysis, and generic recommendations and policies. Nor is it clear what constitutes “advice” or “a recommendation.”

48. Notably, the Act fails to exclude non-profits, either implicitly or explicitly. Prior to passage, the Texas House adopted an amendment to the Act that would have made the law inapplicable to certain charitable organizations, which the amendment defined to include certain Section 501(c)(3) and Section 501(a) organizations under the Internal Revenue Code. But the Senate did not concur in that amendment, and it does not appear in the text of the Act as passed.

Impermissible Vagueness in Key Definitions

49. The “financial interest” of shareholders in a single corporation is not uniform. For any publicly traded company, there will be shareholders with a financial interest in short-term gains, shareholders interested in future and long-term performance, and shareholders who are willing to accept short-term reduction in value if they think certain changes in policy, or capital outlays, for example, will lead to long-term success. These interests may be adverse to management or consistent with management plans. SB 2337 fails to account for these complexities, instead adhering to the fiction that there is only one right way to be interested in the success of a company—all without really ever saying what that way is.

50. This presumption infects the Act, which assumes that any proposal that could be labeled “ESG” or “DEI” is bad for business. Not so.

51. Environmental considerations can have a financial impact on company performance. Numerous studies demonstrate how sustainability initiatives and management of climate risk improve financial performance. Financially material climate risk factors encompass both physical and transition risk. As climate change leads to a higher risk of natural disasters like hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires destroying a company’s physical assets, that company will have to pay out more to repair the damage (and pay for insurance prior to the damage). As companies adjust to the new realities that climate change causes, they will also have to invest to mitigate harms, such as moving ports used for shipping, adapting to drought and floods, or investing in new technologies that are more climate-change resistant.

52. The risk to investor flows is equally real. Morgan Stanley recently discussed four risks that investors face because of climate change, including physical damage, stranded assets, reputational risk, and pressure on natural resources. See Emily Thomas, 4 Ways Investors Can Act on Climate Change, Morgan Stanley (Oct. 10, 2024), https://perma.cc/XV2E-43YX. Each risk presents an opportunity for investors, such as “investing in companies that support natural resource efficiency, resilient infrastructure, food and water security, and sustainable agriculture.” Id.

53. And sustainable investing can significantly outperform investing that fails to take sustainability into account. A Morgan Stanley report found that a larger proportion of sustainable funds had positive returns in the first half of 2025, at 92% vs. 85% for traditional funds; ninety percent of sustainable funds have positive returns. See Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing, Sustainable Reality: 2025 Report, https://perma.cc/3MVA-37GQhttps://perma.cc/T9Y6-XLWNhttps://perma.cc/8A3E-ZXPH.3MVA-37GQ. This makes sense, of course, because companies that consider sustainability can benefit from access to capital, positive brand reputation, and other market-based advantages, while companies that do not address material environmental risks that result from climate change and pollution will face increased costs.

54. Members of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a global organization whose members have approximately 140 trillion dollars in assets under management, recently reaffirmed that they support “incorporating environmental, social and governance factors into their investment and ownership decisions,” Principles for Responsible Investment, Home, https://perma.cc/8JPJ-4Y5F (last visited Nov. 10, 2025), and are “deeply committed to the shared goal of responsible investment.” Principles for Responsible Investment, About the PRI, https://perma.cc/625X-NJAH (last visited Nov. 10, 2025).

55. Social considerations can also have a financial impact on company performance. For instance, labor practices and talent retention, which could be considered “social” factors that fall under SB 2337’s ESG rubric, can also directly affect a company’s financial performance. And companies that proactively seek to mitigate human rights risks in their operations and supply chains prevent the type of regulatory, legal, financial, and reputational risks that can negatively impact long-term performance.

56. So, too, with governance considerations. Independent board oversight, transparent executive compensation, and robust risk management are all indicators of good governance that can benefit a company’s long-term financial outlook. And one example of good governance is reflected in a recent survey, where 79% of corporate directors expressed the belief that board diversity is beneficial to a company, with over 68% believing it leads to better board performance. See Ray Garcia, et al., PwC’s 2024 Annual Corporate Directors Survey at 4, https://perma.cc/R6NB-VX2A.

57. It is not surprising, then, that the Teacher Retirement Fund of Texas has stated that its Investment Division considers “ESG factors that are material to long-term returns and levels of risk” when making investment decisions. See Teacher Ret. Sys. of Tex., Investment Policy Statement (June 3, 2025), https://perma.cc/98W4-DV3H. Or that the Texas Employees Retirement System notes that “[i]ntangible factors such as social and environmental issues are increasingly being incorporated into valuation models to better quantify the risks and opportunities of long-term investing in a company.” See Emps. Ret. Sys. of Tex., Investment Policy Statement, add. I, at 3 (Aug. 21, 2024), https://perma.cc/7Y77-23UP.

Impermissible Interference with First Amendment Rights

58. Plaintiffs face a difficult choice: SB 2337 forces them to make statements that they do not agree with, to stop speaking, or to speak knowing that they risk substantial fines and litigation in the form of public and private enforcement.

59. Forcing Plaintiffs to make government-preferred statements that run counter to their own beliefs is compelled speech and violates the First Amendment.

60. As Plaintiff Ceres notes, its entire model is based on proving that “sustainability is the bottom line.” Ceres, About (last visited Nov. 3, 2025), https://perma.cc/VAA3-W7RN. For Ceres, then, considering ESG factors is solely related to financial interest. ICCR similarly believes that taking environmental, social, and governance factors into account “is integral to long-term value.” That is, ignoring these issues is detrimental to a company’s value. And UCF believes that its funds deliver long-term growth not in spite of their religious mission, but because of it.

61. Texas can disagree with Plaintiffs’ views, but it cannot compel them to give voice to that disagreement without running afoul of the First Amendment, as SB 2337 does.

62. Complying with the Act’s mandated warnings will compel Plaintiffs to speak a message that they believe to be false, including that accounting for certain disfavored factors “subordinates the financial interests of shareholders.” The state’s mandatory disclosures would also require Plaintiffs to diminish the reliability and utility of their own research and analysis. Disseminating such disclosures would harm Plaintiffs’ reputations as trusted sources of information on those very topics the State restricts and will compromise and limit their relationships with their clients and members. Even if Plaintiffs were to moderate the descriptive disclosures required under SB 2337, they would still face other compliance burdens. Compliance with the additional requirements SB 2337 imposes, including the written economic analysis of the financial impact on shareholders of the proposal, would be cumbersome. The personnel required to satisfy these compliance needs are significant, all the more so given that Plaintiffs are non-profits.

63. If, on the other hand, Plaintiffs refuse to speak Texas’s mandated script, Plaintiffs face two unacceptable alternatives. Either they will be forced to be silent on issues in which they strongly believe, or they will face costly investigations, litigation, and fines.

64. The threat of investigation and prosecution from the Texas Attorney General, should Plaintiffs be deemed proxy advisors under the Act, also adds to the likelihood that Plaintiffs will have to expend additional resources should the Act be allowed to remain in place.

65. Under all of these scenarios, SB 2337 would prevent Plaintiffs from furthering their mission of aligning investing with beliefs, all because the State of Texas may not like their positions.

STANDING AND SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY

66. Each Plaintiff has standing. Chilling and compelling speech, as the Act does, are injuries in fact, even pre-enforcement, that are fairly traceable to the Attorney General. SB 2337 authorizes the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney General to bring suit for a violation of the Act under Section 17.47 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. See S.B. 2337 § 6A.201; Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.47. Only a ruling barring SB 2337 from remaining in effect can remove this threat from the Attorney General.

67. Nor is the Attorney General immune from suit. The Attorney General has both a particular duty to enforce the Act and a demonstrated willingness to do so. Indeed, he has made a variety of statements demonstrating a dislike of proxy advisors, making it almost certain that he will enforce the act absent Court intervention.

68. The Attorney General sent a letter to ISS and Glass Lewis in 2023, for example, accusing them of violating Texas’s “prohibition on unfair or deceptive trade practices” because, in language replicated in SB 2337, Attorney General Paxton believed they were issuing advice “contrary to the financial interest” of shareholders. See Letter from Office of the Attorney General of Utah and Office of the Attorney General of Texas to Gary Retelny and Kevin Cameron, at 2 (Jan. 17, 2023) (on file with author), https://perma.cc/85M7-78UC. The Attorney General has also made clear his willingness to use consumer protection laws to attack “a wide range of organizations with which he disagrees politically.” How Ken Paxton Is Stretching The Boundaries Of Consumer Protection Laws to Pursue Political Targets, Tex. Tribune (May 30, 2024), https://perma.cc/63D5-WQCB. There is no reason to believe that the past is anything but prologue here.

69. Even after the Court preliminarily enjoined the application of SB 2337 to Glass Lewis and ISS, the Attorney General nevertheless issued Civil Investigative Demands to both companies, presumably as part of a fact-gathering investigation that, on information and belief, is connected to potential suits under S.B. 2337. See Texas Attorney General Probes ISS, Glass Lewis over ESG, DEI, ESG Dive (Sept. 18, 2025, updated Sept. 19, 2025), https://perma.cc/QK5R-9TEQ.

CLAIMS

70. Plaintiffs raise a facial challenge to SB 2337.

Count I

42 U.S.C. § 1983

Violation of the First Amendment, as Incorporated Against the States Through the Fourteenth Amendment (Freedom of Speech)

71. Plaintiffs incorporate all prior paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

72. It is Texas’s burden to demonstrate that SB 2337 does not run afoul of the First Amendment guarantee that the government “shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” U.S. Const. amend. I. Texas cannot meet that burden.

Content Discrimination

73. The Act is unconstitutional because it engages in content discrimination and cannot withstand strict scrutiny.

74. There is no compelling state interest that justifies the law, much less one that is narrowly tailored to serve any compelling state interest.

75. First, SB 2337’s stated goal of “prevent[ing] fraudulent or deceptive acts and practices in this state,” S.B. 2337 § 1(4), is mere pretext for regulating disfavored views, rendering the Act’s stated interest unlikely to be genuine.

76. There is no evidence of fraud by proxy advisors that justifies SB 2337, and the State has no genuine interest in combating fraud that does not exist.

77. Second, the Act fails strict scrutiny even if SB 2337 reflected a genuine interest in preventing fraud because it is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest. It only targets speech about Texas companies rather than speech occurring in Texas or by Texans or to Texans, requires no disclosures for conflicts of interest that could be an indicator of fraud, and has no provisions that regulate advice that aligns with company management. This all suggests that the Act’s true purpose has nothing to do with stopping fraud in Texas.

78. There is nothing inherently fraudulent about the targeted speech, making it impossible to reduce fraud by targeting it.

79. Nor does the Act’s regulatory structure, which forces Plaintiffs and others to disparage the advice they give, use the least restrictive means available to combat the imagined fraud. There is no evidence that any other means were even considered.

80. The Act discriminates based on the content of speech and is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest and thus violates the First Amendment.

Viewpoint Discrimination

81. Because it subjects only certain speech with a certain viewpoint to rigorous regulation, SB 2337 discriminates based on viewpoint, in violation of the First Amendment. Worse, it compels private speakers to adopt and parrot the government’s viewpoint on hotly contested topics and to align with management views.

82. The Act targets Plaintiffs’ particular views. SB 2337 punishes Plaintiffs for taking the view that ESG or DEI factors are relevant to a company’s financial performance, but not the opposite view. This is viewpoint discrimination.

83. The Act also discriminates on viewpoint when it compels Plaintiffs to speak the Texas government’s viewpoints, made all the worse because Texas’s view contradicts Plaintiffs’ beliefs.

84. The Act compels Plaintiffs to make disparaging disclosures and notices about their own beliefs to their members and clients. S.B. 2337 §§ 101(b), 102(b). It forces Plaintiffs to voice a government-drafted message advocating positions they vehemently oppose. Under the Act, Plaintiffs are required to convey the State’s view that any advice that contemplates “DEI,” or “ESG,” (however those terms may be construed by the State) is “not being provided solely in the financial interest of the company’s shareholders because it is based” on “nonfinancial factors.” S.B. 2337 § 6A.101(a). And this disclosure, which Plaintiffs do not believe to be true, must be made “publicly and conspicuously . . . on the home or front page” of their websites. Id. § 6A.101(b)(3). In short, Plaintiffs cannot express their views without being compelled under SB 2337 to state the Texas government’s preferred views.

85. SB 2337 also requires these disclosures when proxy advisors encourage or promote any proposal that is opposed by company management. This violates the First Amendment in a particularly skewed manner, mandating that shareholders in corporations toe the line on the positions of management, rather than management being accountable to shareholders through the company’s Board.

86. The Act’s viewpoint discrimination is inherent in its design and structure, which compels Plaintiffs to disparage their advice only when they engage in speech deemed “non-financial”—defined as related to ESG, DEI, or a view opposed to management. The purpose of the Act is to slant the public’s views in the direction the State wants.

87. This blatant viewpoint discrimination makes SB 2337 unconstitutional. Texas can view ESG and DEI both as terms and concepts as it wishes. But it cannot force Plaintiffs to express the State’s views or regulate their speech because Texas disagrees with their views, at least not without running afoul of the First Amendment.

Count II

42 U.S.C. § 1983

Void for Vagueness Under the Fourteenth Amendment

88. Plaintiffs incorporate all prior paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

89. The Act is unconstitutionally vague, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

90. It defines “solely in the financial interest of the shareholders,” through ipse dixit, to exclude ESG and DEI, terms that are subjective and subject to significant definitional debate. Plaintiffs are forced to guess when their conduct is subject to SB 2337’s disclosure requirements, with a wrong guess resulting in steep penalties.

91. And it is the Texas Attorney General whose subjective view of what ESG and DEI mean, not any objective standard, that will determine whether SB 2337 is enforced. Plaintiffs are thus left guessing not just what the ill-defined law means, but what the Texas Attorney General thinks it means. The double vagueness puts Plaintiffs in an untenable position.

92. Unless declared unconstitutional, SB 2337 will unlawfully deprive Plaintiffs of their Due Process rights and cause them harm.

Prayer for Relief

Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court:

A. Declare that SB 2337 is unlawful;

B. Declare that SB 2337 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, including the Free Speech Clause;

C. Declare that SB 2337 is void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment;

D.

The 500,000-square-foot facility marks a strategic evolution from an application center to a full-scale production site, reflecting rising demand for advanced energy technologies in the United States.

The move represents a significant step from the company’s previous location in Orlando, Florida, which had become inadequate within five years due to rapid growth. The new facility is part of a collaboration with the Winston-Salem Technology Center, known for its strong manufacturing capabilities and advanced industrial infrastructure.

“We’re proud to have officially inaugurated our new Siemens Energy North American Additive Manufacturing Center,” said Quan Lac, Vice President of Additive Manufacturing at Siemens Energy. “In just five years, we outgrew our original location in Orlando. We’ve now consolidated our AM operations into the 500,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art Winston-Salem Technology Center in North Carolina. Partnering with WTC and leveraging their extensive manufacturing capabilities marks a major milestone for our North American AM operations as we transition from an application center to a full-scale production facility. The timing is critical, as additive manufacturing is poised to help meet the unprecedented surge in energy demand we’re seeing across the U.S.”

Technology expansion and support for the U.S. market

The Winston-Salem center builds on Siemens’ existing Charlotte Advanced Technology Collaboration Hub (CATCH), also in North Carolina, which was established in 2013 to serve as an ecosystem platform for AM machine builders, industrial users, and design engineers. Siemens aims to bolster U.S. manufacturing by offering end-to-end solutions spanning automation, digital simulation, and data-driven process optimization.

In general, Siemens Energy relies on technologies such as laser powder bed fusion (primarily through EOS DMLS) and wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) to develop high-performance parts, facilitate rapid prototyping, and provide on-demand spare parts. The company’s expertise also extends to advanced engineering services, including the design, simulation, and qualification of AM components.

Moving beyond prototyping to serial production

Siemens Energy’s AM efforts are built on more than a decade of experience and millions of operating hours within its own gas turbine fleet. Its technologies include Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) and Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), used to produce high-performance parts, enable rapid repairs, and deliver on-demand spare components.

In 2017, working with EOS, Siemens successfully tested 3D printed gas turbine blades under full-load conditions. Today, the company is engaged in serial production of complex parts such as burner nozzles and turbine vanes, which have reduced lead times and improved system performance. Siemens also provides design, simulation, and qualification services for AM components.

To support industry-wide adoption, Siemens Energy has established an Additive Manufacturing Advisory Board composed of experts from various sectors, tasked with guiding the company’s AM strategy in response to growing U.S. market needs.",https://www.voxelmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Siemens-Energy-North-America_1762985496909.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:03:23.899835

That’s where public health comes in: strengthening the systems that keep communities healthy.

McHale now represents Gillings on the North Carolina Institute of Medicine’s new veteran health task force.","On a warm summer evening in Alamance County, veterans and community members gathered for an unexpected public health event: an art show. The walls displayed paintings, photography, and mixed-media pieces, each one telling a unique story. As veterans stood beside their work, talking with visitors about what inspired them, the atmosphere was alive with connection — a reminder that feeling seen, supported, and part of a community is essential for our well-being.

This art show was the product of a UNC-Chapel Hill initiative called the Healthy Vets Community Project, led by Vaughn Upshaw and Aimee McHale, professors in the Gillings School of Global Public Health.

The idea began in 2018, when Upshaw met Paul Crews, director of the Durham Veterans Affairs Health Care System, at a UNC-Chapel Hill public workforce conference. Their conversation highlighted a key challenge: the difficulty of connecting veterans with community-based mental health services. Upshaw quickly saw this wasn’t just a clinical issue; it was a public health one.

Veterans face distinct health challenges shaped by their service, transition to civilian life, and the communities they return to. Many experience higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, physical injuries, chronic pain, and exposure to environmental hazards. Some also grapple with deep psychological distress from actions during service that conflict with their personal values.

In rural counties, where many veterans live, limited public transit can make it difficult to attend medical appointments or social programs. Upshaw saw an opportunity to apply public health tools to address these barriers.

Today, that conversation has grown into a larger project. With McHale, Upshaw has developed the Healthy Vets Community Project into a phased initiative that partners with communities across North Carolina to strengthen the resources, networks, and conditions that affect veteran health.

The project’s early days were experimental. Upshaw and McHale didn’t begin with fixed goals, just a shared commitment to making a difference. They recruited Gillings students with military connections, using their lived experiences to help shape the initiative.

So far, these efforts have resulted in reduced bus fares in Rocky Mount, eastern North Carolina’s first veteran resource fair, the creation of all-in-one support service centers, and improved mental health hotline screening in Alamance County.

“The public health approach means you’re guided by the evidence,” McHale says. “From the beginning, it was: ‘Let’s start digging and see what we find.’”

A paradigm shift

Health is shaped by more than doctor visits. It’s influenced by housing, transportation, food access, and social support. That’s where public health comes in: strengthening the systems that keep communities healthy.

The Healthy Vets Community Project uses the vital conditions framework to examine these broader forces.

“We’re not working with veterans directly, but with the people who serve them,” Upshaw explains. “Our project is elevating their visibility.”

The project began with a comprehensive literature review exploring how social and structural determinants like housing stability, food access, and social support impact veteran health. This research helped ground the project in evidence, revealing where communities could intervene most effectively.

Then, they began creating visual resource maps by overlaying where veterans live with the presence, or absence, of resources to highlight community strengths and gaps.

Armed with data, the team partnered with three pilot communities — Alamance County, Rocky Mount, and Wake County — to build relationships, identify assets, align priorities, and launch community-led initiatives to address real, lived issues.

“You don’t have to be a psychologist or a psychiatrist to be able to help veterans and move people away from the cliff of mental health crisis,” Upshaw says. “People want to be seen, people want to be helped, and everybody wants to be a part of that picture.”

Insights to impact

With a $6.8 million grant from the Veterans Health Administration, the Healthy Vets Community Project is entering phase two, turning knowledge into action with four ambitious aims.

The first is to create a veteran registry guide, a practical tool to align referral systems and simplify access to services. The second will expand their resource maps to cover all 100 N.C. counties, giving leaders a clear picture of where veterans live and where resources are lacking.

The third goal, ecosystem mapping, paints a broader view to show how organizations, policies, and institutions interact. And the fourth will develop scalable tools to empower communities to build veteran-friendly environments and recognize sustainable efforts.

McHale now represents Gillings on the North Carolina Institute of Medicine’s new veteran health task force. The hope is that the project’s insights will inform not only local programs but also state-level policy decisions.

“The beauty of this project is it’s the kind of thing that can pull communities together, where people can work across partisan lines to serve the people who have served us,” McHale says.",https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aimee-and-vaughn-lead.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 10:01:19.561046

Favorable natural gas prices also contributed to the momentum.

After its upbeat third-quarter earnings report and plans to expand capacity, Hallador Energy’s share price reflected renewed optimism, climbing over 8% in the past month and delivering a year-to-date share price return of 94%. Even more striking, its five-year total shareholder return sits above 2,400%, underscoring the powerful long-term momentum behind the stock.

If Hallador’s recent surge has you thinking about what else the market might be overlooking, now could be the right moment to explore

Yet with such rapid gains and another quarter of blockbuster results, the real question is whether Hallador Energy’s shares remain undervalued, or if today’s price already reflects most of its future growth prospects. Is there more upside ahead?

Price-to-Sales of 2.2x: Is it justified?

Hallador Energy’s stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.2x, which places it below several key comparables and suggests relative value at its last close of $22.72.

The price-to-sales ratio compares a company’s market value to its annual revenue, making it especially useful for evaluating firms where earnings can be volatile or negative, as is often the case in the energy sector.

In Hallador’s case, the 2.2x P/S ratio stands out as favorable when compared to both the peer group average of 3.1x and the North American Renewable Energy industry average of 2.9x. However, a closer look reveals that the estimated fair price-to-sales ratio is 1.5x. This suggests the market might have priced in more optimistic assumptions than historical norms would suggest, and that the ratio could revert toward those levels over time.

Result: Price-to-Sales of 2.2x (UNDERVALUED)

However, persistent negative net income and a possible reversion in price-to-sales ratio present real risks that could challenge Hallador’s current valuation momentum.

Another View: Our DCF Model Weighs In

The SWS DCF model provides a very different perspective. According to this approach, Hallador Energy’s shares are trading well above the DCF-derived fair value of $12.58, suggesting the stock is overvalued by this metric. Does this signal that the recent rally is stretched, or could the market know something the model does not?

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a Washington, D.C. event, according to CNBC.

“By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.”

The secretary, speaking at a conference held by the American Nuclear Society, noted that he expects electricity demand from artificial intelligence to attract billions of dollars from “very creditworthy providers,” CNBC reported. Wright was quoted as saying that his department could match those dollars by as much as four to one.

President Donald Trump directed the department in May to start building 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Wright reportedly added that he hopes there will be dozens under construction by the time the administration ends.

Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive. The president told Wright to use his loan office to build new advanced reactors, finish those that were prematurely suspended, increase the power output of plants that are operating and make resources available to restart closed plants.

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,” Trump said.

The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said in a May report that Trump’s order addressed “well-trodden issues” but was “ambitious.”

The president’s other directives on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are partially aimed at reducing the federal agency’s staff, also present issues for the country’s nuclear energy industry, according to the think tank.

“In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry,” the Atlantic Council explained.

Europe is aiming to increase the standing and reputation of hydrogen across the region by allocating much-needed funds for substantial hydrogen projects across the EU bloc. The EU’s NetZero program is designed to assist the EU in reaching its clean energy goals by 2050, and enables the allocation of funds for projects that may help the region reach its lofty ambitions for clean energy production.

The European Commission has awarded billions to hydrogen and clean energy projects

The commission announced that it has awarded over $3.06 billion in funds for 61 large-scale climate tech projects, of which hydrogen is the main energy source. The funds are derived from the revenues generated under the EU Emissions Trading System, and follow the EU’s first-ever dedicated net-zero call (IF24). Applications for funds from clean energy projects totaled $22.9 billion, nearly ten times the amount planned to be allocated.

Hydrogen has long been overlooked as a potential long-term energy resource that could drive up renewable energy production as the world edges ever closer to the self-imposed 2030 clean energy target. Among the litany of projects that are set to receive funds from the EU Commission are:

Spain: Luxia will produce green hydrogen for ammonia and methanol

Denmark: Arcadia e-Fuels using hydrogen and biogenic CO₂ for eSAF and eNAP

Czech Republic: H2CWay will develop hydrogen fuel cell buses

Estonia: P2XH will produce e-methanol and green hydrogen for the maritime sector

Norway: ODIN will use the funds for retrofitting 15 Cessna 208Bs with H₂-electric powertrains

Norway(again): RjukanLH2 will use the EU funds to validate RFNBO-compliant LH2 bunkering for shortsea vessels

The grant agreement phase for the EU funds is currently underway

The EU is hoping that the allocation of funds will boost domestic hydrogen projects across the European continent, especially as the latest sanctions on Russian energy supplies come into effect. The grant agreement phase has commenced, with the contract confirmation process set for 2026.

“The response to this call demonstrates the strength of our innovators and the determination of our companies to lead the global race for net zero technologies.” – Wopke Hoekstra, EU Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth

The EU has noted that the grant process has been as smooth as a baby’s bottom, with no interruptions or issues facing the allocation of funds. Hydrogen has long been overlooked as a potential long-term energy resource that could completely alter the future of our planet. The EU has been on a hydrogen spree as of late, and has even granted renewable certification for a massive hydrogen project in China.

Europe’s proclivity for hydrogen is a welcome change to the conventional reliance on the fossil fuel sector, which has devastated the global environment, leading to disastrous climate change across the world. Luckily, nations have taken measures to reduce the impact of the energy sector.

BEV sales dropped 46.7% month-over-month in October after federal EV tax credits expired.

Incentives rose to $13,161 per unit, partially offsetting the decline, but uncertainty remains.

Full-year 2025 sales are expected to be flat or slightly higher than 2024, despite a slower Q4.

New light-vehicle sales in October 2025 recorded the lowest seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) in 15 months, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. The October SAAR of 15.3 million units represents a 4.8% decline year-over-year and a 5.9% drop from September 2025. The decrease was primarily driven by a sharp decline in battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales following the expiration of federal EV tax credits on September 30.

BEVs accounted for just 5.9% of total new-vehicle sales in October, falling from a record 11.3% in September. Approximately 75,000 BEVs were sold, a 46.7% decrease from September and down 23.8% year-over-year. Automakers had pulled forward many EV purchases ahead of the credit’s expiration, which contributed to the steep drop in October.

To offset the loss of the federal incentive, several OEMs increased their own discounts. Average incentive spending on BEVs rose $2,047 from September to $13,161 per unit, according to J.D. Power. While these incentives softened the decline, it remains uncertain how quickly BEV sales will return to previous levels without federal support.

Industry analysts expect the slower sales pace to continue through the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with the third quarter. However, earlier “pull-ahead” sales this year suggest full-year totals will remain largely stable. Overall, 2025 new-vehicle sales are expected to finish flat or slightly higher than 2024.

The October results highlight the strong influence of federal incentives on EV adoption. BEV sales surged when credits were available, but the market remains sensitive to policy changes. Automakers may continue to rely on manufacturer incentives to sustain EV demand, and dealers may need to adjust strategies to navigate shifts in consumer behavior.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11132025-BEV-Sales-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 10:00:41.308467

It is Toyota’s eleventh U.S. plant and the company’s first and only battery plant outside of Japan. The nearly $14 billion facility will create up to 5,100 new American jobs.

Building on its unwavering commitment to the U.S., Toyota announced an additional investment of up to $10 billion over the next five years to support future mobility efforts. This will bring the company’s total U.S. investment to nearly $60 billion since beginning operations here nearly 70 years ago.

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first U.S. battery plant and additional U.S. investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” said Ted Ogawa, president and chief executive officer, Toyota Motor North America (TMNA). “Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers.”

United States Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy expressed support for manufacturing investments in the U.S., noting that Toyota North Carolina’s investment of nearly $14 billion and the creation of more than 5,000 new jobs marks a turning point for the Piedmont Triad region.

“Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, America is open for business,” said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. “Toyota’s move to expand production in North Carolina is the latest show of confidence in this administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing, generate new, great paying jobs, and inject billions of dollars into the economy. We’re just getting started!”

The 1,850-acre mega site can produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity. It will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries needed for its ever-growing portfolio of electrified vehicles. The state-of-the-art plant will house 14 battery production lines supporting hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), making it a historical investment for Toyota and a substantial economic impact on the Tarheel State.

Batteries assembled at Toyota North Carolina are set to power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric 3-row BEV—the first of its kind for Toyota to be built in the U.S. Currently, the plant ships HEV modules to both Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama. Additional production lines at Toyota North Carolina are set to launch by 2030. Once construction is complete, the new facility will not just be a place of work, but also a vibrant community, featuring a range of amenities for team members, including on-site childcare, a pharmacy, a medical clinic and a fitness center.

The company remains steadfast in its commitment to being the best in town by supporting workforce development and educational initiatives. Through partnerships with schools and educators across the region, Toyota is developing the Triad’s future workforce with its time, talent and treasure.

Toyota has sold more than 6.6 million hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell and battery electric vehicles in the U.S. since 2000. Toyota currently assembles 11 HEVs and PHEVs in the U.S. as part of the company’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and its philosophy of building where it sells.",https://electriccarsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toyota-battery-roduction.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 08:02:59.404927

About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state.
Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.
More than 6,000 housing units are in development as a result.
“You put housing nearby public transit” Healey said.","BOSTON (AP) — After years of living on the street and crashing on friends’ couches, Quantavia Smith was given the keys to a studio apartment in Los Angeles that came with an important perk — easy access to public transit.

The 38-year-old feels like she went from a life where “no one cares” to one where she has a safe place to begin rebuilding her life. And the metro station the apartment complex was literally built upon is a lifeline as she searches for work without a car.

“It is more a sense of relief, a sense of independence,” said Smith, who moved in July. She receives some government assistance and pays 30% of her income for rent — just $19 a month for an efficiency with a full-market value of $2,000.

“Having your own space, you feel like you can do anything.”

Metro areas from Los Angeles to Boston have taken the lead in tying new housing developments to their proximity to public transit, often teaming up with developers to streamline the permitting process and passing policies that promote developments that include a greater number of units.

City officials argue building housing near public transit helps energize neglected neighborhoods and provide affordable housing, while ensuring a steady stream of riders for transit systems and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the number of cars on the road.

“Transit-oriented development should be one of, if not the biggest solution that we’re looking at for housing development,” said Yonah Freemark, research director at the Urban Institute’s Land Use Lab, who has written extensively on the topic.

“It takes advantage of all of this money we’ve spent on transportation infrastructure. If you build the projects and don’t build anything around the areas near them, then it’s kind of like money thrown down the drain,” Freemark said.

Transit housing projects from DC to LA

The Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments where Smith lives is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 — offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.

In Washington D.C., the transit authority has completed eight projects since 2022 that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.

“Big cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,” Freemark said. “Building new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.”

Among projects Boston has built, the Pok Oi Residents in Chinatown is a 10-minute walk to the subway and a half-dozen bus stops. That’s a draw for Bernie Hernandez, who moved his family there from a Connecticut suburb after his daughter got into a Boston university.

“The big difference is commuting. You don’t need a car,” said Hernandez, who said he can walk to the grocery story and pharmacy. His 17-year-old daughter takes the subway to school. Now, his car mostly sits idle, saving him money on gas and time spent in traffic.

“You get to go to different places very quickly. Everything is convenient,” Hernandez said.

States take aim at zoning regulations

States from Massachusetts to California are passing laws targeting restrictive zoning regulations that for decades prohibited building multifamily developments and contributed to housing shortages.

Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state law allowing taller apartment buildings on land owned by transit agencies and near bus, train and subway lines.

“Building more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis and locking in California’s success for many years to come,” said State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who authored the bill.

California joins Colorado, which requires cities to allow an average of 40 housing units per acre within a quarter-mile of transit, and Utah, which mandates about 50 units per acre. In Washington, the governor signed a bill this year allowing taller housing developments in mixed-use commercial zones near transit.

“We want to ensure that there are mixed-income, walkable, vibrant homes all around those transit investments and that people have the option of using cars less to improve the environmental health of our communities,” said Democratic Rep. Julia Reed, who authored the Washington bill.

“It’s about giving people the opportunity to drive less and live more.”

Housing takes center stage in Massachusetts

Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey has made housing a priority.

Among her most potent tools is a 2021 law that requires 177 towns or communities nearby to create zoning districts allowing multi-family housing. The state provided nearly $8 million to more than 150 communities to help create these zones, while threatening to cut funding for those that don’t. More than 6,000 housing units are in development as a result.

“You put housing nearby public transit” Healey said. “It’s great for people. They can literally get up, leave their home, walk to a commuter rail and get to work.”

Among the first to comply was Lexington, which has approved 10 projects, including a $115 million complex with 187 housing units and retail space.

Walking past earth-moving equipment and dump trucks at the construction site earlier this year, project manager Quinlan Locke said: “This is a landscape yard. It’s commercial. It’s meant for trucking.”

But, he added, in “two years from now, it’s going to be meant for people who live here, work here and play here. This is going to become someone’s home.”

Opposition to zoning changes

Some advocates argue the lofty goals of transit housing are falling short due to fierce local resistance and lack of funding and support at the federal and state levels.

Higher mortgage interest rates, more government red tape, rising construction costs and lack of investment at transit stations also have contributed to a troubling trend — nine times more housing units built far from public transit versus near it in the past two decades, according to a 2023 Urban Institute study.

In Massachusetts, 19 communities still haven’t created new zones. Some unsuccessfully sued the state to halt the law, while residents rejected new zones in others. Lexington eventually shrank its zone from 227 acres to 90 acres after residents complained.

“If we allow the state to come in and dictate how we zone, what else are they going to come in and dictate?” said Anthony Renzoni, a selectman from the town of Holden, which sued the state and is drawing up a new zoning map after residents rejected the first one.

New housing, a new life

In Los Angeles, the six-story complex where Smith lives in East Hollywood is home to 300 new residents since opening in February. It’s revitalizing the area around the metro site, with a Filipino grocery, medical clinic and farmers market opening early next year.

Half the 187 units are reserved for formerly homeless residents like Smith, who had been living in a rundown motel paid for with a voucher and before that on the street. She’s been assigned a case worker and is getting help with basic life skills, budgeting and finding work.

Equally important: Smith, who can’t afford a car, doesn’t need one.

“I’m very very fortunate to be somewhere where the transit takes me where I want to go,” she said. “Where I want to go is not that far.”",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/preview-906.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 08:03:04.211642

Both chambers of the state legislature voted to end the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative as part of the state’s budget, which cut funding for the program. The bill unwinds a 2019 decision by Pennsylvania’s former governor to join the cap-and-trade program.

The move comes as Shapiro pushes to transform Pennsylvania into a major hub for artificial intelligence. The AI boom is propelling the biggest buildout of natural gas-fired power plants in years, and Pennsylvania has long been a top producer of the fossil fuel. Consumer Energy Alliance, which represents businesses and fossil fuel generators, applauded the move, saying it will help reduce escalating utility bills, while climate group Evergreen Action called RGGI the state’s strongest tool for lowering energy costs.

While the exit is seen by some as a capitulation to Republicans and the fossil fuel industry, Shapiro said it removes a key barrier.

“For years the Republicans who’ve led the Senate have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy production; today that excuse is gone,” Shapiro said during a press conference minutes before signing the budget. “I am looking forward to aggressively pushing for policies that create more jobs in the energy sector, bring more clean energy onto our grid and reduce the cost of energy for all Pennsylvanians.”

On the tech giant’s 500-acre campus in Redmond, Washington, teams began holding regular “triage” meetings to confront serious questions posed by the artificial intelligence boom: Where would the company find the gigawatts — just one gigawatt can power nearly 750,000 US homes — needed for data centers? And how could Microsoft possibly secure that extra energy while still making progress toward a long-standing goal of going carbon-negative?

The AI discussions were “interesting and terrifying all at the same time,” said Brian Janous, who served until August 2023 as Microsoft’s vice president of energy. Microsoft and other major tech companies, he said, had to “look at the climate commitments they set and say, ‘Can I still do this?’”

Nearly three years later, Microsoft and rivals including Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are still struggling to answer that question. On one hand, they’re trying to obtain every electron possible to power their trillion-dollar bet on AI. On the other, they’re trying to stay true to a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 or sooner.

“There’s no question that the current push to develop AI infrastructure is putting a strain on the climate commitments of the big tech companies, all of which were made prior to the advent of AI,” Janous said in an interview. After leaving Microsoft, he co-founded Cloverleaf Infrastructure, which partners with utilities to develop clean-powered sites that supply the largest data-center providers.

Dr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""Third quarter revenue was at the high end of guidance, while gross margin exceeded expectations, supported by strong energy storage deliveries and a high mix of module shipments to profitable markets. Demand for energy storage continues to grow, driven by emerging applications such as data centers. We are managing the business with discipline, prioritizing profitability and investing strategically to ensure the resilience of our operations. I am pleased to share that our residential energy storage business is on track to become profitable in 2025. At the same time, we are making strong progress on our manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Construction of our solar cell factory in Indiana and our integrated lithium battery cell, pack, and BESS factory in Kentucky is progressing as planned, with production expected to commence in the first and fourth quarters of 2026, respectively.""

Yan Zhuang, President of Canadian Solar's subsidiary CSI Solar, said, ""We delivered a sequentially higher share of module shipments to the profitable North American market. Our Mesquite factory, which has now successfully ramped up, contributed meaningfully to both shipment volume and profitability. In our energy storage business, earlier deliveries to two projects shifted certain volumes from the fourth quarter into the third, resulting in a record quarter of 2.7 GWh in shipments. While our $3.1 billion utility-scale storage backlog provides line of sight to future growth, we also continue to develop our offerings and capabilities in C&I and residential storage, segments which we expect will contribute more meaningfully to profitability next year. Looking ahead, we expect further profitability improvements, as we begin production of solar cells and lithium battery energy storage products in the U.S.""

Ismael Guerrero, CEO of Canadian Solar's subsidiary Recurrent Energy, said, ""Profitability improved sequentially, driven by higher margin contributions from this quarter's project sales. These included the profitable sales of an energy storage project in Italy and a hybrid project in Australia. Until our IPP business scales further—expanding electricity sales and power services as recurring revenue streams—near-term profitability will continue to depend primarily on global project sales. Maintaining financial discipline remains our top priority. We will balance the growth of our operating portfolio and selective project ownership sales to prudently manage cash flow and debt levels. Looking ahead to 2026, we expect to tip this balance more toward project ownership sales to enhance cash recycling and reduce leverage.""

Xinbo Zhu, Senior VP and CFO, added, ""In the third quarter, we achieved revenue of $1.5 billion, at the high end of guidance, and delivered a gross margin of 17.2%, exceeding expectations. Operating expenses normalized with the absence of one-time items, resulting in net income attributable to shareholders of $9 million. With continued discipline in working capital management and prudent pacing of project construction, we ended the quarter with a cash position of $2.2 billion.""

Third Quarter 2025 Results

Total module shipments recognized as revenues in Q3 2025 were 5.1 GW, down 35% quarter-over-quarter (""qoq"") and down 39% year-over-year (""yoy""). Of the total, 33 MW were shipped to the Company's own utility-scale solar power projects.

Net revenues were $1.5 billion in Q3 2025, down 12% sequentially and 1% yoy, mainly due to lower sales of solar modules partially offset by higher sales of battery energy storage systems.

Gross profit was $256 million, compared to $505 million in Q2 2025 and $247 million in Q3 2024. Gross margin was 17.2%, compared to 29.8% and 16.4%, respectively. The sequential decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the absence of a release of profit upon sales-type leasing of a U.S. project in Q2. The yoy increase was driven by a higher contribution from battery energy storage systems, which have delivered a more favorable margin profile than solar modules on a blended basis.

Operating expenses were $222 million, down from $378 million in Q2 2025 and $247 million in Q3 2024 due to ongoing cost reductions and absence of impairment charges related to certain solar and storage assets, as well as manufacturing assets. Operating expenses represented 14.9% of revenue, compared to 22.3% in Q2 2025 and 16.4% in Q3 2024.

Net income attributable to Canadian Solar in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""GAAP"") in Q3 2025 was $9 million, or a net loss of $0.07 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $7 million, or a net loss of $0.08 per diluted share, in the Q2 2025, and net loss of $14 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in Q3 2024. Net loss per diluted share includes the dilutive effect of convertible bonds and Recurrent Energy redeemable preferred shares dividends, as applicable.

Adjusted net loss attributable to Canadian Solar Inc. (non-GAAP) was $26 million, and adjusted loss per share - diluted was $0.58 per share in Q3 2025, compared to an adjusted net loss of $23 million and adjusted loss per share - diluted of $0.53 per share in Q2 2025, and a net loss of $14 million or $0.31 per share in Q3 2024. Adjusted net loss attributable to Canadian Solar Inc. and adjusted loss per share - diluted in Q3 2025 and Q2 2025 exclude the recognition of income using hypothetical liquidation at book value (""HLBV"") method. The Company uses the HLBV method to attribute income and loss to its tax equity investors. Please see Recurrent Energy - HLBV for definition and About Non-GAAP Financial Measures for reconciliation to nearest GAAP measures.

Net cash flow used in operating activities in Q3 2025 was $112 million, driven by changes in working capital, specifically a decrease in inventories during the prior quarter, compared to net cash flow provided by operating activities of $189 million in Q2 2025 and net cash flow used in operating activities of $231 million in Q3 2024.

Total debt, including financing liabilities, was $6.4 billion as of September 30, 2025, including $2.7 billion, $3.5 billion, and $0.2 billion related to CSI Solar, Recurrent Energy, and convertible notes, respectively. Total debt rose from $6.3 billion as of June 30, 2025, mainly due to new borrowings for development of projects and operational assets. Total non-recourse debt as of September 30, 2025, was $2.0 billion.

Business Segments

The Company operates in two reportable segments: CSI Solar, focused on solar modules and battery energy storage manufacturing and products, and Recurrent Energy, focused on utility-scale solar power and battery energy storage project development and operation.

Recurrent Energy

As of September 30, 2025, the Company held a leading position with a total global solar project development pipeline of approximately 25 GWp and a battery energy storage project development pipeline of 81 GWh.

The business model consists of three key drivers:

Electricity revenue from operating portfolio to drive stable, diversified cash flows in growth markets with stable currencies, with some project ownership sales to manage cash flow and debt level;

Asset sales (solar power and battery energy storage) in the rest of the world to drive cash-efficient growth model, as value from project sales will help fund growth in operating assets in stable currency markets; and

Power services (O&M) through long-term operations and maintenance (""O&M"") contracts, currently with over 14 GW of contracted projects, to drive stable and long-term recurring earnings and synergies with the project development platform.

Project Development Pipeline – Solar

As of September 30, 2025, the Company's total solar project development pipeline was 25.1 GWp, including 2.0 GWp under construction, 3.4 GWp of backlog, and 19.7 GWp of projects in advanced and early-stage development, defined as follows:

Backlog projects are late-stage projects that have passed their risk cliff date and are expected to start construction in the next 1-4 years. A project's risk cliff date is the date on which the project passes the last high-risk development stage and varies depending on the country where it is located. Typically, this occurs after the project has received all the required environmental and regulatory approvals, and entered into interconnection agreements and offtake contracts, including feed-in tariff (""FIT"") arrangements and power purchase agreements (""PPAs""). A significant majority of backlog projects are contracted (i.e., have secured a PPA or FIT), and the remaining have a reasonable assurance of securing PPAs.

Advanced pipeline projects are mid-stage projects that have secured or have more than 90% certainty of securing an interconnection agreement.

Early-stage pipeline projects are early-stage projects controlled by the Company that are in the process of securing interconnection.

While the magnitude of the Company's project development pipeline is an important indicator of potential expanded power generation and battery energy storage capacity as well as potential future revenue growth, the development of projects in its pipeline is inherently uncertain. If the Company does not successfully complete the pipeline projects in a timely manner, it may not realize the anticipated benefits of the projects to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, the Company's guidance and estimates for its future operating and financial results assume the completion of certain solar projects and battery energy storage projects that are in its pipeline. If the Company is unable to execute on its actionable pipeline, it may miss its guidance, which could adversely affect the market price of its common shares and its business, financial condition, or results of operations.

HLBV

The Company applies the HLBV method to account for its contractual relationships with tax equity investors in U.S. solar energy and battery energy storage projects. This method which allocates income or loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests reflects the changes in the amounts that tax equity investors would hypothetically receive upon liquidation at the beginning and end of each reporting period, after considering any capital transactions, such as contributions or distributions, between the subsidiaries and tax equity investors.

The following table presents the Company's total solar project development pipeline.

Project Development Pipeline – Battery Energy Storage

As of September 30, 2025, the Company's total battery energy storage project development pipeline was 80.6 GWh, including 6.5 GWh under construction and in backlog, and 74.1 GWh of projects in advanced and early-stage development.

The table below sets forth the Company's total battery energy storage project development pipeline.

Business Outlook

The Company's business outlook is based on management's current views and estimates given factors such as existing market conditions, order book, production capacity, input material prices, foreign exchange fluctuations, the anticipated timing of project sales, and the global economic environment. This outlook is subject to uncertainty with respect to, among other things, customer demand, project construction and sale schedules, product sales prices and costs, supply chain constraints, and geopolitical conflicts. Management's views and estimates are subject to change without notice.

In Q4 2025, the Company expects total revenue to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 14% and 16%. Total module shipments recognized as revenues by CSI Solar are expected to be in the range of 4.6 GW to 4.8 GW. Total battery energy storage shipments by CSI Solar in Q4 2025 are expected to be in the range of 2.1 GWh to 2.3 GWh, including approximately 600 MWh to the Company's own projects.

For the full year of 2026, the Company expects CSI Solar's total module shipments to be in the range of 25 GW to 30 GW, including approximately 1 GW to the Company's projects. CSI Solar's total battery energy storage shipments are expected to be in the range of 14 GWh to 17 GWh.

Dr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""We will continue to focus on profitable solar markets and to manage volumes in less profitable regions. In contrast, demand for energy storage remains robust, supported by healthy market fundamentals and growing applications. Our 2026 full year storage outlook reflects strong year-over-year growth, backed by contracted volumes and visibility into customers' development pipelines. We also expect to begin production of solar cells and lithium battery energy storage products in the U.S. next year. Financial prudence remains our top priority. Accordingly, Recurrent Energy will increase project ownership sales in 2026 to recycle capital and manage the overall debt level.""

(""Canadian Solar"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: CSIQ) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Third Quarter Highlights

Net revenues of $1.5 billion, at the high end of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion guidance.

17.2% gross margin, exceeding guidance of 14% to 16%.

e-STORAGE achieved record 2.7 GWh in quarterly battery energy storage shipments, above guidance of 2.1 GWh to 2.3 GWh.

e-STORAGE's contracted backlog increased to $3.1 billion, as of October 31, 2025.

Phase I of the solar cell factory in Indiana, U.S. is expected to begin production in March 2026.

Phase I of the lithium battery energy storage factory in Kentucky, U.S. is expected to commence production in December 2026.

Dr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""Third quarter revenue was at the high end of guidance, while gross margin exceeded expectations, supported by strong energy storage deliveries and a high mix of module shipments to profitable markets. Demand for energy storage continues to grow, driven by emerging applications such as data centers. We are managing the business with discipline, prioritizing profitability and investing strategically to ensure the resilience of our operations. I am pleased to share that our residential energy storage business is on track to become profitable in 2025. At the same time, we are making strong progress on our manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Construction of our solar cell factory in Indiana and our integrated lithium battery cell, pack, and BESS factory in Kentucky is progressing as planned, with production expected to commence in the first and fourth quarters of 2026, respectively.""

Yan Zhuang, President of Canadian Solar's subsidiary CSI Solar, said, ""We delivered a sequentially higher share of module shipments to the profitable North American market. Our Mesquite factory, which has now successfully ramped up, contributed meaningfully to both shipment volume and profitability. In our energy storage business, earlier deliveries to two projects shifted certain volumes from the fourth quarter into the third, resulting in a record quarter of 2.7 GWh in shipments. While our $3.1 billion utility-scale storage backlog provides line of sight to future growth, we also continue to develop our offerings and capabilities in C&I and residential storage, segments which we expect will contribute more meaningfully to profitability next year. Looking ahead, we expect further profitability improvements, as we begin production of solar cells and lithium battery energy storage products in the U.S.""

Ismael Guerrero, CEO of Canadian Solar's subsidiary Recurrent Energy, said, ""Profitability improved sequentially, driven by higher margin contributions from this quarter's project sales. These included the profitable sales of an energy storage project in Italy and a hybrid project in Australia. Until our IPP business scales further—expanding electricity sales and power services as recurring revenue streams—near-term profitability will continue to depend primarily on global project sales. Maintaining financial discipline remains our top priority. We will balance the growth of our operating portfolio and selective project ownership sales to prudently manage cash flow and debt levels. Looking ahead to 2026, we expect to tip this balance more toward project ownership sales to enhance cash recycling and reduce leverage.""

Xinbo Zhu, Senior VP and CFO, added, ""In the third quarter, we achieved revenue of $1.5 billion, at the high end of guidance, and delivered a gross margin of 17.2%, exceeding expectations. Operating expenses normalized with the absence of one-time items, resulting in net income attributable to shareholders of $9 million. With continued discipline in working capital management and prudent pacing of project construction, we ended the quarter with a cash position of $2.2 billion.""

Third Quarter 2025 Results

Total module shipments recognized as revenues in Q3 2025 were 5.1 GW, down 35% quarter-over-quarter (""qoq"") and down 39% year-over-year (""yoy""). Of the total, 33 MW were shipped to the Company's own utility-scale solar power projects.

Net revenues were $1.5 billion in Q3 2025, down 12% sequentially and 1% yoy, mainly due to lower sales of solar modules partially offset by higher sales of battery energy storage systems.

Gross profit was $256 million, compared to $505 million in Q2 2025 and $247 million in Q3 2024. Gross margin was 17.2%, compared to 29.8% and 16.4%, respectively. The sequential decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the absence of a release of profit upon sales-type leasing of a U.S. project in Q2. The yoy increase was driven by a higher contribution from battery energy storage systems, which have delivered a more favorable margin profile than solar modules on a blended basis.

Operating expenses were $222 million, down from $378 million in Q2 2025 and $247 million in Q3 2024 due to ongoing cost reductions and absence of impairment charges related to certain solar and storage assets, as well as manufacturing assets. Operating expenses represented 14.9% of revenue, compared to 22.3% in Q2 2025 and 16.4% in Q3 2024.

Net income attributable to Canadian Solar in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""GAAP"") in Q3 2025 was $9 million, or a net loss of $0.07 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $7 million, or a net loss of $0.08 per diluted share, in the Q2 2025, and net loss of $14 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in Q3 2024. Net loss per diluted share includes the dilutive effect of convertible bonds and Recurrent Energy redeemable preferred shares dividends, as applicable.

Adjusted net loss attributable to Canadian Solar Inc. (non-GAAP) was $26 million, and adjusted loss per share - diluted was $0.58 per share in Q3 2025, compared to an adjusted net loss of $23 million and adjusted loss per share - diluted of $0.53 per share in Q2 2025, and a net loss of $14 million or $0.31 per share in Q3 2024. Adjusted net loss attributable to Canadian Solar Inc. and adjusted loss per share - diluted in Q3 2025 and Q2 2025 exclude the recognition of income using hypothetical liquidation at book value (""HLBV"") method. The Company uses the HLBV method to attribute income and loss to its tax equity investors. Please see Recurrent Energy - HLBV for definition and About Non-GAAP Financial Measures for reconciliation to nearest GAAP measures.

Net cash flow used in operating activities in Q3 2025 was $112 million, driven by changes in working capital, specifically a decrease in inventories during the prior quarter, compared to net cash flow provided by operating activities of $189 million in Q2 2025 and net cash flow used in operating activities of $231 million in Q3 2024.

Total debt, including financing liabilities, was $6.4 billion as of September 30, 2025, including $2.7 billion, $3.5 billion, and $0.2 billion related to CSI Solar, Recurrent Energy, and convertible notes, respectively. Total debt rose from $6.3 billion as of June 30, 2025, mainly due to new borrowings for development of projects and operational assets. Total non-recourse debt as of September 30, 2025, was $2.0 billion.

Business Segments

The Company operates in two reportable segments: CSI Solar, focused on solar modules and battery energy storage manufacturing and products, and Recurrent Energy, focused on utility-scale solar power and battery energy storage project development and operation.

Recurrent Energy

As of September 30, 2025, the Company held a leading position with a total global solar project development pipeline of approximately 25 GWp and a battery energy storage project development pipeline of 81 GWh.

The business model consists of three key drivers:

Electricity revenue from operating portfolio to drive stable, diversified cash flows in growth markets with stable currencies, with some project ownership sales to manage cash flow and debt level;

Asset sales (solar power and battery energy storage) in the rest of the world to drive cash-efficient growth model, as value from project sales will help fund growth in operating assets in stable currency markets; and

Power services (O&M) through long-term operations and maintenance (""O&M"") contracts, currently with over 14 GW of contracted projects, to drive stable and long-term recurring earnings and synergies with the project development platform.

Project Development Pipeline – Solar

As of September 30, 2025, the Company's total solar project development pipeline was 25.1 GWp, including 2.0 GWp under construction, 3.4 GWp of backlog, and 19.7 GWp of projects in advanced and early-stage development, defined as follows:

Backlog projects are late-stage projects that have passed their risk cliff date and are expected to start construction in the next 1-4 years. A project's risk cliff date is the date on which the project passes the last high-risk development stage and varies depending on the country where it is located. Typically, this occurs after the project has received all the required environmental and regulatory approvals, and entered into interconnection agreements and offtake contracts, including feed-in tariff (""FIT"") arrangements and power purchase agreements (""PPAs""). A significant majority of backlog projects are contracted (i.e., have secured a PPA or FIT), and the remaining have a reasonable assurance of securing PPAs.

Advanced pipeline projects are mid-stage projects that have secured or have more than 90% certainty of securing an interconnection agreement.

Early-stage pipeline projects are early-stage projects controlled by the Company that are in the process of securing interconnection.

While the magnitude of the Company's project development pipeline is an important indicator of potential expanded power generation and battery energy storage capacity as well as potential future revenue growth, the development of projects in its pipeline is inherently uncertain. If the Company does not successfully complete the pipeline projects in a timely manner, it may not realize the anticipated benefits of the projects to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, the Company's guidance and estimates for its future operating and financial results assume the completion of certain solar projects and battery energy storage projects that are in its pipeline. If the Company is unable to execute on its actionable pipeline, it may miss its guidance, which could adversely affect the market price of its common shares and its business, financial condition, or results of operations.

HLBV

The Company applies the HLBV method to account for its contractual relationships with tax equity investors in U.S. solar energy and battery energy storage projects. This method which allocates income or loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests reflects the changes in the amounts that tax equity investors would hypothetically receive upon liquidation at the beginning and end of each reporting period, after considering any capital transactions, such as contributions or distributions, between the subsidiaries and tax equity investors.

The following table presents the Company's total solar project development pipeline.

Project Development Pipeline – Battery Energy Storage

As of September 30, 2025, the Company's total battery energy storage project development pipeline was 80.6 GWh, including 6.5 GWh under construction and in backlog, and 74.1 GWh of projects in advanced and early-stage development.

The table below sets forth the Company's total battery energy storage project development pipeline.

CSI Solar

Solar Modules and Solar System Kits

CSI Solar shipped 5.1 GW of solar modules and solar system kits to more than 60 countries in Q3 2025. The top five markets ranked by shipments were the U.S., China, Spain, Pakistan, and South Africa.

CSI Solar's revised manufacturing capacity expansion targets are set forth below.

e-STORAGE: Battery Energy Storage Solutions

As of October 31 , 202 5 , e-STORAGE contracted backlog, including contracted long-term service agreements, was $3 .1 billion. These are signed orders with contractual obligations to customers, providing significant earnings visibility over a multi-year period.

The table below sets forth e-STORAGE's manufacturing capacity expansion targets.

Business Outlook

The Company's business outlook is based on management's current views and estimates given factors such as existing market conditions, order book, production capacity, input material prices, foreign exchange fluctuations, the anticipated timing of project sales, and the global economic environment. This outlook is subject to uncertainty with respect to, among other things, customer demand, project construction and sale schedules, product sales prices and costs, supply chain constraints, and geopolitical conflicts. Management's views and estimates are subject to change without notice.

In Q4 2025, the Company expects total revenue to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 14% and 16%. Total module shipments recognized as revenues by CSI Solar are expected to be in the range of 4.6 GW to 4.8 GW. Total battery energy storage shipments by CSI Solar in Q4 2025 are expected to be in the range of 2.1 GWh to 2.3 GWh, including approximately 600 MWh to the Company's own projects.

For the full year of 2026, the Company expects CSI Solar's total module shipments to be in the range of 25 GW to 30 GW, including approximately 1 GW to the Company's projects. CSI Solar's total battery energy storage shipments are expected to be in the range of 14 GWh to 17 GWh.

Dr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""We will continue to focus on profitable solar markets and to manage volumes in less profitable regions. In contrast, demand for energy storage remains robust, supported by healthy market fundamentals and growing applications. Our 2026 full year storage outlook reflects strong year-over-year growth, backed by contracted volumes and visibility into customers' development pipelines. We also expect to begin production of solar cells and lithium battery energy storage products in the U.S. next year. Financial prudence remains our top priority. Accordingly, Recurrent Energy will increase project ownership sales in 2026 to recycle capital and manage the overall debt level.""

Tech advances While SAF policy is progressing by fits and starts, the technology to produce low carbon aviation fuel is making headway.","A year ago, the investment landscape for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was buoyant on both sides of the Atlantic. Today, the prospects for the sector are more favourable in Europe.

While the SAF market in Europe has continued to gain momentum over the past year, sentiment in the US has cooled following the anti-climate stance of the Trump administration.

In Europe, visibility into revenues for SAF producers is getting clearer, while their US counterparts have spent 2025 shrouded in uncertainty.

Despite this, US corporates have been putting more money into funding initiatives for SAF. Just last month, a coalition of aviation players got together to launch the $150m Oneworld BEV Fund, anchored by American Airlines and Alaskan Airlines, and managed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. That followed another group of corporates that backed the $100m United Airlines Sustainable Aviation Fund in 2023, which gained more LPs from the industry over the following year.

Regulatory cliff

But a US-based SAF investor was downbeat about the SAF market in the US. “It’s a different market from November of last year, that’s probably what the decisive turning point was,” says the investor, referring to Donald Trump’s election victory, which pulled a curtain down over sustainability initiatives backed by the US federal government, including subsidies for SAF developers.

“When the notion of the fund first got started, the regulatory environment, particularly in the United States, was much different,” says the SAF-focused investor.

“All this stuff takes lots of capital, and that capital really was going to be unlocked by virtue of government support, in one form or another, that was going to underpin the funding for it. That support has waned,” he says.

Federal tax credits in the US for sustainable fuels such as the 45Z credits under the Inflation Reduction Act which are given per gallon of SAF produced are less certain than they would have been when some startups last raised money. The new administration’s Treasury Department gave guidance earlier this year that softened expectations for the eligibility of certain feedstocks, and legislative proposals are in the works that might cap the credit-per-gallon below where it was expected.

45Z credits are meant to start this year but are set to expire in 2027 unless extended. That might change depending on the results of the mid-term elections.

At the state level, there are low carbon fuel standards (LCFS), which incentivise producers to lower the average lifecycle carbon intensity of their fuels below a declining annual target.

While LCFS rules are legally independent from federal regulations, the value of the credits is not unaffected by federal regulations. If 45Z support goes down, LCFS credits can actually become more valuable because there is less supply of credits overall, but any state-level increase would not likely compensate for the loss of federal support.

The SAF investor tells GCV that their portfolio companies do have enough liquidity for the next couple of years. For now, they’re in a holding pattern, watching to see how regulations evolve.

By contrast, European players are more confident. Both the UK and the EU have incremental blending mandates that are starting to kick in. The UK SAF mandate requires 2% of the UK’s aviation fuel demand to be met with SAF, ratcheting up to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

The EU’s ReFuelEU mandate starts slower but then accelerates faster than the UK’s, requiring 2% of member states’ fuel to be met with SAF this year, increasing to 6% by 2030, 34% by 2040, and 70% by 2050.

A European startup that recently raised funds is UK-based OXCCU, a company developing technology to convert carbon into fuels and chemicals. Its recent $28m series B saw more participation from corporates including Eni, Aramco, IAG, Safran, and Orlen compared with its series A. Encouraged by the success of its OX1 pilot plant at London Oxford Airport, it is seeking to open its second, larger demonstration plant next year.

Apart from OXCCU, other European SAF startups to get funded this year include Norwegian SAF producer Wastefront and Swiss SAF technology company Metafuels.

Tech advances

While SAF policy is progressing by fits and starts, the technology to produce low carbon aviation fuel is making headway. Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids and eSAF have expanded the feedstock landscape. A large amount of money is still needed to build out commercial-scale facilities, although it may prove to be cheaper to retrofit existing refineries that are not making money.

SAF producers are seeking to change the kind of feedstocks they are using. Regulators and entrepreneurs are prioritising carbon feedstocks such as biogas, waste wood, agricultural waste and captured CO2 because they don’t bring the challenges of food displacement that crop-based bio-fuels do.

“We can start from biomethane or CO2, and I don’t think CO2 is in short supply,” says Nacho Gimenez, COO at OXCCU, who previously considered investments in SAF while an investor at BP Ventures and energy investor DTEK. The problem becomes more a logistical one of capturing the carbon and transporting it than sourcing it in the first place, he adds.

Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is increasingly popular because it takes waste products such as used cooking oil, fatty streams from industrial waste, and other fats and vegetable oils, and can heavily reduce the lifecycle emissions.

But the availability of sustainable feedstock for hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids compared with other feedstocks such as cultivated palm oil is not enough to meet demand. It is also more costly.

eSAF is also gaining popularity because it is made with renewable hydrogen and captured CO2, typically reducing emissions by at least 70% compared with jet fuel. It circumvents the supply constraints of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids and benefits from a sub-mandate for synthetic fuels under ReFuelEU.

Wider outlook

The price of SAF production is still high, requiring economies of scale and large capex.

The price of jet fuel is tied to oil, while the ultimate price of SAF is determined by negotiated contracts.

The capex for building the production infrastructure will only come if investors see that offtake contracts are available at a good price. And at least in the US, where there is no federal blending mandate, that’s even harder to picture than in Europe. Some US investors are taking a step back to see where things go before committing more capital.

“We’ve laid our bets around the space [in terms of technologies], but the market kind of in a trough right now as it relates to climate tech, and sustainability in particular,” says the SAF investor.

“We’re being very prudent and measured with where we deploy capital going forward.”

But, even in Europe, if the costs aren’t brought down by the time the heavier mandates kick in, those costs will be passed on to consumers. Volume by itself is not enough, it will be the most cost-efficient startups that succeed.

“Once we get to those blending levels of 2040, it will not be the biggest SAF producers that thrive, but it will be the most economic producers,” says Gimenez.",https://globalventuring.com/content/uploads/2025/11/Feature-lead-image.png,N,,2025-11-13 06:59:36.396576

LNG And Natural Gas Prices U.S. natural gas spot prices moved less than 1% lower Wednesday to around $4.54 per million British thermal units.
An Enverus forecast Wednesday projected U.S. LNG prices to moderate significantly over the winter months, ""due to storage surplus and mild weather.""
For the first five months of 2025, U.S. LNG exports to Europe increased significantly, according to the EIA.
Exxon Mobil Stock Performance XOM stock declined around 1% to 118.70 in Wednesday's stock market action.","The U.S. is already the world's largest liquefied natural, or LNG, gas exporter but it's set to receive another boost with a major Exxon Mobil (XOM) LNG project set to come online at the end of 2025.

The Golden Pass LNG export terminal in Texas, which is owned by Exxon Mobil and QatarEnergy, is set to begin operations at the end of 2025 and will have export capacity of more than 18 million metric tons per annum when fully operational, according to Exxon. The project was originally expected to be an import terminal before plans changed.

Exxon in August published its global outlook through 2050, which forecasts global natural gas consumption increasing 20%, with LNG demand doubling over the next 25 years. The company also expects around 5% oil demand growth by 2050.

Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told analysts on the Oct. 31 Q3 earnings call that the Golden Pass LNG project remains ""on track for start-up around year-end."" He said that it and other projects are expected to form ""an important foundation"" to ""2030 earnings and cash flow growth plans.

""They're expected to drive more than $3 billion in earnings contributions next year at constant prices and margin,"" Woods said.

""The growth in LNG is what underpins our continued interest in finding low-cost, advantaged LNG production. The recognition of economies growing and people's livelihoods improving and the energy demand required to facilitate that underpins continued growth in oil and gas,"" the Exxon CEO added on Oct. 31.

Golden Pass would become the 9th U.S. LNG export facility after it becomes operational. The U.S. is the world's top LNG exporter, ahead of Australia and Qatar, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

LNG And Natural Gas Prices

U.S. natural gas spot prices moved less than 1% lower Wednesday to around $4.54 per million British thermal units. Natural gas prices are effectively flat in what has been a volatile year.

An Enverus forecast Wednesday projected U.S. LNG prices to moderate significantly over the winter months, ""due to storage surplus and mild weather."" However, the firm acknowledged ""significant upside exists in our view.""

Meanwhile, Europe continues to scramble to shore up its gas inventories as the winter months roll in, attempting to make up the difference for Russian gas supplies lost at the upshift of Russia's attacks on Ukraine in 2022.

Enverus estimates natural gas futures for delivery at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in the Netherlands and Japan Korea Marker (JKM) (benchmark price assessment) will hold near $11 per MMBtu through 2030 ""despite global LNG oversupply concerns.""

The EIA reported last week average front-month natural gas futures for delivery at the TTF averaged $10.69 per million British thermal units for the week, down from $12.79 per MMBtu in the same week in 2024.

In late 2021 and early 2022, the Netherlands TTF market saw record-high prices, reaching an average of $30.94 per MMBtu in the first half of 2022. For the first five months of 2025, U.S. LNG exports to Europe increased significantly, according to the EIA.

The EIA estimates that U.S. LNG exports will rise from an average 11.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2024 to 14.6 Bcf/d in 2025, before growing to 16 Bcf/d in 2026.

Stored European Union gas supplies currently sit at 82.4%, according to Aggregated Gas Storage Inventory, which tracks the commodity.

Exxon Mobil Stock Performance

XOM stock declined around 1% to 118.70 in Wednesday's stock market action. Meanwhile, Chevron (CVX) stock edged down 1.4% to 154.06.

Chevron dipped below its 50-day moving average Wednesday but is in a cup-with-handle base and is 5% below a traditional 161.86 buy point, according to MarketSurge charts. The supermajor held its investor day presentation early Wednesday.

How To Read Stock Charts

ING analysts noted Wednesday that recently there has been strength in the oil refinery stocks, ""with gasoline and gasoil cracks surging amid concerns about supply.""

That stems from gasoline prices holding effectively flat vs. year-ago levels, while oil prices have dropped around 14%. That combination increases refinery profit margins. In addition, disruption of Russian exports of heavy oil and refined products continues to upend markets.

""Continued Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries are a concern for the market, particularly middle distillates. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft, and what they mean for refining assets outside of Russia, is also a concern for broader product markets,"" ING analysts Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey noted Wednesday.

""While the outlook for oil is bearish, the strength in the refined products market is proving to be a significant obstacle,"" according to ING.

The nearly $14bn facility, known as Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina (TBMNC), is expected to create up to 5,100 new American jobs as it ramps up operations. Spanning 1,850 acres, the site will eventually produce 30 GWh of lithium-ion batteries annually, supplying Toyota’s growing range of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles.

Alongside the launch, Toyota confirmed an additional $10bn investment in U.S. operations over the next five years, bringing its cumulative investment in American manufacturing to nearly $60bn since establishing operations almost 70 years ago. Company executives described the development as a pivotal moment in Toyota’s electrification strategy, underscoring the company’s “multi-pathway” approach to mobility that blends hybrid, plug-in and full-battery technologies to meet diverse market needs.

The Liberty facility represents one of the most significant single manufacturing investments in North Carolina’s history, expected to catalyse economic growth across the Piedmont Triad region. State officials have highlighted the project’s role in shaping the area into a national hub for advanced automotive and clean-energy production. Governor Josh Stein called the launch a historic milestone, noting that Toyota’s presence will create thousands of new skilled jobs while bolstering the state’s leadership in the clean-energy economy.

The plant will serve as a key hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries for models including the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV and RAV4 HEV, as well as a forthcoming three-row battery-electric SUV to be built in the U.S. Initial production lines are already shipping hybrid-electric modules to Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama, with full build-out planned by 2030.

Beyond its production capabilities, Toyota has invested in creating a modern workplace and community environment at the Liberty site. Planned amenities include on-site childcare, a pharmacy, a medical clinic and a fitness centre — part of the company’s wider commitment to being a “best-in-town” employer. Don Stewart, president of Toyota North Carolina, credited the plant’s progress to the dedication of its workforce and the collaboration of local and state partners, describing the facility as “a place we are all proud to call home.”

Toyota also announced new education and training initiatives to strengthen the regional talent pipeline. Through its Driving Possibilities program — a national STEM education partnership led by the Toyota USA Foundation — the company pledged an additional $2.7m grant to schools in Guilford County and Asheboro City. The program aims to expand access to science, technology, engineering and mathematics education while connecting students to future manufacturing and mobility careers. Regional education leaders praised the initiative for its role in bridging opportunity gaps and fostering innovation among North Carolina’s next generation of workers.

Josh Shapiro abandoned his predecessor’s effort to join a regional compact limiting power plant emissions.
Democratic political strategist Morgan Hook said cost-of-living issues, including energy affordability, are what voters care most about.
Gas power plant reversal On Friday, the same day the Hochul administration approved the pipeline project, the state also settled a lawsuit with a gas-powered cryptocurrency mining operation.
It was a double blow to climate advocates who had been organizing against the pipeline and energy-intensive cryptomining operations.","“She did not just approve a fossil fuel project. She made a moral choice,” Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, who is primarying Hochul, said on Monday. “New Yorkers deserve a governor who does not treat the climate crisis as a PR problem, but as a test of moral leadership.”

Hochul says she is prioritizing concerns about energy affordability and reliability as she rejects more than a decade of climate orthodoxy in New York.

With Trump’s antipathy toward renewables like solar and wind, increasing energy demand and skyrocketing utility bills, moderate Democrats like Hochul are embracing an “all of the above” approach to energy policy.

“We need to govern in reality,” Hochul said Friday. “We are facing war against clean energy from Washington Republicans, including our New York delegation, which is why we have adopted an all-of-the-above approach that includes a continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability.”

Hochul’s shift reflects a national realignment and recognition by many Democrats that ambitious climate targets are proving more challenging than they’d hoped, and near-term pocketbook concerns, including high energy costs, are a higher priority for voters.

Newly elected Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia also focused on energy affordability during their campaigns. Massachusetts Democrats are actively considering legislation to weaken the state’s emissions reduction targets. California has retreated on climate action this year. And Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro abandoned his predecessor’s effort to join a regional compact limiting power plant emissions.

Democratic political strategist Morgan Hook said cost-of-living issues, including energy affordability, are what voters care most about.

“The reality is, most people don’t think about their power until it is not there, until they lose it, or when they open their electric bills,” said Hook, a partner with Bluejacket Strategies. “Republicans are starting to talk about energy prices, and it is very clearly starting to become a political issue that is rising up the ranks of those issues that are most important.”

Labor and business support

Hochul’s actions Friday were a welcome signal for some, particularly powerful labor and business interests.

“This is a seismic change in policy direction,” said Gavin Donohue, head of the Independent Power Producers of New York, Inc., which represents power generators including gas plants in the state.

Hochul has been communicating more openness to gas for months as the state’s grid operator has escalated its warnings about potential reliability issues in the coming decade.

“No governor, Republican or Democrat wants to be sitting in their office and having blackouts,” Donohue said. “The reliability numbers… are a real, real eye opener to the governor and I think she’s exerted some political courage on this issue.”

Hochul has delayed mandates to electrify new buildings pending a court decision and wants to revise the state’s landmark 2019 climate law that requires steep emissions reduction New York is not on track to achieve. The governor incensed environmental groups at the beginning of the year when she put an indefinite hold on regulations to limit emissions and charge polluters — and Friday’s decisions reignited that anger.

Left-leaning environmental groups Food and Water Action, New York Communities for Change and Third Act’s New York chapters endorsed Delgado this week. They think Hochul took the wrong message from last week’s Democratic victories including that of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in New York City. Mamdani opposes the pipeline.

“From driving new investments in offshore wind, solar energy, and clean water, to cleaning up industrial waste sites in disadvantaged communities, Governor Hochul has shown that we can address climate change head-on while creating good-paying jobs and lowering costs,” Hochul campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.

Pipeline project

The 24-mile Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline that would bring gas to Long Island and New York City was also issued permits Friday by New Jersey. The project was revived in May by developer Williams Co. after receiving support from the Trump administration.

White House officials indicated Hochul agreed to consider new gas pipelines in New York in exchange for the federal go-ahead for an offshore wind project. Hochul’s office has denied there was any deal.

“She swears she wasn’t under pressure or making a deal with Trump, so to me it’s inexplicable,” Third Act founder and prominent environmentist Bill McKibben said in an email. “Signing up New Yorkers for decades of expensive gas-fired power is a serious loss.”

The project had support from business groups and unions. Proponents said it would lower electricity costs and ensure the reliability of the downstate gas system, which has supply constraints and currently relies on trucked-in gas on the coldest days.

“This approval is a significant milestone in boosting local communities by generating more affordable and reliable energy, lowering utility bills, and providing much-needed economic stimulus that will enable more families to ascend to the middle class,” said Gary LaBarbera, president of the NYC and NYS Building Trades.

Williams Co. also plans to continue working on another pipeline former Gov. Andrew Cuomo blocked on Earth Day in 2016 that would carry more gas into the New England region. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation had pushed Williams for more information on the 124-mile Constitution project and the company temporarily withdrew its application last week.

Williams has touted the potential for that project to lower bills for customers in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island by more than $8.5 billion over 15 years.

Energy costs in the region have risen faster than in other parts of the country in recent years, in part because of the reliance on gas and limited supply coming from Pennsylvania and other gas-producing states.

The pipeline approval represents a dramatic departure from more than a decade of New York energy politics under Cuomo, who banned fracking after pressure from progressive environmental advocates, rejected permits for four interstate gas pipelines and signed New York’s 2019 climate law requiring the state to cut emissions to net zero by 2050.

Climate shift

Hochul says the law’s targets are no longer realistic. Some moderate Assembly Democrats, including in upstate New York and downstate suburbs, have similar concerns.

“We’re for decarbonization. We’re for green energy. We want to make it as clean and green as possible,” said Assemblymember Patrick Carroll, who represents part of Rockland County. “We just want people to not have to pay an undue cost to do so.”

Carroll signed on to a letter calling on Hochul to delay a mandate to electrify new buildings over grid reliability and cost concerns. He and some other signatories on that letter support potential changes to the climate law, as well.

Although Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, won big in New York City’s mayoral election, moderate Democrats prevailed in New Jersey and Virginia, Larry Levy, a suburban politics expert at Hofstra University, pointed out.

Suburban voters in places like Long Island will have outsize influence in the general election where Hochul is expected to face off against Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik or Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, Levy said. Long Island residents care about the environment but also reliability and keeping costs down.

“There’s support for what they would consider reasonable projects that can assure the supply of energy and possibly protect its costs, even as they still support green energy,” he said.

But environmental advocates are pushing back on the idea that affordability and decarbonization are at odds.

“We’re not doing enough to install cheap renewable energy,” McKibben said, pointing to a new program in Australia that is offering residents three free hours of power a day thanks to its abundant solar generation.

New York has continued to contract for new renewable energy projects, with ratepayers paying a premium on their utility bills to support the projects. Hochul has espoused continued commitment to advancing those projects before federal tax credits expire.

Gas power plant reversal

On Friday, the same day the Hochul administration approved the pipeline project, the state also settled a lawsuit with a gas-powered cryptocurrency mining operation. The Department of Environmental Conservation plans to issue a permit for the Greenidge plant with the caveat that it will reduce emissions over 5 years.

The state had denied an air permit to Greenidge in 2022, citing the state’s landmark 2019 climate law.

It was a double blow to climate advocates who had been organizing against the pipeline and energy-intensive cryptomining operations.

“This is a disgusting betrayal of New Yorkers and a slap in the face to everyone who fought for our climate law,” said Yvonne Taylor, Vice President of Seneca Lake Guardian.

The Greenidge deal is a stark reversal for the governor who cheered the rejection of permits for downstate gas plants in her first few months on the job. The DEC in those 2021 actions blocked two downstate gas projects that could have supplied additional energy at lower emissions rates than older plants.

Hochul’s administration at the time declared new gas plants incompatible with the state’s climate law. As circumstances and the political winds have shifted, the governor is now embracing new nuclear and potential gas generation to close projected energy shortfalls.

New York’s grid operator is keeping older fossil fuel plants targeted for retirement by state emissions rules online for reliability reasons. They’re likely to be retained to address a forecasted reliability issue in New York City and on Long Island in the next few years.

Hochul cited those reliability concerns as DEC approved the pipeline.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F48%2Fe2%2F65a6be154cf7b43c787326263615%2Fgettyimages-2243227447.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 06:00:34.712493

Question: How do you see the next decade of the European EV battery market, and how will CATL contribute to it?
For us, it is a strategic goal to become a European manufacturer with a localised workforce and supply chain.
In response, CATL Debrecen entered into partnerships with the Vocational Training Centre and University of Debrecen and the University of Miskolc.
We also welcome university interns at CATL Debrecen, and we are planning to open a training centre modelled on our German facility.","In this interview with Matt Shen (Feng), CATL’s Managing Director for Germany and Hungary, we explored CATL’s ambitious strategy to lead the EV battery revolution across Europe. Mr Shen emphasised that localising CATL’s supplier base is a key part of their strategy, and they see strong potential in Hungary, particularly for the Debrecen factory. The company also plans to launch its own university and vocational courses, along with scholarships, to attract local talent.

Regarding the local environmental concerns, the regional leader stressed that CATL is fully committed to meeting all environmental regulations and to operating a strict monitoring process. “Our goal is to provide clear, honest information and build trust through responsible operations,” stated Matt Shen. In five years, he hopes the Debrecen factory will produce CATL’s latest technology and make residents satisfied and proud of the company.

Matt Shen joined CATL in February 2012 as a Senior Manager. He has held the position of Program Management Director since March 2017 and has served as Overseas Car Business Executive President for Europe since 2019. He assumed the role of Managing Director of CATL Debrecen on 17 March, 2025. He was also a speaker at the 5th edition of the Hungarian Battery Days this November.

Question: How do you see the next decade of the European EV battery market, and how will CATL contribute to it?

Matt Shen: Increased investments and lower raw material costs are set to drive strong growth in EV battery manufacturing by the end of the decade. Ambitious goals to expand production, improve technology, and reduce costs will unlock major opportunities for the market in Europe. We expect most vehicles sold in Europe soon – across cars, vans, trucks, and buses – to be electric. Declining battery costs mean electric cars will soon match the total ownership cost of traditional vehicles, something that seemed unlikely just a decade ago.

After a slower growth in 2024, EV sales are picking up steadily. The global sales of EV batteries enjoyed substantial growth year on year in the second quarter of 2025, increasing by 33 per cent compared to the same time in 2024. This means that almost 19 per cent of sold cars in the second quarter of this year were electric. Europe has played a significant role in the growth, with the top five European markets growing by 25 per cent year on year in the first half of 2025.

This fierce competition among battery makers in Europe pushes everyone to deliver the best products for OEMs – those who fall behind risk being left out. CATL is ready for this challenge. We’re developing new battery models tailored to European customers, backed by the world’s leading battery tech and largest R&D team. We’re confident we’ll play a key role in Europe’s electric transition. Our commitment to innovation keeps our production flexible and adaptable, enabling us to quickly respond to market changes, new technologies, and customer demand

Q: Does the company plan to further expand in Europe? If so, along what strategy?

MS: Emission regulations are becoming increasingly strict in the EU, with the goal of a complete transition to electric vehicles. The 2035 deadline for banning the sale of internal combustion vehicles is approaching, leaving less than 10 years to complete the transition. CATL has clients everywhere in Europe, and we are proud of collaborating with over 200 OEMs worldwide, including all the long-standing European partners, who built the world’s first cars and started the development of the automotive industry.

We aim to become the most reliable partner of Europe in its energy transition journey. For us, it is a strategic goal to become a European manufacturer with a localised workforce and supply chain. Our factory in Germany is already operating. Within a few months, we plan to start cell production in Hungary, and we are working on establishing a new production base in Spain, which is a joint venture with Stellantis.

Q: How do you see the future of Chinese-Hungarian cooperation in the electric vehicle industry, especially in light of the EU regulations that are now more strictly reviewing Chinese investments in this sector?

MS: I can only speak on CATL’s behalf. The development of EU competition regulations and changes in international customs tariffs pose significant risks for all international manufacturing companies, regardless of the sector. CATL’s European strategy is to help Europe build an EV and clean energy ecosystem that is “in Europe, for Europe and of Europe,” and in the process, it is a priority for us to follow EU standards in the field of production, and ensure the compliance of new technology and product developments in the EU. It is necessary to see and understand that we are part of a huge global transformation. Allow me to make this easier to understand with a personal comment.

When I bought my first electric car in China, its range barely reached 150 kilometres, while now batteries that can store enough electrical energy allow cars to travel more than 700 kilometres or even 1,000 km, for example Zeekr 001 which is powered by CATL’s Qilin battery at an affordable price, thus breaking down all obstacles and contributing to the spread of electric cars. The future has essentially begun, and CATL is bringing it to Hungary and Europe. We will only help the transition to electric transportation by creating new, valuable jobs and supplier opportunities by installing the most modern manufacturing technology in Debrecen.

Q: What is your personal vision for the Debrecen factory, and what role does it play in CATL’s overall business strategy?

MS: Our goal is to provide high-quality solutions and services to customers around the world, and the new plant we’re building in Debrecen is a key step in that direction. It will help us better meet the growing battery demand across Europe, strengthen our global production network, and support the broader shift toward e-mobility and clean energy in Europe.

In terms of capacity, the Debrecen facility will actually be larger than our plant in Germany, which means we’ll be able to supply even more batteries to our partners. But it’s important to note that the two factories won’t be producing the same products. We plan to tailor production at each site based on customer needs. That means we’ll be working closely with our clients to log and schedule their orders accordingly. Ultimately, both plants are crucial for us to effectively serve the European market.

Q: CATL continuously develops its battery technology and regularly announces innovations. Recently, there have also been reports regarding the Hungarian factory, suggesting a review of the second plant’s technology. What kind of batteries will the facility produce? Will it be capable of switching to newer technologies? Do you plan to develop products specifically for the European/CEE/SEE markets?

MS: One of CATL’s core values is continuous innovation, so production lines are designed to be flexible and easily adaptable to technological innovations or new products. Our latest technologies, incorporating advanced automation and cutting-edge data utilisation, will be implemented across the plant. Artificial intelligence will play a pivotal role in enhancing these processes at our Debrecen facility, working in tandem with 5G connectivity, advanced automation, and robust data management systems.

At the IAA Mobility 2025, we introduced two Shenxing Pro LFP battery products designed specifically for Europe. These products provide groundbreaking solutions to the challenges of range, charging speed, and safety, while also being tailored to the diverse driving needs across the continent. With this approach, CATL demonstrates not only its ability to produce the most advanced battery technologies but also its commitment to developing products that meet the specific requirements of the European markets.

Q: How do you envision CATL building the European supply chain for the Debrecen facility, including Hungarian suppliers? What are your thoughts on the Debrecen region’s potential as a key European expansion hub for CATL?

MS: As I mentioned earlier, many of our automotive partners are based in Europe, and we’ve been working closely with them to deliver top-quality products to consumers. One of the key ways we’re doing that is by establishing a local battery supply here in Europe, which helps us respond faster and more efficiently to our customers’ needs. Currently, we have built a robust local ecosystem anchored by over 1,000 suppliers across the continent.

We strongly believe that shorter supply chains are not only more resilient but also more sustainable. That’s why localising our supplier base is such an important part of our strategy. Hungary, and especially the Debrecen region, really stands out in this regard. It has a rapidly developing industrial ecosystem and a great location within Europe. We see a lot of potential in partnering with local companies to build a strong, future-proof supply chain that supports our long-term growth across the continent.

Q: What conditions are necessary for Hungary to develop a meaningful battery industry R&D sector?

MS: In order to develop a meaningful battery industry R&D sector, it is essential to establish active dialogue and cooperation between government actors, companies, universities and other research organisations. It is vital that both business and scientific approaches are given due consideration, with the aim of facilitating localised R&D that will have a significant and positive impact on the Hungarian battery sector.

Already, CATL can demonstrate some good examples: last year, we signed partnerships with the University of Debrecen, the University of Miskolc, and the Vocational Training Centre of Debrecen. I know that other companies have also begun similar partnerships.

Q: Recruiting local talent can sometimes be challenging. In response, CATL Debrecen entered into partnerships with the Vocational Training Centre and University of Debrecen and the University of Miskolc. Could you tell us more about the details of these partnerships and how they are progressing today?

MS: Our purpose is to support the education system with unique and high-level technology in order to share this knowledge with young talents starting from their very first years at school. We have concrete plans on how to implement our strategy. We started career lectures, where students can get to know more about the company and career opportunities. During special lectures, we focus on knowledge sharing about battery manufacturing technology, while during factory visits, students can experience the working culture at CATL in Debrecen and have a deeper insight into battery production.

We also plan to create our own university and vocational school courses, which will last for one or two semesters and will be assisted by our experts. Our internship program is very successful, and a special scholarship program is on the way. Overall, we aim at creating valuable and unique programs for the future talents and hope that some of them will join our company and contribute to our success in Debrecen.

Q: Hungary has been coping with a growing labour shortage problem for a decade. How do you plan to meet the labour needs of the factory in Debrecen?

MS: As I mentioned, it is part of our strategic goal to develop future talent and support workforce development. We have signed partnerships with the Universities of Debrecen and Miskolc. We also began strategic cooperation with the Debrecen Vocational Training Centre last year to support the training of recruits. We also welcome university interns at CATL Debrecen, and we are planning to open a training centre modelled on our German facility.

CATL aims to be a long-term, responsible partner in Debrecen by investing in education, social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and local community life. Our vision is to grow together with the region by nurturing talent, protecting the environment, and being a good neighbour to local communities.

Q: Many people are concerned about the environmental footprint of battery production. Could you tell us more about how you plan to make production sustainable and environmentally friendly? What specific environmental solutions will the factory employ?

MS: I completely understand that people have concerns – it’s only natural, especially when you’re talking about a relatively new and rapidly growing industry like battery manufacturing. Questions about safety and environmental impact are valid and important. What I want to emphasise is that CATL is fully committed to meeting all environmental regulations.

At our Debrecen plant, we’ll be using a closed production system and implementing a strict monitoring process to ensure compliance with every environmental standard outlined in our permits. Our goal is to provide clear, honest information and build trust through responsible operations. We’ve recently applied for a revised environmental permit that reflects our commitment to sustainability in Debrecen.

One major upgrade is the use of adiabatic cooling towers, which are much more efficient and cut water usage for cooling by nearly a third. We’re also changing how we handle NMP. Instead of building our own regeneration facility, we’ll work with certified partners to manage it safely and sustainably, in line with environmental standards. On top of that, we plan to diversify production at the site – not just NCM batteries, but also LFP cells, which are known for their lower environmental impact.

With better design and tech upgrades, we expect to cut the plant’s energy use to about a third of what was originally planned.

Known as the “Public Lands Rule,” the regulations implement the “multiple use and sustained yield” framework adopted by Congress in the Federal Land Policy & Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The 2024 regulations clarify BLM’s mission to focus on stewardship of public resources by managing for long-term ecological health and resilience, which will protect the interests of the American public in a sustained yield of renewable and non-renewable resources. The intent of the Rule is to ensure that BLM treats conservation of public resources on par with other multiple uses.

The Rule is well-grounded in FLPMA, which directs BLM to manage the public lands for the long-term interests of the American public without allowing for permanent impairment of the land and the quality of the environment. The Rule does not direct BLM to allow or disallow any specific uses at any particular place, but rather it sets forth a framework for how landscape health will be measured and tracked over time, and how natural resources will be protected when BLM considers potential uses of public lands.

With the change in Administration, BLM recently proposed to rescind the Public Lands Rule, asserting that it was conflict with BLM’s statutory authorities in FLPMA. The public notice did not provide much detail on the alleged statutory conflict, but BLM stated its intent to rescind the Rule in whole.

GWC recently submitted comments on the proposed rollback of the Public Lands Rule and worked with law professors across the west to ensure that BLM correctly interprets and applies the multiple use and sustained yield of FLPMA. When Congress passed this bedrock law in 1976, it clearly delegated to the Secretary of the Interior the discretion to decide which uses will be allowed to strike the correct balance between extraction and protection of natural resources.

Rather, they each display the influence of multiple variables producing continuums of coastal system types.
The natural coastal system is now destabilized, requiring construction of groins, jetties, and bulkheads to desperately hold a beach and stop shoreline recession.","Editor’s note: Second in a series on the newest work by coastal geologist Stan Riggs, the following is an excerpt from “Cape Lookout National Seashore: Paradigm For A Coastal System Ethic.”

The book, with a foreword by conservationist Tom Earnhardt, a North Carolina Coastal Federation board member, is the first in the “North Carolina Land of Water” book series and focuses on the Cape Lookout National Seashore.

The nearly 300 photographs, maps and illustrations of shifting dunes, barrier islands and coastal wildlife are interwoven with carefully crafted maps and drawings, “tracing our coast from its ancient past through the centuries to our modern present,” according to NCLOW, the nonprofit founded by Riggs and fellow coastal geologist Dr. Dorothea V. Ames.

NCLOW’s stated mission “is to sustain NC’s dynamic water, land and air systems for generations to come.”

Land-Water-Air Interface: Nature’s Coastal Systems

I like to think that actively evolving coastal systems are like the human body with its totally interdependent array of subsystems: skeletal, muscular, circulatory, pulmonary, nervous, and endocrine systems driven by the incredible brain, heart, and lungs. It is difficult to live a healthy life without all these bodily components working intimately together. Likewise, our coastal system is dominated by an interdependent array of complex subsystems: landscapes, waterscapes, and airscapes all interacting at the land-water-air interface. The geographic conditions, geologic dynamics, meteorologic forces, and chemical-biological characteristics are critical variables that interact to produce a living, breathing, and evolving coastal system. Major coastal system drivers are the Earth’s physical landscape dynamics (uplifting of mountains and opening of ocean basins), its space partners (creating climatic zones and setting the waterscape and airscape into motion), and the life-giving energy from the almighty Sun (driving the hydrologic cycle and atmospheric circulation that dictates the resulting biosphere).

Throughout the world, wherever a water body (ocean, sea, lake, or river) meets the surrounding land, a coastal system occurs. Because all water bodies and land masses are uniquely different, no two coastal systems are alike. Rather, they each display the influence of multiple variables producing continuums of coastal system types. The landscape may be mountainous or low flatlands dominated by hard rock, sand and mud sediment, or rich and black organic matter; located in the polar, temperate, or tropical regions; or it may occur in a stable tectonic zone, an active earthquake zone, or an area dominated by volcanic activity. Likewise, the size, location, and physical-chemical-biological characteristics of the water body are also determining characteristics. A critical third component also occurs at every land-water intersection; this is the overlying atmosphere and its climatic characteristics that help determine the ultimate character and are the drivers of change for each coastal system.

Like the human body, coastal systems tend to be extremely dynamic, changing in response to energy input at several different time scales. Volcanic activity (Hawaiian Island coasts) and earthquakes (US Pacific coasts), the dominant sources of energy, occur over decades, centuries, and millennia. However, the energy input from atmospheric storm dynamics affects all coastal systems and is the dominant energy source along the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts, occurring at irregular but frequent short-term time scales. An extremely active atmosphere with rapidly changing climatic conditions is the overwhelming cumulative force that routinely produces short-term changes and long-term evolution associated with most southeastern US coastal systems. The ultimate driver of these climate systems and associated storms is our space partner, the Sun.

Natural Function of Barrier Islands: Limits to Growth, Development

Barrier islands and their associated water bodies have a set of dynamics that are established by the natural functions of Earth’s systems. The word “function” relative to the interactions between the land-water-air interface means assigned actions, activities, duties, or role. The function of interstate highways is to get vehicles from point A to point B very fast. Yes, I can ride my bike or have a picnic on an interstate, but it is guaranteed suicide for me to do so. I might instead ride a bike on a dead-end backcountry road or on a former railroad bed that has been disconnected from the grid, as these now have totally different functions. Rest areas with picnic tables and dog parks are already major components of most interstate highways and they might have separately constructed bike lanes in the future, but not today.

Absolute limits exist as to the number, size, and speed of vehicles that can use a one-lane dirt road. Absolute but different limits occur when it becomes a paved two-lane road. Soon the two-lane road becomes overwhelmed, and it is expanded to a four-lane highway, and with continued growth and development in expanding urban areas, it will evolve into six- and eight-lane segments. At some point in the situation of unlimited growth and development the function of each system will break down. Then society is generally forced to come up with new rules or zoning conditions essential for developing an upgraded or new roadway system that requires new land and higher-grade building materials for new types of vehicles that need higher speed limits, and so on.

Similar rules, or zoning, what I call geo-zoning or eco-zoning, must now be considered for natural landscapes, waterscapes, and airscapes confronted with the pressures of unlimited growth and development. The problem is that society generally sets economic rules concerning natural dynamics that maximize profits and minimize the cost of living. For example, many laws require state and federal contracts to go to the lowest bidder or require projects to have a certain cost-benefit ratio.

Often this requires that new roadways go straight through natural areas or over waterways. These laws also often eliminate or divide impoverished and minority urban areas, as well as promote minimum water drainage structures and shorter project life expectancies. Rarely do they take into consideration the cumulative impact or unintended consequences on complex, interdependent systems. In addition, a general lack of understanding of the scientific dynamics of many Earth systems leads directly to minimizing the use of scientific data relative to the economic impact of a project. Good societal and natural reasons exist for limits and constraints on our riding bikes on interstate highways; the same is true for living in active riverine floodplains, discharging waste into waterways, or building houses on ocean shorelines.

Barrier islands and their beaches are only mobile piles of sand at the intersection of land, water, and air. Yes, this is real estate that can be subdivided into house lots and developed from shore to shore. However, shoreline lots are not equal to those in the middle of an island since they are direct products of regular storm dynamics on the adjacent water body. A waterfront house for living is like camping on the interstate. The only good news is that your eventual demise will be a bit slower on the beach. With unlimited growth and development, all possible island lots are plotted, sold, and built on. This increased growth soon pressures us to replace our ferry boats with two-lane bridges that quickly become overloaded. Then new four-lane bridges are justified on the premise of the need to get more people safely off the islands during storms. Family beach cottages are rapidly replaced by big businesses that rise vertically as rental McMansions, condominiums, hotels, and full urbanization sets in.

Because sea level is rising and storms continue to impact the barrier islands with more people and larger shoreline structures attempting to prevent the shorelines from moving, beach sand begins to disappear. Pumping new sand onto the islands becomes essential, but it is soon gone even as the islands continue to be developed. The natural coastal system is now destabilized, requiring construction of groins, jetties, and bulkheads to desperately hold a beach and stop shoreline recession. Ultimately, the islands will be encased in steel, concrete, and rock walls with little to no sandy beach along an increasingly steeper shoreface.

When economic development wins the battle, with permanently fixed commercial islands in the ocean covered with urban accoutrements ranging from shopping malls to freshwater parks, the islands will have new economic functions. What happened to the barrier island with its unique natural functions and ecosystems associated with high energy sand beaches, dune fields, tide flats, and marshes that harbored the ghost crabs, sea turtles, and shorebirds? Natural barrier island limits have been violated by unlimited growth and development, and once again the stage is set for the perfect conflict between humans and their natural environment.

Similar to barrier islands, other geographic basins on Earth’s surface and in wet climatic zones (swamps, ponds, lakes, or ocean) have a function of holding water. If the geographic basin is linear and open-ended, its function might be to carry a moving flow of water, generally known as a river. Each type of water system has its own specific functions, each dictating different limits to contiguous growth and development.

Absolute limits to growth and types of development exist for high energy and mobile barrier island sand piles, riverine floodplains, swamp-forest pocosins, and estuarine marshes. Similarly, limits pertain to other landscapes, including the savage clear-cuts of the northwest US rain forests, excavations of Appalachian Mountain tops for coal, the vast deforestation of the Amazon jungle—these are all tracts of insatiable consumption driven by the indigenous American spirit monster of self-destruction. “Unlimited” human consumption has consequences; infinite growth on a finite planet is generally not compatible with natural law. We must embrace the radical notion that all of Earth’s natural resources and crucial ecosystem services are essential if we are to maintain a sustainable and high quality of life in society’s future.

Fortunately, some barrier islands, estuarine water bodies, riverine floodplains, and pocosin swamp forests have been protected from the perils of total modification and urbanization by establishing different forms of protected status such as national seashores, wildlife refuges, coastal preserves, state parks, and conservancy lands. The preservation of Cape Lookout National Seashore, or CALO in 1976 clearly demonstrates the critical interdependence between storm dynamics and the barrier island buffer zone. For these intermediary habitats to continue functioning as nature’s speed bumps, storms must unleash tremendous energy across the coastal wetlands—flooding marshes, reshaping shorelines, and maintaining the shifting sands of healthy barrier islands that buffer the uplands from the sea.

The previous administration initiated this loan, which is still moving forward, enabling existing power lines to carry more power.

As TechCrunch reported, these new grid upgrades will improve electricity flow in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. American Electric Power, the company that owns these power lines, will upgrade 5,000 miles of them in these states to improve energy transmission.

The power company plans to use new conductors to rewire the power lines. With the Department of Energy loan, the company can get a lower interest rate on the project and save at least $275 million. It said that these cost savings will ultimately benefit energy customers.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that the $1.6 billion loan will ""ensure lower electricity costs across the Midwestern region of the United States,"" per TechCrunch.

This power project stands out for its continued momentum, despite so many other energy projects being canceled under the Trump administration.

People living in states that will benefit from the project already have some of the lowest energy prices in the country. Meanwhile, other states' projects were abruptly eliminated, hindering their residents' access to affordable energy rates and perpetuating excess pollution in local communities.

Government support for clean energy solutions is critical to helping people live more sustainably while reducing environmental harm. Regulatory changes that support sustainable energy practices can have a profound impact on how much residents pay for electricity and on the amount of pollution released.

However, every time you reject dirty energy in favor of more sustainable power, you make an impact on your community.

For example, installing solar panels will help reduce your monthly energy costs and lower planet-overheating pollution where you live. To make solar installations more affordable, TCD has put together a Solar Explorer to get trusted quotes from vetted partners in your area, such as EnergySage and Palmetto, enabling you to save thousands of dollars.

When you power your home with clean energy from the sun, it's also more affordable to use other money-saving, planet-saving appliances, like heat pumps. When you're ready to find a heat pump that works with your budget, Mitsubishi can help.

In a Department of Energy statement, Wright said: ""This loan guarantee will not only help modernize the grid and expand transmission capacity but will help position the United States to win the AI [artificial intelligence] race and grow our manufacturing base.""

Here are some key insights and examples:

District Energy Systems

District energy systems, which provide centralized heating or cooling to multiple buildings, have sparked mixed opinions:

Efficiency and Practicality: Some Redditors believe that while district energy systems can be more efficient in dense urban areas, they might not be practical for less dense regions. ""In areas like Universities and cities with buildings close together and a higher density it could be worthwhile to look into since it is more energy efficient and saves cost over the long run.""

Control and Maintenance: Concerns about individual control over home temperatures and the reliability of centralized systems are common. ""If it means each household can’t control the temperature of their home at any given time, most Americans will likely not be supportive of that.""

Solar and Renewable Energy

Solar energy is frequently discussed, especially in the context of door-to-door sales and potential scams:

Door-to-Door Sales: Many Redditors warn about the aggressive and potentially misleading tactics of solar sales representatives. ""You promise to purchase power for the approximate cost of what the solar panels cost, except they own the solar panels and you're at their mercy if something breaks down.""

Scams: There are numerous reports of solar energy scams, where sales representatives misrepresent the benefits and costs of their programs. ""100% a solar scam""

Energy Efficiency Programs

State and local energy efficiency programs are also under scrutiny:

Skepticism: Some Redditors are skeptical about the authenticity and effectiveness of these programs. ""Yes it's a scam. There's no state program to 'weatherize homes'.""

High Energy Usage Flags: The idea of being flagged for high energy usage by a state program is often seen as a precursor to a sales pitch. ""The whole 'flagged for high energy usage' thing is complete bullshit.""

Innovative Storage Solutions

Energy storage solutions, such as sand batteries, are highlighted as promising technologies:

Sand Batteries: Finland’s deployment of the world’s largest sand battery is noted for its potential to store thermal energy efficiently. ""The massive 15-meter-wide system in Pornainen can store enough thermal energy to meet the town’s heating needs for an entire month during summer.""

Collaboration and Development

Collaboration between companies to bring innovative energy solutions to market is also a topic of interest:

Ascent Solar Technologies and NovaSpark Energy: Their agreement to combine lightweight solar technology with mobile hydrogen generation systems for drone powering and other applications is seen as a significant step. ""The agreement brings the two companies’ technologies together to achieve mutually beneficial goals.""

Community Efforts

Community-led initiatives to improve urban environments and energy efficiency are also celebrated:

Urban Compassion Project: This project’s efforts to clean up illegal dumping sites and provide support to unhoused individuals are seen as a positive example of community action. ""Since 2021, Urban Compassion Project has cleared over 3,000 tons of illegal dumping across the Bay Area, with most of our work centered in Oakland.""

The clearcut deadlines and short-term policy guidance are likely to accelerate pipeline wind and solar projects to lock in tax credits.
That said, clean energy and energy storage must still meet FEOC sourcing requirements.
Early BloombergNEF analysis indicates energy storage additions could fall about 7 percent versus prior expectations as FEOC limits narrow supply options2.
Despite the drastic shift in the U.S. energy policy, energy majors are swiftly following the lead of the administration’s agenda.","On 4 July 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), representing a sweeping reset of the United States (U.S.) energy policy. The act drastically pares back the energy transition tax credits for wind and solar, made available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, Code) and further extended or created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), while largely preserving those for clean energies and energy storage in the near future. Complex fiscal incentive rules are further complicated by far-reaching restrictions on foreign ownership and assistance (the so-called FEOC, or “foreign entity of concern”, requirements) that will reshape supply chains and financing across both renewable and clean energies. On the other hand, the OBBB presents clear wins for fossil fuels under a more permissive leasing and fiscal regime.

Incentives Rolled Back for Wind and Solar

The OBBB phases out the long-standing tax credits for wind and solar which were reinforced under the IRA regime, namely the clean electricity production credit under Section 45Y of the Code (Production Tax Credits) or the clean electricity investment credit under Section 48E of the Code (Investment Tax Credits). Under the OBBB, wind and solar projects may only retain eligibility for the Production and Investment Tax Credits if they begin construction before 5 July 2026 or are placed in service by 31 Dec. 2027. Developers are expected to rely primarily on the latter pathway, in which case they would have until the end of 2030 to place their projects in service to maximise their tax credits.

On 15 Aug. 2025, the US Department of Treasury further issued Notice 2025-42 (Notice) to tighten the criteria to determine when a wind or solar project is deemed to have begun construction for the purposes of the first pathway. In essence, developers of wind and solar projects with a maximum net output of more than 1.5 megawatts must demonstrate performance of physical work of a significant nature. Based on market experience, this requirement may be satisfied by performing off-site manufacturing work or ordering site-specific equipment such as main power transformers. In addition, once construction has begun, it must be continuous. This continuity test requires developers to place a project in service within four years after the end of the year in which construction starts or, failing that, demonstrate that construction has been continuous from the start.

The clearcut deadlines and short-term policy guidance are likely to accelerate pipeline wind and solar projects to lock in tax credits. The International Energy Agency estimates that U.S. renewable capacity additions will peak in 2027 before tapering in 2028 and levelling through 20301. At the peak of activity, however, developers may be asked to satisfy more stringent requirements of significant upfront physical work and continuity to lenders and insurance providers to demonstrate the project’s eligibility for tax credits (and thus its economic viability). Projects that begin construction after 2025 will also have to contend with FEOC constraints on supply chains, as explained below, adding significant procurement costs.

Extended Runway for Geothermal, Hydrogen, Nuclear and Energy Storage

The OBBB largely preserves the tax incentives for geothermal, hydrogen and nuclear in the near future. Full Investment and Production Tax Credits remain available for geothermal and nuclear projects that begin construction before the end of 2033, while hydrogen Production Tax Credits would still apply to projects that begin construction before the end of 2027. This extended runway is especially valuable for nascent technologies, such as small nuclear reactors, to develop and prove out before the incentives are withdrawn. Energy storage technologies, i.e. properties that receive, store and deliver energy for conversion to electricity such as battery storage, thermal batteries and hydrogen fuel cells will also retain Investment Tax Credits on a similar deferred phase-down schedule.

That said, clean energy and energy storage must still meet FEOC sourcing requirements. As explained below, this will strain supply chains for critical minerals and components, traditionally dominated by Chinese suppliers. Early BloombergNEF analysis indicates energy storage additions could fall about 7 percent versus prior expectations as FEOC limits narrow supply options2.

FEOC Requirements: Ownership/Control and Material Assistance

The OBBB conditions tax credits eligibility on compliance with more stringent foreign ownership/ control and material assistance rules. The latter stipulates that projects for which specified foreign or foreign influenced entities provide “material assistance” will not be eligible for the Production or Investment Tax Credits. “Material assistance” is determined based on the proportion of direct project or component costs attributable to the relevant entity. For example, starting in 2026, energy storage projects seeking to receive investment tax credits must ensure 55 percent or more of the total material costs are not sourced from specified foreign or foreign influenced entities. This threshold gradually increases for projects that begin construction in subsequent years, reaching 75 percent by 2030.

The designation of specified foreign and foreign-influenced entities include companies owned or controlled by the governments of China, Iran, North Korea or Russia, or by citizens of those countries or otherwise organised or having a principal place of business in one of those countries. For wind, solar and energy storage – sectors where Chinese inputs dominate key components – the “material assistance” restrictions threaten to further tighten already strained supply chains and elevate capex.

Clear Wins for Fossil Fuels

The OBBB is unequivocally supportive of oil and gas, primarily through mandating new lease sales across federal lands and waters. Under the IRA, offshore oil and gas lease sales are linked to those of offshore wind and, as a result, the administration only scheduled three offshore oil and gas lease sales for the 2024-2029 period. By contrast, under the OBBB, the federal government plans to add 30 oil and gas lease sales across the Gulf region over 15 years. In addition, the OBBB restores royalty rates to pre‑IRA levels, reinstates full deductions for intangible drilling costs and delays the methane emissions fee until 2035. As key fossil fuel incentives are reinforced while those of renewable and clean energy are over time withdrawn, it is predicted that U.S. capital and service capacity will soon pivot into upstream and midstream opportunities.

Where Next for UK and EU Energy Companies Operating in the U.S.?

The combination of tax credit rollbacks and surging material costs due to FEOC “material assistance” requirements may result in companies redirecting capital away from U.S. wind and solar. According to BloombergNEF, U.S. investment in solar and wind in 2025 amounted to $35 billion, down 36 percent from the second half of 2024 – in contrast to a 63 percent increase in the EU3. The Financial Times further reported that Germany’s RWE has halted U.S. projects, including three offshore leases, due to political developments, while TotalEnergies and Shell have also dropped planned U.S. wind investments since President Trump’s re‑election4. At the same time, Shell was reportedly planning to bid for new oil leases sale in December, the first under the new annual lease sale schedule set by Trump5. Despite the drastic shift in the U.S. energy policy, energy majors are swiftly following the lead of the administration’s agenda.

In theory, $80 billion can buy enough reactors to power all of Virginia’s Data Center Alley.
It’s possible the nuclear industry can meet Trump’s goal of starting construction on 10 big nuclear reactors by 2030.
“Nothing in nuclear happens overnight,” said Jeffrey Merrifield, a former commissioner with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
None of them have regulatory approval to build a commercial system, nor have they proven they can produce power at a commercial scale.","After a generation of stagnation, interest in US nuclear energy is sky high, thanks to artificial intelligence’s voracious energy needs. Nuclear companies are stock market darlings, and the Trump administration recently unveiled an $80 billion-plus commitment to help fund new reactors.

There’s just one problem: Hardly anything will be ready to to plug in for a decade.

In theory, $80 billion can buy enough reactors to power all of Virginia’s Data Center Alley. In reality, traditional reactors take 10 years or more to build, while a highly anticipated wave of small, modular reactors has yet to produce commercial power. That means the only plants that will go into service anytime soon are a handful of shuttered facilities that can be restarted.

“There’s a lot going on, and nothing is going on,” said BloombergNEF’s head nuclear analyst Chris Gadomski.

That dissonance underscores how radically, and rapidly, the US energy system has transformed in recent years. Not long ago, utilities were shutting down costly nuclear plants and replacing them with cheaper natural gas-fired and renewable plants. The AI boom has since supercharged electricity consumption, straining power supplies and driving up prices. But while nuclear is suddenly in demand again, logistics and technology constraints threaten to thwart development even with President Donald Trump’s moves to streamline permitting and commit billions of dollars in funding.

It’s possible the nuclear industry can meet Trump’s goal of starting construction on 10 big nuclear reactors by 2030. But there won’t be a lot of wiggle room, said Wyatt Hartley, head of North American asset management for Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. The company is emerging as a key player in the industry, in part because it’s the majority owner of Westinghouse Electric Co., which is expected to be a key beneficiary of the $80 billion reactor deal announced last month.

“Nothing in nuclear happens overnight,” said Jeffrey Merrifield, a former commissioner with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Besides permitting, developers must line up buyers for the power and hire thousands of skilled workers. And some of the most critical components of a plant, such as reactor vessels and steam generators, can take as long as four years to manufacture and deliver.

Hartley expects some of those orders to be placed “in the very near term” but, realistically, it will take 10 years to get just two plants up and running.

Until then, some reactor developers are relying on natural gas. Fermi Inc., an energy real estate investment trust co-founded by former Energy Secretary Rick Perry that is developing a massive data center in Texas, placed orders for reactor components last month, but doesn’t expect them to go into service until the early 2030s. Start-ups Blue Energy Global Inc. and First American Nuclear Co. also expect their reactors to be completed next decade. All three companies are installing gas systems to supply data center customers as soon as possible.

And there’s another wrinkle that could slow deployment of big reactors: The Trump administration hasn’t yet laid out how the $80 billion will be allocated. It’s also not clear who would be responsible for covering the costs for a project that goes significantly over budget. Cost overruns resulted in the 2017 abandonment of the two-reactor VC Summer project in South Carolina.

“What matters at the end of the day is who takes on the cost overrun risk,” said Jigar Shah, who headed the US Energy Department’s loan programs office under President Joe Biden.

Hyped Up

The buzz around nuclear is so cacophonous that simply announcing plans to develop reactors is enough to drive up company valuations. Fermi, which has yet to build any electricity generation and only listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September, is now valued at about $13 billion, more than Campbell’s Co. or Moderna Inc. Meanwhile, firms developing small, modular reactors have seen share prices skyrocketing in the past year.

Despite the hype around small reactors, which are designed to be produced in factories and assembled on site, actual progress is painstakingly slow. Shah and others think small reactors could come online sooner than big ones because they’re potentially cheaper and faster to produce, but only three companies have started construction: Oklo Inc., TerraPower LLC and Kairos Power LLC. None of them have regulatory approval to build a commercial system, nor have they proven they can produce power at a commercial scale.

Kairos may be the closest to delivering on its plans for commercial plant. It’s building a demonstration reactor to validate the technology but won’t generate electricity, and has permission to build a slightly larger version that will produce 50 megawatts. Once the company gets all regulatory approvals, it has a deal to sell that energy to the Tennessee Valley Authority for Google data centers, potentially as soon as 2030.

BloombergNEF’s Gadomski remains skeptical of the modular projects: “They’re just pushing bulldozers around.”

‘A Lot of Talk’

That means the fastest-moving part of the industry is restart projects.

More than a dozen reactors were shut down from 2012 to 2022, mostly for economic reasons, and three of them are now being revived. Holtec International expects the Palisades plant in Michigan to resume service early next year, and Constellation Energy Corp. is on track to switch on a reactor in 2027 at Three Mile Island, in Pennsylvania. NextEra Energy Inc. announced last month that it would bring the Duane Arnold plant in Iowa back online by 2029. Brookfield, meanwhile, is in talks to take over the abandoned VC Summer project, which could go into service in the early 2030s, Hartley said, though the deal is not yet finalized.

But the list of potential restart candidates is very short, and the three planned revivals would produce just 2.2 gigawatts of electricity at most, a fraction of the power Trump wants to generate from reactors.

“It’s a lot of talk,” said Scott Levine, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “Will we see anything soon? No.”

When conditions feel unpredictable, confidence drops, spending slows, and the economy loses momentum, regardless of what the hard data say.","Shoppers wandering store aisles this November still seem to feel the pinch as many North Carolinians plan to rein in spending this holiday season. We are posting the latest Carolina Journal poll in just a few hours, but here is a sneak peek: two-thirds (67%) of North Carolinians say they expect to spend less during the holidays, reflecting lingering anxiety after years of high inflation and economic uncertainty.

We also found that a majority of voters (58%) say they are not confident in the US economy, with 38% saying they are not confident at all (38%). Despite that low confidence level, most rate their own financial situation as either good (37%) or fair (34%).

So what is weighing on consumers? We can’t discount consumers’ economic scars of the last four years. With memories of double-digit inflation still fresh, even modest cost fluctuations feel threatening. Add recent warnings about tariffs triggering high holiday prices, and consumers are more likely to keep a much closer watch on their wallets.

In many ways, confidence often lags recovery. Beneath the caution, there are good reasons to believe that this holiday could mark a turning point in consumer confidence.

Let’s look at the actual data.

The national picture shows reason for cautious optimism. According to CBS News’ Price Tracker and the latest CPI data, inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target at 3.0% in September 2025. While that’s still elevated, it came in below forecasts, and the monthly pace of inflation has slowed. For the year ahead, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates at least twice, possibly three times.

Food and everyday goods, which hit North Carolina households the hardest, are showing signs of stabilization. Energy costs, which often set the pace for consumer prices, are finally easing. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the energy index rose only 2.8% over the 12 months ending in September 2025, a sharp slowdown from the spikes seen in previous years. Gasoline prices actually fell by 0.5% during that period. Because energy is a key driver in the cost of transporting goods and powering production, this decline is an early sign that price pressures on everyday items, from groceries to manufactured products, may continue to moderate in the months ahead.

In North Carolina, the state’s labor market remains strong, and companies continue to see opportunity in our state for sectors like advanced manufacturing and technology. The CJ Poll also found that younger adults (ages 18-34) were more likely than older cohorts to indicate they might spend more this season, a small but meaningful sign that some households feel their finances are stabilizing.

tariff passthrough pressures

Of course, caution is still warranted. Excluding food and energy, core inflation rose 0.2% over last month, a step down from the 0.3% increase in the two prior months, and according to analysis from TD Economics, tariff passthrough costs continued to materialize in core goods prices. Price gains were mostly in apparel, appliances, and hobby and sporting goods, with 75% of categories experiencing price gains last month, up from 67% in August.

The CJ Poll reveals how powerful predictability and psychology are in shaping consumers’ response to inflation amid what feels to be constantly changing economic policy. According to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, consumer confidence reflects not just the economy’s measurable strength but also people’s feelings about stability and direction. When conditions feel unpredictable, confidence drops, spending slows, and the economy loses momentum, regardless of what the hard data say.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shopping-venture-cart-4007474_1280.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 04:00:32.401181

Picture an electric car that could go 600, 700 or even 1,000 miles on a single charge. That’s much farther than the longest-range electric vehicles on the U.S. market, according to Car and Driver magazine — and twice as far the official rating for the long-range, rear-wheel-drive Tesla Model 3, which has a maximum rated range of 363 miles.

Current EVs use lithium-ion batteries, which are also found in smartphones, laptops and even large-scale energy storage systems connected to the power grid. A standard for decades, these batteries have been tweaked and improved by generations of scientists and are now close to their physical limits. Even with the best materials and most optimized designs, there is only so much energy that can be packed into a lithium-ion battery.

I’m a materials engineer who studies these batteries and seeks alternatives with better performance, improved environmental sustainability and lower cost. One promising design uses sulfur, which could boost battery capacity significantly, though some key roadblocks remain before it can be widely used.

Lithium-sulfur vs. lithium-ion

Any battery has three basic components: a positively charged region, called the cathode; a negatively charged region, called the anode; and a substance called the electrolyte in between, through which charged atoms, also known as ions, move between the cathode and anode.

In a lithium-ion battery, the cathode is made of a metal oxide, typically containing metals such as nickel, manganese and cobalt, bonded with oxygen. The materials are layered, with lithium ions physically between the layers. During charging, lithium ions detach from the layered cathode material and travel through the electrolyte to the anode.

The anode is usually graphite, which is also layered, with room for the lithium ions to fit between them. During discharge, the lithium ions leave the graphite layers, travel back through the electrolyte and reinsert into the layered cathode structure, recombining with the metal oxide to release electricity that powers cars and smartphones.

In a lithium-sulfur battery, the lithium ions still move back and forth, but the chemistry is different. Its cathode is made of sulfur embedded in a carbon matrix that conducts electricity, and the anode is made primarily of lithium itself, rather than graphite layers with lithium in between.

During discharging, the lithium ions travel from the anode, through the electrolyte to the cathode, where — rather than sliding in between the cathode layers — they chemically convert sulfur in sequential steps to a series of compounds called lithium sulfides. During charging, the lithium ions separate from the sulfide compounds, leave the cathode behind and travel back to the anode.

The charging and discharging process for lithium-sulfur batteries is a chemical conversion reaction that involves more electrons than the same process in lithium-ion batteries. That means a lithium-sulfur battery can theoretically store much more energy than a lithium-ion battery of the same size.

Sulfur is inexpensive and abundantly available worldwide, meaning battery manufacturers do not need to rely on scarce metals such as nickel and cobalt, which are unevenly distributed on Earth and often sourced from regions such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has limited worker safety regulations and fair labor practices.

Those advantages could deliver batteries with far more capacity and that are cheaper and more sustainable to produce.

Why aren’t lithium-sulfur batteries widely used yet?

The biggest obstacle to mass production and use of sulfur-based batteries is durability. A good lithium-ion battery, like those in an electric vehicle, can go through thousands of cycles of discharging and recharging before its capacity starts to fade. That amounts to thousands of car rides.

But lithium-sulfur batteries tend to lose capacity much more quickly, sometimes after fewer than 100 cycles. That’s not very many trips at all.

The reason lies in the chemistry. During the chemical reactions that store and release energy in a lithium-sulfur battery, some of the lithium sulfide compounds dissolve into the liquid electrolyte of the battery.

When that happens, those amounts of both sulfur and lithium are removed from being used in any remaining reactions. This effect, known as “shuttling,” means that with each round of discharging and recharging, there are fewer elements available to release and store energy.

In the past couple of decades, research has produced improved designs. Earlier versions of these batteries lost much of their capacity within a few dozen discharge–recharge cycles, and even the best laboratory prototypes struggled to survive beyond a few hundred.

New prototypes retain more than 80% of their initial capacity even after thousands of cycles. This improvement comes from redesigning the key parts of the battery and adjusting the chemicals involved: Special electrolytes help prevent the lithium sulfides from dissolving and shuttling.

The electrodes have also been improved, using materials such as porous carbon that can physically trap the intermediate lithium sulfides, stopping them from wandering away from the cathode. This helps the discharge and recharge reactions happen without so many losses, making the reactions more efficient so the battery lasts longer.

The road ahead

Lithium-sulfur batteries are no longer fragile laboratory curiosities, but there are significant challenges before they can become serious contenders for real-world energy storage.

In terms of safety, lithium-sulfur batteries have a less volatile cathode than lithium-ion batteries, but research is continuing into other aspects of safety.

Another problem is that the more energy a lithium-sulfur battery stores, the fewer cycles of charging it can handle. That’s because the chemical reactions involved are more intense with increased energy.

This trade-off may not be a major obstacle for using these batteries in drones or grid-level energy storage, where ultrahigh energy densities are less critical. But for electric vehicles, which demand both high energy capacity and long cycle life, scientists and battery researchers still need to sort out a workable balance. That means the foundation for the next generation of lithium-sulfur batteries is likely still a few years down the road.

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-13 05:27:34+00:00,Canary Media,Rising electric bills helped spur a Democratic upset in rural Virginia - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/rural-virginia-elections-electric-bills-democrats,"“I talked to thousands of people across the district, and rising energy bills was a top concern,” she said.
That effort culminated in legislation heavily influenced by the utility that temporarily scaled back some fuel costs for customers, he said.
Riders for fuel costs and for high-voltage, long-distance electrical wires, by contrast, make up nearly half of the average household bill in southwest Virginia.
Fuel costs are closely tied to national markets for coal and gas, which make up over 80% of APCo’s power-generating capacity.
Passthrough of volatile fuel costs is a common problem for utility customers, Gilmore said.","Many households in rugged and rural southwest Virginia are already struggling to make ends meet. But they pay some of the highest electric rates in the nation, with prices that have risen at more than three times the pace of inflation over the last decade and a half.

Last week, residents of the Appalachian region voted to do something about it, joining Americans around the country in electing candidates who made affordability and spiking electricity bills central to their campaigns.

To wit: Voters in Montgomery and Roanoke counties elected Lily Franklin, a Democrat and former schoolteacher from Blacksburg, as their representative to the state House of Delegates. With 51% of the vote, she beat out a Republican incumbent in a district that voted for President Donald Trump three times in a row.

“It is a huge deal that we won this,” she told Canary Media.

The price of electricity wasn’t the only economic issue on voters’ minds as they cast their ballots across Virginia, giving Democrats the governor’s office, a larger majority in the House of Delegates, and a governing trifecta in Richmond. But Franklin said the topic came up again and again in her district, home to Virginia Tech as well as large swaths of mountain countryside.

“I talked to thousands of people across the district, and rising energy bills was a top concern,” she said. ​“I would hear it time after time — people were like, ​‘My bill is almost three times what it was last year, and I haven’t changed anything.’”

Franklin is determined to tackle the problem when she’s sworn in on Jan. 14. ​“I’m not fixing inflation as a state legislator,” she said, ​“but I can work on energy in Virginia and bring down people’s bills.”

Of course, that’s easier said than done. But Clean Virginia, a Charlottesville-based nonprofit with a research division and a campaign arm that endorsed Franklin and numerous other candidates, just issued a report that could serve as a guide. The study homes in on Appalachian Power Co., or APCo, the investor-owned utility that serves all but a few patches of southwest Virginia.

“The last General Assembly session on the energy front was really dominated by intensive focus on the cost crisis in APCo territory,” said Brennan Gilmore, executive director of Clean Virginia.

That effort culminated in legislation heavily influenced by the utility that temporarily scaled back some fuel costs for customers, he said. ​“But it was not a holistic look at what the actual drivers of the crisis were, [or] a holistic look at how to resolve those crises.”

So, Gilmore’s staff spent months digging into regulatory filings in both Virginia and West Virginia, where APCo is headquartered. What they found is that base rates aren’t the main problem. Instead, add-on fees known as riders are the real culprits — and they typically receive far less regulatory scrutiny.

Riders, especially to fund grid upgrades, are hardly confined to APCo territory, rising in multiple jurisdictions nationwide and even sparking a popular internet meme that cheekily sums up the charges: ​“Distribution fee. Processing fee. … Transmission fee. Fee fee. Fee fi fo fum fee. Might as well fee. … Another dollar won’t hurt fee.”

In deep-red Patrick County, south of Franklin’s district on the border of Virginia and North Carolina, the internet hive mind mostly blames the monopoly-utility model for these costs, with scores of commenters on a local Facebook page bemoaning bills that doubled and even tripled in the span of a month.

The Clean Virginia report authors tend to agree, saying the rising bills overall are propelled by a regulatory system that ​“incentivizes utility overspending, inflates utility profits, and puts disproportionate costs on residential customers.” But the study also drills down on specifics.

The researchers note that Virginia’s 2020 Clean Economy Act, which requires APCo to sell 100% renewable energy by midcentury, is causing some of these riders. But they’re relatively paltry: Solar and wind generation to comply with the law makes up less than 1% of households’ monthly bills today, the report found, and is expected to comprise just 3% of monthly costs next year.

Riders for fuel costs and for high-voltage, long-distance electrical wires, by contrast, make up nearly half of the average household bill in southwest Virginia. Fuel costs more than tripled between 2007 and 2024. Transmission fees rose fivefold from 2009, when regulators first allowed them as a separate line item.

Fuel costs are closely tied to national markets for coal and gas, which make up over 80% of APCo’s power-generating capacity. Coal prices more than doubled in 2021 alone, the report says. Likewise, natural-gas prices jumped 540% between 2020 and 2022. Since APCo customers pay 100% of fuel costs, they bear the full brunt of these increases, while shareholders bear none, Clean Virginia notes.

“If you’re using generation technology that requires a lot of fuel, customers are going to pay more than if you use a renewable source with no fuel,” Gilmore said. ​“Add the volatility and the spike in natural-gas prices because of global and other economic issues, then you see a direct correlation between increased bills and fossil-fuel prices.”

But fuel fees appear to be rising for other reasons, too, the study says. The charges include power purchases from other utilities, and last year, the report notes, the Virginia attorney general found that APCo was buying coal power at above-market rates from an affiliate company, Ohio Valley Electric Corp.

“Legislators should urge [regulators] to order refunds if APCo’s interaffiliate power purchases exceed market benchmarks,” the report suggests.

APCo may also be using more coal power than is cost-effective.

Across the country, plant operators have scaled back use of coal-fired units not just because the fuel itself is expensive, but because the aging plants cost a lot to operate and maintain. Last year, the average run time for U.S. coal plants was a little over 40%. But regulators in West Virginia — where APCo operates two coal plants — have ordered the utility to run the facilities at least 69% of the time, the report says, citing testimony from a recent rate case.

Passthrough of volatile fuel costs is a common problem for utility customers, Gilmore said. ​“But there are some specific APCo elements of this,” he said, ​“including uneconomic dispatch of their coal plants, and a sort of self-dealing with some of the APCo affiliate-owned coal plants.”

Perhaps the biggest challenge is the utility’s ballooning transmission fees. One problem, according to the study, is that the cost of building and maintaining these high-voltage electric lines in the area’s hilly terrain is spread among relatively few customers. The much larger Dominion Energy, for instance, charges less than half as much in transmission costs per household as does APCo.

Data centers could well be a factor, too. Though virtually none are in southwest Virginia, hubs in Ohio, northern Virginia, and elsewhere are crowding the grid run by the regional transmission organization PJM Interconnection. PJM allocates the resulting costs for upfitting lines across its member utilities, without factoring in where these large electric loads are located.

For its part, APCo said in an emailed statement that ​“investing in and maintaining [our] generation, transmission and distribution network is essential for minimizing and shortening outages, accommodating growing energy demands and integrating new energy sources.”

Like utilities nationwide, the statement continued, APCo faces high interest rates and inflation, driving up a number of the expenses associated with generating and delivering power, including ​“higher material and labor costs; … cost recovery for major storms; fuel-related costs not yet recovered through the fuel factor, and cost recovery for investments made in generating plants and distribution infrastructure.”

The company also touted its energy-efficiency programs and noted that a $10 decrease in fuel costs took effect Nov. 1.

The price cut grew out of the law Gilmore said inspired his group’s study, which notes, ​“given that methane gas prices are projected to double between 2024 and 2026, fuel costs are likely to increase again in the near future.”

Incoming Del. Franklin called the reduction woefully insufficient.

“It’s not a whole lot of relief when your wages haven’t gone up any, your groceries are still more expensive, and your rent’s really high — or your property taxes have gone up,” she said. ​“We have to have a more substantial plan to bring down rates.”

The recommendations in the plan by Clean Virginia, such as requiring utilities to pick up a share of fuel costs and reducing reliance on riders, echo a recent report that grew out of a bipartisan resolution from the 2024 General Assembly.

“There are folks that think if we have an all-of-the-above approach — that is how we bring down costs,” she said. ​“Then you’ve got some people on both sides that think nuclear is the direction.”

“And at the end of the day, we’ve got to help the people,” she said, ​“and that’s what I’m going to remind members of my party.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/lily-franklin.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ccd2b6f0bac2cf8fdb582bd90665cd91,N,,2025-11-13 04:59:52.226952

Total sales fell 4.3% year-over-year to 1.28 million units, with a daily selling rate of 47,300 units—down from 52,100 in September. The annualized pace of sales dropped to 15.4 million vehicles, the lowest in three months.

While retail sales were nearly flat, rising 0.3% year-over-year to 1.13 million units, fleet deliveries plunged 28.8%, reflecting a sharp pullback in commercial demand.

GM maintained its lead with 219,000 units and a 17.2% market share, but Toyota closed the gap to its narrowest since April, selling 208,000 vehicles for a 16.3% share. Ford remained in third place with roughly 170,000 units and a 13.3% share. At the brand level, Toyota led with 178,000 units, followed by Ford (162,000) and Chevrolet (140,000). Stellantis’ brief surge faded, with its market share easing to 8.3% from 8.8% in September, GlobalData said.

Among individual models, Ford’s F-150 held the top spot at 40,700 units, narrowly ahead of the Toyota RAV4. The Chevrolet Silverado, Honda CR-V, and Toyota Camry rounded out the top five. The Tesla Model Y slipped from the rankings as the loss of EV tax credits weighed on demand.

Segment-wise, Compact Non-Premium SUVs continued to dominate, but their share fell to 21.4%, the lowest since June. Large Pickups gained the most ground, rising to 14.7% of total sales—their highest share of 2025.

“As the weather turned colder during October, the light vehicle market was also expected to cool down, and in general this proved to be the case,” said David Oakley, manager of americas sales forecasts at GlobalData. “The loss of EV tax credits was certainly a factor in a more subdued October, with some well-known EVs suffering a sharp reduction in sales, whether in year-on-year or month-on-month terms.”

He added that manufacturer incentives “failed to support demand in most cases,” suggesting the current pool of EV buyers “is depleted, as many pulled forward purchases into Q3.” Still, Oakley noted, “the broader picture is that most OEMs reported steady sales outside of EVs, as the industry continued to absorb tariff costs, shielding the consumer—for now—from the majority of their impact.”

From a financial perspective, the data highlight a market still outperforming early-year expectations, even as sales momentum moderates and smaller, import-heavy brands face tougher conditions. For lenders and auto-finance providers, the report signals a near-term plateau in vehicle demand—particularly for EVs—while established truck and SUV lines continue to anchor consumer spending.",,N,,2025-11-13 00:58:58.472365

Battery-electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales were the hardest hit, dropping 47 per cent overall. BEVs were down 43 per cent from a year earlier, representing 5 per cent of total retail sales, while PHEVs fell 62 per cent to a 1 per cent share.

“Following months of significant growth in August and September, when shoppers bought EVs at record rates, the BEV market is experiencing a pullback in October,” said Tom Kondrat, global lead for advanced analytics at Urban Science, in a statement.

He added that the situation is not unexpected, since the termination of U.S. federal tax credits “pulled BEV buyers ahead” as they wanted to take advantage of the incentive before it expired — much like the situation in Quebec.

Kondrat said BEVs accounted for only 5 per cent of total retail sales in October, roughly half their year-to-date share of 8.4 per cent. He expects BEV sales to remain below last year’s levels through the fourth quarter and into early 2026, with a possible recovery next spring as seasonal demand returns.

“A key time frame to look for a rebound will be next spring, when BEV sales historically pick up and the effects of the pull-ahead are behind us,” he said.

The amendment would ban donations from within Michigan’s campaign finance system and also so-called issue advertisements funded through the nonprofit accounts that are the most common avenue for “dark money” in Michigan’s political system.

The Michigan Chamber, which opposes the new ballot initiative, has described issue advocacy as a tool “used extensively to educate the public.” By avoiding a few key phrases that would explicitly support or oppose a candidate or ballot proposal, political groups can spend unlimited amounts to advertise without having to follow any campaign finance rules.

The ballot proposal aims to cast a light on some of that spending, by requiring any outside spending group making even tangential reference to a candidate or ballot issue to report their spending totals and donors to the state in the months leading up to an election.

First Amendment rights?

Business groups argue it amounts to an attack on free speech.

“This ballot petition disenfranchises over 900 state contractors — picking winners and losers in who can and cannot express their freedom of speech through transparent political activity,” Consumers Energy spokesperson Katie Carey told Bridge in a statement.

The type of nonprofit accounts used by Consumers and others for issues ads in the past are not required to disclose who funds them.

Michiganders for Money out of Politics is itself so far largely funded by dark money. It received $115,000 from the California-based Tides Foundation, a clearinghouse for liberal donor-advised funds through which hundreds of millions of dollars pass each year.

The group is currently circulating petitions to try to make the 2026 ballot. It will need to collect valid signatures from at least 356,958 voters to qualify.

The proposal wouldn’t impact political spending at the federal level, which regularly dwarfs state-level election spending.

Protect MI Free Speech’s treasurer is the head lobbyist for the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, Wendy Block. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment for the story.

BCBS noted in a statement that their PAC is “funded entirely by employees, who represent all political viewpoints and voluntarily contribute their own money to our collective work in advancing quality health care in our state” and argued the ballot proposal “silences their voices.”

Consumer Energy also alleged employees “may lose their right to association and to engage in the political process as they do today” under the legislation.

The ballot initiative’s language however, does not appear to block regular employees from contributing to campaigns and political action committees.

“Rank-and-file employees are not touched by our proposal, it’s only c-suite executives,” Sean McBrearty, one of the coalition’s organizers, said in an interview.

Under the language, that includes a company’s president, CEO, treasurer, officer with similar responsibilities, a person with “substantial” ownership or is on the board of directors.

Large-scale solar projects in the United States are experiencing a notable decrease in commissioning delays, based on the latest data compiled from multiple Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory reports. In the third quarter of 2025, around 20% of planned solar capacity reported a delay, compared to 25% during the same period in 2024.

Strong increase in installed capacity despite deferrals

Solar energy remains the leading source of new electricity generation capacity in the United States, driven by utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) projects developed by independent power producers and public utilities. In 2024, despite a high level of reported delays, the country recorded a record 31 gigawatts (GW) of new large-scale solar capacity, representing a 34% increase in total national capacity.

According to data collected through the Annual Electric Generator Report (EIA-860) and updated monthly via the Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory, delays are generally short in duration. Less than 1% of planned capacity is fully cancelled each month. Most reported delays concern projects in the final stages of construction or testing.

2025–2026 forecasts and gap between projections and actuals

For the period from October 2025 to September 2026, power plant developers plan to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online, 5 GW of which are projects already delayed from their initially declared timelines. These figures confirm a persistent trend: installed capacity at year-end is often lower than initial projections.

In January 2024, developers anticipated 36 GW of solar capacity additions for the year, but only 31 GW were actually connected to the grid. This discrepancy is mainly due to late-stage scheduling adjustments, which are difficult to anticipate in developers’ initial declarations.

Development stages and delay dynamics

In the monthly data collection, companies are also required to indicate the stage of development: planning, permitting, construction or testing. Delays mainly affect projects in the final phases, confirming that they are typically short-term technical deferrals rather than structural or financial obstacles.

With strong growth momentum and a declining delay rate, the U.S. utility-scale solar sector continues to expand while adjusting its targets to on-the-ground realities. These adjustments remain a key indicator for market participants and investors monitoring alignment between announcements and actual commissioning.

Personnel on the record were: John Prine (vocals, acoustic guitar), Iris DeMent (vocals) and Marty Stuart (acoustic guitar).
“In Spite of Ourselves” was the only Prine song on the LP.","Let’s start with a quick refresher on carbon capture. When carbon dioxide (CO2) is captured and stored, and that’s all, the process is called carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and requires a Class VI injection well for long-term storage in deep geologic formations. If the CO2 is used for some other process before it’s stored, it is called carbon capture, use and sequestration (CCUS) and for certain applications requires a much-easier-to-permit Class II injection well — the most common example being the type used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Permitting for Class VI wells is typically handled by the EPA, although a few states have gained control over that process, something referred to as primacy, and several others, including Texas, are attempting to do the same (more on those states later).

There are plenty of CCS projects in the works nationwide, driven at least in part by improvements made to the 45Q tax credit for permanent CO2 sequestration as part of 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Under the budget law passed in July, the tax credits for CCS and CCUS/EOR are now equal at $85/MT for most carbon-capture facilities and $180/MT for direct air capture (DAC). Before the changes this year, the tax credits for CCUS/EOR were lower than for CCS. The blue bar sections in Figure 1 below indicate the credit rates under the IRA; the orange bar sections show the increases under the OBBBA.

“In Spite of Ourselves” was written by John Prine and appears as the 15th song on his 13th studio album of the same name. The song features Iris DeMent on vocals with Prine. Dement sang on four other tracks on the LP. Prine wrote the song for Billy Bob Thornton’s film, Daddy and Them. It’s about two lovers who look past each other’s imperfect ways, to a love that will last despite themselves. It was the first song Prine recorded after battling throat cancer in 1998. Personnel on the record were: John Prine (vocals, acoustic guitar), Iris DeMent (vocals) and Marty Stuart (acoustic guitar).

The album, In Spite of Ourselves, was recorded between August 1997 and December 1999 at Country Arms and Jack’s Tracks in Nashville. The album featured duets of classic country songs with female country artists, including Connie Smith, Lucinda Williams, Trisha Yearwood and Iris DeMent. “In Spite of Ourselves” was the only Prine song on the LP. Produced by Jim Rooney and John Prine, it was released in September 1999 and went to #21 on the Billboard Hot Country Albums chart and #197 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart.

John Prine was an American country/folk music singer, songwriter and musician. Working as a mailman in Chicago in the late 1960s, he began writing songs and performing at coffeehouses in the area. After Steve Goodman told Kris Kristofferson about Prine, Kristofferson began using him as his opening act, leading to a deal with Atlantic Records in 1971. He released 18 studio albums, six live albums, three compilation albums and eight singles. He won four Grammy Awards and is a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Prine died in Nashville in April 2020 at 73.

Market Outlook:

The third quarter of 2025 presented a distorted view of the automotive market, driven by a last-minute rush for electric vehicles (EVs) ahead of an expiring federal tax credit. This surge, a 72% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase in new EV sales, represents a pull-forward of demand rather than organic growth, with EVs still comprising just over 5% of total Q3 sales across brands represented in Vincensus.

While overall new vehicle sales rose 11% QoQ and used sales increased 3%, the underlying data suggests a more price-sensitive and competitive landscape ahead. Inventory levels are stabilizing after years of volatility, exposing challenges for brands with older or mispriced vehicles. Lotlinx anticipates a highly competitive Q4, characterized by increased manufacturer incentives, deeper markdowns, and aggressive year-end sales events as automakers seek to clear aging 2025 model-year inventory.

Key Findings

Inventory and Pricing Trends

New vehicle day supply increased by 5 days QoQ to 62 days (up 1 day YoY)

Used vehicle day supply increased by 1 day QoQ to 40 days (up 4 days YoY)

Carryover for new vehicles decreased 2% QoQ to 52%; used increased 7% QoQ to 50%

Aged ending inventory decreased 3% QoQ to 42% for new vehicles and held steady at 48% for used

Units sold with a markdown increased by 1% QoQ for new vehicles and 3% QoQ for used

EV, Hybrid, and ICE Performance

New EV sales surged 72% QoQ, while hybrids rose 7% and ICE vehicles 9%

EVs made up just 5% of all sales, signaling that the surge is short-term and incentive-driven

New EV day supply dropped to 61 days and used EV day supply to 36 days — both below ICE averages

Average list price of sold new units: EVs $55,510; hybrids $44,100; ICEs $41,857

For used vehicles, EV prices fell 3% QoQ to $28,888, while ICE and hybrid prices remained stable

Market Dynamics and Competition

The stabilization of inventory has introduced new challenges, particularly for brands with aging 2025 stock

Dealers are expected to face the most aggressive pricing environment in years, with manufacturer incentives rising sharply to move inventory

Markdown strategies and real-time decisioning are becoming critical for profitability

Wylfa on the island of Anglesey, or Ynys Môn, will be home to three small modular reactors (SMRs) to be built by British manufacturer Rolls-Royce SMR. The government said it will invest £2.5bn.

SMRs are a new – and untested – technology aiming to produce nuclear power stations in factories to drive down costs and speed up installation. Rolls-Royce plans to build reactors, each capable of generating 470 megawatts of power, mainly in Derby.

The government also said that its Great British Energy – Nuclear (GBE-N) will report on potential sites for further larger reactors. They would follow the 3.2GW reactors under construction by French state-owned EDF at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and Sizewell C in Suffolk.

The Labour government under Starmer has embraced nuclear energy in the hope that it can generate electricity without carbon dioxide emissions, while also providing the opportunity for a large new export industry in SMRs.

However, it faced the prospect of a row with the US, piqued that its ally had overlooked the US’s Westinghouse Electric Company when choosing the manufacturer for the Wylfa reactors.

Ahead of the publication of the UK announcement, US ambassador Warren Stephens published a statement saying Britain should choose “a different path” in Wales.

“We are extremely disappointed by this decision, not least because there are cheaper, faster and already-approved options to provide clean, safe energy at this same location,” he said.

The Trump administration last month signed an $80bn (£61bn) deal with Westinghouse, which had been struggling financially, to build several of the same larger reactors proposed at Wylfa. Under the terms of that deal, the Trump administration could end up taking a stake in the company.

A source close to the UK government said: “This is the right choice for Britain. This is our flagship SMR programme, producing homegrown clean power with a British company and we have chosen the best site for it.”

While the ambassador’s intervention is unlikely to change the future of Wylfa, it may put pressure on the UK to choose Westinghouse if it does go ahead with future large reactors.

It is understood that Torness, to the east of Edinburgh, and Hunterston, to the west of Glasgow, would be considered for future large reactors. A source close to the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said the government wants to generate nuclear power in Scotland, despite the opposition of the ruling Scottish National party.

Wylfa generated nuclear power from 1971 until 2015, when its last reactor was shut down. Japan’s Hitachi tried to build a new plant there, but these efforts collapsed in 2019 after it failed to agree funding with the government. GBE-N bought the site from Hitachi.

Starmer said: “Britain was once a world leader in nuclear power, but years of neglect and inertia has meant places like Anglesey have been let down and left behind.

“This government isn’t just reversing decline, it’s delivering thousands of future-proofed jobs, driving billions in investment and providing cheaper energy bills in the long term.”

However, Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, said that building three smaller reactors rather than one larger one at Wylfa would be a mistake because it would not maximise the number of jobs for British workers. The union represents some workers in the nuclear industry.

“Failure to support a gigawatt nuclear power station at Wylfa would be a huge missed opportunity in securing the UK’s energy security,” she said.

Nevertheless, the confirmation of a UK site will be another welcome step for Rolls-Royce, the FTSE 100 maker of jet engines that was chosen as the government’s preferred developer in June.

It owns the majority of Rolls-Royce SMR, alongside Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, France’s BNF Resources, US energy company Constellation, and the Czech utility CEZ, which could order as many as six of the reactors.

Rolls-Royce SMR has more than 1,000 employees, who are racing to produce technology that will also be installed at Temelín in the Czech Republic.

Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, a lobby group, said the Wylfa project was “an exciting opportunity for a UK technology, our domestic supply chain and skilled workforce”.

He added: “To achieve the amount of nuclear capacity the country needs for a secure, reliable and price-predictable electricity mix, we will need reactors large and small.

“There will be other projects using different reactor technologies, and potentially further gigawatt-scale plants beyond Sizewell C. Partnership with like-minded allies, including the US, will be a part of delivering that ambition.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd0d67bd71875cc05e13b88746ec07e7bbf4b885/363_0_2108_1688/master/2108.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8546080980e35ac995c6cb7adbe9991",N,,2025-11-12 22:59:29.131842

This partnership marks a step forward in Sustainea’s efforts to promote sustainable practices across its supply chain.

The project will support around 1,000 acres of farmland near Lafayette, Indiana. That’s a key region within the U.S. Corn Belt known for high corn productivity. The focus is on implementing regenerative agricultural techniques that aim to improve soil health, increase carbon sequestration, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lessen environmental impact.

Gustavo Sergi, CEO of Sustainea, commented, “Regenerative agriculture offers a way to address climate change while supporting rural communities in the Midwest. Working closely with local farmers and trusted partners, we aim to promote practices that contribute to long-term industry resilience. We’re proud to collaborate with Primient and local farmers in Indiana to build a low-carbon future.”

This initiative builds on Sustainea’s ongoing partnership with Primient, which includes collaboration on the development of the first U.S. Bio-MEG facility. The project aims to promote large-scale adoption of regenerative practices in the Lafayette area and ensure responsible sourcing of corn—the raw material used in Sustainea’s Bio-MEG production.

Laura Kowalski, Head of Sustainability and Marketing at Primient, stated, “Since 2018, Primient has been working to increase regenerative agriculture practices in the U.S. Midwest. Using advanced technology, we help farmers monitor and measure their environmental outcomes, contributing to a more resilient supply chain.”

Sustainea’s Bio-MEG, produced from renewable, plant-based feedstocks, offers a way for customers to reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing quality. As the company prepares to expand its operations in the U.S., local regenerative sourcing is central to its sustainability strategy.

The Bio-MEG facility is projected to begin operations in 2028, processing the equivalent of 42,000 bushels of corn daily. This capacity could prevent up to 400,000 tons of CO₂e emissions annually by replacing petroleum-derived MEG with Sustainea’s low-carbon alternative.

Gustavo Sergi concluded, “This initiative reinforces our commitment to creating value at every level; from how we source raw materials to the products we deliver.

We Energies is planning an expansion to add nearly 3 gigawatts of energy capacity, including renewable energy, battery storage, and modern natural gas facilities, to strengthen Wisconsin’s power grid.

The expansion is anticipated to help drive economic growth by creating construction jobs and supporting data centers and other energy-intensive customers without shifting costs to residential or business customers.

A We Energies customer protection plan ensures data centers pay their full share of energy costs, while federal tax credits may help its customers save on electricity expenses.

We Energies announced an expansion plan last week aimed at adding nearly 3 gigawatts of new energy capacity to Wisconsin’s power grid.

The proposal, filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, includes a mix of renewable energy projects, battery storage, and modern natural gas facilities designed to meet growing energy demands while supporting economic development across the state.

A Boost for Wisconsin’s Economy and Energy Security

The expansion plan is set to power data centers and other energy-intensive customers, driving economic growth and creating thousands of construction jobs. The renewable energy facilities will provide clean energy on a daily basis, while the natural gas plants will operate during peak demand to ensure reliability.

Details of the Expansion

The announced We Energies plan includes:

Seven solar projects

One battery storage project

Two modern natural gas plants

Upgrades to existing power facilities to enhance reliability

The renewable energy and battery storage projects are expected to qualify for federal tax credits, potentially saving customers in long-term costs, according to officials.

“These new power plants reflect our commitment to reliability, economic growth, and putting our customers first,” said Mike Hooper, president of We Energies.

“Together, these projects and the data centers they support will energize Wisconsin’s workforce, creating thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of full-time high-tech and energy careers.”

In addition to job creation, the projects will strengthen Wisconsin’s power grid, add thousands of megawatts of locally produced electricity, and enhance energy security for customers statewide.

Fairness for All Customers

We Energies emphasized in a statement that its customer protection plan ensures fairness in cost distribution.

More than 12 million gallons of liquid waste from Smitty Supply had been recovered from impacted areas as of Oct. 28.
The liquid waste is pumped through the tubing and into the ground, filling the tiny spaces in porous rock underground.
As for the kinds of solid waste River Birch will accept from Smitty’s Supply, LDEQ officials wouldn’t provide any specifics when reached for comment Wednesday.
Lisa Karlin, a River Ridge resident and longtime citizen watchdog of Jefferson Parish government, raised several concerns about River Birch accepting waste material from Smitty’s Supply.","Millions of gallons of oily water and spilled petrochemicals from the Smitty’s Supply fire and explosion have been handled at three different sites, but state officials have granted an emergency request to bring some of the liquid and solid waste to a Jefferson Parish landfill.

River Birch LLC, which operates a landfill in Avondale, received a permit exemption last month from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to accept waste recovered after the Aug. 22 fire disaster in Tangipahoa Parish, according to LDEQ records the agency published this week.

Although River Birch’s Class 1 injection wells are permitted for only non-hazardous materials, a 1996 federal law allows them to be used to dispose of certain hazardous materials mixed when with water. River Birch uses its injection wells for petrochemical wastewater, industrial sludge, oily waters, solvents, acids, contaminated groundwater and stormwater, and other liquid wastes that would otherwise be considered hazardous, according to the company’s website.

River Birch’s injection well permit allows it to accept liquid waste statewide, but its solid waste permit is limited to a 13-parish area that doesn’t include Tangipahoa. The company requested the emergency solid waste exception on Oct. 13, and the state approved it two days later.

“This is a unique opportunity for Smitty’s to manage all of its contaminated waste at a properly permitted facility,” Chris Casteix, River Birch’s environmental compliance manager, wrote in the company’s emergency request to the agency.

In its approval letter to River Birch, the Department of Environmental Quality said the waste from Smitty’s Supply “will have no significant adverse impact on the public health, safety, welfare, and the environment.”

It’s unclear how much waste Smitty’s Supply will send to the River Birch landfill. Neither company has responded to calls or emails.

More than 12 million gallons of liquid waste from Smitty Supply had been recovered from impacted areas as of Oct. 28. Roughly half of that amount has already been disposed of at other facilities, according to information from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state.

As of Oct. 16, EPA contractors brought 2.7 million gallons of recovered waste to Preston Environmental Solutions in Baton Rouge for recycling and 3.7 million gallons to Woodside Landfill in Livingston Parish for solidification.

Another 595,000 gallons has been taken to a landfill in Liberty, Mississippi, and injected underground, according to LDEQ records.

Underground injection of liquid waste is an accepted disposal practice under state and federal laws.

Whether it’s an injection well for waste disposal or an oil well for extraction, the structure is mostly the same. A hole is drilled to a desired depth, typically around 4,000 feet for Class 1 wells, and supported with long sections of pipe cemented in place to prevent cave-ins. Often an additional layer of tubing lines the inner walls of the pipe to prevent leaks. There is no encasement or container at the bottom of the well. The liquid waste is pumped through the tubing and into the ground, filling the tiny spaces in porous rock underground.

The EPA requires a Class 1 well to extend below the lowermost formations containing drinking water within a quarter-mile vicinity. Patrick Courreges, spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, said there must be a good enough barrier of impervious rock to prevent any of the waste from seeping upwards. He said the injection pressure at the wellhead is constantly monitored to prevent fractures and blowouts.

River Birch’s website says its wells are positioned 6,500 feet underground.

Injection wells are generally the cheapest option to dispose of contaminated liquid waste, but they do carry some risks such as well leaks and groundwater contamination, according to the EPA and other sources. The federal agency says underground injection is safe when the wells are placed at an appropriate site and properly maintained.

As for the kinds of solid waste River Birch will accept from Smitty’s Supply, LDEQ officials wouldn’t provide any specifics when reached for comment Wednesday.

“River Birch will be disposing of non-hazardous solid waste that they are already permitted to dispose of,” LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said.

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

Lisa Karlin, a River Ridge resident and longtime citizen watchdog of Jefferson Parish government, raised several concerns about River Birch accepting waste material from Smitty’s Supply. She wants to know who determines whether the waste going to River Birch is hazardous or not and if any kind of testing is required to make that determination.

“Even if it’s technically OK, should the parish take in waste from Smitty’s?” Karlin said. “Everything I’ve seen suggests that the Smitty’s waste is likely highly toxic.”

Members of the Jefferson Parish Council have not responded to her questions about River Birch’s permit, she said.

Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng and Councilmembers at-large Jennifer Van Vrancken and Scott Walker have not responded to a reporter’s request for comment.

Karlin also questioned whether River Birch’s permit exemption warranted expedited approval when waste from Tangipahoa Parish was already going to other landfills that were closer in distance.

“Why drive over an hour to get to River Birch?” Karlin asked.

The 180-day emergency permit exemption will remain in effect until mid-April.

Smitty’s Supply faces a lawsuit from the state and EPA that seeks fines and penalties that could exceed a billion dollars for years of environmental violations. The Louisiana Environmental Action Network has also given notice that it intends to sue the company over violations of the federal Clean Water Act.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Plant-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 19:02:22.825647

”Our hope is that this shared statement of principles will inspire bipartisan collaboration across Washington and help get Congress back to work for the American people,” the lawmakers wrote.
The offices of Bacon and Hurd did not respond to inquiries about next steps now that the government seems likely to reopen imminently.","WASHINGTON — With the federal government appearing to be on the precipice of reopening without an agreement on extending the soon-to-expire health care tax subsidies at the center of the shutdown fight, attention is likely to turn to the fate of the Affordable Care Act credits that have helped lower the cost of insurance for millions of Americans.

In particular, as federal employees get back to work and government programs return to normal operations, eyes may turn to the trickle of bipartisan proposals to extend them and the handful of Republican lawmakers who have joined Democrats in calling for action.

The credits, which were established under Democrats’ American Rescue Plan in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and extended in the party’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, are set to lapse at the end of the year, threatening to raise the cost of health coverage plans for Americans across the country.

Democrats, who say they were standing up to the “health care crisis” in America created by Republicans, made an extension of the subsidies the key tangible focal point of their demands in exchange for joining with the GOP in voting to reopen the government.

The eventual agreement to end the record-long, 40-plus-day shutdown that appears likely to become law was worked out by Republicans and a handful of Democratic senators and promises the party a vote on extending the credits by the second week of December but makes no commitments it will result in the outcome those on that side of the aisle want. And given the GOP’s yearslong battle against the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare and the ACA for short, it is unlikely it will. Also, no parallel commitment to a vote was made in the House, where an extension would also have to pass to become law.

Throughout the shutdown, Republican leaders argued they would be open to conversations on the subsidies only once Democrats voted to reopen the government but Speaker Mike Johnson in particular also said there would have to be reforms.

The bipartisan proposals and vocal Republicans

But as the shutdown dragged on, a collection of Republican lawmakers has emerged to express concern about the expiration of the credits and call for Congress to address it, with a few even joining Democratic colleagues to propose solutions.

In perhaps the most notable instance, a bipartisan pair of House members representing California introduced a bill this week that seeks to extend the premium tax credits for another two years while implementing an eligibility cap at six times the poverty level and moving to crack down on what they say is fraud by insurance brokers and waste in Medicare Advantage.

“Our bipartisan legislation will assure Americans are spared from a massive increase in health care costs that is just around the corner,” said Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who joined with Democratic Rep. Sam Liccardo, in introducing the bill. “This will provide short-term relief while we tackle broader reforms to lower the cost of care.”

A week earlier in what marked the first instance of a bipartisan group teaming up to propose a tangible plan to address the credits amid the shutdown, Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, along with Democratic Reps. Tom Suozzi of New York and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, banded together to offer a “statement of principles.” Although not legislation, the statement proposed a two-year extension of the subsidies with an income cap phased out between $200,000 and $400,000.

”Our hope is that this shared statement of principles will inspire bipartisan collaboration across Washington and help get Congress back to work for the American people,” the lawmakers wrote.

The offices of Bacon and Hurd did not respond to inquiries about next steps now that the government seems likely to reopen imminently.

Meanwhile, a group of more than a dozen House Republicans, led by Reps. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Jen Kiggans of Virginia, spoke out last month urging Johnson to ensure action is taken on health care once the shutdown is over. In a letter to the speaker, the House Republicans urged him to “immediately turn our focus to the growing crisis of healthcare affordability and the looming expiration of the enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits” once the government is reopened, warning that allowing them to lapse “without a clear path forward would risk real harm to those we represent.”

Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a well-known conservative firebrand, has also been vocal on the issue throughout the shutdown, noting that her own adult children are set to see their insurance premiums double next year if the credits expire.

For his part, President Donald Trump — who has long railed against the ACA and unsuccessfully sought to get rid of it in his first term — vowed in a recent interview with CBS News to “sit down with the Democrats” and work to “fix” the health care situation in the U.S. when they vote to reopen the government.

Asked about such a pledge from the president at Wednesday’s White House briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is “absolutely open to having conversations about health care” once the shutdown is officially over.

She added that Trump would be “putting forth some really good policy proposals the Democrats should take very seriously.”

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York vowed Wednesday to introduce legislation to extend the subsidies for three years.

The impact of the credits expiring

With the ACA open enrollment period already underway, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health estimated consumers buying insurance through the program are seeing their premiums rise by up to 59%. An analysis from independent health policy organization KFF estimated that the enhanced premium tax credits saved certain enrollees an average of $705 a year in 2024 and would have been more than 75% higher without the subsidies.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, meanwhile, estimated that the end of the enhancements will raise the cost of coverage for enrollees previously receiving the credits by an average of $1,000 a year. And it notes the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found 1.5 million more people will be uninsured in 2026 if Congress waits until the end of the year to take action on their extension.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/capitol_AP_25310656691923_NAT_1109_crop,N,,2025-11-12 22:59:42.605250

North Carolina Toyota battery manufacturing facility grand opening sparks economic promise for U.S.

Toyota North Carolina officially began production on their electric vehicle battery plant in Liberty, Randolph County, with a grand opening event. Local, state and federal officials joined Toyota leadership at the 1,850-acre megasite (the equivalent of 120 football fields) for an official tour and welcome party. The battery facility marks the first of its kind operation in the United States for the company.The Toyota plant brings a $14 billion investment to North Carolina, with an additional $10 billion promised in the next five years in the United States. As of 2025, Toyota has invested $60 billion in the energy and transportation sector in the United States. ""Americans love cars because a car means freedom,"" said US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who spoke before a crowd of thousands at the event Wednesday. ""When companies invest in America, that means great American jobs. And I think the example here is the families sustaining great American jobs that Toyota has made for this community comes from that $14 billion investment.""The new facility hosts 2,000 employees and is set to hire 3,000 more employees in the next phases of development. The current capacity of the megasite can create 150,000 batteries per production line that could power 600,000 vehicles. Last year, Toyota said it sold 1 million vehicles with electric battery capabilities. ""There's going to be a good chance that your new Toyota hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or electric vehicle will be powered by a battery that comes off the line in this facility,"" said North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein. Former governor Roy Cooper announced the plans for the megasite back in 2021, and leaders at the opening event gave a nod to the late former Greensboro Mayor Jim Melvin for his commitment to economic development in the Triad. The site not only employs North Carolinians, but also lowers the cost of electric vehicles produced for Toyota in the U.S.""We want to be both the employer of choice for the people of North Carolina, and all of our sites across North America, but also we stay close to our customers and we want to make sure for families that they have affordability to be able to have mobility,"" said Kevin Voelkel, the senior vice president of manufacturing operations for Toyota North America. The raw materials used for batteries are imported to the U.S., but production costs and use of American labor in North Carolina streamlines the entire supply chain process.""Here in North Carolina, there are more than 400 Japanese companies operating,"" said Shigeo Yamada, the Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. ""Japan is proud to be the leading investor and leading employer in this state.""""It's about belief in the American Dream, belief in the American workers, belief in the power of technology and teamwork to move us all forward,"" said Toyota North America president Ted Ogawa.Ogawa and Toyota North Carolina president Don Stewart announced that Guilford County Schools and Asheboro City Schools would receive a $2.7 million donation for STEM education through Shift_Ed and their Driving Possibilities education initiative.How it works: battery productionMuch of the battery building process is kept under wraps because of the patents on the manufacturing process. Although cameras were not allowed inside the manufacturing site, journalists got a tour of the production site that has already begun.Cells are made of anodes and cathodes. They go through a vacuum-sealed process in a tight room that locks the cells into an aluminum body to mitigate contamination. They are processed in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment and laser sealed as well. Voltages are checked, and helium checks are done to weed out the 'bad' cells. Cells are roughly the size of a cell phone once they are sealed.Electrolytes are run through the dry cells to ensure that the battery can hold a charge, and a second leak test is done. Then, dozens of cells are stacked together in a process called palliating. The pallets are then put inside a heater to be tested for quality and to withstand different conditions.The waiting cells go through a charge and discharge process that lasts anywhere between five to 15 days, otherwise known as the ""cell phone theory."" That means cells get charged, wait for the energy to leave the cell, and then attempt to charge it again. AI is not currently being used on the production floor or in the manufacturing process. The cells get put into a formation called a module, which is the base of the final product battery seen in hybrid vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles that Toyota produces in Alabama and Kentucky. The module is approximately 80% complete when it leaves the Randolph County facility and is finalized on the production floor when being put into vehicles like the Rav-4, Highlander, Corolla, and Camry.

Toyota North Carolina officially began production on their electric vehicle battery plant in Liberty, Randolph County, with a grand opening event. Local, state and federal officials joined Toyota leadership at the 1,850-acre megasite (the equivalent of 120 football fields) for an official tour and welcome party. The battery facility marks the first of its kind operation in the United States for the company.

The Toyota plant brings a $14 billion investment to North Carolina, with an additional $10 billion promised in the next five years in the United States. As of 2025, Toyota has invested $60 billion in the energy and transportation sector in the United States.

""Americans love cars because a car means freedom,"" said US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who spoke before a crowd of thousands at the event Wednesday. ""When companies invest in America, that means great American jobs. And I think the example here is the families sustaining great American jobs that Toyota has made for this community comes from that $14 billion investment.""

The new facility hosts 2,000 employees and is set to hire 3,000 more employees in the next phases of development. The current capacity of the megasite can create 150,000 batteries per production line that could power 600,000 vehicles. Last year, Toyota said it sold 1 million vehicles with electric battery capabilities.

""There's going to be a good chance that your new Toyota hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or electric vehicle will be powered by a battery that comes off the line in this facility,"" said North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein.

Former governor Roy Cooper announced the plans for the megasite back in 2021, and leaders at the opening event gave a nod to the late former Greensboro Mayor Jim Melvin for his commitment to economic development in the Triad. The site not only employs North Carolinians, but also lowers the cost of electric vehicles produced for Toyota in the U.S.

""We want to be both the employer of choice for the people of North Carolina, and all of our sites across North America, but also we stay close to our customers and we want to make sure for families that they have affordability to be able to have mobility,"" said Kevin Voelkel, the senior vice president of manufacturing operations for Toyota North America.

The raw materials used for batteries are imported to the U.S., but production costs and use of American labor in North Carolina streamlines the entire supply chain process.

""Here in North Carolina, there are more than 400 Japanese companies operating,"" said Shigeo Yamada, the Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. ""Japan is proud to be the leading investor and leading employer in this state.""

""It's about belief in the American Dream, belief in the American workers, belief in the power of technology and teamwork to move us all forward,"" said Toyota North America president Ted Ogawa.

Ogawa and Toyota North Carolina president Don Stewart announced that Guilford County Schools and Asheboro City Schools would receive a $2.7 million donation for STEM education through Shift_Ed and their Driving Possibilities education initiative.

How it works: battery production

Much of the battery building process is kept under wraps because of the patents on the manufacturing process. Although cameras were not allowed inside the manufacturing site, journalists got a tour of the production site that has already begun.

Cells are made of anodes and cathodes. They go through a vacuum-sealed process in a tight room that locks the cells into an aluminum body to mitigate contamination. They are processed in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment and laser sealed as well. Voltages are checked, and helium checks are done to weed out the 'bad' cells. Cells are roughly the size of a cell phone once they are sealed.

Electrolytes are run through the dry cells to ensure that the battery can hold a charge, and a second leak test is done. Then, dozens of cells are stacked together in a process called palliating. The pallets are then put inside a heater to be tested for quality and to withstand different conditions.

The waiting cells go through a charge and discharge process that lasts anywhere between five to 15 days, otherwise known as the ""cell phone theory."" That means cells get charged, wait for the energy to leave the cell, and then attempt to charge it again. AI is not currently being used on the production floor or in the manufacturing process.

The current reporting deadline is October 13, 2026.
Thus, if the rule is finalized after May 2026, this would result in an extension of the reporting rule’s deadline.","On November 10, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a pre-publication copy of its proposed rule to significantly reduce the scope of its Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) reporting requirements under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Most significantly, the proposed changes seek to exempt imported articles from the reporting requirement. According to EPA, the proposed rule aims to make PFAS reporting under TSCA more practical and easier to implement by reducing unnecessary or duplicative requirements for businesses, while ensuring EPA continues to receive essential information on PFAS use and safety.

In October 2023, EPA finalized a one-time PFAS reporting and recordkeeping regulation requiring manufacturers and importers of PFAS and PFAS-containing products between 2011 and 2022 to report certain data to EPA. The rule aimed to improve EPA’s understanding of PFAS use and exposure, and potential environmental and health effects. The previous rule did not include traditional TSCA exemptions, raising concerns among regulated entities about significant compliance costs, implementation challenges, and impacts on small businesses—particularly importers of finished products containing PFAS.

Under the proposed rule, EPA now seeks to add key reporting exemptions including: (1) mixtures or articles containing PFAS in concentrations less than 0.1%; (2) PFAS imported as part of an article; (3) certain PFAS that are byproducts not used for a commercial purpose or PFAS that are manufactured upon incidental exposure or end use of another substance; (4) PFAS that are impurities; (5) PFAS that are manufactured or imported in small quantities for research and development purposes; and (6) PFAS that are non-isolated intermediates.

In addition, EPA seeks to revise the reporting deadline under the rule. The current reporting deadline is October 13, 2026. EPA is proposing to alter the deadline for reporting, by having the submission period begin 60 days after the rule is finalized and to run for three months.

The $14b investment is Toyota's largest in a single site, and part of the reason this campus cost them so much (others have built 30 GWH for $2b-$3b) is that it's really three battery plants on the same grounds.

In North Carolina, they're running 4 of 14 possible production lines, making batteries for 600,000 hybrids annually such as Camry in Kentucky and Corolla Cross in Alabama. They're building space for PHEV and EV batteries, but those plans are fairly limited currently, enough to support 74,000 PHEVs and 45,000 EVs.

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a Washington, D.C. event, according to CNBC.
President Donald Trump directed the department in May to start building 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030.
Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which was established in the 1970s, oversees power plants and other uses of nuclear materials.","The Department of Energy will lend most of its loans for nuclear power plant projects, its secretary announced Monday.

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a Washington, D.C. event, according to CNBC.

“By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.”

The secretary, speaking at a conference held by the American Nuclear Society, noted that he expects electricity demand from artificial intelligence to attract billions of dollars from “very creditworthy providers,” CNBC reported. Wright was quoted as saying that his department could match those dollars by as much as four to one.

President Donald Trump directed the department in May to start building 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Wright reportedly added that he hopes there will be dozens under construction by the time the administration ends.

Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive. The president told Wright to use his loan office to build new advanced reactors, finish those that were prematurely suspended, increase the power output of plants that are operating and make resources available to restart closed plants.

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,” Trump said.

The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said in a May report that Trump’s order addressed “well-trodden issues” but was “ambitious.”

The president’s other directives on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are partially aimed at reducing the federal agency’s staff, also present issues for the country’s nuclear energy industry, according to the think tank.

“In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry,” the Atlantic Council explained.

Whitney, Alexander C. Kaufman, Ben Rubin",,,,,https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/where-does-ferc-go-from-here-on-interconnection-rulemaking/,"Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s directive to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to standardize large load interconnections landed last month with a bang.
And it bolstered the industry’s growing enthusiasm for load flexibility for data centers by encouraging FERC to offer expedited interconnection for curtailable loads (as well as colocated facilities that agree to be both curtailable and dispatchable).
And with the ambitious — arguably to the point of improbable — six-month timeline that Wright set for the rulemaking, FERC doesn’t have much time to answer them.
There’s also the question of what kind of load flexibility FERC should push for.
One of the trickiest questions for FERC to iron out is whether it actually has the authority to regulate interconnection to the transmission system.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s directive to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to standardize large load interconnections landed last month with a bang.

The unusual move — delivered via advanced notice of proposed rulemaking — would dramatically expand FERC’s authority over interconnection to the transmission system, which has traditionally been left up to the states. And it bolstered the industry’s growing enthusiasm for load flexibility for data centers by encouraging FERC to offer expedited interconnection for curtailable loads (as well as colocated facilities that agree to be both curtailable and dispatchable).

But the ANOPR leaves open many critical questions. And with the ambitious — arguably to the point of improbable — six-month timeline that Wright set for the rulemaking, FERC doesn’t have much time to answer them.

Allison Clements, former FERC commissioner and current partner with digital infrastructure advisory firm ASG, and Tyler Norris, a researcher at Duke University who authored a seminal paper on load flexibility last February, unpacked some of these considerations on a recent episode of the Catalyst podcast with Shayle Kann. For instance: What are the technical parameters of flexibility? How many total hours of curtailment will be required each year? How will FERC value different approaches to flexibility, from batteries to backup generation? And how to ensure loads actually curtail when they’ve committed to doing so?

One of Clements’ primary concerns is that answering these questions with sufficient specificity will be impossible, given both FERC’s typical approach to these kinds of rulemakings, and the timeline at play.

“Ever since standard market design failed in 2000, the agency has been really skittish about requiring standardized anything across the board….So my instinct, without getting into the politics, is they’re not going to get that specific on first take,” Clements told Kann. “And that’s my biggest concern here. We don’t want something rushed that ends up failing to really take advantage of the opportunity that these flexibility alternatives provide and incentivize them in a way that works for the providers.”

For more of Allison Clements and Tyler Norris’ takes on the ANOPR, listen to this recent episode of Catalyst with Shayle Kann:

In the next five and a half months, FERC will have to take comments on the ANOPR, then write its own notice of proposed rulemaking — an outline of the proposed regulation — then take comments on that NOPR, all before issuing a final rule. According to Clements, accomplishing that by the April deadline would be “rocket speed in FERC world.”

The rulemaking process for FERC’s Order 1920, a landmark long-term transmission planning and cost allocation rule, Clements added, took four years and was 1,200 pages long. The Wright ANOPR, in contrast, was 14 pages. “It’s not realistic,” Clements said of the April deadline. And Wright’s authority to require that six-month speed rulemaking, she added, is simply “the bully pulpit, political pressure.”

“But I think when that letter came out, there were a lot of FERC staffers who were thinking, oh no, my Thanksgiving and holiday plans,” she added.

What kind of load flexibility?

There’s also the question of what kind of load flexibility FERC should push for. The concept has gathered steam in the last year, but there are several ways a large load could be flexible: for instance either throttling down their use during moments of peak demand (as Google has done for several years) or relying on backup generation or batteries. However, there is also a growing move to redesign data centers themselves to serve as flexible grid assets, as the startup Verrus is doing.

Norris argues, however, that ideally FERC would structure its regulation to cover any approach to flexibility that a large load may want to take, rather than picking winners by endorsing a particular one.

“Ultimately you want it to be as sort of generalizable as possible so that you can sort of represent any load that is utilizing this type of flexibility for all these purposes,” he said. “Then we can actually create a market where a variety of different options can compete either onsite — or even to some extent offsite.” While it’s even more nascent, there is a move toward procuring flexibility from other loads in the same balancing authority, he added, including via a virtual power plant program announced by WattCarbon last week.

But the technical specifications still need to be worked out. In the wake of the proposal, a collection of researchers at the Duke Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment, and Sustainability joined Clements and the lawyers of Roselle LP in outlining FERC’s considerations for the rulemaking.

The brief argued that if FERC wants to make the most of large load flexibility — and ideally free up grid capacity at the same time — the commission will need to structure flexibility commitments “as transactions with clearly defined terms.” And in doing so, the group said FERC will need to evaluate rules that:

Enable large load flexibility commitments to avoid or defer transmission upgrades

Enable large load flexibility commitments to reduce capacity procurements

Enable flexible large loads to obtain non-firm withdrawal and, as applicable, injection rights

Clarify study timelines, queue priority, and interconnection process for large load customers, as well as load-supply hybrid facilities and pairings

The response so far

The docket for the proposal is open now; in light of stakeholder requests, the comment period has already been extended from November 14 to November 21, with reply comments due December 5.

So far, most respondents have filed motions to intervene — essentially requests to become an official party to the proceeding, via arguing that they will be directly impacted by the outcome. This group includes both the PJM Power Providers Group and the organization of PJM states, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, and Southwest Power Pool Market Monitoring Unit, as well as companies like Mainspring Energy and Vitol. No company or organization has yet expressed opposition or support for the specifics of the ANOPR.

Utilities, some of the most important stakeholders in this rulemaking, have yet to weigh in.

One of the trickiest questions for FERC to iron out is whether it actually has the authority to regulate interconnection to the transmission system. Clements said on Catalyst that the legal arguments that Wright makes in his filing are strong, but said “I’m not sure if it’s by tradition, by culture, experience or practice that it actually hasn’t been asserted in the past.” Norris added that he anticipates concerns on the jurisdictional question especially from some state commission officials “and certainly the investor-owned utilities.”

So far, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group representing the country’s large, investor-owned utilities, has remained mostly quiet on the ANOPR. The group’s sole statement on the proposal could be characterized as damning-with-faint-praise: “We share the Administration’s commitment to American energy dominance and appreciate their leadership to accelerate energy to win the AI race and fuel our economy,” EEI president and CEO Drew Maloney said. “We look forward to working with FERC to strengthen the grid, drive down costs for customers, and improve reliability across our country.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-11-12T171849.189.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 22:59:36.420931

“Flat production and strong export growth are expected to tighten natural gas balances,” the agency said.

The EIA projects Henry Hub natural gas prices will average about $4.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2026, up 16% from this year, reflecting stronger LNG exports and steady winter heating demand. In contrast, global oil inventories are rising, putting downward pressure on crude prices even as gas markets strengthen.

Gas prices firm as exports expand

The EIA expects Henry Hub spot prices to rise to an average of $3.90/MMBtu this winter (November–March), following typical seasonal patterns of higher heating demand. Prices are then forecast to hold near $4.00/MMBtu in 2026 as U.S. LNG exports continue to grow and domestic production levels off.

“Flat production and strong export growth are expected to tighten natural gas balances,” the agency said.

U.S. LNG terminals are exporting gas at record levels. The EIA expects average LNG exports of 14.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2025, up 25% from last year, driven largely by rapid commissioning of the Plaquemines LNG facility in Louisiana. That project has come online faster than expected, prompting the EIA to raise its fourth-quarter export forecast by 3% from the prior month.

Exports are projected to increase another 10% in 2026, underscoring the U.S. role as the world’s leading LNG supplier.

In contrast to the tightening gas market, the EIA expects global oil inventories to build through 2026, exerting downward pressure on crude prices. Brent crude is forecast to average $54 per barrel in the first quarter of 2026 and $55 per barrel for the year, about $3 higher than last month’s forecast due to revised assumptions about Chinese stockpiling and ongoing Russian sanctions.

Lower crude prices will filter through to the retail level, with U.S. gasoline prices projected to fall below $3.00 per gallon in 2026 and diesel prices averaging $3.50 per gallon, both declines from 2024 levels.

While oil prices ease, electricity demand continues to grow—particularly in Texas and neighboring states. The EIA expects U.S. electricity sales to rise 2.4% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026, led by demand from data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities in the West South Central region.

Coal production, meanwhile, is forecast to remain steady above 500 million short tons (MMst) in 2026, buoyed by the reopening of several Appalachian mines and slower stock drawdowns at coal-fired power plants.

Outlook

The EIA’s forecast highlights diverging trends across the U.S. energy landscape. Oil and refined fuel prices are poised to soften amid growing inventories, but natural gas remains on a firmer trajectory as export capacity expands and new LNG projects ramp up.

By late 2026, the United States is expected to solidify its position as the world’s largest LNG exporter, even as domestic producers face limited output growth and infrastructure planners balance expanding export demand with system reliability.",https://www.compressortech2.com/Images/1260x628/index-20251112-214759-Henry-Hub-graph.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 18:00:58.605395

Dive Brief:

Toyota Motor Corp. announced Wednesday that it will invest an additional $10 billion in its U.S. operations over the next five years to support mobility efforts. Additional details were not disclosed.

The automotive manufacturer also began production at its electric vehicle battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina, the first and only such facility outside Japan, the company said in the release.

The 7-million-square-foot Liberty factory is Toyota’s 11th and can produce 30 gigawatt hours of batteries annually at full capacity. The site is expected to create up to 5,100 jobs.

Dive Insight:

Toyota first announced it was building an EV battery plant in North Carolina in December 2021, with an initial investment of approximately $1.3 billion. Since then, Toyota has gradually increased its Liberty investment, bringing the total spending to $13.9 billion.

The automaker breaks ground on the plant and announced an additional $2.5 billion

Toyota announced its spending an additional $2.1 billion in the EV battery factory

The company announced it’s spending an additional $8 billion, bringing the total investment to $13.9 billion

The new plant will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries for its growing EV portfolio, according to the Nov. 12 press release.

The facility will house 14 production lines supporting hybrid, battery-powered and plug-in hybrid EVs.

The facility currently has “all different stages going,” Don Stewart, president of Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina, said in a video on Wednesday. Four of the hybrid lines are currently operational while its first BEV line is in its trial phase. “So we’re actually producing batteries, but they’re not sellable,” Stewart said.

The Liberty plant assembles battery modules specifically for HEV models of Toyota’s Camry, Corolla Cross, RAV4 and an undisclosed BEV that Toyota said will be the first of its kind to be built in the United States. The company plans to add more production lines, set to launch by 2030.

Stewart added that the North Carolina facility is helping Toyota become a mobility company through its various EV battery efforts. In April 2023, the company introduced a mobility strategy to accelerate EV production and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, according to its media channel, Toyota Times. The strategy also includes improving the energy density of its lithium-ion batteries.

“As [the electrification age] continues to ramp up, we’re right to the leading edge of that,” Stewart said.

In June, the facility beganshipping HEV modules to the company’s Georgetown, Kentucky, plant as well as its joint venture assembly factory with the Mazda Motor Corp. in Huntsville, Alabama, according to the automaker’s website.

This facility, the first of its kind for Toyota outside Japan, plays a crucial role in the company’s efforts to enhance its electric vehicle (EV) production capabilities. Designed to produce lithium-ion batteries with an annual capacity of 30 GWh, the plant is poised to support Toyota's growing lineup of hybrid and electric vehicles, aligning with the global automotive industry's shift towards electrification. The establishment of this facility not only reinforces Toyota's commitment to sustainability but also positions the company as a key player in the rapidly evolving EV market.

The Liberty plant is expected to create approximately 5,100 jobs, contributing significantly to the local economy and supporting the workforce in the region. President and CEO of Toyota Motor North America, Ted Ogawa, emphasizes that this investment reflects Toyota's dedication to its workforce, customers, and local communities. Additionally, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy commends the investment for its potential to reshape the Piedmont Triad region’s economy and stimulate job growth. This development aligns with the current administration's efforts to reshore manufacturing and promote economic revitalization, showcasing the broader implications of Toyota's investment beyond its corporate interests.

Toyota’s commitment to electrification extends beyond the Liberty plant. The company has pledged an additional $10 billion in U.S. investments over the next five years, bringing its total commitment in the U.S. to nearly $60 billion since its inception nearly 70 years ago. As part of its comprehensive electrification strategy, Toyota aims to sell 3.5 million electrified vehicles annually by 2030. This ambitious target underlines the company’s proactive approach to securing a competitive edge in the evolving automotive market while addressing environmental concerns. The Liberty facility is a pivotal element of this strategy, enabling Toyota to meet the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions.

In addition to its advancements in battery production, Toyota faces scrutiny from significant shareholders regarding governance practices related to a proposed transaction with Toyota Fudosan. Elliott Investment Management, a substantial stakeholder in Toyota Industries Corporation, raises concerns over the potential undervaluation of the company and emphasizes the need for transparency in corporate transactions. This highlights the ongoing challenges that Toyota navigates in balancing shareholder interests with its strategic goals in the rapidly changing automotive landscape.

Overall, Toyota's establishment of the Liberty battery plant marks a transformative moment for the company, reinforcing its leadership in the electrified vehicle market while demonstrating a commitment to sustainable practices and technological innovation.

MITCHELL, Staff, DAVID GRUNFELD, HILARY SCHEINUK",,,,,https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-infrastructure-roads-bridges/article_5ea54fb5-0087-5219-97ca-72fedf4cebdb.html,"The American Society of Civil Engineers reached this conclusion and rated all state infrastructure with a ""C-"" in its new report card, though roads and drinking water systems were given a ""D"" and bridges a ""D+"" grade.
Grades for Louisiana aviation, coastal areas and drinking water improved compared with the 2017 grades, but the state’s dams, ports and wastewater systems received lower marks.
The report noted that Louisiana has spent $1.62 billion annually to fight coastal erosion on a combined 150 projects to try to protect 2 million coastal residents and oil and gas infrastructure.
In that same time period, the share of bridges rated in ""good condition"" has steadily fallen, pushing the majority of state bridges into ""fair"" condition.
""This trend means the overall condition of bridges continues to decline, reflecting the increasing overall aging of our infrastructure and the need for continual maintenance,"" the report says.","Extreme weather, chronic underfunding and age are conspiring to keep Louisiana's infrastructure falling behind ""current and future needs"" despite recent federal investments, a national engineering society analysis released Wednesday says.

The American Society of Civil Engineers reached this conclusion and rated all state infrastructure with a ""C-"" in its new report card, though roads and drinking water systems were given a ""D"" and bridges a ""D+"" grade.

The overall ""C-"" represents a slight improvement from what the society concluded in its 2017 analysis, but the group said the 2025 grade still means ""Louisiana’s built environment is not keeping pace,"" as infrastructure continues to age and is affected ""by limited resources and increasingly frequent severe weather events.""

The national average was a ""C.""

The society noted that the state has experienced 36 extreme weather events over the past decade that resulted in $200 billion in damages statewide. While the society acknowledged that some areas have made strides, a member of the engineering society argued more needed to be done.

""The people of Louisiana require infrastructure networks that are as resilient as the people they serve, to keep families safe and businesses operational,"" Katherine Castille, an engineer who is the society's Louisiana president, said in a statement Wednesday.

""The improved grade in this report demonstrates the hard work our public and private sectors have done to modernize our built environment, but we know Louisiana is capable of far better than a ‘C-’ when provided additional resources and a dedicated workforce.""

In 2017, the society gave Louisiana a ""D+"" grade.

State highway officials and Gov. Jeff Landry's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

'Need for continual maintenance'

The society analysis detailed in the 140-page report looked at a wide sweep of public and private infrastructure, from the familiar roads and bridges to ports, airports, dams, levees, drinking water and sewage treatment systems, as well as coastal protection work.

Grades for Louisiana aviation, coastal areas and drinking water improved compared with the 2017 grades, but the state’s dams, ports and wastewater systems received lower marks. None was higher than a ""C+"" grade.

Since the 2017 report, Louisiana has been the beneficiary of post-COVID economic stimulus packages under President Biden that have sent $750 million for public water and sewer systems and $5.9 billion for roads and bridges.

Funding, however, remained a problem in all the categories analyzed. The society also concluded that without enough money to go around, the state needed to find a way to be selective and impactful.

In trying to build in greater resiliency to storms, for instance, the society said the state should improve currently lacking data ""that could guide the best use of limited funds.""

The report noted that Louisiana has spent $1.62 billion annually to fight coastal erosion on a combined 150 projects to try to protect 2 million coastal residents and oil and gas infrastructure. But millions of wetland acres still need restoration, with the billions related to the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon spill set to expire in six years.

The state has major road and bridge projects under construction, including improvements on I-10 and at the I-10/I-12 split in Baton Rouge.

But the society pointed out that Louisiana roads and bridges still have a $33 billion maintenance and capital improvement backlog combined, a rising figure affected not only by continuing demands but also by inflated material and other costs over the past several years.

The society noted that 11.5% of Louisiana's nearly 12,700 bridges are rated as being in ""poor"" condition, which is an improvement since 2018 due to maintenance and repair efforts, but the figure is still nearly double the national average.

In that same time period, the share of bridges rated in ""good condition"" has steadily fallen, pushing the majority of state bridges into ""fair"" condition.

""This trend means the overall condition of bridges continues to decline, reflecting the increasing overall aging of our infrastructure and the need for continual maintenance,"" the report says.

This surge is being driven by transport and industrial electrification, heating, cooling, data centers, and rising demand in emerging economies.

The report shows both the opportunities presented by the global energy transition as well as the risks of inaction.

Following is a statement from Taryn Fransen, Director of Global Research and Data, WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition:

“A clean, reliable, affordable, and abundant energy future is possible – but we need to make smart investments today to get on the right path. The IEA projects rapid growth of electricity demand driven by electric transport, data centers, and air conditioning. Power systems around the world could struggle to keep up – but with the right policies, this challenge could become an opportunity to accelerate the global energy transition.

“Investments in grids are critical. Strengthening and modernizing transmission, distribution and storage will make power systems more reliable and enable clean energy to scale to meet growing demand. Global investment in grids is rising, but more is needed, especially for high-voltage transmission.

“Policymakers and regulators should work with large buyers of electricity – particularly in countries with rapidly growing data centers – to find ways to meet demand without falling back on dirty fuels or driving up costs.

“The clean energy transition depends on critical minerals, but there are risks as countries rush to expand the currently concentrated mining supply chain. Reducing the need for mining through better design and improving recycling and circularity can help manage these risks as we take steps to ensure mining is done responsibly.

“The global energy transition should ensure no one is left behind – from the hundreds of millions of people who still lack electricity and clean cooking to consumers facing rising bills. Policymakers can also embrace new economic opportunities through workforce development and clean energy jobs.

“As world leaders gather at COP30, the choices made today will determine the future of our energy system. Without careful management, households will face higher energy bills, communities and businesses will see more blackouts and emissions will continue to climb. But with the right decisions, we can cut emissions, further unleash the benefits of a booming clean energy sector, and bring reliable, affordable power to households and communities around the world.”",https://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-12 18:00:25.109855

Democrats are expected to oppose the package en masse, though a few centrists may vote for it, despite party leaders whipping against the measure. The House action will be the first time members, who left town while the Senate struggled to pass a stopgap spending bill and curtail the shutdown, have voted since Sept. 19.

House Republican leaders need nearly all of their members to back the deal after the balance of power in the House shifted to 219-214 once Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., swore in Arizona Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva.

Two GOP lawmakers — Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz — voted against the original version of the short-term spending bill when it passed the House in September. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine voted for that bill, the only member of his party to do so.

The Senate significantly reworked it into what is now a 394-page package, adding in three of the full-year government funding bills and changing the date of the stopgap measure to Jan. 30, among many other provisions. The original stopgap was set to last through Nov. 21.

The change will give Congress a couple more months to work out agreement on the remaining nine appropriations bills that were supposed to become law before the start of the current fiscal year on Oct. 1.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing that Trump “looks forward to finally ending this devastating Democrat shutdown with his signature and we hope that signing will take place later tonight.”

Health care costs

Trump will then turn his attention toward the rising cost of health care that Democrats highlighted during the shutdown, Leavitt said, though she didn’t put a firm timeline on when he’ll release any plans.

“Once the government reopens, the president, as he’s always maintained, is absolutely open to having conversations about health care,” Leavitt said. “And I think you’ll see the president putting forth some really good policy proposals that Democrats should take very seriously to fix, again, the system that they broke.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters following a closed-door meeting that Democrats will try to get the necessary signatures on a discharge petition to force a floor vote on legislation to extend tax credits for three years for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The New York Democrat said the extension mirrors how long the enhanced tax credits were set to last initially in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Temporary health care subsidies were originally passed as part of the COVID-19-era American Rescue Plan in 2021 for two years. The Inflation Reduction Act, the signature climate policy bill from the Biden administration, then extended those health care subsidies for three years, expiring at the end of December 2025.

“The legislation that we will introduce in the context of a discharge petition will provide that level of certainty to working-class Americans who are on the verge of seeing their premiums, co-pays and deductibles skyrocket,” Jeffries said.

Democrats will need the support of at least a handful of Republicans in order to get the 218 signatures needed to force a vote on the bill. The discharge petition was released mid-afternoon.

Senate floor vote pledged on ACA tax credits

Democrats said for weeks ahead of the Oct. 1 shutdown deadline they wouldn’t provide the support needed to move the House-passed, short-term spending bill over the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster unless GOP leaders negotiated over the ACA tax credits.

Speaker Johnson said those talks wouldn’t happen during a shutdown and referred to it as an end-of-year issue, though he has repeatedly declined to say if he’ll hold a floor vote on the expiring subsidies in the weeks ahead.

Ramifications of the shutdown worsened the longer it went on through flight cancellations, delayed payments to U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs and no pay for federal workers, just to name a few.

Seven centrist Senate Democrats and one independent, concerned about the shutdown’s impact on their constituents, broke with party leaders this weekend to advance the reworked spending package and then voted to approve the legislation Monday.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who said throughout the shutdown he was interested in a bipartisan path forward on health insurance costs after the shutdown ended, committed to hold a floor vote on a Democratic bill “no later than the second week in December.”

What’s in the new bill

The spending package wraps in several different bills and provisions, such as the three full-year funding bills that cover the Agriculture Department, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Legislative Branch, military construction projects and Department of Veterans Affairs.

Included are:

A stopgap spending bill that will keep the rest of the federal government running through Jan. 30;

$30 million for the U.S. Capitol Police to enhance protections for lawmakers, $30 million for the U.S. Marshals Service to bolster security for members of the judicial and executive branches, and $28 million for enhanced safety for Supreme Court justices;

Language requiring the Trump administration to reinstate the thousands of workers it sent layoff notices to during the shutdown and preventing officials from firing those workers through January;

Provisions mandating the Trump administration provide back pay to all federal workers, including those furloughed during the shutdown. Trump at one point during the shutdown had threatened to yank that back pay, though it is required by law.

The Trump administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy a few hours before the House was scheduled to vote, saying the administration strongly supports the bill, describing the measure as “a fiscally responsible package that provides the full-year funding necessary to support the Nation’s veterans, farmers, and rural communities.”

The package also “ends disruptions to programs the American people rely on and ensures the thousands of Federal employees who have been forced to work without a paycheck, such as air traffic controllers, will be promptly paid,” the administration added.

The Agriculture and Military Construction-VA spending bills include tens of billions of dollars in earmarks requested by lawmakers from both political parties, important to them as midterm elections loom in 2026.

Separate vote planned on senators and subpoenas

But not every Republican on Capitol Hill is happy with how the full-year bills turned out.

Speaker Johnson announced mid-afternoon that the House would take a separate vote later this month to remove language from the package that will allow senators to file suit against the federal government if their data is subpoenaed.

“We are putting this legislation on the fast track suspension calendar in the House for next week,” Johnson wrote in a social media post.

The provision, tucked into the full-year Legislative Branch spending bill, is retroactive to January 1, 2022 and would apply to the eight senators who had their cell phone records subpoenaed during a 2023 investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.

The FBI reportedly obtained data for cell phone use between January 4 and January 7, 2021 for Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.

Congress will likely try to finish work on the remaining nine full-year government spending bills by the Jan. 30 deadline set in the new stopgap spending bill.

Failure to broker a bipartisan deal that can pass both chambers of Congress before that deadline would lead to another government shutdown, though that would be partial and only affect the agencies included in those nine bills.

There are certain agencies that are not viewed favorably by President Trump, and they have a significant number of their workforce on furlough.
The Internal Revenue Service, for example, has had only about half of its workforce active through the shutdown.
For workers whose jobs are deemed essential for the nation, it should also be essential they get paid.
The goal of a smaller government is reasonable, with the number of government employees mostly flat over the past half-century.","The current government shutdown is now the longest on record, surpassing the 34-day shutdown during President Trump’s first term. More than 700,000 government employees are on furlough, and not being paid. Those deemed essential have remained on the job, but without a paycheck to show for it.

What the Department of Government Efficiency attempted to do with a sledgehammer, Congress succeeded in doing with gridlock and an unwillingness to compromise.

On the surface, a smaller government workforce appears to be working. But is it really?

Government has two basic functions. It provides services for the population, and it collects data that informs such services. With the government shutdown, both of these functions are compromised.

There are certain agencies that are not viewed favorably by President Trump, and they have a significant number of their workforce on furlough. The Internal Revenue Service, for example, has had only about half of its workforce active through the shutdown. As an organization, they oversee the collection of tax revenue. If such revenue slows, then less money comes into the federal Treasury. Whether the current non-furloughed employees are sufficient to fulfil their mission remains to be seen.

The Environmental Protection Agency has around 90 percent of its workforce on furlough, effectively bringing all of its research and data collection activities to a standstill. NASA has also seen more than 80 percent of its workforce furloughed. Both of these agencies play an active role in monitoring factors that relate to the environment. Given that Trump believes climate change is a “con job,” starving these agencies of human capital is something he most likely enjoys.

The Department of Commerce has about 80 percent of its workforce on furlough. This, too, is not surprising, since it is a highly data-centric unit within the government. It contains the Bureau of Economic Analysis and International Trade Administration, both of which are equipped to collect data that exposes flaws in the president’s tariff policies.

The U.S. Census Bureau, also housed within the Department of Commerce, collects and analyzes data that capture the economic condition and societal metrics of the nation. It is also responsible for overseeing the decennial census and apportionment, which determines which states gain or lose House seats — something Trump is keenly interested in.

The Department of Labor has more than three-quarters of its workforce on furlough. It contains the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects data surrounding the labor force and the economy, exposing potential flaws in the president’s economic agenda. The firing of its commissioner back in August indicated the president’s interest in suppressing such data.

Though essential workers like Transportation Security Administration officers and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers continue to show up for work, the fact that they are not being paid is de facto slave labor for the government. For workers whose jobs are deemed essential for the nation, it should also be essential they get paid. The forced reduction in flights by the secretary of Transportation will cost the airlines and the government billions of dollars in lost revenue.

Yes, the country continues to function. But is the level of function during this shutdown making the nation better? Ruptures in the foundation of our nation may not be visible for quite some time. And any time data is being suppressed by not being collected, or tasks that contribute to the stability of the nation are not being executed, we as nation are weaker for it.

The goal of a smaller government is reasonable, with the number of government employees mostly flat over the past half-century. Yet, the U.S. population has grown by around 10 percent on average per decade over this time period. This means that the number of people served per government employee has grown over time. Thus, the government has already been shrinking for many years. With the proliferation of technology and the growth of artificial intelligence, there is every reason to believe that this downward trend will continue.

The government shutdown may give the illusion that workers on furlough are not needed. Undoubtedly, some of these people are expendable. The challenge is identifying who they are, as would also be the case in the private sector. Attrition over time can organically address this issue.

Indeed, the tasks that federal workers perform, the services they provide, and the data they collect are all vital to keep the foundation of our nation strong and safe, both today and into the future. Over time, this shutdown will provide evidence to support this statement, as the carnage left in its wake is assessed.

This acquisition, subject to closing conditions, will mark an important step in JOLT’s international expansion, by adding thousands of locations across the United States to its growing footprint, with sites spanning up to 34 states and 64 Designated Marketing Areas (DMAs), including major metros such as Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas–Fort Worth. JOLT will acquire a strategic selection of Volta assets to deliver maximum value for drivers, advertisers and property partners.

The integration of Volta’s network will build on JOLT’s pioneering model of combining DOOH displays with EV charging, connecting brands with consumers at key moments in their daily journeys; from on the way into malls and restaurants to travel hubs and retail centers. Central to JOLT’s approach is its data-led advertiser proposition, delivering advanced targeting, audience measurement and performance insights that enable brands to engage customers with precision and relevance across its network. Leveraging Volta’s foundation and JOLT’s global expertise in streetside OOH and fast EV charging, the combined network will deliver a seamless, measurable experience for advertisers and an enhanced charging experience for EV drivers.

With this expansion, JOLT will further solidify its position as the world’s largest combined EV charging and digital out-of-home network. That scale is reflected in the company’s global client base, which includes leading brands across retail, automotive, finance, technology, and quick-service restaurants, with global brands such as McDonald’s, Amazon, Toyota, Target and American Express among its advertisers.

“This acquisition will accelerate our mission to make it faster, easier, and simpler for drivers around the world to switch to electric vehicles,” said Doug McNamee, JOLT CEO. “The Volta Media Network and JOLT share the same DNA - combining EV charging with a powerful media platform - making this acquisition a natural fit. Securing a significant US footprint represents a major milestone and a longstanding strategic priority for JOLT, strengthening our ability to serve drivers, advertisers, and partners while delivering on our growth ambitions. These assets sit squarely in JOLT’s sweet spot: combining EV charging with digital media. We’ll bring our innovation and operational discipline to maximize their value for drivers, advertisers, and landlords.

“JOLT’s acquisition ensures the Volta network continues to thrive, giving drivers, advertisers, and landlords confidence in its future at a time when its continuation had previously been uncertain,” McNamee added.

With charging speeds tailored to both everyday top-ups and longer sessions, the combined network will meet the diverse needs of EV drivers while creating new pathways for advertisers across categories to engage audiences in contextually relevant, real-world environments.

JOLT’s expansion underscores the growing convergence between mobility infrastructure and digital media, delivering measurable commercial outcomes for advertisers while accelerating the broader shift toward electrification. Looking ahead, JOLT plans to expand its presence across major U.S. markets in 2026, partnering with leading advertisers, property owners, and municipalities to grow its integrated charging and media footprint.

The agreement is expected to close Jan. 1, 2026, and is conditional upon satisfaction of closing conditions. Shell was advised on the transaction by Goldman Sach & Co. LLC.

TAGANGA, Colombia – On Colombia's Caribbean coast, a fishing village lies in a cove where green hills meet the turquoise sea.

A few years ago, oil companies found natural gas off the coast and now plan to drill Colombia's deepest gas wells there.

It's been more than a century since Colombia began drilling for petroleum. But the country's president, Gustavo Petro, wants these wells off the coast to be among Colombia's last.

Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on the need for urgent climate action. Key to his administration's climate agenda is transitioning the country away from fossil fuels, the single-biggest driver of global warming.

In 2023, Petro pledged to stop approving new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal. On the world stage, this was a big deal. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers. Scientists say that to reach global climate targets, some fossil fuel producers will have to leave oil, gas and coal in the ground. Stopping new fossil fuel exploration is a pivotal step.

Now the question is: how is Colombia's energy transition going?

When it comes to growing its renewable energy sector, the country has made progress, says Margarita Nieves Zárate, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, a research group. Meanwhile Colombia's government oil company, Ecopetrol, is continuing its multi-year strategy of diversifying away from oil.

But Colombia's energy transition has also faced obstacles - some external, and some of Petro's own making, says Ana Carolina González Espinosa, senior director at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute. While Colombia has become a global poster child for saying no to fossil fuels, it isn't such a simple story, González Espinosa says.

""I remember the international community, and especially the climate community, clapping,"" she says. ""But maybe they didn't look at all of the challenges that this government would have to overcome.""

""It is not a happy story, it is not a sad story, it's just a real story,"" she says.

Why Colombia is doing this

Many in Colombia's government see the transition away from fossil fuels not just as good for the climate, but as a prudent economic strategy.

Colombia is not a petrostate with extreme reliance on fossil fuels like its neighbor, Venezuela, is. It has manufacturing and tech industries, agriculture, and a growing tourism sector.

But the oil and coal industries are still critical sources of taxes and export revenues. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to fall over time with the global energy transition, and that poses serious risks for the country, according to a study from insurance broker WTW and the Universidad de los Andes. The study found that if Colombia is too slow in transitioning away from fossil fuels it could face lost economic output equivalent to around 27% of its GDP between now and 2050.

Also, Colombia's oil sector isn't very competitive compared to some regional neighbors, says Guy Edwards, who researches Colombia's energy transition at the University of Sussex. He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil. A recent oil industry bright spot was the major gas discovery in the Caribbean, but it's deep and expensive to develop.

"" If we don't think about how to diversify the economy,"" González Espinosa says, ""then we are going to be in trouble.""

Today Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, is diversifying, says Julián Lemos, corporate vice president of strategy and new business at Ecopetrol.

The year before Petro took office, the company acquired an electricity transmission company. In recent years, they've acquired more solar and wind projects. And they're investing in geothermal energy, drilling deep into the earth to create electricity.

""The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company,"" Lemos says, ""but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power, transmission.""

""We need to, as a company, be prepared to lead the country in the transformation of our fuel system. And in the transformation of our energy supply matrix.""

Renewable progress and failures

A key part of Colombia's transition away from fossil fuels is growing the renewable energy sector. Much of that growth has come from solar, says Andrés Camacho, the former minister of mines and energy under Petro.

Solar made up around 9% of the country's total installed power capacity in 2024, according to data from XM, Colombia's electricity market operator. That's up from roughly 1.5% in 2022.

Petro's government has introduced something called ""energy communities,"" funding solar and battery projects for Colombian communities that lack regular electricity. The government is trying to attract international financing for some of these community-scale renewable projects. And the government recently streamlined the environmental licensing process for solar making it more efficient, says Manuel Schulte, chief executive of Colombian renewable developer Colibri Energy.

But Colombia's renewable energy sector has faced challenges. In some parts of Colombia the grid still isn't big enough to handle many of the new renewable projects. And many of Colombia's big wind, solar and transmission projects are on land belonging to indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve indigenous groups in planning, Nieves Zárate, the renewable energy researcher, says.

Struggles with local communities are among the reasons why some foreign investors have given up on renewable projects, particularly wind projects. The national oil company, Ecopetrol, has acquired some of these abandoned wind projects.

Losing the messaging fight

Petro's energy transition policies haven't been popular with many Colombians. According to Susana Muhamad, former environment minister in Petro's cabinet, the government often encountered the ""myth,"" she says, that the country's energy transition ""will be an economic hindrance.""

"" The opposite,"" Muhamad says. ""What we see is that making [an energy transition] that is planned will be economically beneficial.""

Edwards says a lot of opposition to Petro's energy transition agenda was stirred up in the Colombian press. His research finds several Colombian newspapers and magazines have mostly framed the pledge not to award new oil and gas contracts as ""disastrous for the Colombian economy.""

Still, González Espinosa thinks Petro's government fumbled the ball on messaging. She says the government didn't focus enough on the local benefits of the energy transition, like how it will help the Colombian economy, and the health advantages of moving away from fossil fuels.

"" They didn't resonate with the national audience,"" González Espinosa says in an email. ""It was all about climate and that argument is not always very easy to sell without connecting it to local realities.""

Looking to the future

Petro's term ends in 2026. Looming over next year's election is a question: Will Petro's policies around stopping fossil fuel expansion outlast his administration?

Colombia's president is a vocal opponent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a type of oil and gas extraction. Many of the presidential candidates have indicated they'll authorize fracking. While Petro's government has put forward legislation in congress to ban fracking, they haven't been able to get it to a vote.

As for Petro's pledge to stop awarding new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal, Estefanny Pardo, mining attorney at Holland & Knight, says a right wing government could reverse it.

""The current government has made a mistake, which is that instead of processing everything as a law to be approved by the congress of the republic, they have issued their own decrees and resolutions that could be repealed or changed by the next government,"" Pardo says in Spanish.

An upcoming conference

Andrés Gómez is Latin America coordinator of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation treaty, an initiative to make a global treaty to phase out fossil fuels. Colombia was one of the first oil-producing countries to join the movement in 2023.

Modeled after treaties to stop nuclear proliferation and landmines, the goal is to create a binding international agreement to stop expanding fossil fuel production.

Next spring, before the country's presidential election, Colombia will host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels.

If the upcoming conference marks the formal beginning of the treaty-making process, Gómez says in Spanish the incoming Colombian government may still be interested in seeing it through.

""Steps are being taken that have never been taken before.""

The land trusts will purchase new conservation easements that will protect air and water quality, preserve wildlife habitat and biodiversity, support sustainable forest management, and increase outdoor recreation opportunities for the public.

“Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, DEC continues to protect forests and bolster climate resiliency, quality of life for all communities, and the economy,” said Commissioner Lefton. “With approximately 73 percent of New York State’s forests being privately owned, this $1.72 million in FCELT Grant Program funding will help landowners keep their forests as forests and maintain working forest landscapes. Through partnerships with land trusts and dedicated landowners, we’re adding protections that keep trees standing, wildlife thriving, watersheds intact, and communities resilient.”

The grants, administered by the Land Trust Alliance in partnership with DEC, were made available through the Forest Conservation Easements for Land Trusts (FCELT) Grant Program and contribute to the State’s goal of conserving 30 percent of New York’s lands and waters by 2030. These grants are intended to provide community benefits, advance ecosystem benefits and climate resilience, and work towards goals identified in the New York State Open Space Plan, the New York State Wildlife Action Plan, the New York State Forest Action Plan, and/or other local, regional or statewide land protection plans. Environmental justice and climate resilience are key components for project selection.

New York Senior Program Manager for the Land Trust Alliance Jamie Brown said, ""Protecting forests offers so many benefits to all New Yorkers. The FCELT Grant Program is a vital tool that assists land trusts to do this important work. We are grateful to the State’s support and leadership in protecting our natural resources and important places.”

Funded Projects:

Genesee Valley Conservancy, Livingston County: $227,220 to purchase a conservation easement on the 135-acre Pokey Moonshine Hallow property, located in the town of Springwater. This land is 99 percent forested and situated within the watershed of Hemlock Lake, a drinking water source for the City of Rochester. The landowners will continue to sustainably manage the forest.

Genesee Valley Conservancy, Steuben County: $350,000 to purchase a conservation easement on the 841-acre Beckhorn property, located in the towns of Rexville and West Union. This is one of the largest forested parcels remaining in Steuben County and will connect to other protected land. The property’s forest blends species found in both temperate and boreal climates, making for a diverse mix of trees and plants, enhancing biodiversity and providing habitat for numerous species of birds and mammals.

Hudson Taconic Lands, Rensselaer County: $265,000 to purchase a conservation easement on the 288-acre Wheeler Mountain Escarpment in the towns of Brunswick and Grafton. The land is 100 percent forested and is adjacent to the 1,100-acre Camp Rotary Conservation Easement recently acquired by Hudson Taconic Lands. The easement will protect Wheeler Mountain and the Quaken Kill, home to critical habitat and part of a larger initiative to create a four-mile contiguous corridor of protected forest along the western escarpment of the Rensselaer Plateau.

Otsego Land Trust, Otsego County: $54,250 to purchase a conservation easement on the 41-acre Burr Forest property in the town of Westford. The land is adjacent to the popular Betty and Wilbur Davis State Park. The easement property is 90 percent forested, and includes wetlands and hemlock stands, along with large concentrations of native plants. The landowners will manage the forest for wildlife and the health of the forest.

Roundout-Esopus Land Conservancy, Ulster County: $160,850 to purchase a conservation easement that will protect 19 acres of diverse forestland adjacent to Minnewaska State Park in the town of Wawarsing. The easement will protect Mine Hole Brook, which contains brook trout and is a tributary to Roundout Creek. The easement will also ensure that the area surrounding the Mine Hole Trail, a popular and heavily used recreation area, remains in a natural state. The current owner is interested in proactively managing the woodlands for habitat, with a focus on improving the health and ecological diversity of the forest.

Scenic Hudson, Columbia County: $250,000 to purchase a conservation easement on the 272-acre West Family Land property in the towns of New Lebanon and Canaan. The land was once part of a larger 19th century Shaker community and is adjacent to conserved land, including Bates Memorial State Park in Massachusetts. The forest is a mix of hardwood and softwood and includes habitat for several bird and mammal species.

Scenic Hudson, Dutchess County: $125,000 to purchase a conservation easement on the 137-acre Royal Strawberry Hill Farm and Preserve in the town of Poughkeepsie. The property, once part of a network of farms, has mostly reverted to forest in an area under extreme development pressure. The City of Poughkeepsie identified the property in its Open Space Plan and designated the land as an urban greenway. The land hosts a limestone woodland forest community, wetlands and streams, habitat for birds, mammals, and amphibians, and connects some of the last remaining forests in the area.

Tug Hill Tomorrow Land Trust (THTLT), Herkimer County (two projects): $131,122 to conserve the 135-acre Kimak Forest property and $161,175 to conserve the 182-acre Grafer Forest property, both located in the town of Russia. Both properties are part of a large, forested area that includes other conservation easements held by the land trust. These new easements will build on THTLT’s conservation efforts surrounding Hinckley State Forest. Both properties are characterized by forested land that contains a mix of softwood and hardwood species, which play a crucial role in providing habitat for a diverse array of wildlife. Several streams cross the property and flow into West Canada Creek.

The grants are funded through the State's Environmental Protection Fund (EPF). Among the many environmental victories in the enacted 2025-26 State Budget, Governor Kathy Hochul and legislative leaders increased the historically high level of $425 million in EPF funding. The EPF supports climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, improves agricultural resources to promote sustainable agriculture, protects water sources, advances conservation efforts like the projects announced today, and provides recreational opportunities for New Yorkers.

Entr will conduct FEED for a temporary storage and liquefaction processing terminal at Port Tampa Bay in Tampa, Florida, and a discharge and regasification terminal at LBC Tank Terminals in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, supporting Aptamus’s CO2 maritime transport and storage programme, Carbon Ocean and Storage Transport 20 (COAST20).

COAST20 was selected for an award to be partially funded by the US Department of Energy. The programme includes design of a 20,000-tonne liquefied CO2 tank vessel which will be the first built in the United States, the Port Tampa Bay intermodal hub site collecting captured CO2 from emitters across Florida, and the LBC receiving port on the Mississippi River near Baton Rouge, adjacent to an existing dedicated CO2 pipeline system for delivery to permanent underground storage sites. Port Tampa Bay and LBC are partners in the COAST20 project.

Knut Egil Pedersen, vice president of hydrogen and CO2 at Aker Solutions, expressed excitement about bringing pioneering expertise in designing and building CO2 terminals and first-of-their-kind carbon removal projects to Florida. He stated that having advised on optimised solutions in early development phases, Entr will now execute these in a cost-effective, industrialised project environment, combining North American team expertise with global experience to support safe processing, storage, and transport of CO2 from Tampa Bay to Louisiana.

Jeffrey Ross Williams, president of Aptamus, stated that Aptamus has strategically expanded capabilities to offer Florida’s largest CO2 emitters a supply chain solution for safe and efficient removal of captured CO2 from the state. He characterised Entr’s development of the Port Tampa Bay hub and LBC Tank Terminals site as offering the ideal solution for managing captured CO2 in Florida. Williams noted that COAST20 will allow power generation companies to meet increasing electricity demand in Florida whilst managing carbon output to meaningfully impact the environment and human health.

The COAST20 programme addresses emerging requirements for CO2 transport and storage infrastructure supporting carbon capture deployment. Florida’s CO2 emitters lack proximate geological storage formations suitable for permanent sequestration, necessitating transport solutions connecting emission sources with suitable Gulf Coast storage sites.

The maritime transport approach utilises purpose-built liquefied CO2 carriers connecting Florida collection points with Louisiana delivery terminals adjacent to existing CO2 pipeline infrastructure. Port Tampa Bay serves as collection hub enabling aggregation of CO2 from multiple Florida sources, with temporary storage and liquefaction processing preparing CO2 for ship loading.

LBC Tank Terminals’ Baton Rouge location provides strategic positioning on the Mississippi River with existing liquid bulk storage infrastructure and proximity to established CO2 pipeline systems. The discharge and regasification terminal will receive liquefied CO2 from vessels, return it to a gaseous phase, and inject it into pipelines for delivery to permanent storage sites.

US Department of Energy funding support reflects federal policy priorities for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage infrastructure development. Aker Solutions’ experience in CO2 handling infrastructure from North Sea projects provides relevant technical expertise for COAST20.

FEED work establishes detailed technical specifications, equipment selections, process designs, safety systems, and cost estimates supporting final investment decisions. The project exemplifies emerging carbon management infrastructure connecting emission sources lacking proximate storage with suitable geological formations via multimodal transport, potentially establishing models for similar regional approaches addressing commercial-scale CCS deployment requirements.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-12 21:01:22.018519

That could spell the end for North Carolina’s booming businesses that sell the intoxicating products.

Over the past five years, stores selling hemp-derived products have flourished, selling products like smokable THC-A flower, gummies, candy and drinks infused with THC. Some businesses have billboards along interstates.

The products contain Delta-8 and THC-A, which are close derivatives of Delta-9 THC, the chemical in marijuana that gets you high.

Matt Mitchell, owner of Hemp and Barrel in Pineville, has a wide array of products on display.

“This will be all our flowers,” he said, pointing to plants kept behind a glass case. On the wall, the store has a board showing the percentage of THC-A contained in each product. When eaten, THC-A has no effect. But when burned, it converts to regular Delta 9 THC, and has the same effects you would get from smoking pot. The cigarettes produce a high just like a joint — and it's legal.

Mitchell continues the tour.

“Here’s your CBD, your concentrates,” he said. “Pet stuff over here. Tea. Topicals. Edibles. Chocolate. Gummies.”

Mitchell has been in business for six years, but the upcoming year could be his last.

The Senate continuing resolution that funds the government would also revamp the 2018 Farm Bill. One provision in that earlier law allowed for a proliferation of hemp-derived products that are being sold in places where marijuana is still illegal, like North Carolina, Texas, Georgia and Wisconsin.

The new restrictions would take effect in a year, severely limiting the amount of THC-like chemicals in products and effectively outlawing the dried plants, edibles and other items in his shop.

“It would shut everything down,” he said. “There’s just no way to get [my products] to that level. It just wouldn’t be beneficial.”

Phil Dixon with the UNC School of Government is an expert on North Carolina’s hemp industry, which he has called the “Wild West.” The General Assembly has debated bills to regulate the market, but hasn’t approved any.

Now, Congress could be doing their work for them, Dixon said.

“It would be a big change on the federal definition of hemp and it would vastly constrict the industry if not effectively shutting it down altogether,” he said.

That wouldn’t just affect the THC-selling stores such as CannaBuddy, Blue Flowers and Apotheca that have become ubiquitous. It also would mean pulling products from stores big and small, from gas stations to major retailers like Total Wine that sell THC-infused drinks.

The Trump administration has said it approves of the new regulations.

On Monday, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, pleaded unsuccessfully with his colleagues to remove the provision. Kentucky is a large hemp-producing state.

To meet this challenge, Asamani noted that African universities and technical institutes are steadily adapting to the needs of the energy transition. In Nigeria, petroleum and gas engineers are being retrained for solar energy and energy efficiency roles. Similar initiatives are expanding across the continent. In Kenya, geothermal energy is creating new opportunities for former thermal technicians. Programs in Rwanda, Morocco, and Ghana are reorienting fossil fuel engineers toward hydropower, wind, and hybrid projects. These efforts aim to build a talent pool capable of driving the deployment of renewable energy while retraining workers from legacy industries.

Urgency to Act

Asamani emphasized that Africa must move quickly to address its energy transition challenges. The continent still has 600 million people without access to electricity, while coal remains a cheap and reliable source of power, highlighting a stark paradox. South Africa illustrates this clearly. Research from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) shows that nearly 100,000 coal miners and power plant workers risk losing their jobs as mines close. The SARB noted that their mostly semi-skilled profiles rarely align with the demands of renewable energy projects.

According to PMI’s Talent Gap Report 2025-2035, between 1.6 million and 2.1 million additional project management professionals will be needed by 2035 to support transition infrastructure and technologies, representing a 75 percent increase over current levels. The report also estimates that 10 percent of global project investments are lost annually due to poor performance, an inefficiency especially costly for Africa’s infrastructure portfolio.

Asamani’s warning comes amid high youth unemployment across Africa. The International Labour Organization (ILO) reported that nearly 62 million young people in Sub-Saharan Africa were not in employment, education, or training in 2023, representing more than a quarter of the region’s youth population. Among those who are employed, nearly three-quarters hold precarious jobs, often informal or low-skilled.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/0915b09c6ab1f1fe19371d9e00de18da_S.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 19:58:41.510647

First promulgated in 2023, the PFAS Reporting Rule in its current form is wide-sweeping, applying to all companies that domestically manufactured PFAS or imported PFAS-containing items during 2011-2022. The current rule includes essentially no exemptions, and now EPA is proposing to change that.

EPA’s proposal would incorporate exemptions for imported articles; de minimis concentrations of PFAS at 0.1% or lower; byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates; and for research and development (R&D). EPA is also proposing certain clarifications, technical corrections, and to key the submission period to the effective date of the finalized revisions. The most prominent of these proposed revisions is the imported articles exemption, which would remove from the rule’s scope the large majority of companies subject to the regulation in its current form. Affected stakeholders should consider submitting public comments on the proposed revisions, and these comments will be due 45 days after the proposed revisions are published in the Federal Register.

Background

EPA first finalized the PFAS Reporting Rule (40 C.F.R. Part 705) in October 2023 pursuant to Section 8(a)(7) of TSCA, which was added to TSCA by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. Section 8(a)(7) requires EPA to promulgate a reporting rule applicable to “each person who has manufactured a chemical substance that is a [PFAS] in any year since January 1, 2011.” EPA applied Section 8(a)(7) through the October 2023 rule to impose a one-time reporting requirement on all companies that manufactured PFAS between 2011 and 2022 or that imported PFAS in any amount during that period (even in articles). EPA has since delayed the submission period for this rule twice, and that submission period is currently set to open on April 13, 2026, and close (for most manufacturers) on October 13, 2026.

As explained in our previous alert, EPA’s proposed revisions to this rule are not completely unexpected. EPA under the Trump administration has previously indicated that revisions were on the horizon, including through an April 28, 2025 press release where EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin committed the agency to implementing TSCA section 8(a)(7) “to smartly collect necessary information, as Congress envisioned and consistent with TSCA, without overburdening small businesses and article importers.”

The Proposed Exemptions

EPA is proposing to add exemptions to the rule for the following:

Imported articles. “Article” is defined in the rule at 40 C.F.R. § 705.3 and can generally be described as a finished good or component thereof with a definitive shape or design. EPA justified this exemption in the preamble by explaining that article importers are unlikely to have known or reasonably ascertainable information about the PFAS in the articles they imported during the lookback period. EPA also reasoned that Congress did not intend Section 8(a)(7) to apply to article importers and that the agency will nevertheless receive information on PFAS in articles by upstream PFAS manufacturers who will still be required to report under the rule.

De minimis PFAS concentrations. EPA explained in the preamble that the agency is “proposing a de minimis concentration exemption for reportable PFAS in mixtures or articles under which PFAS concentrations below 0.1% would be exempt from reporting.” EPA reasoned in the preamble that this exemption is justified in part because, during the lookback period, “reporters are unlikely to have records of PFAS amounts below 0.1% due to U.S. and international requirements at the time.” EPA also noted that the agency is interested in comments on whether a 1.0% de minimis exemption or another de minimis level would be more appropriate.

Byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates. EPA explained in the preamble that these exemptions would “align with existing exemptions under TSCA for substances not manufactured and used for a separate commercial purpose and is consistent with the approach taken in EPA’s [Chemical Data Reporting] rule.”

R&D chemicals. This exemption would apply to PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes. EPA explained in the preamble that this exemption is justified since “information on PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes would be limited and would provide minimal information regarding PFAS exposures and quantities in commerce.”

EPA also offered other justifications for the revisions in the preamble, including how TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A)-(C) directs EPA, to the extent feasible, to not require unnecessary or duplicative reporting, minimize compliance costs on small manufacturers, and apply reporting obligations only to companies likely to have information relevant to the effective implementation of TSCA. EPA likewise pointed to TSCA Section 2(c), which directs EPA to carry out TSCA “in a reasonable and prudent manner” and to “consider the environmental, economic, and social impact of any action.”

Proposed Revision to the Submission Period, Clarifications and Technical Corrections

EPA is proposing that the submission period begin 60 days after the effective date of the finalized revisions and then last for three months. As EPA explained in the preamble, this revision to the submission period will “allow[] reporters to familiarize themselves with the amended rule and ensure their data are responsive to the amended rule and EPA to modify the reporting application as needed.”

EPA is also proposing a few clarifications and technical corrections to the rule, including for the scope of environmental health effects information that must be reported and the consumer and commercial product categories to be used for reporting purposes.

EPA Requests for Comment

In addition to public comments on the revisions mentioned above, EPA is soliciting comments on the following questions:

Should EPA amend the scope of reportable chemicals? For instance, EPA indicated in the preamble that the agency is receptive to feedback on the possibility of limiting reporting to PFAS with Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CASRNs) and adding a production-volume threshold to the rule.

Should EPA modify any assumptions or cost savings calculations in its Economic Analysis? For instance, in the preamble, EPA estimated that a certain percentage of industry costs has already been accrued in preparation for reporting under the October 2023 rule. EPA is seeking comments on these types of assumptions, including sunk cost estimates.

Upon publication of the proposed revisions in the Federal Register, EPA will accept comments on the proposed changes for 45 days. Given that the impact of the proposed revisions will span across industries – especially for article importers – all affected stakeholders are encouraged to comment.",https://www.bdlaw.com/content/uploads/2024/10/Diamond-Only-Web-Size-default-social-share-social-sharing-image-23338.png,N,,2025-11-12 21:01:04.905961

The overlap of clean energy and innovation is becoming more evident every day.","There’s a YouTube video I’m embarrassed to admit I’ve watched one too many times. It’s a compilation of cuts from President Trump’s first term of him saying the word “China.”

As it reveals, he says the word a lot. Normally in a mocking tone, sometimes threatening, and often derisive. In fact, Trump’s main nemesis throughout his two presidencies has been the world’s second most populous country.

He’s blasted China for what he’s characterized as bad trade deals and blamed the country for ruining the United States’ steel, manufacturing, and auto industries. More recently, Trump blamed China for profiting disproportionally from global free trade and instituted significant tariffs that escalated into a game of trade-war chicken.

But for all of his strong-arming with the country, Trump isn’t trying to compete with China on a key area where they’ve come out far ahead globally–clean energy.

China currently produces over 80% of the world’s solar panels. It surpassed Tesla as the leading producer of electric vehicles in 2023 and is now responsible for producing more than 70% of the global EV market. After vowing in 2021 to end (with some veracity) new overseas coal projects, China invested heavily in clean-energy projects in more than 50 countries. The country now has the most new nuclear power plants under construction, and dominates the market for rare earth metals—an important component of battery storage.

China, like the U.S., signed the international Paris Climate Agreement 10 years ago in a commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

The U.S., by comparison, removed itself from the agreement twice: both times under Trump. While former President Joe Biden championed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, intending to boost U.S. manufacturing in clean energy and an investment in clean-tech jobs, Trump pushed Congress this year to shrink those initiatives.

At the U.N. General Assembly this past September, Trump called climate change a “con job,” and pressured diplomats at the White House last month to table plans to create a global shipping climate tax. The U.S. is now re-embracing fossil fuels, announcing executive orders focused on expanding natural gas drilling and opening up more offshore oil exploration. This is happening at the same time offshore wind projects are halted, solar grants ended, and electric vehicle subsidies pulled.

With COP30 as the backdrop, China—once considered a climate boogeyman as the source of the largest share of annual greenhouse gas emissions—is now demonstrating an incredible investment in clean energy technologies while situating itself as a global leader on the green transition … just as the U.S. is turning away.

China is far from a perfect leader when it comes to climate commitments. For one, its motives aren’t humanitarian, nor apologetic: They’re economical.

In a Yale Environment 360 analysis, Isabel Hilton writes:

“There are many ways to judge climate leadership: They include the quality and consistency of policy, the speed and effectiveness of carbon reduction, and the role a country plays in the global effort, including in support to less developed countries.

When China became the biggest carbon emitter by volume in 2005, its leadership did not contest the science. Importantly, they understood climate change as a severe threat but also as an enormous industrial opportunity. If the world needed to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy, China resolved to be the supplier of the enabling goods and technologies.”

China is now leading where more traditional climate champions—namely, the most industrialized nations—are faltering.

Instead of sending delegates to COP30, the White House sent Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to a different conference.

The two flew last week to Athens, Greece, to promote fossil fuels. “There is no energy transition—there is just energy addition,” Burgum told reporters there.

The European Union also scaled back its leadership capacity on climate initiatives, as several member countries faced tough elections with populist parties championing fossil fuels. The EU further disappointed environmentalists after softening an anti-deforestation law and moving to push its start date. The EU also failed to finalize its own climate-mitigation targets by COP’s September 30 deadline.

It’s part of a trend that André Corrêa do Lago, the president of this year’s COP and a Brazilian diplomat, framed as the wealthiest global countries losing interest in climate change.

Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping told delegates at the U.N. General Assembly in September that the “green and low-carbon transition is the trend of our time.” The focus is already giving China wins: A new study found that China’s CO2 emissions have been flat or falling for 18 months, thanks in part to its “rapid adoption of electric vehicles.”

China’s investment in renewable energy also helps other countries approach their own climate targets.

As Somini Sengupta and Brad Plumer write for The New York Times:

“Having saturated its own market with solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, Chinese companies are now exporting their wares to energy-hungry countries in the developing world. What’s more, they’re investing billions of dollars in factories that make things like solar panels in Vietnam and electric cars in Brazil.”

“China is coming up with solutions that are for everyone, not just China,” Corrêa do Lago told The Guardian. “Solar panels are cheaper, they’re so competitive [compared with fossil fuel energy] that they are everywhere now.”

Newsom was blunt when he said how China’s dominance looked for the U.S.:

“The United States of America is as dumb as we want to be on this topic,” he told Reuters in Belem, adding that Republicans were letting China take ownership of the growing market and that the country “will dominate in the next great global industry.”

During Trump’s recent Asia trip, he signed a flurry of deals with countries that indicate the U.S. is jockeying for a stronger hold on rare earth minerals to stay competitive in electricity and tech innovation—to say nothing of the materials required for expanding renewable energy capabilities, such as solar or wind.

While climate change might be a backburner issue for some developed nations, electricity capacity is not. With the rise of AI and data centers and the subsequent battle of tech giants to come out on top, there’s a projected global energy rush.

The overlap of clean energy and innovation is becoming more evident every day. The economic and business opportunities around embracing renewable energy are what former Secretary of State John Kerry says could be what brings the U.S. back to the table on climate.

Kerry told NPR:

What I’m banking on is showing people that the transition to a clean energy economy is, in fact, the greatest economic opportunity the world has ever known. There are 8 billion people who want electricity, need electricity in the world today—1 billion of them actually don’t have it yet—and it’s going to go up to 10 billion in the next 20 or 30 years. So that’s a huge marketplace … And by the way, the best of capitalism—you can make a lot of money as that transition is implemented.

Time will tell whether that potential money speaks to the White House.

While there’s been progress at past COP conferences, it hasn’t been enough to slow down the impacts of greenhouse gases. Going into this year’s meeting, some modeling shows that the world is already likely to blow past the Paris Agreement’s target, projecting the globe to warm between 2.3-3.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages by the end of the century.

During opening remarks on Monday, Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the world needed a roadmap to “overcome” fossil fuel dependence.

Here’s what could be on the table:

● A forest fund: Brazil wants a major focus on this year’s meeting to be a plan that protects the Amazon rainforest. The country aims to create a multibillion-dollar fund that would pay countries to keep their forests intact at around $1.60 per acre.

● Climate finance: Leaders last year set a target, called a New Collective Quantified Goal, to deliver at least $300 billion annually for developing countries to partake in climate action by 2035. This year’s COP kicked off with a roadmap target that increases funds to $1.3 trillion, in part by increasing taxes on polluting activities.

● Adaptation: Another area of focus will be a sobering one: preparing the world for the impacts of climate change through adaptation. The U.N.’s environmental arm released an Adaptation Gap Report this year that found the private sector could provide around $50 billion annually in adaptation finance, if backed by policy. Delegates are working toward codifying “indicators” of adaptation from a list of 10,000 different options and eventually creating a global adaptation scorecard.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1237358959_hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 17:00:11.229800

Sign up for our free newsletters.

HARRISBURG — Environmental advocates and a handful of Democratic lawmakers are lambasting legislative leaders for agreeing to pull Pennsylvania out of an interstate cap-and-trade program as a part of the state’s long-awaited $50.1 billion budget.

The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) would have capped the amount of carbon that companies in Pennsylvania are allowed to emit. Lawmakers and advocates who spoke with Spotlight PA said pulling out was a major capitulation to state Senate Republicans that leaves the commonwealth without a clear path forward to combat climate change.

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf directed the state to join the initiative in 2019 through an executive order. However, litigation from Republican lawmakers and energy producers prevented the state from participating in the program. A case is currently pending before the state Supreme Court.

Molly Parzen, executive director of environmental advocacy group Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, called leaving RGGI a “devastating, self-inflicted setback in addressing affordability, clean energy, and pollution.”

“Their capitulation means that Pennsylvanians will now be robbed of more than $1 billion annually to lower electricity prices through investments in clean energy,” Parzen said in a statement, referencing the potential revenue that would have been funneled to the state.

Republicans have long criticized the program, saying that it would stymie the state’s powerful energy industry and raise consumer bills at a time of increasing costs.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has been vocally skeptical of the program since he announced his run for governor in 2021. He introduced his own state-based alternative to RGGI as legislation that would require GOP support.

However, state Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) previously told Spotlight PA that he would not move on any energy policy as long as the state was still in RGGI.

Language pulling Pennsylvania out of RGGI was included in the budget-enabling fiscal code bill. It passed the state House 189-14 and the state Senate 43-6.

State Rep. Greg Vitali (D., Delaware), a longtime environmental advocate and chair of the Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee, voted no.

“Democrats and the governor have ceded to this, along with other environmental asks, as a way of coming to a budget agreement and getting other things they deem important,” Vitali told Spotlight PA.

Vitali called RGGI the “only serious thing” that the legislature could have done to address climate change, calling Shapiro’s policy plan “dead on arrival” in the state Senate.

“This is our one opportunity, even though this was an uncertain opportunity. And unfortunately, we are caving in,” Vitali said.

The budget does include an additional $25 million for a popular grant program that provides schools with money to install solar panels and authorizes the spending of federal funding for solar panel construction.

Still, Vitali called those provisions “minuscule” compared to RGGI’s impact.

State Sen. Carolyn Comitta (D., Chester), the minority chair of the chamber’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, voted for the bill, despite her concerns regarding “taking RGGI off the table.”

Instead, she called on the legislature to pass Shapiro’s energy plan, which would create a state-level cap-and-trade program and increase renewable energy usage requirements for utilities.

“I fought for RGGI for years. I support RGGI. I still think RGGI would be a good idea for Pennsylvania,” Comitta said on the floor of the state Senate on Wednesday. “But I’m also realistic, and I’m willing to vote yes to end this impasse.”

The plan features 24 measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across a range of sectors, including transportation, industry, residential and commercial buildings, energy, waste & materials, and trees & greenspaces.

These measures include:

Encouraging fleet transitions to electric vehicles

Providing more options for people to walk, bike, or take public transportation

Making buildings more energy efficient

Increasing use of renewable energy sources

Protecting and restoring natural lands.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in August urged engine and equipment manufacturers to revise system software to prevent sudden loss of power from engine derates related to aftertreatment problems. The Cold Weather Diesel Reliability Act of 2025, co-sponsored by Republican Senators Dan Sullivan (Alaska) and Cynthia Lummis (Wyoming), however, hones in Arctic temps at which diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is known to freeze.

The Senators contend that automatic engine shutdowns and power reductions due to emissions control malfunctions in extreme cold pose ""serious, life-threatening risk,"" and that DEF systems are ""frequently unreliable and logistically impractical"" in prolonged freezing conditions.

The bill does not waive compliance with any emissions standards under the Clean Air Act yet contends that ""emissions safeguards under the Clean Air Act were never intended to jeopardize human safety or impede critical mobility,"" the bill reads.

The bill, which would apply to on- and off-highway diesel vehicles and equipment, outlines two primary mandates for the EPA, each to be enacted within 180 days of the bill's passage.

Temporary cold weather mitigation

The EPA would be required to revise regulations to allow manufacturers to suspend engine derate or shutdown functions. This temporary mode would be allowed when an emissions control fault is triggered at or below freezing (0°C/32°F).

This function would only be authorized if ""continued maximum engine performance... is necessary to prevent occupational danger, equipment failure, or loss of essential transportation functionality in remote areas.""

The engine must return to normal emission control operation once temperatures rise above freezing.

Regional exemption

The bill also grants a year-round exemption from DEF system requirements for specific vehicles – ""primarily operated north of 59 degrees north latitude"" or those that encounter operational conditions where prolonged low temperatures make using the DEF system ""impractical."" The area north of 59 degrees north latitude is primarily Alaska.

The bill exempts the vehicle from any derate or shutdown functions related to the ""absence, degradation, malfunction, or fault"" of the DEF system.",https://img.ccjdigital.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/11/adobestock-248257640.nGKnW3MkVA.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-12 19:58:52.858163

BEAVER DAM, WI. NOV. 12, 2024 – Gov. Tony Evers, company leaders, and state and local partners announced today that Meta is investing more than $1 billion in an artificial-intelligence-optimized data center campus located in Beaver Dam.

“Wisconsin is a leader when it comes to biohealth and advanced manufacturing industries, and we’re excited to keep building upon this tradition as we become the home to new world-changing technology,” said Gov. Evers. “This investment will help ensure Wisconsin is meeting the demands of the 21st Century and creating good, family-supporting jobs to support the workforce in the Beaver Dam community and across the greater region. Wisconsin must stay one step ahead in harnessing AI technologies to remain a national and international leader in this work, and this announcement will help us continue to do just that.”

“We’re thrilled to announce Meta’s first Wisconsin data center in Beaver Dam. This is the perfect home for Meta for several reasons, including great local talent, strong community partnerships, and reliable infrastructure,” said Brad Davis, director of data center community and economic development at Meta. “We are excited to become part of the Beaver Dam community, and we look forward to a strong partnership with the city and the state for years to come.”

Meta anticipates the project will result in more than 1,000 skilled trade jobs on site at peak construction. The data center is expected to come online in 2027, after which it will support more than 100 operational jobs.

“I’m excited for the positive things this project brings to Beaver Dam, including the increased tax base and additional jobs,” said Mayor Bobbi Marck. “I am pleased to partner with a company that has a strong commitment to environmental stewardship and charitable giving, and I also look forward to building a strong partnership with Meta so that together we can continue to enhance our community.”

The data center campus will span over 700,000 square feet, with its operational buildings set to achieve LEED Gold certification. Meta officials said the project will be designed and built with efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability in mind, and the site’s electricity use will be matched with 100% clean and renewable energy. As part of its commitment to cover infrastructure costs to support the data center, Meta will underwrite nearly $200 million in energy infrastructure investments including network upgrades, utility substations, and transmission lines.

Alliant Energy, the energy utility serving Beaver Dam, continues to develop renewable energy generation sources across Wisconsin and energy storage that will serve increased energy demands and ensure reliability. Over the next ten years, Meta will also donate $15 million to Alliant Energy’s Hometown Care Energy Fund, aimed at providing direct energy cost assistance for families in need.

Meta has a goal to be water-positive in 2030, meaning the company will restore more water than it consumes. As part of this, Meta will restore 100% of the water consumed by the Beaver Dam data center to local watersheds. Additionally, the facility will use dry cooling, which means that there will be no water demands for cooling once it is operational.

In partnership with Ducks Unlimited and local conservation partners, the project will also restore 570 acres of biodiverse wetland and prairie surrounding the data centers. Of this, 175 acres of greenspace will be deeded to Ducks Unlimited and its partners for conservation work that will provide flood storage, filter nutrients before they enter the watershed, create new opportunities for wildlife viewing (particularly migratory birds and pollinators), and offer a place for visitors to recreate.

“Strong partnerships are at the core of successful conservation projects,” said Brian Glenzinski, manager of conservation programs for Ducks Unlimited. “We are excited to join Meta, the city of Beaver Dam, and the many other organizations that are prioritizing wetland habitat through this project.”

Located in Alliant Energy’s Beaver Dam Commerce Park, the location is Wisconsin’s largest certified site and has been shovel-ready for development since it was designated by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation in 2019.

“The Midwest is emerging as a hub for expanding large industrial businesses, from data centers to manufacturing and other cutting-edge industries,” said Becky Valcq, assistant vice president regulatory & data center services, at Alliant Energy. “Our Beaver Dam Commerce Park provides strong infrastructure and was specifically intended to facilitate economic development opportunities like this. We are proud to welcome Meta to the community. As the communities we serve grow, energy demand grows too. New and expanding businesses play a key role in helping to keep energy bills more affordable. We are moving at the speed of our customers – big and small – to help them thrive and improve the communities we call home.”

“Six years ago, leaders from Beaver Dam, WEDC, and Alliant Energy celebrated that the Commerce Park had been designated a WEDC certified site,” said Sam Rikkers, deputy secretary and chief operating officer of WEDC, the state’s lead economic development organization. “We knew that the combination of a great workforce, central location, and incredible infrastructure would attract a world-class investment. Meta’s decision to locate in Beaver Dam affirms the vision the partners had. Together, we are delivering a win for Meta, for Beaver Dam and for Dodge County, and for entire the state of Wisconsin.”",https://wedc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Default-web-news-blog-image.png,N,,2025-11-12 16:00:46.552940

It’s day 43 of the U.S. government shutdown, but an end is finally in sight. On Sunday night, the Senate voted to move forward with funding for the federal government through Jan. 30. That vote, in which eight Democrats joined the vast majority of Senate Republicans, is expected to be followed by approval from the Republican majority in the House of Representatives and President Donald Trump. With many Democratic officials condemning the capitulation of their Senate colleagues, a revival of the shutdown is a distinct possibility after funding expires again next year.

One of the many adverse effects of the current shutdown is that, for weeks now, the nation’s top environmental cop has been off duty. While it’s too early to know the exact consequences of the dysfunction, analogous situations in the recent past indicate that polluters often increase their emissions during periods of relaxed enforcement. With such periods becoming regular features of the U.S. political process, the cumulative environmental fallout could be significant.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement division is responsible for making sure the country’s cornerstone environmental laws — the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and hazardous waste laws among them — are followed. From Washington, D.C., and 10 regional offices across the country, these staffers police some of the nation’s biggest polluters. They conduct surprise inspections at refineries, power plants, and factories. They review data and reports to check compliance. And, when they find violations, they issue fines and work with the Justice Department to take offenders to court until they course correct.

But since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the EPA has gradually furloughed most of its civil enforcement staff. At first, only a handful of employees were sent home at the start of the month, and the agency kept most workers on using unspent funds from previous budget years. As that funding ran out, however, the agency furloughed most of its workforce. Since only essential staff that protect the public from imminent threats are retained during furloughs, the vast majority of enforcement staffers had been ordered to stay home by the end of the month.

“The inspection and enforcement arm of the agency has largely been shuttered,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, the union that represents agency employees. “The large majority of inspectors and enforcement officers, along with attorneys who work with them to conduct the settlements and other legal actions against regulated entities, are all furloughed right now.” Chen himself was furloughed on Oct. 20.

Previous pauses in enforcement indicate that a lack of federal oversight can embolden polluters. Researchers at Pennsylvania State University examined emissions data from 204 coal-fired power plants from across the country during the last major federal shutdown at the end of 2018. They found that the coal plants released 15% to 20% more particulate matter during the 35 days when the government was shut down and EPA enforcement officers were furloughed. When the shutdown ended and the inspectors returned to their jobs, emissions returned to pre-shutdown levels. The findings were robust even though the researchers controlled for changes in weather, use of more polluting coal varieties, and other factors. That suggests that the plants were less likely to operate their pollution controls when they knew they were unlikely to get caught.

“The only possibility is a temporary change of the end-of-pipe pollution abatement device,” said Ruohao Zhang, a professor at Penn State and lead author of the study, which was published last month. Zhang and his colleagues relied on data reported by the coal plant operators to the EPA as well as satellite data from NASA. They examined particulate matter levels in a 1.8-mile radius around the coal plants.

While Zhang was not able to comment on the legality of such moves on the operators’ part, he said that it indicated there was a higher possibility of a violation. The current shutdown creates similar incentives as the last time around, he said. “Now without the EPA’s watching, this increased possibility [of being cited for violating environmental laws] is no longer there,” he said.

Researchers found a similar trend in the spring and summer of 2020 during the COVID-19 shutdown. At the time, the EPA announced that facilities that weren’t able to monitor and report their emissions would be excused from compliance. Companies took the EPA up on the offer. Self-reported data from polluting facilities showed that companies conducted 40% fewer emission tests at smokestacks in March and April of 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. American University researchers also found that counties with six or more polluting facilities reporting to the EPA saw a 14% increase in particulate matter pollution after the EPA announced its enforcement policy in 2020.

Shutdowns ultimately send the message that nobody is watching, said Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit founded by former EPA enforcement staffers.

“It means that communities may be more exposed to pollution,” she said, “if companies do break the laws, and there’s no one from EPA working to be able to respond.”

The EPA’s regional offices each have about 18 staffers dedicated to handling each of the three main enforcement areas: air, water, and hazardous waste and toxics. Chen estimated that roughly 600 EPA employees were responsible for enforcement at the regional level. In part, these employees supervise the many environmental enforcement activities delegated to individual states. Additionally, the EPA has also assigned staff to enforce environmental laws in consultation with tribes, since many federally recognized tribes haven’t been granted authority to implement environmental laws.

The near-complete halt of inspections and case processing activities is likely to have significant implications for the EPA’s enforcement work. For one, any administrative settlements the agency might want to enter into with a polluter are contingent on utilizing evidence not more than a year old, unless the agency secures a waiver from the Justice Department. As a result, staff tend to front-load the work at the beginning of the fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1, Chen said. But given that they’ve been furloughed for the past several weeks, it “makes it very difficult timing-wise to do some sort of administrative settlements to get a quick resolution on certain things,” Chen said.

The furloughs are the latest setback to hit EPA staff. The Trump administration has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs and offered buyouts to workers this year. While it’s unclear exactly how many EPA enforcement staffers were let go or resigned, the EPA is in the process of reducing its headcount by nearly 25%. The Department of Justice, or DOJ, has also lost at least 4,500 workers to layoffs and buyouts. As a result, the Justice Department’s environmental enforcement arm has shrunk by about half.

Once the EPA identifies environmental violations, the Justice Department pursues cases against polluters and enters into legal settlements with them. According to an analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project first reported by the Washington Post, the DOJ has brought just nine major civil cases against polluters in the first eight months of the Trump administration. That’s a major decrease compared to Trump’s first term, when the DOJ brought 53 cases during the same time period.

An EPA spokesperson told the Post that the number of civil cases did not reflect relaxed enforcement on the Trump administration’s part, citing other metrics in which she claimed Trump had outperformed the Biden administration, but Duggan, the Environmental Integrity Project’s executive director, disagreed.

“That’s a significant slowdown of the enforcement process,” she said. “If you are cutting the staff that are doing that job, you know that’s going to have an impact.”

The steady stream of good EV charging news keeps on coming — this time in the state of Michigan. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) has awarded $1.84 million dollars in funding for the installation of 201 new EV chargers at 31 multifamily properties in Michigan.

The new chargers will be installed in such locations as: Taylor, Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Dearborn Heights, and Southfield. Other sites include Kalamazoo, Flint, and Lansing. They will be Level 2 chargers, which is just fine because residents at multifamily complexes who drive electric vehicles and plug them in at night can get a full charge while in their homes doing other things. In other words, it is not necessary to fast charge to 80% in 35 minutes for EV owners when they are at home. Some residents also may work remotely so they can charge at home while working and have their batteries ready to go when they need to drive somewhere.

Many EV owners have single family homes and home chargers, which makes home charging convenient and easy. However, most apartment and condo complexes do not yet have their own home chargers, so people who live in such dwellings do not yet have the same easy access to home charging.

Some critics, trolls, and haters might poo-poo the news of this number of EV chargers being installed as too little, but they are actually part of a much larger plan. “The grants expand charging access for residents throughout Michigan and move the state closer to the MI Healthy Climate Plan (MHCP) goal of sufficient infrastructure to support 2 million EVs in Michigan by 2030. Awardees are listed below. The MHCP is Michigan’s roadmap to a healthy, prosperous, carbon-neutral future for all Michiganders by 2050.”

Electric vehicles don’t directly generate toxic air pollution because they don’t burn gasoline or diesel fuel. Some areas of Detroit have too much air pollution. “The 48217 zip code in Southwest Detroit has the most air pollution of any community in the state, which can have devastating impacts on our health. Residents in the 48217 zip code — a community that is majority Black and Latino residents — experience disproportionately high rates of cancer and asthma. Investing in 100% clean energy will significantly reduce our carbon emissions and protect the health of communities across the state.”

Climate change impacts may also become more harmful. “A University of Michigan study projects deaths and emergency department visits caused by weather events during the time period 2041 to 2070 compared to a historical period of 1971 to 2000. Deaths from extreme heat are likely to increase from 33 deaths annually to 240 in the projected time period, the researchers report. Emergency department visits are expected to increase from 1,200 to 7,800, and hospitalizations from 28 to 185. Illness caused by extreme precipitation may increase from 170 ER visits per year to 220 visits per year.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChatGPT-Image-Nov-12-2025-12_46_41-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-11-12 16:01:00.194401

The Dalles, Ore., Nov. 12, 2025 — Oregon homeowners are facing a critical deadline to maximize savings on energy-efficient home improvements by stacking federal tax credits with local cash offers. The federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, making the remaining months of this year the final opportunity to complete eligible projects.

Homeowners can claim these federal tax credits when filing their taxes in early 2026 for any qualifying projects completed in 2025. Many of these upgrades also qualify for cash incentives from Energy Trust of Oregon, a nonprofit that helps people, businesses and communities use less energy and save money. Combining tax credits and incentives allows homeowners to get the deepest possible savings.

Along with lowering energy bills, these changes help make your home more comfortable inside. Energy efficiency improvements eligible for both the federal tax credits and Energy Trust incentives include:

Insulation: Adding or updating insulation on your attic, walls and floors can keep your heated or cooled air inside, meaning your system doesn’t have to work as hard.

Windows: Replacing older windows with energy efficient ones can keep your home more comfortable by keeping the air in and preventing drafts.

Heating and cooling: Heating and cooling your home is likely one of your biggest home energy expenses, so upgrading to modern, energy efficient units like heat pumps are a great way to keep energy costs low.

Water heating: Switching from a traditional water heater to a more efficient heat pump water heater uses much less energy to heat your water (often the second largest energy expense after heating and cooling).

Home energy audit: Credits can cover the cost of a professional energy “check-up” for your home. During the audit, an energy auditor uses tools to monitor temperature and moisture in your home and advises on the best upgrades to make, where your home is using energy efficiently and where energy may be wasted.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement federal tax credit offers two separate caps for tax credits, allowing homeowners to claim a total of up to $3,200 on their 2026 taxes from projects finished before December 31, 2025. The general cap with a maximum of $1,200, covers upgrades like insulation, windows, doors and home energy audits. Additionally, there’s a separate cap of $2,000 for installing an electric heat pump or heat pump water heater.

To claim the federal tax credits when filing a 2025 tax return, homeowners must have receipts and the manufacturer’s certification statements for all upgraded products. The process involves filling out a Form 5695 through the IRS website or tax prep software and filling in the details of energy-efficient improvements made at home in 2025 that qualify. Afterward, consult a tax professional to ensure everything is correct and ensure you’re able to qualify for as many savings as you’re eligible to claim.

Energy Trust does not give tax advice. Consult your tax professional for current information on credits available and how to apply.

DALLAS, TEXAS (November 12, 2025) – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a final rule approving the State of Texas’ request to administer permitting for Class VI underground injection wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). With this approval, Texas will implement Underground Injection Control (UIC) programs covering all well-types (Class I-VI), allowing better coordination and improved efficiencies.

This action recognizes that Texas is best positioned to protect its underground sources of drinking water while bolstering economic growth and energy dominance. It supports EPA’s Powering the Great American ComebackInitiative, which prioritizes clean and safe water for Americans, restoring American energy dominance, and advancing cooperative federalism.

“Approving Texas’ request to be in charge of this critical program is a big step forward for cooperative federalism—as big as the state of Texas,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “The Railroad Commission of Texas has demonstrated that the state is ready, willing, and able to add Class VI wells to its underground injection control program, and the Trump Administration is proud to support Texas as it shows once again that you can protect natural resources and grows our nation’s energy economy at the same time.”

“Obtaining Class VI primacy marks an important step forward for our state’s energy sector and our citizens by recognizing the Railroad Commission’s unmatched expertise when it comes to matters of energy production, geological knowledge, and safety,” said Railroad Commission of Texas Chairman Jim Wright. “I want to thank the Trump Administration and the leadership of EPA Administrator Zeldin and Region 6 Administrator Mason for their efforts to work with states to reduce regulatory overlap and for understanding that the permitting of Class VI wells can be accomplished both safely and efficiently under the Railroad Commission’s oversight.”

“Texas is a leader in energy production, and part of that is pioneering carbon capture and storage practices,” said Senator John Cornyn (R-TX). “The EPA’s final approval of Texas’ application for primacy over underground water injection wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act will allow the Lone Star State to have more control over its own permitting process and improve efficiency, and I thank the Trump administration and EPA Administrator Zeldin for prioritizing this effort.”

“I applaud and strongly support Administrator Zeldin and the EPA for this decision. Texas is the energy capital of the world, Class VI wells are critical to energy innovation in the Lone Star State and beyond, and providing certainty about their development in the permitting process will help spur new investment. This decision reaffirms that the Railroad Commission of Texas, not the bureaucracy in D.C., is best equipped to manage the permitting of wells in the Lone Star State. I look forward to working with Administrator Zeldin and my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that regulations don’t unnecessarily hinder Texas energy development, and that Texas remains the top energy producer in the nation,” said Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX).

“Texas has always led the way in responsible energy development, and today’s decision affirms that leadership. By granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells, EPA is recognizing what we already know: no one is better equipped to protect our drinking water, advance American energy independence, and streamline permitting than the great State of Texas,” said Congressman Brian Babin (R-TX-36). “I was proud to support this effort, and I applaud Administrator Zeldin for finally clearing the way for Texas to do what it does best: grow our economy, safeguard our communities, and strengthen America’s energy future.”

“I want to thank EPA Administrator Zeldin for this approval, which will keep Texas a leader in energy innovation,” said Congressman John Carter (R-TX-31). “This decision is a win for Texas, our environment, and our economy. With this approval, Texas can move faster, attract new investments, and create good-paying jobs, leading the way for Texas energy to flourish responsibly.”

“Giving states the authority to regulate Class VI wells will cut down lengthy review times and redundant bureaucratic red tape. Carbon capture should not be mandated, but if market forces demand it, duplicative regulations should not stand in the way. This is also why I introduced the Primacy Certainty Act of 2025—so other states can benefit from what Texas energy projects now enjoy thanks to the EPA’s actions under Lee Zeldin’s leadership. President Trump is delivering on his promise to allow our energy industries to thrive, and Texas is leading the way,” said Congressman Dan Crenshaw (R-TX-2).

“I want to thank Administrator Zeldin for recognizing Texas’ leadership and granting our state primacy over Class VI well permitting. Delays at the federal level have slowed down critical carbon capture projects. As a result, this has held back innovation, investment, and job growth across Texas,” said Congressman Jake Ellzey (R-TX-6). “By empowering the Texas Railroad Commission to oversee these permits, we’re cutting through red tape and putting decisions back in the hands of experts who understand Texas’ geology, economy, and commitment to protecting our water resources. I’m grateful to my Texas colleagues who joined me in urging this action, which strengthens both environmental stewardship and American energy leadership.”

“I’m glad to see the Environmental Protection Agency, now run by the Trump Administration, finally cut red tape and streamline the permitting process for Class VI underground injection wells,” said Congressman Craig Goldman (R-TX-12). “This improved process not only safeguards our drinking water but also promotes economic growth in Texas and across the nation.”

""This is a crucial step by Administrator Zeldin and the EPA to safeguard our drinking water while advancing technologies that keep Texas and America energy dominant. This America First policy will protect our water sources and draw new jobs and investment to Texas,” said Congressman Lance Gooden (R-TX-05).

“In February, I signed onto a letter expressing strong support for the Texas Railroad Commission’s (RRC) application for primary enforcement responsibility over Class IV Underground Injection Control (UIC) wells” said Congressman Wesley Hunt (R-TX-38). “With final rule approval from the EPA, Texas will be able to implement this initiative. This will incentivize economic growth and ensure that underground water sources are properly utilized, providing clean, safe drinking water for Texans. I applaud all efforts to protect public health and the environment. Thank you to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for taking key steps to delegate and approve this rule, which will benefit and strengthen communities across Texas.”

“Texas is the epicenter of our nation’s energy industry, leading the charge on carbon capture and responsible permitting. Today’s final rule announcement will continue our state’s incredible work and streamline its efficiency and innovation. I applaud EPA Administrator Zeldin’s leadership which benefits not only Texas, but also creates jobs, boosts manufacturing, and encourages energy dominance,” said Congressman Morgan Luttrell (R-TX-8).

""For far too long, bureaucratic red tape has delayed critical energy projects and slowed innovation. Texans lead the way in responsible, efficient production, and no one understands our geology better than the experts at the Railroad Commission. I applaud the EPA's decision in granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells, which will streamline the permitting process and allow energy producers to move forward with confidence. I want to thank Administrator Zeldin for recognizing Texas’s leadership and taking this important step to advance American energy security,"" said Congressman August Pfluger (R-TX-11).

“I applaud the Trump Administration EPA decision to grant the Texas Railroad Commission primary enforcement responsibility (or “primacy”) for Class VI underground injection wells to help expand American energy dominance and support tens of billions of dollars of investment, economic growth, and job opportunities for the Lone Star State,” said Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne (R-TX-24). “The Texas Railroad Commission is fully capable of evaluating and overseeing the development and operation of carbon capture and storage wells. I am thankful the Trump Administration is, once again, working to get the federal government out of the way and allow states to best manage energy production, storage, and innovative new technologies to secure a stronger energy future for our nation.”

“I was proud to support Texas’ request for primacy over Class VI injection wells, and I applaud EPA Administrator Zeldin for acting quickly and decisively to move this process forward,” said Congressman Randy Weber (R-TX-14). “Texas’ standards align with the Safe Drinking Water Act, and this decision helps streamline the permitting process to reduce unnecessary delays. It keeps projects moving, supports investment, and ensures decisions are made closer to home. This is a positive step for Texas and America’s economic future.”

After conducting a comprehensive technical and legal review, EPA determined that Texas’ UIC Class VI program meets all requirements for approval and that the state will implement and enforce the program consistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act. Today’s action marks the sixth time a state has received primacy for Class VI wells and the fifth approval under President Trump’s leadership.

Under the leadership of Administrator Zeldin, EPA is streamlining processes for issuing permits and reviewing applications for primacy. This work includes reducing the time to permit UIC wells and eliminating the backlog of applications.

The final rule will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. Publication is expected to be delayed due to a lapse in government funding.

US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy; US Sen. Ted Budd, R-NC; Gov. Josh Stein; Japanese ambassador to the US Shigeo Yamada; state Sens. Dave Craven, R-Randolph; Amy Galey, R-Alamance; state Reps. Brian Biggs, R-Randolph; Neal Jackson, R-Moore; officials from the Town of Liberty, Randolph County, and Guilford County; officials from the Greensboro-Randolph County Megasite Foundation; president and CEO of Toyota Motor North America, Tetsuo “Ted” Ogawa; and Toyota North Carolina president Don Stewart, were on hand to mark the occasion.

US Rep. Richard Hudson, NC-09, who was also supposed to be in attendance, was in Washington, DC, voting on a bill to end the federal government shutdown.

Stewart and Budd also acknowledged Jim Melvin, the late mayor of Greensboro, for his involvement in helping the plant come to fruition.

The company announced in 2021 that it planned to open the plant megasite, which spans 1,850 acres and is Toyota’s largest investment in the United States, at nearly $14 billion.

It currently has more than 2,500 workers, but the plans are to hire a total of 5,100 employees.

The plant, which is Toyota’s 11th manufacturing facility in the US, will feature 14 production lines, including four dedicated to supporting battery production for hybrid electric vehicles and 10 dedicated to supporting battery production for battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

The state-of-the-art facility features several shops that specialize in various stages of the lithium-ion battery manufacturing process. Production is divided into three main parts: electrode manufacturing, cell assembly, formation, and module.

According to a press release, batteries assembled at Toyota North Carolina are set to power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric 3-row BEV — the first of its kind for Toyota to be built in the US. Currently, the plant ships HEV modules to both Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama. Additional production lines at Toyota’s North Carolina facility are scheduled to launch by 2030.

The plant also has an on-site childcare center, medical clinic, and pharmacy for its employees.

Toyota “no stranger” to North Carolina

Ogawa noted that the company is no stranger to North Carolina, with its Racing Development Team in Salisbury, Rowan County.

“So, we are putting even deeper roots in North Carolina,” he said, adding that the launch of the plant marks a pivotal moment in the future of electrification for Toyota and for US auto manufacturing and that over the next five years, the company is planning an additional investment of $10 billion, for a total of over $60 billion in the US to further grow its manufacturing capabilities.

“The almost $14 billion investment in this state-of-the-art facility is not just about building batteries, it’s about building a future, a future that reflects our deep belief in America, in North Carolina, and in creating a more sustainable world,” Ogawa said.

He said President Donald Trump acknowledged Toyota’s commitment to North Carolina and recognized the importance of continued growth and partnership between the company and the US economy.

Duffy said an announcement will be made in the near future about the US Department of Transportation’s new “very reasonable fuel efficiency standard,” which will allow auto manufacturers to produce more vehicles that are more cost-effective for the American consumer.

He also applauded Toyota for listening to the consumer about what they want in a vehicle.

“Sometimes political pressure tells companies what they are supposed to do, but Toyota didn’t listen to political pressure,” Duffy said. “They listened to consumer pressure… I think the American people want hybrids, they want electric, but they also want the backup of a combustion engine, and those two things together to drive fuel efficiency is what Toyota has done and done it very well.”

Both Budd and Stein touted why Toyota and many others have selected North Carolina as the No. 1 state to do business.

“Those who have come in from out of state for a very special day, this is what the No. 1 state in the country for doing business in feels like,” Budd told the crowd.

Stein, a Democrat, mentioned his recent trip to the Southeast United States (SEUS)/Japan Annual Joint Meeting in Tokyo, Japan, and said he met with officials from at least 29 other Japanese companies in addition to meeting with executives from Toyota.

“We’re seeing our state become a national leader in the clean energy economy with Toyota leading the way,” he said. “To maintain this momentum, earlier this year I established an energy policy task force, which I’m proud to say Toyota is a part of. It’s about figuring out how we, as a state, can build on our economic momentum, keep electricity affordable as we meet growing energy demands, and maintain our goals to reduce carbon pollution.”

The governor noted that more than 100,000 North Carolinians are employed in clean tech jobs.

“Toyota is not alone here in North Carolina,” Yamada told those in attendance. “More than 400 Japanese companies are operating here. Japan is proud to be the leading investor and leading employer in this state.”

He also mentioned that President Trump had a highly successful meeting with the new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, the first woman to hold the position in the country’s history, when he visited two weeks ago.

“The president’s visit underlined that Japan and the United States, our relationship is stronger than ever,” Yamada said. “We are steadfast security allies, and we are dynamic economic partners, and we are natural collaborators in advancing our economic security. And in that partnership, this facility stands as a proud symbol of our joint work: driving innovation, sustainability, and resilience.”

Stewart also announced that the Toyota USA Foundation will give a $2.7 million grant to the second phase of Driving Possibilities in Guilford County Schools and the Asheboro City School District.

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf directed the state to join the initiative in 2019 through an executive order. However, litigation from Republican lawmakers and energy producers prevented the state from participating in the program. A case is currently pending before the state Supreme Court.

Molly Parzen, executive director of environmental advocacy group Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, called leaving RGGI a “devastating, self-inflicted setback in addressing affordability, clean energy, and pollution.”

“Their capitulation means that Pennsylvanians will now be robbed of more than $1 billion annually to lower electricity prices through investments in clean energy,” Parzen said in a statement, referencing the potential revenue that would have been funneled to the state.

Republicans have long criticized the program, saying that it would stymie the state’s powerful energy industry and raise consumer bills at a time of increasing costs.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has been vocally skeptical of the program since he announced his run for governor in 2021. He introduced his own state-based alternative to RGGI as legislation that would require GOP support.

However, state Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) previously told Spotlight PA that he would not move on any energy policy as long as the state was still in RGGI.

Language pulling Pennsylvania out of RGGI was included in the budget-enabling fiscal code bill. It passed the state House 189-14 and the state Senate 43-6.

State Rep. Greg Vitali (D., Delaware), a longtime environmental advocate and chair of the Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee, voted no.

“Democrats and the governor have ceded to this, along with other environmental asks, as a way of coming to a budget agreement and getting other things they deem important,” Vitali told Spotlight PA.

Vitali called RGGI the “only serious thing” that the legislature could have done to address climate change, calling Shapiro’s policy plan “dead on arrival” in the state Senate.

“This is our one opportunity, even though this was an uncertain opportunity. And unfortunately, we are caving in,” Vitali said.

The budget does include an additional $25 million for a popular grant program that provides schools with money to install solar panels and authorizes the spending of federal funding for solar panel construction.

Still, Vitali called those provisions “minuscule” compared to RGGI’s impact.

State Sen. Carolyn Comitta (D., Chester), the minority chair of the chamber’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, voted for the bill, despite her concerns regarding “taking RGGI off the table.”

Instead, she called on the legislature to pass Shapiro’s energy plan, which would create a state-level cap-and-trade program and increase renewable energy usage requirements for utilities.

“I fought for RGGI for years. I support RGGI. I still think RGGI would be a good idea for Pennsylvania,” Comitta said on the floor of the state Senate on Wednesday. “But I’m also realistic, and I’m willing to vote yes to end this impasse.”

Now, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moves to revoke the backbone of federal climate rules — the scientific finding that greenhouse gases threaten human health — one of the state’s top climate officials is weighing a provocative idea put forward by environmental law experts: If Washington retreats, California could lead on carbon-controlling regulation.

Absent what’s known as the endangerment finding, the EPA may soon consider abandoning the legal authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles, power plants and other sources, furthering the Trump Administration’s stated aim to dismantle U.S. climate policy.

While decrying the prospect of such a move, climate advocates say a repeal would yield a silver lining: California and other states could in theory set their own greenhouse gas rules for cars and trucks, regulations previously superseded by federal authority.

Cars and trucks represent more than a third of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. A long shot regulatory gambit could clean some of the nation’s dirtiest air – and keep the state’s clean-car transition alive.

“All options are currently on the table,” Lauren Sanchez, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told CalMatters in an interview.

Authority States Have Never Had Before

A former federal official and expert on the Clean Air Act – who is also a law professor at UCLA – first floated this idea.

Ann Carlson wrote in the law journal Environmental Forum that an aggressive federal action against climate policy “could, ironically, provide states with authority they’ve never had before.”

The Trump administration now argues that greenhouse gases do not endanger health and that regulation is more harmful — a claim widely rejected by scientists, businesses and environmental groups, as well as states, including California.

“If greenhouse gases aren’t covered by the Clean Air Act,” Carlson told CalMatters, “then California could presumably regulate them — and so could every other state.”

Carlson, who ran the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration until last year and has written extensively about the landmark law, argues that the act only preempts state rules for pollutants it actually covers. States “have a pretty strong legal argument” to regulate greenhouse gases, she said.

The EPA, for its part, argues that states would still be barred from setting their own standards, arguing that its broad authority over air pollution covers even emissions the agency chooses not to regulate. That’s a view shared by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association and lobbying group, which supported overturning California’s phaseout of new, gas-powered cars, as well as the American Trucking Associations, which has opposed some of California’s rules on trucks.

Carlson said that argument doesn’t hold up. In her Environmental Forum article, she wrote: “If Congress didn’t intend the act to cover greenhouse gases, as the administration argues, then it’s hard to believe Congress intended to preempt states and localities from regulating them.”

In other words, she says, preemption has its limits.

Other experts agreed the idea is worth considering.

Ethan Elkind, who directs the climate program at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, said that states are free to “do whatever they want,” as long as the federal government hasn’t preempted them.

Not a Slam Dunk for California to Step in

For the better part of a century, California has worked to curb air pollution at the state and local level. The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts.

“I personally would be advocating that they move ahead,” said Mary Nichols, a former air board chair. “And if I were there, I would be looking to gain support for doing it.”

California holds a unique status under federal law. It can set tougher tailpipe-emission standards than the rest of the country — a recognition of its early leadership in fighting smog. Since 1968, the state has obtained more than 100 federal waivers for its vehicle rules, and other states can adopt California’s standards under certain conditions.

UC Berkeley law professor Daniel Farber said the state could even take a dual-track approach. “We don’t really think we need a waiver,” he would argue after EPA abandons the field, “but just in case we do: yes, give us one.”

California’s latest clash with Washington stems from a decades-long dance over who sets the nation’s toughest clean-car rules.

The state’s strict vehicle rules have helped spur innovations from catalytic converters to cleaner fuel to electric cars. The regulatory push began in Los Angeles after skies grew so smog-choked they stung people’s eyes.

In 1966, California adopted the nation’s first tailpipe standards. When Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act, it gave the state rare authority to set tougher rules — making California both a laboratory and a trailblazer, so long as it secured a federal waiver.

In 2002, California passed the nation’s first law regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling confirmed those gases are pollutants under federal law, leading to the Obama administration’s 2009 “endangerment finding” that they harm public health.

Such a move would fit California’s pattern of pushing first and asking permission later. In 2005, the state adopted its greenhouse-gas standards for vehicles and sought a waiver before it was even clear whether carbon qualified as pollution under federal law. The EPA initially denied that request in 2008 but reversed course a year later, granting the waiver in 2009.

“So this wouldn’t necessarily be a slam dunk approach for the state to take, but I think the legal avenue is now there,” said Elkin, of UC Berkeley.

Targeting Cars with New Regulation

If California tried to regulate greenhouse gases on its own, it would have both experience and infrastructure to rely on. The process would look a lot like how the state has written past clean-car rules — except this time, the target would be carbon itself.

California’s clean-car rules have operated within the permission-seeking framework set up by the Clean Air Act — until this year, when Trump and Congress moved to block the state’s plans to phase out gas cars and tighten diesel-truck standards. Trump’s EPA then went further by proposing to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding, framing it as a win for “consumer choice.”

Most of the state’s climate programs already run under authority of California’s own groundbreaking state laws: clean-energy mandates for utilities, a carbon-trading program for businesses, even standards to cut the carbon in fuels.

Cars are different. They’re sold into a national market, and tailpipe emissions have long been federally preempted — one reason California has needed Washington’s permission to go its own way.

If the state decides to test those limits, regulators would need to draft new rules and open them to public review — a process that could take years.

California has already started down the path of new rules for clean cars and trucks. Last month, the Air Resources Board began the process of crafting clean car rules in response to the Trump administration’s rollback of the state’s new gas-car ban — a revocation the state is also fighting in court. In December, the board plans to begin the process of writing new emissions rules for trucks.

The automobile association declined to comment on the new rulemaking effort. Patrick Kelly, vice president of energy and environmental affairs for American Trucking Associations, said the group would work with its state affiliate to “respond to specific proposals.”

“More broadly, (our group) supports achievable national standards and opposes a patchwork of state and local standards that Congress sought to avoid,” Kelly wrote in an email.

Asked by CalMatters whether the new rulemakings could become the vehicle for California to go its own way under Trump, Sanchez, the air board chair, said it’s an option staff is studying.

“It’s something that staff is looking into, and I look forward to digging into myself,” Sanchez said.

No Downside to Trying, and Some Upsides

Even if legal experts like the idea in theory, UC Berkeley’s Dan Farber says California going forward alone is a longshot in practice.

“There’s a chance you would win,” Farber said, of the argument that the state could directly regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars. “You’re buying a lawsuit, but other than litigation expenses, I don’t think there’s much downside in trying to do it.”

Farber and others point out that the Trump administration and car and truck manufacturers would almost certainly sue to block state-level efforts to regulate greenhouse gases.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation warned, in comments to the EPA, that if states were not preempted, any unregulated emission “would then become fair game,” creating conflicting standards across the country. Automakers have long argued that letting states write their own climate rules would create a costly patchwork of standards, raising prices for consumers and complicating production for a national market.

California is in somewhat of a legal quandary. The Clean Air Act requires California to meet national pollution standards, and the state still has some of the most air-polluted regions in the country.

The state’s solutions rely heavily on clean-car and truck rules to meet those requirements. If California falls short, it could lose federal highway funding, a situation that Sanchez called a “no-win, Catch 22.”

After decades of regulation and incentives, California has built a reputation as a leader in electric cars, and experts said if the state pushes further on policy, that could help keep California’s clean-car transition alive and its electric-vehicle goals within reach.

Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, said California could also risk getting ahead of consumers if it goes it alone. Electric cars proved less popular than policymakers expected when it originally passed its goal to do away with sales of new gas-powered cars.

“What is clear is that the program was not overwhelmingly popular amongst the public, even in California, right?” Nigro said. “That’s usually a flag for policymakers.”

Craig Segall, an independent consultant and former state air board deputy, said there’s another factor to consider: by preserving demand and infrastructure for EVs, the state could maintain a beachhead for innovation that a future president might build on.

With no coherent federal policy to compete in the global EV market, California could again use its regulatory and investment muscle — just as it once did in helping spawn electric car maker Tesla — to push the market forward.

“What the feds are basically signaling here is that the field is open for anyone who’s serious about being a competitive car or truck company in five years,” Segall said. “One of those paths is: the world’s fourth largest economy figures out ways to take its manufacturing economic capacity and just plow ahead.”

The new headquarters is expected to be in the Commonwealth development in Plaza Midwood. The jobs will be created over a five-year period from 2026 to 2030, according to officials at the Economic Investment Committee meeting.

They said $172,878 is the expected minimum average wage, and Scout Motors anticipates investing $207 million by the end of 2029. The state is awarding Scout Motors a job development investment grant worth up to $46.5 million if it reaches its hiring and investment targets.

This is one of the biggest job creation announcements in Charlotte over the past decade, local officials said.

Charlotte beat out sites in South Carolina and Virginia for the Scout Motors headquarters, the company told N.C. officials. Scout Motors’ headquarters is in Tysons, Virginia, near Washington, D.C.

Scout Motors already has a robust presence in the Carolinas. In 2023, the company announced it was investing $2 billion in an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Richland County near Columbia, along with 4,000 jobs. The company also received $1.3 billion in incentives from the state.

Production is targeted to begin at the S.C. site in 2027.

“Scout Motors has undertaken a nationwide search to identify a location for its new corporate headquarters from which it will lead and drive its company, brand and products,” Mark Poole of the NC Commerce Department, said at the meeting.

In Plaza Midwood, Gov. Josh Stein and state Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley traveled to Charlotte for the announcement. They were joined by city and Mecklenburg County officials who are also involved in the deal, along with the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance.

The Charlotte headquarters will serve as the home for executives, research and development, finance, IT, sales, marketing and other key corporate functions.

“We’re excited that you’re revitalizing an iconic American brand and building the next generation vehicle company right here in the Carolinas,” Stein said.

Why Scout Motors chose Charlotte for HQ

Scoutt Motors President Scott Keogh talked about the reasons the company landed on Charlotte.

He cited the talent pool, local universities and a reputation as a launchpad for bold ideas.

“Charlotte offers the momentum we need to scale quickly and sustainably,” Keogh said. “We’ll build a headquarters that reflects our culture, empowers our team and connects us to a region that’s fast becoming a national hub for mobility and manufacturing.”

Scout Motors will establish its Charlotte presence gradually. Its plans for initial staffing and office development will start next year, with full headquarters operations scaling up over several years.

Scout Motors in South Carolina

In February 2024, Scout Motors broke ground on a production center in Blythewood, South Carolina, off Interstate 77 and just outside of Columbia. It covers about 1,600 acres, with the main plant taking up 1,100 acres, according to a Scout Motors news release.

This location gives Scout Motors easy access to highways, shipping ports in Charleston and Savannah, and colleges known for automotive engineering.

Scout plans to start making vehicles by the end of 2026, with trucks and SUVs expected to go on sale shortly after production begins. Over 14,000 people already have expressed interest for the 4,000 jobs, the Columbia State reported.

Plans are also underway to build a Supplier Park on the site of its Blythewood production center. Located next to the main production center buildings, the Supplier Park spans nearly 200 acres and will feature more than 2.3 million square feet of specialized manufacturing and logistics space.

About Scout Motors

The Scout was first made by International Harvester from 1961 to 1980. It was the world’s first vehicle designed for both off-road and family use, earning a reputation as a tough, all-purpose truck.

In 2022, Volkswagen introduced Scout Motors, a new company founded to bring back the iconic Scout brand by building a fresh line of all-electric trucks and SUVs.

Scout currently operates 1.3 million square feet of assembly space and body shops, according to its website. The company has more than 4,000 workers for production jobs.

EV manufacturer Scout Motors’ decision will bring a new industry to Charlotte

By Ashley Fahey and Tony Mecia

Scout Motors is planting its headquarters in Charlotte, bringing 1,200 jobs and an expected investment of $207M to the Plaza Midwood neighborhood.

The N.C. Department of Commerce’s Economic Investment Committee on Wednesday afternoon voted to approve a Job Development Investment Grant for Scout’s local expansion. An announcement that includes Gov. Josh Stein, the city, the county and the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance is scheduled for 2 p.m. today at the Commonwealth development in Plaza Midwood. Local incentives of about $20M are expected to be offered by the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County.

The investment is expected to run through Dec. 31, 2029. The positions are expected to pay an average wage of $172,000. Scout also considered sites in South Carolina and Virginia for its headquarters.

The project is a significant one for Charlotte, in terms of job count, investment and industry diversification.

Who is Scout Motors?

In starting to manufacture cars and trucks, Scout Motors is reviving a brand from the 1960s and 1970s that is thought of as helping create the SUV segment. Scout off-road vehicles were made by International Harvester from the 1960s until 1980.

The new Scout Motors is a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group that was founded in 2022. It plans to make off-road capable electric trucks and SUVs at a manufacturing facility in Blythewood, S.C., just north of Columbia, which is under construction.

Scout Motors CEO Scott Keogh said in a May interview that the company is going to “restore an American icon for this American moment.”

The company does not currently have vehicles available for sale, though it is accepting reservations for its first two models: the Scout Traveler SUV and the Scout Terra pickup truck. Production is expected to begin in 2027, and analysts estimate the first models will be available in 2028. The company says entry-level models will start at “under $60,000.”

Since Scout selected the site for its $2B plant in South Carolina in 2023 — which is expected to employ as many as 4,000 workers — it has been searching for a headquarters location to consolidate its operations. Scout has said it preferred a spot close to the plant. Blythewood is about 1 hour, 15 minutes south of Charlotte, off I-77.

Keogh said in May that the company was searching for a site that is “a great place to live, and that’s a big spectrum. Can our employees afford it? Do they get good health care? Do they want to move here? We’re going to have to convince an awful lot of people to say this is a great place to raise your family and build a home and all of that.”

The announcement also represents a continued shift of automotive jobs to the South. For years, North Carolina had been bypassed for other states, but that is starting to change — especially with electric vehicle-related projects. Toyota announced a battery manufacturing plant near Greensboro in 2021, and Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced a battery plant west of Raleigh in 2022 (though construction has been delayed).

South Carolina has been stronger at attracting automotive investments, with BMW opening a plant near Spartanburg in 1994 and Volvo opening one outside of Charleston in 2018. Isuzu said this year it would open a plant near Greenville, S.C.

Both states have quietly nurtured the growth of automotive suppliers as well.

Scout’s unique choice in HQ location

The arrival of Scout is also distinctive in that it chose to locate its headquarters in Plaza Midwood, a neighborhood east of uptown that is not known as an office employment hub.

Scout’s future home at the Commonwealth project, spearheaded by Charlotte developer Crosland Southeast and Nuveen, is part of a 12-acre redevelopment at Central and Pecan avenues that was once home to a Family Dollar-anchored strip center. Crosland and Nuveen have built hundreds of apartments, and a substantial amount of retail space — more than 100,000 sq. ft., for both existing and new businesses — is entitled for the property. Already, several ground-floor retail tenants, including Van Leeuwen, Yonder Yoga, Solidcore and bootmaker Lucchese, have opened. Several more, including Japanese restaurant Uchi, have been announced.

The project’s six-story, 145,000 sq. ft. office building finished construction in the second quarter. An undeveloped portion of the site — the side closest to Independence Boulevard, at the intersection of Commonwealth and Pecan avenues — could accommodate a future phase of development.

The Commonwealth project is perhaps the most visible example of the change Plaza Midwood has undergone in recent years, as more developers and new businesses have moved in, and longtime neighborhood staples have relocated to more affordable areas of Charlotte.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical source of energy for meeting exploding future global energy needs. It can also assist in achieving climate goals through replacing more emissions-intensive sources (such as coal). The United States is by far the largest producer and exporter of LNG, with new facilities coming online (including many along the Texas coast) which will enhance future capacity.

In essence, LNG facilities compress natural gas into a liquid form which can be transported by tanker and regassified at locations around the world. It is rapidly transforming the market for natural gas, which was once dictated almost entirely by pipeline routes, into a global phenomenon.

Under a variety of alternative scenarios regarding economic growth, costs of zero-carbon energy sources, energy prices, and other relevant parameters, continued expansion is anticipated. International demand for natural gas is increasing due to its favorable environmental properties as well as its potential role as a backup fuel to intermittent renewable energy. Developing economies around the world are also in need of low-cost, environmentally friendly fuels to facilitate growth, expand production, and alleviate extreme poverty.

Natural gas is also essential to electric generation capacity for the foreseeable future across the world. While renewable sources clearly have a vital and, indeed, essential role to play, their intermittent nature and ongoing lack of sufficient battery storage capacity requires backup generation capacity primarily fueled by natural gas. This requirement has been further enhanced of late by the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), massive data centers, and other emerging technologies (including those related to carbon capture and other emissions-reducing methods) which require unprecedented levels of power consumption. In Texas alone, requirements for power generation are expected to double over the next five years.

Beyond supplying needed energy, the LNG industry has a significant impact on the economies of the United States and Texas. Through their construction and operations, LNG facilities provide jobs, economic activity, and fiscal benefits. We have studied the effects on numerous occasions and found that construction and operations lead to billions in economic activity as well as substantial tax receipts to federal, state, and local government entities. They also support development of natural gas resources, which brings additional investment and employment opportunities.

US LNG exports are crucial to meeting future demand, and Texas is able to provide the necessary gas production, pipeline infrastructure, LNG facilities, ports, and terminals. In addition to ensuring sustainable global energy supplies, the industry provides a substantial economic and fiscal stimulus. It must be implemented in a responsible manner that recognizes and embraces climate realities, but the sheer quantities of energy that will be required mandate that an “all-of-the-above” strategy be implemented. Stay safe!

About International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety Since 2008, the German government has been promoting climate action and biodiversity conservation in the Global South through the International Climate Initiative (IKI).
Within the Federal Government, the IKI is anchored in the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUKN).","Belém, Brazil (November 12, 2025) – Today at the COP30 UN climate conference, leaders from governments, businesses, civil society and philanthropy launched a new global effort that puts people’s jobs and skills at heart of the transition to a low-carbon and resilient economy.

Developed in collaboration with the COP30 Presidency and a broad coalition of international partners, the Global Initiative on Jobs & Skills for the New Economy aims to accelerate investment in human capital, foster social inclusion, and align workforce development with national climate and economic strategies. The Initiative responds to growing demand for practical solutions that make climate action work for people — creating jobs, developing skills, and ensuring social protection as economies transform.

“Here in Belém, we must show that climate action is not only about emissions and technologies, but about people and their future,” said COP30 CEO Ana Toni, who co-hosted the event launch. “Let us come together in the spirit of mutirão — the collective energy of communities working together — to build a fairer and more prosperous future for all.”

The Initiative builds on new global research from Systemiq and World Resources Institute (WRI) which shows that the climate transition could create an estimated 375 million new jobs over the next decade, particularly in renewable energy, construction and nature-based solutions. Adaptation activities, such as building resilient infrastructure, are expected to be a major source of employment as well, generating an estimated 280 million jobs worldwide.

Realizing the potential for new jobs will require unprecedented coordination among governments, business and international financial institutions. The new analysis sets out an Action Agenda across three key pillars:

Intentionality: Embed jobs and skills strategies in national climate and industrial plans, backed by data-driven workforce intelligence and local transition pacts.

Innovation: Build modern, modular training systems and industry-led consortia to align skills with emerging green sectors.

Investment: Treat spending on human capital as investment, not consumption, mobilizing domestic revenues, business incentives, and international finance for long-term workforce development.

“The transition to a new economy is not a burden, but a historic opportunity to create jobs, empower youth and drive inclusive growth,” said Hon. Dr. Eng. Festus K. Ng’eno, Principal Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry, Kenya. “With over 40% of Kenyans employed in agriculture and a rapidly growing youth population, investing in our people’s skills for sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and transport is essential to building a more resilient, competitive and equitable economy for generations to come.”

“The data is clear — the skills needed for jobs are changing faster than ever,” said Allen Blue, Co-Founder of LinkedIn. “Our research shows demand for green talent continues to grow at twice the pace of skills in the workforce. Closing this gap will only happen with urgent, coordinated action to put green training at the core of every climate and business plan. Doing so not only accelerates progress, it connects people to economic opportunity.”

To deliver impact, the Initiative will work across different tracks to bring together knowledge and learning, help to establish country and industry action partnerships and build a movement. Early engagement is underway with countries including Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, Senegal, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, and partnerships are forming with leading development institutions and private-sector coalitions. As a foundation for further cooperation, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH commissioned and published three country case studies (Brazil, Kenya and Pakistan), while the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German government funded a case study on the impact of skills shortages on global power emissions.

Leaders supporting the new Initiative underscored how the transition to a low-carbon and resilient economy will succeed only if it is powered by skilled, secure and supported workers. They called for a new compact between climate and development actors, positioning human capital as a central pillar of economic and climate transition strategies:

“A people-centered transition is both a moral imperative and an economic necessity,” said Jochen Flasbarth, State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany. “Social protection, opportunities for retraining and job transition policies are key to ensuring that climate ambition remains both politically and socially sustainable.”

“Business and industry have a crucial role to play in this transformation,” said Ricardo Mussa, Chair of Sustainable Business COP30 (SB COP). “Investing in green skills and workforce transformation is not just good for the planet — it’s good for business. By building the talent base for the low-carbon economy, companies can unlock new markets, strengthen supply chains, and deliver sustainable growth.”

“We need a coordinated, whole-of-economy approach with investments in skills and workforce development at the center,” said Dr. Liesbet Steer, Executive Director at Systemiq and lead author of the report. “Our report shows that a people-centered transition can deliver a powerful triple dividend — stronger economies, greater social cohesion, and faster environmental progress.”

“The transition to a low-carbon economy will only succeed if people are positioned to benefit from it and equipped to drive it forward,” said Ani Dasgupta, President & CEO of WRI. “By investing in people’s skills and potential, we turn the challenge of decarbonization into an engine for growth and shared prosperity.”

“Skills shortages put global climate goals at risk. There can be no climate transition without a skills transition,” said Ingrid-Gabriela Hoven, Managing Director at GIZ. “Accelerating green jobs and skills will yield a triple dividend: stronger and more resilient economies, more social cohesion, and faster progress to a low-carbon economy.”

“Philanthropy and private investors are key to unlocking the potential of the new economy,” said Michelle Armstrong, Managing Director at Ares Management and President of the Ares Charitable Foundation. “Catalytic investments in people’s skills, resilience and potential can help empower communities, expand access to good jobs, and build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.”

""As countries implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the right tools and partnerships are essential to build capacity for climate innovation — unlocking the social and economic transformation these commitments aim to deliver,"" said Pablo Vieira, Global Director of the NDC Partnership. ""The Global Initiative on Jobs & Skills for the New Economy will play a key role in expanding this support, helping countries fast-track NDC implementation and investment for a green and just transition.”

The plant is producing hybrid batteries for factories in Kentucky and a Mazda Toyota joint venture in Alabama.

“Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10 billion in the US to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60 billion,” said Toyota Motor North America president Ted Ogawa.

Toyota’s 11th US factory, on a 1,850-acre (749-hectare) site, will be able to produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity and house 14 battery production lines for plug-in hybrids and full EVs. It will eventually employ 5,000 workers.

Last month in Japan, US President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10 billion investment in the United States. “Go out and buy a Toyota,” Trump said. He has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest automakers to move to full EVs but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

“We know there is no single path to progress,” Ogawa said on Wednesday. “That’s why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.”

Other automakers like Volkswagen have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits and eliminated penalties that incentivized EV sales.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under President Joe Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

Such refreshing economic practicality almost provides hope for the renewables industry after all.
Sadly, as Dr. von Bernstorff noted, her opinion on CfDs is not widely shared across the European renewables industry.
In the U.S., meanwhile, new projects and improved delivery networks for our most affordable and reliable energy sources are being regularly implemented across multiple states.","This article was orginally published at The Empowerment Alliance and is re-published here with permission.

Momentum is a crucial factor in success in all walks of life. In sports, a high-performance team builds confidence and enthusiasm, often leading to a string of wins. In politics, legislative victories or a growing list of endorsements pressures others to line up in support of a cause or candidate. And in business, a rising stock or product often continues to climb because its momentum attracts attention and leads to growing demand.

In the energy business, momentum in recent years was on the side of renewables, primarily thanks to government subsidies financing wind and solar initiatives and regulations designed to erect roadblocks to legacy energy enterprises.

Clearly, things have changed. The momentum has shifted. Thanks to the Trump administration removing barriers for our most affordable and reliable energy sources, a whirlwind of activity designed to deliver natural gas to consumers across the nation is underway at a frenetic pace.

Just during the last couple of weeks of October alone, various companies announced a flurry of activity. To highlight just a few:

In Louisiana, Williams Companies unveiled a strategic partnership with Woodside Energy “to advance Louisiana pipeline and liquefied natural gas projects,” leading to more capital investment.

The deal involves an investment in the Louisiana LNG project in which Williams “will acquire 80% ownership in and become operator of Driftwood Pipeline LLC, which includes the construction of Line 200, a fully permitted greenfield pipeline connecting Woodside’s Louisiana LNG facility to multiple pipelines, including Transco and Louisiana Energy Gateway.”

Williams said it expects its investment “will total $1.9 billion in capital for development of the pipeline and LNG facilities.”

In Tennessee, East Tennessee Natural Gas, owned by Enbridge, announced that “construction on the 122-mile pipeline through the Upper Cumberland for the Ridgeline Expansion Project will begin soon.” The company said it received a notice to proceed on Oct. 7 from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Construction was expected to begin Nov. 1, according to Enbridge. “The pre-construction activity began on Oct. 20,” according to the report. The pipeline “will supply natural gas to the new Tennessee Valley Authority Kingston Energy Complex.”

In Ohio, a new bill, SB 294, mirrors federal legislation recently introduced by U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson (R) aimed at qualifying natural gas as clean energy and designed to “compel the Ohio Power Siting Board to favor energy projects it deems both ‘clean and reliable,’” as one industry site described it.

The bill would also “declare renewable sources like wind and solar ‘unreliable.’”

In Texas, Phillips 66 and Kinder Morgan Inc. announced “the commencement of a binding open season for transportation service on the Western Gateway Pipeline (Western Gateway), a newly proposed refined products pipeline system.”

The project “will facilitate the transportation of refined products from origin points in Texas to key downstream markets in Arizona and California, with connectivity to Las Vegas, Nevada via Kinder Morgan’s CALNEV Pipeline.”

A press release spelled out an impressive delivery network across parts of Texas, Arizona, Missouri, California and Nevada.

Compare the level of excitement and activity for legacy energy with the worries and warnings coming from the renewables industry about its own state of play, including on the world stage.

BloombergNEF recently held a London summit with renewables leaders to address the fact that “the European renewables boom is colliding with growing systemic pains. Record levels of negative power prices, particularly in Spain, are reshaping how risk is distributed across producers and buyers of renewable electricity.”

One of the topics was Europe’s Contract for Difference (CfD) model, which amounts to a contract between a renewables company and a government-backed counter-party agreeing on a fixed price for wholesale electricity. The idea is to stabilize revenues for renewables while encouraging investment by removing fear of volatile electricity prices. In other words, it’s one more way for the government to artificially prop up the renewables industry.

Encouragingly, one panelist at the summit seemed impressively grounded in reality. Dr. Alexandra von Bernstorff, managing partner for Luxcara, a German-based company specializing in renewable energy investments, said she was not a fan of CfDs because “they made the industry lazy.”

“We need to face the fact that we have a product and we have to sell the product like everyone else,” she said. “And I need to think about, do I have connections or not? Do I have customers or not? Can I produce cheap enough or not? As an industry, we should have gotten into these questions much earlier. So I’m a big fan of having free market negotiations.

Wow. Such refreshing economic practicality almost provides hope for the renewables industry after all. Sadly, as Dr. von Bernstorff noted, her opinion on CfDs is not widely shared across the European renewables industry.

The renewables industry is dealing with “systemic pains” and second-guessing its approach in Europe, despite the overwhelming support of government leaders, as Europeans nervously face an uncertain energy future.

Nissan Leaf

The pioneer of the mass-market EV industry remains, for now, the most affordable way into a new electric vehicle. The third-generation Nissan Leaf is still holding the line on price, reducing entry barriers to EV ownership for USA buyers.

Starting at an MSRP of around $29,990 USD, the Leaf is undeniably the cheapest electric car on this list. Despite its low price, there’s no compromises when it comes to range, with even the entry level S+ trim offering an EPA-estimated range of 303 miles thanks to a large 75 kWh battery.

This entry model still packs a decent list of standard equipment, including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, remote climate control, a 28-inch driver display, and more. With the front-driven electric motor offering up 214 horsepower, it’s got more than enough power to easily merge onto highways too.

Chevrolet Equinox EV

For those in the market for a compact SUV that’s also fully-electric, Chevrolet’s latest Equinox EV is another strong choice. Prices for the entry-level LT1 start at $35,100 USD, and it’s no surprise that this car is Chevrolet’s best selling electric car.

This EV delivers an EPA-estimated range of up to 319 miles, making it the longest range EV available at this price point. It’s a no-compromise replacement for a similarly sized gasoline option, offering ample space inside and strong on-road performance thanks to its 220 horsepower electric motor.

For the 2026 model year, the Equinox EV also comes with a native NACS charging port, further future proofing this American-made EV by offering a seamless gateway to Tesla’s Supercharger network.

Fiat 500e

With its iconic European styling and small form factor, the Fiat 500e is the style icon on this cheap EV list, offering bags of personality for an MSRP starting price of $30,500 USD. With an EPA-rated range of around 153 miles, the 500e is more suited for urban driving, as opposed to the mile-munching capabilities of other cars on this list such as the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Equinox EV.

DC fast charging capability means the Fiat 500e can also be recharged in a flash, on the correct public charger – allowing for 40 miles of range to be added in as little as five minutes.

Hyundai Kona Electric

The Kona Electric is another affordable compact SUV on this list, offering a compelling blend of range, tech, and utility in a segment-favorite crossover package.

The entry-level Kona Electric SE starts at approximately $32,795 USD. With an EPA estimated range of 261 miles, and standard equipment such as Hyundai’s dual-screen infotainment setup, connectivity features, and a spacious cabin, this is a great affordable all rounder.

(Reuters) -Toyota Motor said on Wednesday it had begun production at its $13.9 billion North Carolina battery plant as it ramps up hybrid production and confirmed plans to invest $10 billion over five years in U.S. manufacturing.

The Japanese automaker first announced the plan in December 2021 to produce batteries for its hybrid and electric vehicles. Batteries from the plant are set to power hybrid versions of the Camry, Corolla Cross, RAV4 and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row battery electric vehicle. The plant is producing hybrid batteries for factories in Kentucky and a Mazda Toyota joint venture in Alabama.

""Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10 billion in the U.S. to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60 billion,"" said Toyota Motor North America President Ted Ogawa.

Toyota's 11th U.S. factory, on a 1,850-acre (749-hectare) site, will be able to produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity and house 14 battery production lines for plug-in hybrids and full EVs. It will eventually employ 5,000 workers.

Last month in Japan, U.S. President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10 billion investment in the United States. ""Go out and buy a Toyota,"" Trump said. He has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest automakers to move to full EVs but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

""We know there is no single path to progress,"" Ogawa said on Wednesday. ""That's why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.""

Other automakers like Volkswagen have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits and eliminated penalties that incentivized EV sales.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under President Joe Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

Given data centers’ exceptionally large electricity demands and 24-hour use times, projects are sited with numerous large diesel generators.
There isn’t a consensus on how many hours of backup power a data center needs, Limandibhratha said.
The public debate about such issues is new for the data center industry, which hasn’t been accustomed to such scrutiny.
“Maybe you can’t do it all with battery storage, but you also don’t need to just rely on diesel generators,” Wamsted said.","“Five nines.”

In the world of data centers, ensuring a facility will be online 99.999 percent of the time, is everything. Access to power is the number one priority when developers are trying to figure out where to build the warehouses storing supercomputers that in recent years have grown beyond what was previously imaginable.

In order to ensure five nines, data center developers secure power in various ways: They’ll seek to connect to the grid, build out or buy their own behind-the-meter power supply—typically in the form of gas-fired generation—and lastly, host multiple backup generators on site.

These generators commonly run on diesel. The refined crude oil has become the industry standard to ensure around-the-clock access to power as developers in Texas await a new state regulation that empowers the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state’s grid operators, to disconnect large power users like data centers at times of peak demand. Backup generators have also become vital to developers as slow supply chains delay onsite gas turbine installations.

The preferred backup power source for data centers are big air polluters, which environmentalists and industry experts say could be highly problematic unless clear rules are established and enforced for limiting diesel generator use.

While these backup generators are meant to be used rarely outside of maintenance testing, there is concern that as ERCOT employs its new powers to force data centers off the grid in times of peak demand, the diesel generators will run more frequently.

Diesel generators are rife with environmental issues. They are expensive to run and face limits from federal, state and local regulators on noise and air pollution. Diesel emits harmful pollutants that the American Cancer Society links to heart and lung disease and cancer.

Yet despite such obvious health impacts, those operating diesel generators are typically only required to self-report emissions to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA may issue compliance inspections and facility evaluations to ensure that projects are abiding by the rules for regulated pollutants.

Diesel generators used as backup power in Texas are most commonly permitted by the TCEQ, as long as the hours they run don’t exceed 10 percent of the annual operations of the primary power source. TCEQ grants those operating diesel generators either a standard permit or a case-by-case new source review permit.

With some data center developers looking to build single projects that consume more electric power than cities, there’s concern that the self-reported emissions from diesel generators used to provide backup power will exceed limits under the Clean Air Act.

Federally, there are no time limits on the use of these diesel generators during emergencies. The EPA sees emergencies as situations resulting from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events, like a grid power failure, gas plants unexpectedly shutting off or natural disasters. Under such circumstances, the operator of the generator is responsible for logging the emergency and reporting which steps were taken to mitigate emissions.

But for non-emergencies, like machine testing, diesel generators are federally limited to 100 hours. Fifty of those 100 hours can be used for demand response programs—grid or transmission operators paying large load users like data centers to switch to backup generators to reduce stress on the grid.

This comes as Texas’ largest metropolitan areas—Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso and San Antonio— already violate air quality standards, according to the EPA.

There are companies in gas-rich Texas promoting a switch to portable natural gas generators, which burn cheaper fuel that is better suited for long-term use with less air pollution. One gas generator company, Generac, said in a white paper that its gas generators emit 95 percent less nitrogen oxides, a significant contributor to smog and acid rain; 98 percent less non-methane hydrocarbons and 59 percent less carbon monoxide. But natural gas, unlike diesel fuel, can’t be stored on site.

Because diesel can be stored on site and is readily available, it has become the preferred energy source for most backup or emergency generators, said Brandon Seale, a longtime gas executive and former president of West Texas Gas, recently rebranded as WTG Energy.

“You can find it in a bunch of different places,” Seale said to a crowd at a data center conference in October. “And so people like that.”

Diesel generators are regularly used in mining, agriculture and energy. Given data centers’ exceptionally large electricity demands and 24-hour use times, projects are sited with numerous large diesel generators.

While data centers already use all sources of redundancy in order to maintain their reliability, as more grid operators around the country like ERCOT trend toward curtailing data centers at times of peak demand, the facilities will likely need even more backup systems, said Nathalie Limandibhratha, BloombergNEF’s U.S. power analyst.

There isn’t a consensus on how many hours of backup power a data center needs, Limandibhratha said. But given the shifting rules regarding large loads in ERCOT, some business leaders are considering having 50 to 100 hours of backup generation onsite, she said.

Diesel generators are the cheapest way for data centers to meet shifting industry standards for on-site backup with on-site fuel supply, said Chris Miller, president of The Piedmont Environmental Council, a Virginia-based nonprofit that has been tracking the environmental impacts of the data center industry across Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world. But these generators also produce the most toxic air pollution.

In any other industry use, generating as much power from diesel as is required by data centers in any metropolitan area in the U.S. would trigger Clean Air Act violations, he said. However, by using emergency permitting, the pollution is allowed, Miller said.

“Diesel combustion is one of the dirtiest forms of generation we know,” Miller said. “It’s only supposed to be for emergency use.”

But conversations happening at both the federal and state levels consider allowing waivers from the Clean Air Act for an expanded range of grid scenarios, he said. His concern is that while grid and data center operators try to solve for grid reliability by curtailing and using backup power, air quality impacts are not being considered.

His fear is that the default will become using these diesel generators for longer and longer periods of time.

The public debate about such issues is new for the data center industry, which hasn’t been accustomed to such scrutiny. For years, the industry operated in relative secrecy, building big warehouses to support everyday internet functions like Gmail, iCloud and Amazon Prime.

But as the industry transforms grids across the country and drives electricity demand to record levels, it finds itself at the center of a storm of protest in communities nationwide. Residents across the country are becoming increasingly concerned about rising power costs, pollution, zoning and water usage related to data centers, many of which are massive in size.

As Texas follows in the footsteps of Virginia’s so-called “Data Center Alley,” building out huge amounts of infrastructure and incorporating these large loads onto its grid, Miller warns about the looming consequences of allowing the industry to steam ahead before rules are settled.

In attempts to get online faster as interconnection queues grow, Miller said some data centers are getting permits for a power generation unit they claim is temporary and will be used as backup power once they’re connected to the grid, but end up using it as the primary power source as they wait to get on the grid.

“We’re starting to see specific proposals that say, ‘Well, don’t worry about the air quality effects. We’re just trying to come online in a timely fashion,’’’ Miller said. “But what they’re really saying is, ‘We want to operate outside the rules.’”

Some big tech companies say they are looking to reduce their growing emissions while trying to stay competitive in the race to develop artificial intelligence. While Microsoft’s emissions grew by nearly 25 percent from fiscal years 2020 to 2024, the company has committed to becoming carbon negative by 2030. To get there, Microsoft says it plans to phase out the use of petroleum-based diesel generators as a backup power for its data centers by 2030, partly by adopting “renewable diesel variations” and procuring hydrogenated vegetable oils to reduce their emissions.

An alternative future to diesel generators could include diversifying backup power options to include battery storage, renewables, natural gas or cleaner diesel products, Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability concluded in a February report.

Dennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, warned against the widespread use of diesel generators. “On a 30,000-foot level, it’s a terrible idea,” Wamsted said. “They’re noisy, they have to be tested all the time if they aren’t running. They are not very friendly, if you will.”

The local air pollution undoubtedly will lead to issues, he said.

Wamsted said that large-scale battery storage has great potential in this application and could be used even in combination with diesel generators to lower a site’s overall environmental and noise pollution, as well as running costs.

“Maybe you can’t do it all with battery storage, but you also don’t need to just rely on diesel generators,” Wamsted said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2194970695-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 14:03:37.724633

Donate to sustain Prism’s mission and the humans behind it.

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), India’s largest Hindu far-right organization, initiated a well-funded lobbying effort in the U.S. earlier this year, a Prism investigation has found.

Prism is the first news outlet to report that Squire Patton Boggs, one of the top lobbying firms in the U.S., registered as a lobbyist on Jan. 16 for the RSS, according to lobbying disclosures. In the first three quarters of 2025, Squire Patton Boggs received $330,000 to lobby officials in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on behalf of the RSS, according to lobbying reports. This marks the first time the RSS has hired lobbyists in the U.S., according to public records.

In September, the RSS marked 100 years since its founding in 1925. The organization was established to promote what critics and human rights groups describe as a Hindu state; its followers have been accused of targeting Muslims and other minorities with discrimination, harassment, and violence. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political party emerged from the RSS, and Modi himself was once a worker for the organization.

The RSS’s lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C., raise questions among experts on foreign influence operations about how the RSS has been able to conduct its activities without identifying as a foreign entity or without Squire Patton Boggs registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a 1938 law that requires transparency from representatives of foreign interests. Public records confirm that neither Squire Patton Boggs nor any other organization is registered as an agent for the RSS under FARA. It is unclear whether Squire Patton Boggs is required to register as a foreign agent of the RSS.

The RSS and Squire Patton Boggs did not respond to Prism’s requests for comment.

The paperwork—filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA), a transparency law for activities to influence the federal government—does not list the RSS as Squire Patton Boggs’ direct client. Rather, the client is State Street Strategies doing business as the lobbying firm One+ Strategies on behalf of the RSS.

In Squire Patton Boggs’ lobbying registration form for the RSS, the general lobbying issue is noted as foreign relations, and the specific lobbying issue is “U.S.-India bilateral relations.” The focus on relations between the two countries strongly suggests that the firm’s activities should be registered under FARA, experts told Prism.

“Registering under the LDA and not FARA really keeps this influence campaign in the shadows,” said Ben Freeman, director of the Democratizing Foreign Policy program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and a leading expert on lobbying and foreign influence in the U.S. “And so, we really don’t have much idea at all about what [the lobbyists] are doing for the RSS.”

In India, the RSS has grown its influence in part by providing social services for local communities through charity programs, schools, and environmental disaster relief. In the U.S., however, the group has been the subject of political and media scrutiny in recent years over its ties to Modi, whose Hindu nationalist, anti-Muslim politics have turned the secular democracy into an “electoral autocracy.”

Raqib Hameed Naik, the founder and executive director of the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, a D.C.-based think tank that researches political extremism, said the RSS’s lobbying activities in the U.S. could be part of a campaign to alter how it is perceived outside of India.

“The RSS might have become a mainstream force in Indian politics, but globally, it is still seen as a fascist paramilitary group,” he told Prism. “So what they’re trying to do right now is to invest in changing the perception of the policymakers.”

Who are the RSS’s lobbyists?

Over the past century, the RSS has grown from a small, fringe volunteer paramilitary group into the most influential right-wing Hindu organization in India. The early leaders of the all-male organization praised Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, and a member of the RSS assassinated Mahatma Gandhi in 1948. Today, RSS members participate in drills and marches at training camps, and critics say the group’s methods of mass mobilization and targeting of minorities are rooted in its fascist origins.

The RSS serves as the ideological fountainhead of the broader Sangh Parivar, a network of Hindu right-wing organizations encompassing education, social services, and labor. A few years after India’s independence from British colonial rule in 1947, the Sangh developed a political wing in order to enter electoral politics. In 1980, erstwhile members of the political wing formed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Critics accuse the RSS, the BJP, and its affiliates of instigating harassment and violence toward Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities. Notably, those groups led a campaign to build a Hindu temple at the site of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya that culminated in the destruction of the mosque by activists in 1992, triggering a series of communal riots that were among the deadliest in Indian history. Last year, Modi attended the consecration ceremony for the newly built temple.

Since Modi and the BJP’s ascent to power in 2014, Indians have witnessed major democratic backsliding and a cascade of anti-minority politics and policies. The RSS remains closely linked to the BJP: Several of the party’s top leaders, including Modi, emerged from the RSS’s rank and file. “Their only interest has always been love towards the nation,” Modi said of the RSS at a centenary event in October.

While U.S. nonprofits have spread the RSS’s ideology among Hindu communities domestically, the RSS has now turned its attention to lawmakers.

According to quarterly lobbying reports, Squire Patton Boggs received payments totaling $330,000 during the first three quarters of 2025 for its work with the RSS.

Four Squire Patton Boggs lobbyists are listed in the reports: Bradford Ellison, Ludmilla Kasulke, Bill Shuster, and Rebekah Sungala. Ellison and Kasulke have experience lobbying Congress on behalf of foreign governments: Ellison previously represented Ethiopia and Benin, and Kasulke has represented South Korea and the umbrella organization for the Syrian opposition, according to FARA filings. Shuster served as a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania from 2001 to 2019; Sungala was a congressional staffer in his office. Bill Shuster’s brother Bob Shuster is a co-founder of One+ Strategies, the firm listed in the disclosures as working on behalf of the RSS. Neither the lobbyists nor One+ Strategies responded to requests for comment.

Email communications obtained by Prism, along with an article in an RSS publication, shed light on how Squire Patton Boggs and One+ Strategies have engaged with the RSS this year.

On Jan. 16, Ellison reached out to Audrey Truschke, a historian and professor at Rutgers University–Newark. Truschke, who has extensively researched the Hindu right, was contacted as part of the lobbyists’ efforts to conduct research about the RSS, according to an email obtained by Prism.

“Our team was recently retained by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to educate lawmakers about RSS’s mission and impact, as the organization marks its centenary. This effort calls for us to develop a comprehensive understanding of RSS’s history, including historical controversies associated with the group,” Ellison wrote. “Accordingly, we would appreciate meeting with you in February to understand your perspective on the RSS’s history and current impact.”

Truschke’s reply was short. “Thanks for reaching out. Please let me know your status under FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) for this advocacy work.”

“I never heard back from them,” she told Prism.

In June, the Shuster brothers and Ellison were among the guests at an RSS event in Nagpur, India, where the group is headquartered. Neither the RSS nor local news reports indicated that the Shusters and Ellison are the RSS’s lobbyists.

The lobbyists visited an RSS training camp and met with members, according to an article in an RSS publication. The article called the visit “a significant moment in Indo-US civil society engagement, signaling growing interest among American policymakers in understanding India’s indigenous institutions beyond government and corporate corridors.” The article noted that the visit came weeks after a military conflict between India and Pakistan.

Also part of the “high-profile United States delegation,” according to the article, were Walter Russell Mead, a columnist at The Wall Street Journal, and Bill Drexel, a think tank specialist on U.S.-India relations. Mead and Drexel are both fellows at the Hudson Institute, a right-wing think tank based in Washington, D.C. Mead and Drexel did not respond to requests for comment.

The RSS also appears to have enlisted a pharmaceutical executive based in Massachusetts to help promote the group during its centenary.

The lobbying registration between Squire Patton Boggs, One+ Strategies, and the RSS lists Vivek Sharma as “an entity other than the client that contributes more than $5,000 to the lobbying activities in a quarterly period” and either participates in or supervises the registrant’s lobbying activities. Sharma is the executive chair of Cohance Lifesciences, a drug manufacturer based in Boston with major operations in India. The address given for Sharma on the form matches that of his company’s financial filing. Sharma has also been listed as a mentor of Ekal Vidyalaya, a U.S.-based nonprofit that reportedly has links to the Sangh Parivar and runs a network of schools in rural India that have been accused of imparting divisive teachings that preach Hindu superiority to children. Sharma did not respond to a request for comment.

In October, Jim Geraghty, a contributing columnist at The Washington Post, attended an RSS event in Nagpur marking the group’s 100th anniversary. Geraghty, who is a political correspondent for the conservative magazine The National Review, wrote in his column, “My trip was sponsored by the Hudson Institute and the Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies, whose president is affiliated with RSS.”

The Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS) is a U.S.-based nonprofit that regularly hosts events to “strengthen the U.S.-India partnership,” according to its website, featuring high-ranking Indian officials such as the country’s foreign minister and the ambassador to the U.S. FIIDS also brings together U.S. lawmakers to “underscore the deepening strategic and bilateral relationship between the two nations.” FIIDS is not registered under FARA.

The nonprofit’s president, Khanderao Kand, was reported as being a member of the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS), an organization that has been likened to being the RSS’s branch in the U.S. Kand also reportedly served as HSS’s national public relations coordinator.

Hudson Institute, FIIDS, and Kand did not respond to requests for comment.

The RSS’s lobbying efforts have raised concerns among multiple experts about whether the activities fall under the purview of FARA.

Legal questions over foreign lobbying status

After reviewing the lobbying disclosures, three experts on foreign influence in U.S. politics told Prism that per lobbying regulations, the RSS would be considered a foreign entity and Squire Patton Boggs should be registered as a foreign agent for the RSS.

The registration form under the LDA asks if there is any foreign entity that holds at least 20% equitable ownership in the client or “directly or indirectly, in whole or in major part, plans, supervises, controls, directs, finances or subsidizes activities of the client or any organization.” In Squire Patton Boggs’ registration, there is a check in the box next to “No,” despite the RSS employing One+ Strategies, the listed client, to act on its behalf.

“This is clearly, just unquestionably, a foreign entity as far as the LDA is concerned. They should have checked ‘yes’ in that foreign entities box,” said Freeman of the Quincy Institute. “What matters is who the ultimate client is. And the ultimate client here, according to this document, is the RSS, which is a foreign entity.”

Squire Patton Boggs did not respond to a question from Prism about why the firm had not listed RSS as a foreign entity.

Dan Auble, a senior researcher at OpenSecrets who oversees the watchdog group’s lobbying database, told Prism that according to LDA guidelines published by Congress, the RSS should disclose itself as a foreign entity. “The guide is actually quoting the law itself,” said Auble, who also directs OpenSecrets’ Foreign Lobby Watch program.

The section in the guidelines on “Listing Foreign Entities” provides more specific guidance on what constitutes an indirect client. “The purpose of the disclosure is to identify the interests of the foreign entity that may be operating behind the registrant,” the document explains.

“If the RSS in India is funding or controlling the lobbying effort, or if they are affiliated and have a direct interest, then there should be disclosure of [Squire Patton Boggs’] ties to a foreign entity,” Auble told Prism.

When Squire Patton Boggs registered as a lobbyist for the RSS under the LDA, the firm entered the code for foreign relations as the “general lobbying issue area.” The “specific lobbying issues (current and anticipated)” is “U.S.-India bilateral relations.” In the subsequent quarterly filings, however, the specific lobbying issue is to “introduce the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to U.S. officials.”

“My conclusion is that ‘U.S.-India bilateral relations’ is within the FARA rules. RSS should have been registered under FARA instead,” said James Thurber, distinguished professor of government emeritus at American University and a co-editor of the book, “Congress and Diaspora Politics: The Influence of Ethnic and Foreign Lobbying.”

Freeman agreed. “To me, what jumps out is that line in the registration statement where it does say their activities are U.S.-India bilateral relations,” he told Prism. “I can’t think of any exemption that they would fall under.”

Some firms registered under LDA can qualify for a FARA exemption. However, if a foreign government or a foreign political party is the principal beneficiary, this exemption does not apply. Because the disclosure mentions “U.S.-India bilateral relations” and the RSS has a close proximity to the ruling regime in India, Freeman said, “that raises a very important question of whether they should be registered under FARA and not the LDA for this work.”

The lobbying classifications matter, experts say, because registrants under FARA have to publicly disclose significantly more about which lawmakers they engage as well as other particulars, such as details of meetings, emails, texts, calls, receipts, transactions, and disbursements. Under the LDA, the RSS’s lobbyists do not need to disclose any such details.

The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, which administer the LDA, did not respond to requests for comment.

This is not the first time the lobbying activities of a Hindu nationalist organization have raised concerns over federal violations.

After operating in the U.S. for almost 30 years, Overseas Friends of the BJP-USA (OFBJP-USA) registered as a foreign agent of the BJP under FARA in 2020. OFBJP-USA has reportedly campaigned for the BJP, including during Indian elections. The group has also facilitated trips to the U.S. for BJP leaders, hosted them at events, and promoted them through social media initiatives.

In August 2020, an Indian news website reported that a member of OFBJP-USA criticized Joe Biden’s presidential campaign and his selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate. As questions were raised about the propriety of the member’s statement as a part of OFBJP-USA, the group clarified that his views did not reflect its own. Less than 10 days later, the group registered under FARA.

The Indian government, too, has hired lobbyists in Washington. India has long been represented by BGR Government Affairs, and this year, it contracted with two more lobbying firms. In April, the Indian Embassy signed a contract worth $1.8 million annually with SHW Partners. The firm’s activities for India include government relations and perception management, according to FARA filings.

Less than 10 days after President Donald Trump imposed a 50% tariff on India in August as alleged retaliation for India purchasing Russian oil during the Ukraine war, the Indian Embassy hired another lobbying firm, Mercury Public Affairs. The Indian government is paying Mercury $75,000 a month, per FARA filings, for services that include federal government relations, media relations, and paid advertising. The government of India did not respond to a request for comment about Squire Patton Boggs’ lobbying on “U.S.-India bilateral relations” on behalf of the RSS.

In February, the Trump administration took aim at FARA with a memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi that pared back enforcement of the law and disbanded the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force.

“The problem right now is that with Trump as the new president, he’s explicitly announced that he’s not going to actively enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act,” Thurber said. The Department of Justice, which administers FARA, did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite the RSS lobbyists’ efforts to change the group’s image among U.S. lawmakers, Naik, of the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, said the influence campaign could easily be challenged by decades of publicly available information about the RSS.

“Documentation of a century of all their activities is literally available to anyone,” he said.

“Dealers are navigating a new chapter of hyper-competition, where every VIN decision matters,” said Len Short, Executive Chairman of Lotlinx.","DETROIT (November 12, 2025) — Lotlinx, the auto industry’s first and only VIN Performance platform built to help dealers maximize profitability, announced today its Q3 2025 Quarterly Vincensus Report, the most comprehensive quarterly inventory report in the industry. Leveraging over 24 billion proprietary VIN-level data points and more than a decade of machine learning innovation, the report delivers unmatched insight into the state of the automotive retail market, including new and used vehicle performance, pricing trends, inventory risk, and consumer behavior. Click here to access the full Q3 Quarterly Vincensus Report.

Market Outlook:

The third quarter of 2025 presented a distorted view of the automotive market, driven by a last-minute rush for electric vehicles (EVs) ahead of an expiring federal tax credit. This surge, a 72% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase in new EV sales, represents a pull-forward of demand rather than organic growth, with EVs still comprising just over 5% of total Q3 sales across brands represented in Vincensus.

While overall new vehicle sales rose 11% QoQ and used sales increased 3%, the underlying data suggests a more price-sensitive and competitive landscape ahead. Inventory levels are stabilizing after years of volatility, exposing challenges for brands with older or mispriced vehicles. Lotlinx anticipates a highly competitive Q4, characterized by increased manufacturer incentives, deeper markdowns, and aggressive year-end sales events as automakers seek to clear aging 2025 model-year inventory.

Key Findings

Inventory and Pricing Trends

New vehicle day supply increased by 5 days QoQ to 62 days (up 1 day YoY)

Used vehicle day supply increased by 1 day QoQ to 40 days (up 4 days YoY)

Carryover for new vehicles decreased 2% QoQ to 52%; used increased 7% QoQ to 50%

Aged ending inventory decreased 3% QoQ to 42% for new vehicles and held steady at 48% for used

Units sold with a markdown increased by 1% QoQ for new vehicles and 3% QoQ for used

EV, Hybrid, and ICE Performance

New EV sales surged 72% QoQ, while hybrids rose 7% and ICE vehicles 9%

EVs made up just 5% of all sales, signaling that the surge is short-term and incentive-driven

New EV day supply dropped to 61 days and used EV day supply to 36 days — both below ICE averages

Average list price of sold new units: EVs $55,510; hybrids $44,100; ICEs $41,857

For used vehicles, EV prices fell 3% QoQ to $28,888, while ICE and hybrid prices remained stable

Market Dynamics and Competition

The stabilization of inventory has introduced new challenges, particularly for brands with aging 2025 stock

Dealers are expected to face the most aggressive pricing environment in years, with manufacturer incentives rising sharply to move inventory

Markdown strategies and real-time decisioning are becoming critical for profitability

Lotlinx Dealer Performance

Lotlinx dealers continued to outperform the broader market during Q3. On average, Lotlinx dealers had 1% less aged inventory for new vehicles and 4% less for used vehicles compared to the market. Additionally, 59% of new vehicle brands and 92% of used vehicle brands leveraging Lotlinx outperformed their respective market benchmarks.

“Dealers are navigating a new chapter of hyper-competition, where every VIN decision matters,” said Len Short, Executive Chairman of Lotlinx. “Our data shows that Lotlinx-powered dealers are winning by acting faster and smarter, using VIN-specific insights to reduce aging, optimize pricing, and preserve profitability, even as the market becomes more volatile.”

It first introduced the plan in December 2021 to produce batteries for its hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs). Batteries from the plant are set to power hybrid versions of the Camry, Corolla Cross, RAV4, and a yet-to-be-announced, all-electric, three-row-battery vehicle. The plant is producing hybrid batteries for factories in Kentucky and a Mazda and Toyota joint venture in Alabama.

“Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10bn in the US to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60bn,” said Ted Ogawa, president of Toyota Motor North America.

Toyota’s 11th US factory, on a 1,850-acre (749-hectare) site, will be able to produce 30 gigawatt-hours of energy annually at full capacity and house 14 battery production lines for plug-in hybrids and full EVs. It will eventually employ 5,000 workers.

Last month in Japan, US President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10bn investment in the United States.

“Go out and buy a Toyota,” said Trump, who has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and has imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest carmakers to move to full EVs, but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

“We know there is no single path to progress”, Ogawa said on Wednesday.

“That’s why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.”

Other car companies like Volkswagen have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits and eliminated penalties that incentivised EV sales.

US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event that the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under former US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

A $207 million is projected, along with as many as 1,200 jobs are expected, at an average salary of $172,000, state officials said.

Scout is backed by German automotive giant Volkswagen Group, which bought the Scout trademark in 2021. An incentives plan was approved at today’s meeting of the state Economic Investment Committee. Total state and local incentives are expected to be in the $50 million range, hinging on hitting jobs and investment targets.

The company’s plans to enter Charlotte were discussed at today’s meeting of the neighborhood business association, according to Tonya Wilson, president of the affiliated Plaza-Midwood Neighborhood Association and Clifton Castelloe, a longtime board member of the merchants group.

Gov. Josh Stein plans to attend an economic development announcement at 2 p.m. today at the Commonwealth development, where Scout is establishing offices. The Charlotte Ledger was first to report Scout’s interest in the site.

Scout has said it will invest $2 billion in the Blythewood, South Carolina, plant with a goal of making 200,000 vehicles annually once it is fully operational. The company has said it expects to start production in 2027 and eventually employ as many as 4,000 people.

“That’s kinda neat to have that kind of auto business in our neighborhood,” says Wilson, who owns the Wiloe Home & Gift store in Plaza-Midwood. “We are an evolving, established neighborhood that appreciates history and our small businesses and closeness as neighbors. We want anyone who comes here to be part of that.”

“We think it’s a great sign for neighborhood development and economic growth in our area,” says Castelloe, who with his wife Michelle owns the Moxie Mercantile shop in Plaza-Midwood. “We’re absolutely thrilled to welcome them.”

The company says it is planning to make electric SUVs called “Travelers” and “Terra” trucks priced at $60,000 or less. Plug-in hybrid versions of Scout’s models are also planned. Blythewood is about 70 miles south of Charlotte and the North Carolina border.

A $5 million training hub at Midlands Tech Northeast, a community college in the Columbia area, recently opened to help train workers for the new plant. More than 14,000 people have sent emails expressing interest in working at Scout, Tim Hardee, president of South Carolina’s Technical College system, told The State newspaper in Columbia this week.

Scout CEO Scott Keogh told the Carolina Business Review TV program in Charlotte that the company’s headquarters could have “upwards of 1,000 high-paying jobs.” He is a veteran VW executive.

Elimination of tax incentives for electric vehicles and relatively high vehicle prices has prompted General Motors and other manufacturers to pull back on some of their EV plans. But Scout says it anticipated the changes and is ready to compete as more consumers favor EVs over gas-powered vehicles.

“We’re able to operate in this current environment because we’re set from the ground up to build in America, at our new facility in Blythewood, South Carolina,” Keogh told Car and Driver in September.

“Our intent always was exactly what we are seeing now with the administration and everything else. … Our product is coming in 2027 and 2028. The incentives were always going away in 2032. So there’s no way in the world we would build a so-called 50-year factory like we are in Blythewood based on a four-year window.”

Scout plans to sell vehicles directly to consumers, without a dealer network, which has sparked some lawsuits from some trade associations. North Carolina lawmakers have shown limited interest in allowing manufacturers to sell cars without dealer involvement, with the exception of EV pioneer Tesla.

Beyond its assembly plant, Scout this year announced a $300 million investment for a “supplier park” for smaller parts manufacturers to service the South Carolina factory.

Volkswagen Group had revenue of $353 billion in 2024. It sells more cars globally than any other company except Toyota.

The Commonwealth development is owned by Charlotte developer Crosland Southeast and asset manager Nuveen Real Estate, which is a subsidiary of TIAA. Crosland Southeast bought the mostly undeveloped 12-acre site in 2020 from a local real estate investor. It has built the Rowe apartment development there.

Jon Husted, R-Ohio, on Newsmax Wednesday praised Republicans and President Donald Trump for delivering tax relief, reviving American energy production, and lowering gas prices, saying those results are now clear for working families.

Husted said on “National Report” that Republicans “gave working families the largest tax cut they’ve ever had in American history … eliminated taxes on tips and overtime [and] cut taxes on Social Security.”

He added, “So we’re letting people keep more of what they earn.”

Husted also credited renewed energy production for easing costs at the pump.

“One of the things you see dramatically gone down since last year are gas prices because we eliminated all the [former President Joe] Biden-era prohibitions on drilling and so forth on energy,” Husted said.

Husted argued that Republicans have kept their promises, while Democrats “didn’t accomplish anything other than put people through 43 days of pain and unnecessary suffering” during the recent government shutdown.

“We finally, as Republicans, did what we said we would do,” he said.

Husted also criticized Democratic Party leadership, saying Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his allies “got the Democrats into a shutdown that they could not get their way out of.”

He said it took “more moderate Democrats” to cross over and work with Republicans to reopen the government.

“The Democrats have been taken over by the radical left,” Husted said.

“Since Obamacare was put in place, healthcare inflation has been the number one driver of inflation in this country,” he added. “And the Democrats put that in place, not Republicans.”

He argued that Republicans can now show they are the party of affordability.

“We want to make healthcare more affordable,” Husted said. “We want to empower consumers, stop sending payments directly to insurance companies, and give consumers the ability to shop for their healthcare and drive down the cost.”

Husted said the GOP’s record proves its economic approach works.

“We’re responsible,” he said.

“We’re letting people keep more of what they earn. We’re attacking the bad policies that Democrats put in place and showing that there’s a pathway forward to make things more affordable.”

Meeting that demand while reducing emissions requires expanding every viable source of clean, firm energy. Nuclear power, with its ability to deliver reliable, firm zero-carbon electricity and heat at scale and speed, remains indispensable to that strategy.

At COP28 in Dubai, 22 nations pledged under the Net-Zero Nuclear (NZN) initiative to work toward tripling global nuclear capacity by 2050, marking a historic recognition of nuclear energy’s central role in achieving a clean energy future. Two years on, as the world attends COP30 in Belém, that commitment offers an opportunity to take stock of progress made.

From Washington to Brussels, governments are increasingly placing nuclear energy at the heart of their clean energy and industrial strategies. Yet progress since COP29 toward the NZN goal continues to face persistent hurdles, chiefly around financing, regulatory modernization, and supply chain readiness.

U.S. leads with ambitious federal push for nuclear expansion and innovation

The United States has made nuclear energy a pillar of its domestic and international climate and energy policy. The Trump 2.0 Administration’s “Make Atoms Great Again” agenda has reaffirmed the federal government’s commitment to scaling the sector, with executive orders aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050. The policy focus includes:

Accelerating the licensing and construction of new reactors, including advanced and small modular designs;

Modernizing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to accommodate next-generation technologies while maintaining independence and transparency;

Strengthening U.S. nuclear fuel supply chains to reduce reliance on foreign enrichment;

Expanding reactor exports to bolster U.S. global competitiveness; and

Building the American nuclear workforce to meet the growing demand for skilled engineers and operators.

These steps mark a clear ambition to deploy nuclear energy but, as we’ve previously outlined, achieving the Administration’s targets will require a far more muscular approach to deployment and financing. While the retention of key tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act is valuable, large-scale deployment will not happen without deeper federal involvement to reduce risk, streamline project delivery, and promote investment.

Specifically, the U.S. needs to focus on establishing clear “orderbooks” of standardized reactor builds that enable cost reductions through economies of scale, rather than focusing on isolated projects. Federal cost-overrun insurance and expanded use of tools like loan guarantees and power purchase agreements could help de-risk early projects. Without these measures, the Administration’s goal of quadrupling U.S. nuclear capacity will remain aspirational. Beyond policy, the U.S. Army’s plan to deploy microreactors to power domestic bases illustrates nuclear energy’s growing appeal for energy security and resilience applications.

In a historic first, Palisades nuclear plant set to restart operation

The Holtec Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan is entering the final phase of a historic restart, with commercial operations expected by late 2025. Following NRC approval and fuel delivery, Palisades will become the first U.S. nuclear plant ever restarted from decommissioning.

This milestone underscores the value of extending and revitalizing existing nuclear assets, opening new possibilities for other prematurely shuttered plants.

Europe’s political realignment anchors nuclear as key part of its energy strategy

Across Europe, political attitudes toward nuclear power are shifting rapidly. Once considered peripheral, nuclear energy is now seen as essential for decarbonization, competitiveness, and energy security.

The European Nuclear Alliance among Member States creates a powerful bloc pushing for technology-neutral policies across EU institutions. Even Germany’s participation as an observer marks a tentative but notable potential recalibration in its stance toward EU-wide nuclear policymaking.

Recent policy updates are also laying the foundation for a European nuclear resurgence:

Revised State Aid Rules from the European Commission have clarified how Member States can support nuclear energy through subsidies, contracts-for-difference (CfDs), and other mechanisms, recognizing nuclear’s strategic value to the bloc.

The Programme for Nuclear Energy (PINC) update assesses national commitments to deploy at least 60 GW of new large-scale nuclear capacity by 2050, which could be supplemented by dozens of gigawatts of SMR capacity depending on market conditions (See our recommendations here).

The European Industrial Alliance on SMRs released its Strategic Action Plan, advancing standardization, regulatory alignment, and supply chain development to accelerate deployment.

Meanwhile, the UK’s Final Investment Decision on Sizewell C and its selection of the Rolls-Royce SMR design for further development signal that Europe’s nuclear ambitions are translating into action.

Together, these steps are laying the foundation for nuclear energy to fulfill its role in delivering a secure, low-carbon energy mix across Europe, but concrete and actionable plans on financing, bolstering supply chains, readying the workforce, and standardizing regulatory frameworks are crucial to building on this momentum.

COP30 ambitions

At COP30, global ambitions to triple nuclear capacity remain strong, but implementation and financing lag behind political momentum. The past year has seen a remarkable convergence of political will in both the U.S. and Europe. The challenge now is to translate commitments into concrete deployments, ensure fit-for-purpose regulatory environments, and mobilize capital at scale.

With climate finance again high on the COP agenda, world leaders have an opportunity to anchor nuclear energy within broader climate investment frameworks, helping nations secure reliable, zero-carbon power while strengthening economic resilience.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/03150558/nuclear-playbook.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:45.772289

This evolution highlights an important principle: tax incentives should be temporary, targeted, and tied to performance, not permanent giveaways.","One of COP 30’s top priorities is boosting climate finance from both governments and private investors. Why is this especially crucial for emerging and developing economies?

Despite record-high investment in renewable energy last year, emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) face a USD 2.2 trillion financing gap each year through 2030 to meet their goals under the Paris Agreement. Countries need to attract investments that can lower emissions while expanding access to affordable energy and creating jobs. Unlike major emerging economies, such as China, India, or Brazil, which attract the majority of global renewable energy investment, the climate transition of many lower-income EMDEs continue to be held back by limited access to affordable finance, perceived country or sector-related risks, and weaker policy frameworks.

In response, mobilizing both public and private finance is crucial. Public financial support is needed to crowd in larger private investment, such as through targeted subsidies including incentives, budget transfers, concessional lending, and market mechanisms that reduce investment risks. This must go hand in hand with phasing out inefficient tax incentives for fossil fuels to level the playing field and encourage a shift by consumers and investors toward less polluting alternatives. Raising taxes on fossil fuels to reflect their social costs—through excise or carbon taxes can also accelerate the transition in an economically efficient way, provided that protections are in place for vulnerable groups.

What have governments already committed to in terms of renewable energy capacity?

At COP 28, 133 governments agreed to the collective goal to triple the world’s installed renewable energy generation capacity by 2030, taking into consideration different starting points and national circumstances. Limited fiscal space and rising debt require that public support be used strategically such as by lowering investment financing costs. The global FfD4 process has underscored the mounting pressure on public budgets and the need for more efficient deployment of resources.

Without this combination of public and private finance, emerging and developing economies cannot accelerate the energy transition in line with the COP 28 commitment.

What mechanisms at COP 30 could help scale green investment and turn commitments into action?

COP 30 has been framed by the Brazilian Presidency as a COP for implementation, where countries work to turn their climate commitments into action. This could be achieved through the Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T, which sets out a plan for how climate finance from all sources can be scaled up to USD 1.3 trillion annually by 2035.

However, as IISD has noted, while the Baku to Belém Roadmap recognizes that phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies, including fossil fuel subsidies, can have long-term benefits, these points are not reflected in recommendations. This means we risk COP 30 becoming a missed opportunity for redirecting public finance from fossil fuels to renewables.

Ambitious reforms also require financial backing. At COP 30, a decision on Article 2.1(c) (the Paris Agreement’s goal on aligning financial flows with climate-resilient, low-carbon development pathways) is expected. For the past three years, the Sharm el-Sheikh dialogue on Article 2.1(c) has taken place, leading to greater understanding of what the Article means. However, more work remains to be done, and COP 30 could establish negotiations towards a framework for Article 2.1(c), perhaps under a work programme. A decision on Article 2.1(c) could contain a commitment to phase out public finance for fossil fuels to ensure investment is climate compatible.

COP 30 could also move the dial on strengthening public finances and growing governments’ fiscal space for climate action, for example through advancing the conversation on ambitious debt relief.

Tax policy is one tool for leveraging public resources to scale private investment. What role can the tax incentives play towards closing the green investment gap, especially in emerging and developing economies?

Tax incentives that target green investment, if strategically designed, can help lower the cost of capital for climate projects, unlocking private finance and accelerating renewable energy deployment. They already have in countries that use them well.

Designing strategically means shifting away from broad profit-based tax holidays toward incentives that address real investment constraints. Targeted tools like allowing businesses to write off the cost of renewable energy capital faster (“accelerated depreciation”), partial relief from import duties for certified green technologies, or time-limited tax credits for investment in energy grids and storage can really move the dial on climate projects through reducing upfront and operating costs.

What other levers should governments be using to mobilize private finance?

Incentives work best as part of a broader policy mix that includes planning, regulation, and infrastructure development. Without clear energy targets, ready energy grids, and streamlined permitting for energy projects, even generous incentives will fail to attract investment.

Tax policies are only one tool among many.

Countries also use many non-tax instruments to encourage clean energy investment, particularly for technologies that are already cost competitive, such as solar and onshore wind. Market-based mechanisms can provide the certainty that investors need without a large net impact on public finances.

These include measures that stabilize prices such as feed in premiums, contracts for difference, and auctions for long term power purchase agreements. Domestic and international public financing can reduce the high cost of capital that is common in many EMDEs. While some of these mechanisms can be more complex to administer than broad based tax incentives, they have proven effective in large EMDEs that are rapidly scaling up clean energy including Brazil, China, India, and Vietnam.

Policy stability and an enabling regulatory environment are also key to attracting investment.

How can countries ensure that green tax incentives achieve results for climate without eroding the tax base unnecessarily?

Our research shows that tax incentives deliver the strongest results in sectors with high upfront costs, such as early-stage renewables, storage, industrial efficiency, and mini-grids, rather than in mature technologies that already attract private investment. Focusing on these areas is where countries are most likely to see tangible results.

Countries can ensure that green tax incentives support climate goals without undermining revenues by focusing on efficiency, effectiveness, and targeting. Incentives should directly address barriers such as high upfront costs or technology risks, be time-bound and performance-linked, and include clear monitoring and review mechanisms.

Shifting from broad profit-based tax holidays to cost-based measures such as accelerated depreciation, which I explained earlier, or investment tax credits, makes sure the support catalyzes new investment rather than rewarding activity that would occur anyway. This is a strategic use of public resources, maximizing climate impact while maintaining fiscal sustainability.

Additionally, one of the key elements is tying tax incentives to real economic outcomes, like new capacity or job creation; or to environmental goals, with priority going to projects that fit a national green taxonomy and meet environmental and community consent standards.

Transparency throughout the process is also essential. Tax expenditure reporting at the economy-wide level helps governments track the fiscal cost of incentives by clearly presenting revenue forgone across sectors and bring other benefits. The Coalition on Tax Expenditures Reform launched by IISD and partners seeks to support countries in increasing reporting and evaluation of incentives.

You analyzed 35 different countries for the report ""The Use of Green Tax Incentives for Renewable Energy Deployment."" What trends did you spot in terms of countries’ use of tax incentives to drive green investment?

Our analysis reflects trends among smaller emerging and developing economies (excluding larger emerging economies such as China, India, or Brazil), where governments are increasingly using tax incentives to attract private investment into clean energy but are often challenged by limited fiscal space, weak targeting, and inconsistent implementation.

These countries continue to rely on profit-based tax holidays, which tend to be less effective in stimulating renewable energy investment. These incentives only apply once firms become profitable, yet in many lower-income markets, renewable projects often face long development timelines, grid connection delays, and high financing costs, which postpone or reduce taxable profits.

However, we also observe a gradual shift toward targeted, cost-based measures, with more countries adopting investment tax credits, accelerated depreciation, VAT exemptions and import duty relief for renewable energy components—policies that are more likely to be cost effective and better aligned with climate objectives.

What did you find on the design of these tax incentives?

The design of these tax incentives varies widely, and policy fragmentation remains a major issue. In many countries, incentives are scattered across investment laws, tax codes and special economic zone legislation, creating complexity for investors, and tax administration, and increasing the risk of overlapping or duplicate incentives. Very few countries include clear eligibility criteria, performance conditions or sunset clauses.

Most incentives we analyzed were open-ended and did not require any reporting on energy generation, job creation or emissions reductions. Without reporting requirements, governments have no reliable basis to assess whether tax incentives are delivering value for money or contributing to climate and development goals. As a result, it becomes difficult to evaluate tax expenditures, compare their cost-effectiveness against other policy tools, or justify their continuation when public finances already are squeezed.

Fresh data shows that, at the global scale, investment in renewable technologies and projects reached a record. To what extent have tax reforms helped make that happen, and what can EMDEs learn from it?

Indeed, global investment in renewable energy reached a record USD 2.1 trillion in 2024, up 11 percent from the previous year. Much of this growth came from large emerging economies.

China alone accounted for over one-third of global clean energy investment in 2024, and India is consistently among the top ten countries for renewable energy investment.

While it is difficult to isolate the specific impact of tax incentives, countries that combine fiscal measures with broader policy frameworks such as clear renewable energy targets, grid investments, and stable power purchase mechanisms tend to attract the highest levels of renewable energy investment. This has been an instrumental strategy in China, the European Union, and the United States, where extensive renewable energy support measures are in place.

Other successful strategies include India, which used accelerated depreciation, GST reductions for renewable components, and tax holidays in earlier phases to rapidly scale wind and solar, and South Africa introduced a 125 percent tax deduction for businesses investing in renewables, helping unlock new private-sector projects during its energy crisis. This measure complements the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme, which awards long-term power purchase agreements through competitive auctions to provide investment certainty. Together with other renewable energy fiscal policies, these initiatives illustrate how combining fiscal incentives with clear procurement frameworks can effectively mobilize private investment and advance broader development goals.

The United States showed how powerful tax incentives can be when combined with industrial strategy through the Inflation Reduction Act, which used production and investment tax credits to crowd in manufacturing and deployment.

The global trend also shows that successful countries adapt their tax incentives over time. China initially relied heavily on VAT rebates and tax holidays to build its solar manufacturing base but has gradually phased these out as the industry became globally competitive. India has taken a similar path unwinding broad tax breaks as its renewables market matured and shifting toward more targeted measures, like reverse auctions for deployment of renewables and production linked incentives, viability gap funding, and concessional lending for manufacturing.

This evolution highlights an important principle: tax incentives should be temporary, targeted, and tied to performance, not permanent giveaways. For emerging and developing economies, this is especially critical given limited fiscal space and competing public priorities. Incentives must therefore be designed to catalyze private investment without compromising revenue sustainability, ensuring that scarce public resources are used efficiently and can continue to support essential development and social spending.",https://www.iisd.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2025-11/solar-energy-kenya.jpg?itok=78Agcr4K,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:49.261652

The event was held nearly four years after Toyota unveiled plans to build a hybrid and electric battery factory on an 1,800-acre megasite near the small Randolph County town of Liberty, about 20 miles south of Greensboro. The automaker started its first production line in January and shipped its first car batteries from the Liberty facility in the spring.

Toyota says it currently employs around 2,500 workers and runs four hybrid battery production lines at the facility. Company officials say that by 2034 the local headcount should exceed 5,000.

The site is the largest economic project North Carolina has ever backed with state incentives, in terms of capital investment. Under its job development investment grant, Toyota targets spending $13.9 billion on the facility. Toyota aims to eventually operate 14 lithium-ion battery production lines across seven buildings at the site called Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina. Per its grant, Toyota must pay workers an average wage of at least $62,234.

Between state and local incentives, Toyota is poised to receive around $439 million in payroll tax breaks if it meets its minimum investment and job creation targets by 2029.

Specific production lines will be tailored to support hybrid, plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles. Toyota has prioritized hybrid vehicles over fully-electric cars — both globally and at its North Carolina factory — a decision company officials say has been advantageous as electric vehicle demand in recent years has weakened and federal EV tax credits ended this year under the Republican-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“We’ll follow market demand,” said Don Stewart, president of Toyota North Carolina.

Toyota shipped its first hybrid batteries to a Mazda Toyota plant in Huntsville, Alabama for the Corolla Cross SUV. It also supplies batteries for the Camry in Georgetown, Kentucky, and will eventually send them to Canada for the RAV4.

Among the speakers in Randolph County were Gov. Josh Stein, U.S. Sen. Ted Budd, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.

During the ceremony, Toyota announced it would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, a move Duffy credited to President Donald Trump’s trade policy approach. “President Trump has asked the world to make investments in America, because when companies invest in America, that means great American jobs,” he said.

Toyota officials later told reporters they were not aware of how much, if any, of this additional Toyota spending will be in North Carolina.

However, the SPS case suggests an additional seven exajoules (EJ) of solar will be in operation by 2040, and an additional 13EJ by 2050, compared to the CPS case.
Growing electricity demand The increasing cost-competitiveness of solar PV comes as the world’s energy demand is likely to grow and change.
“Data centres are an important driver, especially in the US, where they account for more than 50% of demand growth in the next decade,” explained Cozzi.
While they will only account for less than 10% of global electricity demand growth between 2024 and 2030, the doubling of consumption is a striking trend.","“Our world is thirsty for energy,” Birol said. “Demand for energy services and electrification will increase, but we’re seeing new driving countries coming into the mix. Slowly but surely, China will be replaced by India, Southeast Asia, Latin America and a few other emerging countries.

“None of these countries alone will replace China, but together they will be the drives of global energy demand growth in the years to come.”

Unsurprisingly, solar PV looks set to be a key component in meeting this shifting energy demand in the years to come.

The IEA report sets out four scenarios, which Birol highlighted are not forecasts, but potential scenarios, that could determine global power demand and usage: the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), the least ambitious scenario that takes into account policies and regulations already in place in the energy sector; the Stated Policies Scenario (SPS), which takes into account policies that have been announced but not yet implemented; the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, which includes measures necessary to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2025; and the Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS), which provides a roadmap to achieve universal access to electricity and clean cooking.

The graphs below demonstrate the potential energy mix, for selected technologies, in both the CPS and SPS cases, with oil set to lead the world in energy generation in both cases. However, the SPS case suggests an additional seven exajoules (EJ) of solar will be in operation by 2040, and an additional 13EJ by 2050, compared to the CPS case. In both scenarios, the world’s solar generation is expected to outpace its combined wind and hydro generation by 2050.

A key driving force behind this trend will be the continued low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for the solar sector. The report notes that, since 2010, the LCOE of solar PV has fallen by 90%, in line with a 90% decline in battery energy storage systems (BESS) and greater than the 70% decline in wind. Between 2024 and 2035, the IEA report expects solar costs to decline by a further 40%, compared to 30% for BESS and 10% for wind, suggesting that solar PV will continue to be the most cost-effective form of electricity generation in the decade to come.

Crucially, the report adds that in the SPS case, the projected cost for new solar PV and wind projects have “similar or lower average generation costs” than new coal, gas and nuclear projects in the US, EU and China, suggesting that renewables will soon be on par with conventional fossil fuels in regions with some of the largest energy generation systems in the world.

The report also notes that the co-location of BESS and solar PV is likely to be the most financially viable clean energy technology in the years to come, which echoes a sentiment expressed by others in the sector. The rapid deployment of PV capacity has led to grid curtailment challenges and price collapses in several markets, and many commentators have suggested that better integration of BESS can help sidestep grid issues and improve the bankability of solar projects.

Indeed, the IEA report notes that, by 2035, pairing solar PV with a 4-hour BESS will be “more competitive than standalone PV in major markets, as the added value of dispatchability outweighs the additional cost”.

Growing electricity demand

The increasing cost-competitiveness of solar PV comes as the world’s energy demand is likely to grow and change. The report notes that in the CPS scenario, total energy demand will grow by 14% by 2035, while in the SPS scenario it will grow by 8% by the same year, and Laura Cozzi, IEA director of sustainability, technology and outlooks, said today that in all scenarios, demand for electricity “accelerates significantly”.

“Electricity demand growth from now to 2035 is nearly identical in our two SPS scenarios [to] 10,000TWh, [which is] the electricity that is consumed today in the US, Canada, all of Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia,” said Cozzi. “This will be added in just ten years, and is a very big shift that will demand a lot of investments and planning.”

“We can comfortably say that the age of electricity has arrived,” added Birol, who went on to suggest that the “spectacular” growth in energy demand could create opportunities for the solar sector in particular, as many countries with growing electricity demand have significant potential for new solar deployments.

“Solar is going to play a pivotal role,” he said. “It is also important to see that the bulk of the electricity demand growth will come from the countries where we see a huge amount of solar radiation—they are solar-rich countries—and we see solar electricity playing an important role here, together with other renewables, such as wind, geothermal and hydropower.”

A combination of an ageing and declining population in China will also limit the growth of electricity demand. The report notes that, between 2010 and 2024, China’s total final energy consumption increased by over 2EJ; this is projected to fall to less than 1EJ between 2024 and 2035 in the SPS case, and then decline into the negative between 2035 and 2050.

The decline is even more stark in the “advanced economies” category, which saw negligible year-on-year increases in final energy consumption between 2000 and 2010, and has seen year-on-year declines in energy consumption since 2010, which the IEA notes could persist until 2050 in the SPS case.

Data centres an ‘important driver’ of power demand

The report’s authors also highlighted that data centres are likely to be significant contributors to changing energy demand; this year, the world is expected to invest US$580 billion into data centres, compared to US$540 billion in oil.

“Data centres are an important driver, especially in the US, where they account for more than 50% of demand growth in the next decade,” explained Cozzi. The report adds that globally, data centre electricity consumption is expected to double by 2030. While they will only account for less than 10% of global electricity demand growth between 2024 and 2030, the doubling of consumption is a striking trend.

The graphs above, from the IEA, show how the US and advanced economies will drive electricity demand growth from data centres in the next five years for the SPS case, and how data centres will see greater growth in electricity demand than sectors such as heating, which in this case refers to space and water heating in buildings.

The IEA report notes that, in the SPS case, renewable power will account for 45% of the growth in electricity supply to meet data centre demand through to 2035, totalling nearly 40TWh. This percentage is slightly power in the CPS case, of just 40%, but this is still a larger percentage than any other fuel type.

Solar under-production

While the report points to several examples of significant potential for growth in the renewable energy industry in general, and the solar sector in particular, it notes that current economic systems do not facilitate the kind of growth in renewable energy deployment necessary to meet the more ambitious scenarios.

The report points to “significant surplus capacity” for module manufacturing in China, which has contributed to a downturn in both module manufacturers’ profits and significant reductions in manufacturing output. The IEA report notes that, in 2024, Chinese module manufacturers had a nameplate production capacity of over 1,000GW, accounting for the majority of the world’s nameplate production capacity, but actually produced closer to 600GW. The same trend is true for other clean energy technologies—battery cells saw production drop to less than half of its nameplate capacity—and this highlights the challenges associated with generating profits in the current economic climate.

“Market forces alone are not going to deliver that resilience and diversity that we need [in supply chains],” said IEA chief economist Tim Gould during the launch of the report. “There is a need for coordinated, determined policy action to enhance preparedness against potential disruptions, but also to build up new partnerships and projects that diversify supply chains more quickly, and this will continue to be a very important focus for the IEA.”

Cozzi noted that there are “at least 42 countries” currently implementing or changing energy regulations to better position renewables to deliver profits in the coming years, and Birol explained that challenges in “the political domain” will need to be overcome in order to meet some of the world’s more ambitious clean energy deployment targets as the 2050 goals loom ever larger.

“When we look at climate change, I see two trends, both of them in the political domain,” said Birol. “I talked with several government leaders, business leaders and others, and I see that the priority given to climate change at the national level is at a decline in most cases. At the same time, of course, we know that 2024 was the hottest year in history. The current policy scenario is almost in line with a [temperature rise] of three degrees Celsius.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iea.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 14:03:13.144569

Along with lowering energy bills, these changes help make your home more comfortable inside. Energy efficiency improvements eligible for both the federal tax credits and Energy Trust incentives include:

Insulation: Adding or updating insulation on your attic, walls and floors can keep your heated or cooled air inside, meaning your system doesn’t have to work as hard.

Windows: Replacing older windows with energy efficient ones can keep your home more comfortable by keeping the air in and preventing drafts.

Heating and cooling: Heating and cooling your home is likely one of your biggest home energy expenses, so upgrading to modern, energy efficient units like heat pumps are a great way to keep energy costs low.

Water heating: Switching from a traditional water heater to a more efficient heat pump water heater uses much less energy to heat your water (often the second largest energy expense after heating and cooling).

Home energy audit: Credits can cover the cost of a professional energy “check-up” for your home. During the audit, an energy auditor uses tools to monitor temperature and moisture in your home and advises on the best upgrades to make, where your home is using energy efficiently and where energy may be wasted.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement federal tax credit offers two separate caps for tax credits, allowing homeowners to claim a total of up to $3,200 on their 2026 taxes from projects finished before December 31, 2025. The general cap with a maximum of $1,200, covers upgrades like insulation, windows, doors and home energy audits. Additionally, there’s a separate cap of $2,000 for installing an electric heat pump or heat pump water heater.

To claim the federal tax credits when filing a 2025 tax return, homeowners must have receipts and the manufacturer’s certification statements for all upgraded products. The process involves filling out a Form 5695 through the IRS website or tax prep software and filling in the details of energy-efficient improvements made at home in 2025 that qualify. Afterward, consult a tax professional to ensure everything is correct and ensure you’re able to qualify for as many savings as you’re eligible to claim.

Energy Trust does not give tax advice. Consult your tax professional for current information on credits available and how to apply.

Think of it as bringing together great minds, passionate about providing safe drinking water, wastewater services, and more from around North Carolina.

Let’s set the scene: The convention center was transformed with signs featuring large arrows directing attendees to classrooms and various halls to hear from speakers. In the main exhibition hall, rows of booths snaked through the room, each focusing on a different aspect of water. In addition to the numerous opportunities to meet other like-minded water professionals, several competitions were held among municipalities, including ""Best Tasting Water,"" Hydrant Hysteria, and Pipe Tapping

Of course, our Raleigh Water teams participated in the friendly challenges, and here’s how we ranked:

Hydrant Hysteria:

A fast-paced competition where two-member teams race to assemble a specific hydrant as quickly as possible. Teams are also judged on whether all parts are assembled correctly and function properly. Yes, a loose bolt can cost your team precious time.

This year, Raleigh Water’s women’s team was coached by Meriam Manuel, a five-year veteran of the competition, though this was her first time coaching. The two-person team consisted of Jennifer Anderson, who has participated for three years, and Sarah Calverley, a rookie this year. The women’s team placed second.

The men’s team was led by Josh Bennett, who has competed for two years and was also coaching for the first time. The team included Jeffrey Tennant, returning for his second year, and Jason Talton, a first-time competitor. The men’s team placed third.

Pipe Tapping:

In this timed competition, teams of three workers and one coach compete to tap a pressurized ductile iron pipe and install a water service line.

Raleigh Water’s team consisted of Kyle Bates (first-year competitor), Myles Dawson, Ricky Shanks (both returning for a second year), and coach Jeremy Isgrigg, who has been with Raleigh Water since 2005. The men’s team placed third with a time of 2:18.3.

Isgrigg was proud of his team, saying, ""Every team always puts in so much effort. It’s clear to see that many members put in double duty outside of their everyday work to commit to the team and practice, going above and beyond.”

Best Tasting Water Competition:

Utilities submitted two-liter water samples drawn from their distribution systems for judges to taste and evaluate against other utilities.

This year, the E.M. Johnson Water Treatment Plant secured third place in the state water-tasting competition.

Raleigh Water is dedicated to providing our customers with the highest standards of water quality, and we are proud of the hard work from our teams this year. Congratulations to all!",https://raleighnc.govcover.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 15:03:39.197106

FERC granted the requested relief on August 28, 2025, and reauthorized the project under NGA section 7.
The states’ changed position on the permits after rejecting prior applications made by Transco in 2018, 2019 and 2020, may portend a broader energy and environmental policy shift for several converging reasons.
These include a surging demand for energy in the Northeast, forecasted grid reliability concerns in New York and historically high electricity prices in New Jersey.
However, project opponents may try to challenge state-issued permits required for FERC-approved natural gas infrastructure, akin to a recent challenge to a Louisiana-issued Coastal Use Permit received by a liquefied natural gas terminal developer with FERC NGA section 3 authorization.","On November 7, 2025, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) reversed their prior positions and approved Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 401 Water Quality Certifications and other environmental permits for the Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Company’s (Transco) Northeast Supply Enhancement Project (NESE). NESE is a 25-mile natural gas pipeline expansion project certificated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that is intended to deliver 400,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas produced in Pennsylvania to local distribution company customers in New York City through new facilities in Middlesex County, New Jersey and an underwater segment traversing the Raritan and Lower New York Bays.

NESE initially received a certificate of public convenience and necessity from FERC for the project in 2019 under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), but its project sponsor ultimately canceled the project without initiating construction due to an inability to secure CWA and flood hazard permits from New York and New Jersey that were required by FERC. In 2025, following the President’s declaration of an Energy Emergency in Executive Order No. 14156 (E.O. 14156), Transco applied to reinstate the 2019 certificate, relying on FERC’s prior environmental analysis. FERC granted the requested relief on August 28, 2025, and reauthorized the project under NGA section 7.

The states’ changed position on the permits after rejecting prior applications made by Transco in 2018, 2019 and 2020, may portend a broader energy and environmental policy shift for several converging reasons. These include a surging demand for energy in the Northeast, forecasted grid reliability concerns in New York and historically high electricity prices in New Jersey. New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, stated that the NYSDEC’s decision is consistent with her administration’s “all of the above approach” to addressing grid reliability and affordability. State officials also may be concerned about future actions by the federal government to force infrastructure development in the Northeast region in line with statements made in E.O. 14156, and seek to take greater control to maintain a level of state autonomy for federally permitted projects. Additional Northeast pipeline projects are anticipated to materialize.

Toyota opens its first EV battery plant in the US

After the first batteries rolled off the production line at its new facility in Liberty, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Toyota said today marks a “pivotal moment” in the company’s history. The facility is Toyota’s 11th plant in the US and its first battery plant outside of Japan.

Toyota first announced plans to build EV batteries in the US almost four years ago. The nearly $14 billion facility will create up to 5,100 jobs in the area.

In addition, the Japanese auto giant announced plans to invest an additional $10 billion in its US operations over the next five years. Since it first arrived in the US nearly 70 years ago, Toyota has invested close to $60 billion.

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first US battery plant and additional US investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” Toyota Motor North America’s CEO, Ted Ogawa, said at the event.

The mega site spans 1,850 acres, or about the size of 121 football fields, and can produce up to 30 GWh annually. Toyota will use the hub to develop and build lithium-ion batteries for its growing lineup of “electrified” vehicles, including battery electric (EV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and hybrid (HEV) models.

Batteries from the plant will power the new Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and Toyota’s yet-to-be-announced three-row electric SUV.

The North Carolina battery plant houses 14 production lines, but Toyota said it plans to add more to the facility by 2030.

Toyota is already shipping HEV modules to its plant in Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama. It currently assembles 11 HEVs and PHEVs in the US.

Although Toyota only offers two battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the US, the bZ SUV and Lexus RZ, it will add several more over the next few months, including the CH-R and bZ Woodland.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Toyota-EV-sales-crash-2.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-12 13:03:50.556935

In addition, the company throughout November will provide another $500,000 to at least 60 feeding programs statewide amid funding uncertainties as colder weather and the holiday season approaches

Since 2021, Duke Energy and the Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are contributing $100,000 to the One SC Fund recently activated by Gov. Henry McMaster to support food banks across the state.

Why it matters: As colder weather and the holidays approach, many South Carolina families turn to assistance programs that help support those facing hunger. But those programs are facing challenges of their own to support this tremendous need. That is why it is important to support the organizations that do this great work.

What they are saying

Gov. Henry McMaster: ""Duke Energy's contribution to the One SC Fund highlights the very best of South Carolina. At a time when many families are facing uncertainty, Team South Carolina is coming together to support our food banks and put food on the table. I'm grateful for their generosity and hope it will encourage others to join our effort to help families in need.""

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""These organizations are fighting the good fight every day in communities across our state, but they cannot do it alone. Duke Energy is happy to stand with the governor, and we encourage other corporate entities, organizations and citizens across the state to help support the fight against hunger.""

Bottom line: Duke Energy's support of these organizations and the issue of hunger in the Palmetto State is nothing new. Starting next week, Duke Energy, with support from Duke Energy Foundation, will kick off the company's monthlong annual campaign to support organizations in South Carolina that address food insecurities and inequities. The fifth year of the initiative will provide over $500,000 to more than 60 feeding programs leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday and culminate in final surprise grant announcements on Giving Tuesday.

Zoom in: This campaign is in addition to the support of the One SC Fund and will highlight critical community partners that do this incredible work to fight hunger, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina and AIM, among many others. Duke Energy employees will also provide their time and talents volunteering with organizations throughout the month.

Go deeper: Customers struggling to put food on the table are also likely making decisions about what bills to pay at home, including their electricity bill. That is why it is important to also offer information that can assist families to manage their energy bills when times are tough.

EPA specifically asked for comments on the elimination of reporting requirements for four categories: suppliers of carbon dioxide, geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide, injection of carbon dioxide and geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide with enhanced oil recovery.
But ethanol producers say if finalized, the proposal could wreak havoc with carbon capture projects that can significantly lower ethanol's carbon intensity.
Also, it would be more difficult to make use of the $85-per-ton 45Q tax credit in the IRA for permanently stored CO2.
The company’s efforts have stalled, in large part because South Dakota approved a law prohibiting use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines.","Carbon capture advocates are objecting to an EPA proposal to scrap a greenhouse gas reporting requirement for dozens of industrial sectors, arguing that energy tax credits would be negatively affected.

“The potential wholesale rescission of the [Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)] threatens to destabilize the fuels market, disrupt ongoing and planned projects, and ultimately undercut the significant investments that are helping to revive America's energy dominance,” Wayne Garrett, general manager of Chief Ethanol Fuels in Hastings, Nebraska, said in comments submitted to the agency.

EPA’s September proposal would eliminate reporting requirements for 46 industrial sources of greenhouse gases, including carbon capture, storage and utilization (CCUS), ammonia and lime manufacturing and phosphoric acid production.

The agency said in the proposal there is no statutory requirement to collect GHG emissions information for sectors other than the petroleum and natural gas source category, which are subject to the Waste Emissions Charge in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. That law imposed an annual charge on methane emissions from large emitters in the oil and natural gas sector, but delayed implementation until 2034.

EPA specifically asked for comments on the elimination of reporting requirements for four categories: suppliers of carbon dioxide, geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide, injection of carbon dioxide and geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide with enhanced oil recovery.

But ethanol producers say if finalized, the proposal could wreak havoc with carbon capture projects that can significantly lower ethanol's carbon intensity. Also, it would be more difficult to make use of the $85-per-ton 45Q tax credit in the IRA for permanently stored CO2.

If the reporting program is repealed, ""most investors and lenders would cease deploying capital into new CCUS projects until a replacement reporting mechanism is established,” American Carbon Alliance CEO Tom Buis said in comments. “Without certainty on how to measure, report, and verify emissions reductions under section 45Q, the CCUS industry will be paralyzed, jeopardizing the administration’s energy dominance priorities.”

Many companies involved in CCUS that are seeking the sequestration tax credit under 45Q, in addition to those pursuing the clean hydrogen production tax credit under section 45V, “currently rely heavily on the GHGRP's reporting mechanisms to provide verifiable evidence of the amount of CO2 they have successfully sequestered or prevented from being emitted through their projects,” Buis said.

Summit Carbon Solutions, which has been struggling for years to persuade landowners to allow use of their land for a planned 2,500-mile carbon dioxide pipeline, is an ACA member. The company’s efforts have stalled, in large part because South Dakota approved a law prohibiting use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines.

Chief Ethanol Fuels' Garrett said use of Section 45Z, a tax credit for low-carbon transportation fuels, also could be imperiled.

The Treasury Department and IRS haven't finalized rules clarifying the 45Z requirements for monitoring, reporting and verifying CI reductions attributable to carbon capture and sequestration, he said. However, ""we believe it is likely the agencies will adopt an approach that is similar to the approach required for both 45Q and the section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credit (i.e., in cases where CCS is employed by the clean hydrogen producer).""

The GHGRP “is a well-established and accepted reporting mechanism within the carbon management industry that, if eliminated, would leave taxpayers unable to claim 45Q,” Christian Flinn, public policy manager at the Carbon Capture Coalition, said at a public hearing last month.

Flinn cited 19 “commercial-scale facilities with the capacity to capture more than 21 million metric tons of CO2 per year” and said 45Q “has spurred over $77 billion in investments across announced and operating projects.”

Savings from elimination of requirement questioned

EPA said eliminating the reporting requirements would save industries $303 million per year through 2033. But commenters who objected to the proposal said those savings aren’t substantial, given that more than 8,000 facilities participate in the program.

The law firm White & Case said compliance costs are about $50 million for industries other than petroleum and natural gas. “When that figure is spread across all of the companies required to report, the total annual cost of the program appears to be fairly modest for most of the regulated industries,” the firm’s analysis says.

In addition, Flinn said EPA’s own estimate shows that compliance costs are “negligible compared to the scale of industry investment.”

“It is already standard practice for facilities that capture, sell, and store CO2 to measure the volume of CO2 in question thanks to widely available, cost-effective equipment installed at these facilities,” he said. “Therefore, for large and small companies engaged in the CO2 supply chain, reporting this information requires minimal additional effort.”

In addition to the carbon capture implications, the proposal has fertilizer manufacturers concerned.

Some members of The Fertilizer Institute take advantage of both 45Q and 45V tax credits; the latter apply to hydrogen. “Without an adequate replacement methodology in place by Treasury/IRS to meet its statutory obligations, The group's members may be unable to demonstrate the ability to qualify for these tax credits,” Tom Lynch, TFI senior vice president of government affairs, said in comments.

TFI recommended EPA keep some of the industrial sources in the reporting program on a voluntary basis for at least a year to allow the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service to put an alternative reporting system in place.

“A short-term voluntary GHGRP would provide near-term certainty to operators of active projects seeking to claim credits, allow industry time to agree upon a suitable replacement methodology and give Treasury/IRS further time to develop effective guidance replacing the GHGRP for future tax years,” Lynch said in comments.

TFI also encouraged EPA to work with the Commerce Department, U.S. Trade Representative, Treasury and industry “to ensure that a framework is provided to support the export of low-carbon products. Currently, the GHGRP – and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model on which it relies – “aids in the ability of U.S. exports of energy and other low-carbon manufacturing exports to key allies by providing a well-respected path for exporters to document emissions.”

The North Dakota Ethanol Producers Association also strongly opposes getting rid of the GHGRP for carbon capture.

“The proposed changes would create significant uncertainty for ongoing and future carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects that are essential to the ethanol industry’s success and to advance national decarbonization goals,” the group said in a letter. Signatories include association officers from Guardian Energy Hankinson, Harvestone Low Carbon Partners, Tharaldson Ethanol Plant, Gevo North Dakota and BI Biorefinery.

The repository for the carbon dioxide from Summit’s proposed pipeline, which has 57 ethanol plants signed up, is in North Dakota.

“Repealing these requirements would invalidate approved [monitoring, reporting and verification] plans, discourage new investment, and diminish ethanol’s role as a low-carbon, homegrown fuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard and emerging clean fuel markets,” they said.

Chief Ethanol Fuels' Garrett said, ""the lower CI resulting from CCS helps ethanol remain highly competitive in U.S. and global markets where carbon reduction is required or rewarded, often opening significant new revenue streams for ethanol producers."" He urged EPA to retain a voluntary reporting program.",https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/2024/Red-Trail-Energy-plant-Gevo.png?height=635&t=1762894216&width=1200,N,,2025-11-12 16:01:08.295794

Climate anxiety different from general anxiety Imagine you leave the house in the morning, and realize you left the stove on.
”I can’t just flip a switch around climate change.” The anxiety is more complex than a stove left on, because climate change is a more complex problem.
Climate anxiety is cyclical, because the sources of anxiety keep coming, and so does the need for coping mechanisms and actions.
Newman said that there isn't an easy switch between climate anxiety and climate optimism.","Every autumn, news feeds get flooded with stories about climate change. That's because around this time each year, global leaders gather to discuss collective efforts to limit our emissions of planet-warming gases, released primarily from oil, gas and coal.

Some of the information coming out of the COP30 conference is bleak. But it's not just COP. Climate stories can be difficult to consume year-round, whether it's about natural disasters, victims of heat waves or sea level rise or new studies about global warming impacts.

“When you throw a ton of scary facts and information at people, their nervous system shuts down. It’s a coping mechanism,” said Sarah Newman, founder and executive director of the Climate Mental Health Network.

That sense of dread, doom, fear or hopelessness gets lumped into a single term: climate anxiety. Surveys from the American Psychiatric Association have repeatedly shown that a significant amount of Americans experience climate anxiety.

Dealing with it, just like dealing with climate change, is an ongoing process. Here's how to get started.

Climate anxiety different from general anxiety

Imagine you leave the house in the morning, and realize you left the stove on. There's a fire hazard at home, and you're feeling anxious about it. So you turn around and switch it off. The problem is solved, and so is your anxiety.

Climate change doesn't work that way.

It activates different parts of the brain, according to a study published by the National Institutes of Health. While Generalized Anxiety Disorder often involves the part of the brain that handles fear, threat and emotion, climate anxiety activates parts of the brain that help with high cognition, willpower and tenacity.

“It’s an ongoing larger problem that I need to attend to over time and that is largely out of my control,” climate psychologist Thomas Doherty said. ”I can’t just flip a switch around climate change.”

The anxiety is more complex than a stove left on, because climate change is a more complex problem. The threat is indefinite, it’s largely out of each person’s control and addressing it requires repeated and variable action.

Doherty, who wrote a book about coping with climate anxiety, said that it isn't inherently negative. It's a natural reaction to a threat, and it's the first step in a cyclical relationship with climate change.

“The rest of the cycle is ultimately taking some action to resolve the threat as best that we can,” he said.

First, cope and connect

Newman said that one of the most effective ways to combat climate anxiety is to find other people who are experiencing it too, and to talk about it.

Every year, New York City hosts something called Climate Week. Folks from all over descend upon Manhattan for hundreds of events and panels on energy, the environment and climate change.

Between 15 and 20 people showed up to one event about finding connection and hope in the face of climate change. It was intimate, but so is confiding feelings of dread and isolation with a room full of strangers.

“How many of you wake up in the morning with feelings of despair or hopelessness?” asked the leader at the front of the room.

Just about every hand sheepishly went up.

“Not just in the morning!” said a man in the front row. And an awkward chuckle of understanding swept through the room.

That group was addressing what Doherty said is one of the greatest risks of climate anxiety: isolation.

“Just like working on any problem, any issue, once you have a team around you, then you feel better. You’re not alone. You feel stronger,” he said.

Meetups such as Climate Cafes or groups like Climate Psychology Alliance have online and in-person events where people can share experiences and build resilience together.

Much of Newman's work with the Climate Mental Health Network is about bringing people together to combat that feeling of isolation.

“When people start to recognize that, they’re not alone with what they’re feeling,” she said. “There’s an opportunity for people to move from that helpless state to one of empowerment.”

Many general anxiety treatments relate to calming the body and clearing the head, and Doherty said that all of those work with climate anxiety.

“It’s our same body. Our same brain, our same heart rate, blood pressure, our same ways of thinking,” he said.

Immediate grounding exercises include the 3-3-3 technique, where you name three things you see, three you hear and three parts of your body that you can move. Another one is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, where you identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste.

Doherty also recommends prioritizing rest and exercise, going outside in nature and focusing on the present moment. He calls all of those practices basic mental hygiene.

Then, find a purpose

Doherty recommended channeling climate concern into something controllable, such as the impacts of climate change in your neighborhood, or even in your home.

“Take care of my own garden so to speak, before I try to plant a garden somewhere else,” he said.

That starts with something Doherty calls ceremonial actions. They don't meaningfully change the world, but they're easy, they can be repeated, they align with a person's values and make them feel better, like picking up litter or bringing reusable bags to the grocery store.

Then those ceremonial actions fuel the desire and resilience needed for something larger, like getting rid of the gas appliances in the house, which could take years to afford and invest in. The U.N. lists 10 actions to reduce a person's impact on the planet.

Climate anxiety is cyclical, because the sources of anxiety keep coming, and so does the need for coping mechanisms and actions. Newman said that there isn't an easy switch between climate anxiety and climate optimism.

“I still carry those emotions and I still have the worry and I have the anger and I have the sadness, but I’m able to live with them in a different way,” she said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/12/PDTN/87231816007-ap-25315625869852.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y200&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-12 13:03:05.681628

Against this backdrop, we should be thinking about how data centers can stack functions for sustainability, efficiency and community benefit.
These kinds of data centers offer some unexpected possibilities with respect to sustainability and social impact.
Pairing data centers with greenhouse agriculture and carbon-utilization operations changes that equation by adding growers, controls technicians, energy operators, logistics staff and trainers.
But any serious national strategy must grapple head-on with energy and water sustainability along with community resilience.","Tim Ryan is a former 10-term Democratic member of Congress from Ohio. Shawn Cutter is a sixth-generation Ohio farmer and an entrepreneur in the energy and tech sectors.

This year, a wave of state laws is reshaping how America builds data centers. Ohio’s HB 15, effective in August, fast-tracks power build-out and microgrids for large loads. Texas’s SB 6, in effect since July, makes mega-load data centers responsible for interconnection costs and makes them curtail-ready when the grid is stressed. Massachusetts just approved incentives that grant long-term sales tax relief to major facilities, and Colorado is also moving toward rebates for certified projects tied to jobs and energy benchmarks.

It’s good news that states are thinking strategically about accelerating data center development. All this is essential for the advancement of artificial intelligence and for American competitiveness vis-à-vis China. But speed alone won’t solve the harder problems. States now need creativity to meet the moment with respect to data centers: concrete plans for where the power, water and grid capacity will come from, as well as how to create good jobs and benefit communities and the environment.

Analysts at the International Energy Agency recently projected that U.S. data center electricity use could more than double within five years. By 2030, these facilities may draw nearly 9% of America’s total power — putting pressure on grids and pushing up rates without major new investment.

The squeeze isn’t limited to electricity. By 2027, AI-related water consumption is forecast to equal more than half of the U.K.’s annual use. Researchers at the University of California, Riverside estimate a ChatGPT session of 5–50 prompts can consume up to 500ml of water. Google used 20% more water in 2022 than in 2021 as it scaled AI; Microsoft’s usage rose 34% in the same period. Communities are also pushing back on new data centers over noise, water draw and thin long-term job creation.

Against this backdrop, we should be thinking about how data centers can stack functions for sustainability, efficiency and community benefit. And state governments, along with the federal government and municipalities, should be thinking about how to maximize these kinds of benefits.

In the face of long permitting timelines and firm-power needs, many new campuses are adding “behind-the-meter” power plants. These kinds of data centers offer some unexpected possibilities with respect to sustainability and social impact. For example, imagine capturing server heat and CO2 and putting them to work fueling nearby industrial-scale greenhouses that produce fresh, high-quality food. Elevated CO2 in greenhouses accelerates photosynthesis and boosts yields; recovered heat keeps crops warm through winter. That means local tomatoes, lettuce and herbs in a Northeast or Midwest January powered by data center byproducts. Because these sites often land in less dense areas with ample space, they can supply rural food deserts, strengthening local economies.

When crops require less CO2 in summer, excess carbon can be converted into fuel like clean hydrogen. Emerging capture and electrolysis pathways can turn emissions into hydrogen for backup systems, fuel cells or even local fleets. Organic greenhouse waste can be composted or turned into biochar on site, improving soils, locking away carbon and feeding the next growing cycle. In short: Stack multiple sustainability functions and turn liabilities into assets.

Water is another overlooked opportunity. Vast, flat roofs — often 100,000 square feet or more — are perfect for rainwater harvesting. One inch of rain on 50,000 square feet yields over 30,000 gallons, meaning significant offsets for cooling and irrigation. Captured rain can feed cooling towers and greenhouses, cutting municipal draw. Leaders like Google and Microsoft are beginning to show what this can look like in practice.

On jobs, today’s critique is fair: A 250,000-square-foot facility may employ up to 1,500 people during construction but only around 50 full-time operators thereafter. Pairing data centers with greenhouse agriculture and carbon-utilization operations changes that equation by adding growers, controls technicians, energy operators, logistics staff and trainers. These integrated campuses can run apprenticeships and hands-on programs in data operations, energy management and controlled-environment agriculture, creating durable jobs and deeper community roots.

We’re entering the largest infrastructure build-out in a generation. The choices we make about emissions, water and local economies matter. We’ve risen to moments like this before: the Tennessee Valley Authority and Rural Electrification Act brought affordable power to every farmhouse. The Erie Canal and interstate system rewired commerce. Apollo turned slide-rule sketches into a moon landing in under a decade. Each looked audacious at the start. Each expanded what was possible.

AI infrastructure now calls for a leap of similar ambition. If we pair capacity with on-site microgrids, rain-harvesting roofs, carbon-fed greenhouses, hydrogen production, workforce academies and other innovations, we can scale AI without undermining communities or nature.

It’s not just states that are pushing ahead with policies to accelerate data center development. In late July, the Trump administration unveiled its AI Action Plan, proposing reduced environmental requirements and faster permitting to speed construction of data centers and supporting power infrastructure. The new AI Action Plan contains sensible elements. But any serious national strategy must grapple head-on with energy and water sustainability along with community resilience.

The “megabill” passed this summer surprisingly retained one important environmental provision from the Biden Administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act: the 45Q tax credit, which provides incentives to companies capturing and storing carbon. Given the bipartisan support for carbon capture, we should be thinking about policies to enable data centers to bring these technologies to scale. While it’s important to emphasize speed, we need to think seriously, and realistically, about sustainability.

ElectriCities, the membership organization that provides power supply and related critical services to 99 community-owned electric systems in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, was created by the North Carolina General Assembly’s Electric Act of 1965 to support public power communities in the region.

Sixty years later, ElectriCities and public power providers continue their mission to better serve citizens through safe, reliable, and affordable electric power, it noted.

“Through political changes, economic highs and lows, and significant evolution in the energy industry, ElectriCities has maintained its commitment to support the success of public power,” said ElectriCities CEO Roy Jones. “ElectriCities members are in the public power business because they know they can provide better, more reliable electric service to their customers—their neighbors,” said Jones. “Public power utilities don’t answer to shareholders or investors. They answer to their community.”

ElectriCities manages the power supply for North Carolina’s two power agencies: the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency (NCEMPA) and the North Carolina Municipal Power Agency Number One (NCMPA1). NCEMPA consists of 32 cities and towns in eastern North Carolina while NCMPA1 is made up of 19 cities and towns in piedmont and western North Carolina. Cities and towns that are members of NCEMPA or NCMPA1 own and operate their electric systems and provide power to their local customers.

Significant milestones mark ElectriCities’ 60-year history, including more recent successes that have saved public power communities and customers hundreds of millions of dollars while supporting increased electric reliability.

In eastern North Carolina, the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency’s 2015 $1.25 billion sale of assets to Duke Energy resulted in an average wholesale rate reduction of 19%.

This past July, the eastern Power Agency made its final debt service payment, marking a major milestone signifying those communities’ commitment to providing affordable, reliable power to their public power customers.

In western North Carolina, the North Carolina Municipal Power Agency Number 1’s wholesale power costs have reduced by 45% over the past 10 years, and NCMPA1’s 19 member communities have received an additional $275 million back from the Power Agency over the last decade.

What appeared to be a software fault was, in fact, a warning about the material fragility of American power. Behind every “cloud” lies a mountain of hardware: transformers, copper cabling, rare earth magnets, and fiber optics. These materials anchor the digital infrastructure of the United States. When the supply chains for data centers and industry falter, compute slows, translating into degraded command-and-control capabilities for the US military.

In an era of strategic competition, digital reliability is deterrence. A single outage in a hyperscale facility can ripple across intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) networks, disrupting real-time operational efficiency. Data centers power the digital age and the associated server farms underpin everything from economic productivity to military decision-making and intelligence operations. Current data center infrastructure is composed of thousands of acres of servers, transformers, and cooling towers scattered across North America. However, these private-sector behemoths remain perilously exposed. In the digital era, failure to treat data and data centers as national defense assets is a strategic blind spot.

The dynamics of deterrence have evolved in the 21st century. Previously, power projection relied on fuel and steel; currently, it relies on megawatts and computational throughput. The physical foundations of the cloud, including transformers, rare earth elements, and copper, are as essential to national security capabilities as shipyards and automobile assembly lines previously were.

The same materials that make fighter jets, missiles, and satellites are what make artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, cyber warfare, and command and control possible. When supply chains for these materials falter, such as through Chinese export controls on certain minerals and rare earths, or when power grid bottlenecks delay new facilities, the US military’s ability to process and act on information stalls. A targeted mineral embargo against the United States could undermine the infrastructure that supports military networks for collection and dissemination of ISR information.

For policymakers, the issue is that data centers are dual use. The Pentagon’s Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) and Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) networks utilize the same commercial power and server backbones that serve industry. A disruption in copper, transformer steel, or photonic components slows both sectors simultaneously. The boundary between civilian compute and military command has effectively vanished; resilience in one now requires resilience in the other.

Cloud outages have a major impact on the economy, critical infrastructure, and military operations, meaning the security and the functioning of these data centers are a major national security issue. This article traces the hidden linkage between data centers, component materials, and military readiness. It quantifies the physical footprint of compute infrastructure and examines the emerging vulnerabilities in supply chains and construction timelines before outlining concrete policy steps to harden the ability of US digital computing power.

The Mathematics of Data Centers: Power, Materials, and Build Cycles

Compute power may seem infinite, but its physical limits are constrained by materials and infrastructure. Building a single 100-megawatt AI-enabled data center—a power requirement on par with a mid-sized American city like Dayton, Ohio—has massive physical requirements. Each site needs about 2,700 tons of copper for cabling and busbars, 150 to 200 tons of transformer-grade steel, and more than 50,000 tons of concrete and structural steel for the shell. Even the smallest components carry strategic weight: rare-earth magnets inside hard-disk drives, gold in server connectors, and indium phosphide in optical transceivers. These materials form America’s compute base (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Material Intensity in a 100 MW AI Data Center (estimates)

The estimates for material tonnage are a synthesis of data from multiple sources, including the International Copper Association (2022) for copper requirements, the Department of Energy (2024) for transformer steel, and Arup (2022) for other embodied materials. Figures for rare earth elements and gold are based on component-level mineral data from the USGS (2024).

Every new data center build amplifies these demands. Their construction has already become one of the world’s fastest-growing industrial sectors for copper, aluminum, and specialized steels. Yet production of critical raw materials remains concentrated in a handful of unstable and/or authoritarian countries. The mathematics are unforgiving: Small shortages in transformer steel or copper can delay data center completion by years, with cascading effects on compute availability across both the civilian economy and defense networks.

This situation reflects the limitations that previously characterized naval logistics and fuel supply chains in the 20th century. In this context, computation has become a new form of logistics: Instead of moving oil to the front, it moves information to the decision-maker. And like oil, its flow depends on extraction, refining, and transport chains that are slow, exposed, and politically entangled.

Power requirements amplify the problem. Each megawatt of data center load also requires an investment in grid capacity through substations, high-voltage lines, and cooling systems, which depend on the same constrained material inputs.

Meanwhile, China’s 2024 National Computing Network Initiative plans over 300 new dual-use data centers that explicitly combine commercial and defense functions. Conversely, the expansion of computing in the United States is constrained by transformer shortages, permitting delays, and utility congestion. The inequality lies in hardware: Those who govern material throughput dictate digital speed. This disparity poses a sustained threat to information supremacy.

The American economy and military are racing to deploy AI, advanced analytics, and global sensor networks, yet current bottlenecks reside in the alloys. Each layer of digital acceleration adds an industrial burden that compounds over time. Rather than pursuing an endless build-up of capacity, the United States must also innovate its way out of material dependence. Advances in chip architecture, photonics integration, and compute efficiency, like domain-specific accelerators and co-packaged optics, can reduce the physical footprint of compute. Investing in efficiency at the transistor and algorithm level can stretch limited materials far further than adding another data hall.

Emerging Vulnerabilities: Grid, Transformers, and Mineral Bottlenecks

The most advanced command-and-control systems in the world still depend on transformers, specialized metals, and high-purity optics that each have globalized supply chains with slow replacement cycles. What once seemed like a commercial challenge is now a question of national security. A grid failure or material shortage that halts data center construction can lead to delays in the flow of intelligence and targeting data to combatant commands.

Transformer availability sits at the center of this risk. Rising demand, aging manufacturing equipment, and global concentration of electrical-steel supply have extended delivery schedules from under a year to more than four (see Figure 2). The same pattern holds for high-voltage substation components and electrical steel, where China, India, and Japan dominate supply. This creates an invisible drag on digital expansion. Even if America builds new compute clusters, the energy infrastructure that powers them cannot keep pace.

Figure 2. Lead-Time Ladder for Critical Compute Infrastructure

The estimates for lead times are derived from an aggregation of data from the US Department of Energy (DOE) reports in 2023 and 2024, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) in 2024, and private-sector analyses, including those from EPRI, the Uptime Institute, and McKinsey in 2023. The figures represent median durations and are subject to variation based on capacity and permitting jurisdiction.

These constraints spill directly into defense readiness. The recent US Department of Energy Grid Supply Chain Review cautions that the transformer backlog, extending for many years, is causing systemic delays in both commercial and defense programs. The 2021 Texas power crisis illustrated how grid instability can lead to widespread digital blackouts. Should such a disruption coincide with cyber or kinetic attacks, command-and-control systems dependent on commercial clouds may fail during crucial mobilization phases. In contrast, China’s State Grid Corporation manages dual-purpose “computing and command” corridors that ensure uninterrupted power supply for military intelligence fusion centers. The disparity is stark: US computing relies on market logistics, but China’s computing is regarded as national defense infrastructure.

Equally concerning is the geopolitical geography of these critical materials. China produces over 70 percent of the world’s transformer steel, refines most rare-earth elements, and dominates the wafer-level photonics used in optical transceivers. Any export restriction or embargo could throttle global build-out of hyperscale compute, giving Beijing a lever over both economic and military networks. Even friendly bottlenecks matter: The United States has only two domestic transformer plants capable of producing the large units needed for defense-critical data centers. The combination of long industrial lead times and concentrated supply creates a slow-burn crisis. Power, not processing speed, may determine who holds the advantage in digital-age warfare.

From Compute to Combat Power: Why the Cloud Is a Warfighting Enabler

Modern warfighting runs on compute. Every mission, from satellite intelligence and maritime surveillance to predictive maintenance and AI-enabled targeting, depends on data flowing through vast server farms and secure fiber links. These networks form to support military and intelligence actions across Joint All Domain Operations (JADO). When that data flow slows, the tempo of sensing, deciding, and acting slows with it. Compute latency means combat latency.

Decision cycles that previously depended on human analysis increasingly rely on distributed computing infrastructures. The more rapidly a nation can receive, communicate, and integrate sensor data, the more credible its deterrent stance becomes. Throughout the conflict in Ukraine, distributed cloud architectures were pivotal. When Russian missile strikes targeted Ukraine’s command infrastructure, Kyiv rapidly migrated intelligence and targeting data to cloud-based systems. That shift allowed operations to continue with minimal disruption, preserving pace and decision speed even under attack. Compute resilience enabled continuity of operations.

Compute is the new logistics for 21st-century warfare. It moves information instead of fuel, but its vulnerabilities are strikingly similar: limited surge capacity, globalized dependencies, and long resupply timelines. The United States once maintained strategic stockpiles of oil and munitions to ensure freedom of action in crisis. Today it must think the same way about the transformers, rare-earth magnets, and photonic wafers that are needed for a data server farm. Each is a “just-in-time” component that underwrites digital-age war.

Faster kill chains require the compute power hidden in the algorithms and AI at physical server farms, which depend on uninterrupted access to power, bandwidth, and data. An adversary that can choke these inputs, either through cyber-attack, export control, or sabotage, can slow US decision-making without firing a shot. Hence, protecting compute infrastructure is a strategic imperative that can hinder or enable US military operations in crisis or conflict.

Ultimately, superiority in warfighting increasingly depends on data that can be processed, transmitted, and acted upon faster than the enemy. Compute is combat power, and the materials that sustain it are the new munitions. Securing this edge means the United States must defend and sustain the factories, foundries, and substations that make data centers function.

Six Steps to Improve US Compute Power and Resilience

We highlight six steps needed to align industrial tools and defense planning approaches to preserve the US economy and military warfighting abilities.

First, Washington must designate and protect National Compute Nodes, data center clusters whose function is critical to both economic stability and military readiness. These facilities should receive priority access to transformers, fiber routes, and electrical power, along with hardened redundancy and physical defenses comparable to strategic ports and air bases. Compute should be viewed as a form of infrastructure sovereignty and defended accordingly. Regional diversification of data centers would ensure resilience, so that no single natural disaster, cyber-attack, or grid failure can paralyze national decision-making.

Second, the United States must accelerate grid and transformer capacity. Transformer lead times now exceed two years, delaying both commercial and defense projects. The Department of Energy should coordinate with industry to co-fund new electrical-steel and transformer manufacturing plants, establish a strategic reserve of key grid components, and expedite permitting for defense-critical substations. Every week of delay in electrical power delivery translates into slower compute growth, meaning slower economic growth and military command and control.

Third, policymakers must secure materials and photonics supply chains. Copper, transformer steel, rare-earth magnets, and indium-phosphide wafers underpin the entire data center ecosystem. Yet these midstream refining and finishing processes are concentrated in China. Extending Defense Production Act authorities, allied sourcing partnerships, and industrial incentives to these materials will reduce foreign dependency. Recycling and circular-economy programs can supplement domestic supply, but they cannot substitute for new refining and alloy capacity on US soil.

Fourth, Washington needs to deploy targeted industrial tools to rebuild the “missing middle” of manufacturing that connects raw materials to finished components. CHIPS Act styled incentives should expand to include magnet alloys, capacitor powders, optical connectors, and power electronics. These investments are modest compared to the strategic cost of supply-chain ruptures in wartime; plus, they yield long-term dividends in jobs, technology, and resilience across the defense industrial base.

Fifth, compute resilience must become an element of defense planning. Combatant commands should wargame scenarios in which data centers or regional grids are degraded or disrupted. Exercises should test backup compute, power rerouting, and data prioritization under contested conditions, just as logistics drills stress munitions and fuel. Deterrence depends on speed of response, and the assurance that speed can be sustained when data systems are strained or attacked.

Finally, the United States must align its electrical power grid with national security. Data center reliability depends on uninterrupted energy. This can mean small modular reactors, advanced geothermal plants, or contracted renewables backed by large-scale storage. The Pentagon should treat megawatts as munitions: finite, strategic, and vital to operations. Hardening that power base completes the loop between energy, compute, and combat power. It ensures the US military can sense, decide, and act faster than an adversary.

Emerging sensor technologies will amplify these compute demands. Quantum magnetometers, gravimeters, and other precision sensors will generate unprecedented data volumes, collapsing the decision window in future conflicts. Quantum sensing may make the invisible visible, but only if backed by resilient compute infrastructure capable of processing those signals in real time. Without secure power and stable data centers, quantum advantages are lost to immense noise these systems will generate.

By locking power, materials, and manufacturing into a single resilience plan, the United States can preserve its edge economically and militarily. Securing transformers, materials, and megawatts is as vital as maintaining aircraft or missiles. Washington must invest in the industrial base of intelligence—the physical architecture of cognition that turns information into strategy and compute into combat power.

American competitiveness will be built from silicon and electricity. Future success depends on every algorithm, satellite, soldier, and weapon system operating with an uninterrupted cloud. The chemistry of modern war has changed: It now runs on materials, minerals, and megawatts.

The Trump administration had just adopted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which fundamentally altered tax and spending policies in the United States, including phasing out federal tax credits for clean energy.

Biggart, who has worked in the solar industry for over two decades, was alarmed. Just a few years ago, the Biden administration had done the opposite by raising solar tax credits to 30% for homeowners and businesses — increasing interest, accessibility and market for solar energy. But now, Biggart prepared for that momentum to plunge in 2026.

“A lot of people are trying to install solar right now, because once you roll into January you won’t get the credit,” said Biggart, CEO of Freedom Solar Power, a residential solar installation company based in Austin. “I would say once that credit is gone, the solar market is going to go down by 30% to 40%.”

Solar energy has been on the rise in Texas for decades, but a dramatic shift in renewable federal policy and funding has left the industry unstable and industry actors like Biggart uncertain of the future. As a consequence, incentives that made solar energy installation and employment attractive, accessible and affordable have vaporized across the state — throwing a wrench in the growing market.

Before Donald Trump took office a second time, the Biden administration increased the renewable energy tax credit from 20% to 30%, and created Solar for All — a $7 billion federal fund designed to expand solar energy access to disadvantaged communities across the country through the administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

However, in an effort to halt the growth of renewable energy in favor of the oil and gas industry, the Trump administration is phasing out the tax credit by January 2026 and eliminating Solar for All — stripping recipients of any initially awarded funds. This includes nearly $250 million for California, $156 million for Pennsylvania and $400 million for Texas.

Experts, officials and businesses across the country have sounded alarm bells over the impact these funding and policy changes will have on the solar industry. In Texas, Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee sued the Trump administration and Environmental Protection Agency in October, arguing that the administration’s decision to claw back the money is unlawful. In the meantime, the funding remains frozen. As for the loss of tax credits, solar companies like Biggart’s are in a kind of purgatory, fighting to stay afloat for the foreseeable future.

“We have more projects than we can literally fill a schedule, and we’re hiring like crazy and trying to get these projects done,” Biggart said. “But there’s this cliff and how far is the cliff, and how gnarly it is, is sort of to be determined.”

Accessible Solar

Despite being home to one of the largest petrochemical industries in the world, Texas has a large and growing renewable energy market.

The state is third in solar jobs behind California and Florida, and employment in the solar industry has increased by nearly 30% between 2018 and 2023, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. And, recent reporting by the United States Energy Information Administration found that in Texas, utility-scale solar — which is solar energy sold directly to the state electrical grid — generated 50% more energy within the first nine months of 2025 than in the same period in 2024, and nearly four times more than in the same period in 2021.

However, the state is not as far along when it comes to nonutility-scale residential installation and community solar programs, according to Margaret Cook, vice president of water and community resilience at the Houston Advanced Research Center, a nonprofit focused on sustainable development and science.

“We have little problems in Texas getting those large [utility-scale] installations and the jobs associated with that,” Cook said. “Our single family, multifamily, our commercial and residential solar industries are not as robust and they are seeing a lot of turnover, downsizing of companies.”

Solar for All was meant to help close that gap by expanding energy access to low-income and disadvantaged communities across Texas through various partnerships and programs. The eventual goal was to lower energy costs and create local job opportunities in the industry — meaning more affordable and accessible solar energy.

With the federal program in place, solar companies prepared for a huge influx of work by hiring more people to get ready for the expected increase in business. Now, Cook said those are sunk costs since none of the companies will be receiving the grant money they were promised.

And it wasn’t just Solar for All. Other renewable energy funding eliminated or halted left numerous programs without funding.

The Black United Fund of Texas — a nonprofit housed in Houston’s historic Fifth Ward — had expected millions in funding from the federal government for a local solar installation training program through several EPA environmental justice and resiliency grants. The organization had already hired instructors and started its first class. But all the funds it initially received have been frozen or eliminated, and the organization had to search for new funding.

“Trust is a big thing in low-income communities because everyone comes in promising so many things, and usually they don’t see anything directly change or impact them,” said Velika Thomas, chief financial officer for the Black United Fund.

Some of the students were able to graduate from the first class, but weren’t able to continue to the next phases, said Thomas. Those students got jobs at a local solar installation company, but the organization is still searching for more funding for future students.

The same type of whiplash left companies like Biggart’s pivoting on the spot after the tax credit ended. Originally, Biggart could breathe a sigh of relief. The 30% credit the Biden administration adopted would last 10 years, until 2032. It meant he could plan how the market would look for the next several years. But after July, all that planning and relief went out the window.

Freedom Solar is now rebranding as Freedom Power, Biggart said. The company launched a heating, ventilation and air conditioning installation business and a generator business in addition to the solar installation and battery business. Two years ago, Freedom Solar had 1,000 employees. This year, it has 400.

“It’s sort of like riding a bull a little bit,” Biggart said. “There are a lot of ups and downs in the solar industry.”

Bringing Solar Back

Before the Trump administration cut funds, Harris County — a leader in Solar for All in Texas — was planning for 4,300 projects across Texas that would aid 30,000 low-income households through the initiative, according to the Office of County Attorney Menefee. He sued the Trump administration and the EPA in October.

Initially, when the Big Beautiful Bill passed in early July, the administration repealed only the unobligated funds — the funds that had not yet been distributed. This came to only $19 million out of the total $7 billion allocation and wasn’t deemed a massive concern, said Menefee.

“But then in August this year, the EPA administrator announced that Solar for All, all $7 billion, would be eliminated,” Menefee said. “So that’s when we started getting ready to take action, which is what led to the lawsuit.”

In an August statement, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that the EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or to access the appropriated funds to “keep this boondoggle alive.”

Menefee disagrees. The Constitution and the laws of this country don’t allow a president to unilaterally eliminate a program that was appropriated by Congress and for which the funds have been fully obligated, he said. And Texas isn’t the only state taking action: nearly two dozen other states have also sued the Trump administration over Solar for All.

Experts point out that the administration’s move against solar and renewable energy is contrary to market demands. Solar is still on the rise in Texas, especially for the large utility-scale companies, said Cook, the vice president of the Houston Advanced Research Center.

Energy prices across Texas are also increasing, widening the gap that already exists between those who can afford electricity and those who struggle to pay the bills. For years, renewable energy, like solar, has been a growing solution to this concern since solar has proven to be more cost effective than traditional energy in the long term — at least for those who can pay the upfront installation cost.

In this new economy, the administration isn’t limiting access for everyone in the same way, said Cook. Solar is moving forward, but it’s leaving people behind at the same time.

“Texas has a lot of sun, a lot of land. It makes a lot of sense to do a utility-scale project in [the state]. It’s just very economically advantageous,” Cook said. “But Solar for All is for people to access what they might never have had access to without this program.”

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a Washington, D.C. event, according to CNBC.

“By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.”

The secretary, speaking at a conference held by the American Nuclear Society, noted that he expects electricity demand from artificial intelligence to attract billions of dollars from “very creditworthy providers,” CNBC reported. Wright was quoted as saying that his department could match those dollars by as much as four to one.

President Donald Trump directed the department in May to start building 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Wright reportedly added that he hopes there will be dozens under construction by the time the administration ends.

Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive. The president told Wright to use his loan office to build new advanced reactors, finish those that were prematurely suspended, increase the power output of plants that are operating and make resources available to restart closed plants.

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,” Trump said.

The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said in a May report that Trump’s order addressed “well-trodden issues” but was “ambitious.”

The president’s other directives on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are partially aimed at reducing the federal agency’s staff, also present issues for the country’s nuclear energy industry, according to the think tank.

“In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry,” the Atlantic Council explained.

This memo draws on CPE’s work with state agencies and municipalities nationwide, and demonstrates how tools like green banks, revolving funds, and public equity structures can advance climate goals while generating returns. They suggest that state actions taken now will build the institutional capacity to enable faster implementation when federal support returns.

The Trump administration has used both administrative and legislative measures to roll back the progress that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was making to decarbonize and modernize America’s energy system while containing consumer costs. With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), many IRA programs including tax credit support to renewable energy, federal loans for new energy infrastructure, and support for building decarbonization have been halted. New administrative barriers have been erected to minimize the impacts of the programs that still exist.

States can keep the flame of green industrial policy alive through the next three years to preserve some of the IRA’s gains and build a base of administrative competence, innovation, and market information for the day that we see competence return to the federal government. As part of its efforts to build public sector capacity among states, the Center for Public Enterprise has undertaken projects to help states replace and expand some of the functions of IRA, while acknowledging the fiscal limitations of state governments relative to the federal government.

States should be an investor in the green transition. We encourage leaders to find strategic business opportunities for state entities’ financial and development authorities not just by incentivizing the private sector to encourage investment in your state’s infrastructure but also by creating and redistributing value to the taxpayer. Institutions such as green banks, bond banks, and public investment funds can support green industrial policy while also generating returns to the budget that can be recycled or used as a cross-subsidy for further investment in essential projects.

Critical uses for public investments in the post-IRA environment include:

Public development of mixed-income housing: Complimenting and encouraging investment in green industrial capacity by preemptively pairing traditional state and federal economic development efforts with proactive planning of investments into workforce infrastructure—especially housing. State leaders such as the Montgomery County Housing Opportunities Commission (Maryland) not only streamlined regulation to build new housing but invested public capital into both traditional low income housing and “mixed income social housing,” combining both market-rate and subsidized units using tools such as publicly financed revolving funds. We are providing financial modeling and capital planning services to over 15 municipalities and state governments interested in addressing the housing shortage through this revolving fund-led approach.

Public development or financing of critical energy infrastructure: Using existing or new state instrumentalities as “public developers” of critical infrastructure, including higher-cost technologies such as transmission, storage, geothermal, and nuclear power. For example, the New York Power Authority has been instrumental in sustaining the state’s clean energy progress by building a pipeline of renewable energy projects owned and developed by the state in partnership with private developers.

Public development and financing of local grid resilience: Supporting smaller-scale decarbonization efforts such as rooftop solar and storage deployment and building decarbonization via both green bank lending and green bank-led public development. For example, the Connecticut Green Bank’s Solar Municipal Assistance Program uses its own power purchase agreement (PPA) and lease structures to directly build public-public partnerships with municipalities and community organizations, with the bank as PPA holder and lessor.

Public procurement of clean energy: Investing in both centralized procurement of clean energy projects and PPA warehousing to crowd in capital. In the former case, the state’s utility commission can itself sign PPAs and mandate that regulated utilities buy certain kinds of contracted power (e.g., geothermal or offshore wind). In the latter case, states play a more entrepreneurial role by signing upfront PPAs with developers, to lower developers’ construction risks, and selling them to end-users of clean energy when projects are complete, earning returns in the process. To maximize the impact of such measures, states should examine options for pre-payment of PPA contracts. California has implemented the former of these projects while the latter is being examined in several states in the Western Interconnect grid region.

Public backstop for critical projects: Examining opportunities to rescue projects that have encountered unexpected financial bottlenecks from federal policy uncertainty though public equity or lending structures. Many renewable energy projects rely on tax credit financing and are rushing to meet expiration deadlines. However, administration actions and other delays may cause projects to miss these cutoffs, forcing them to resort to higher-cost financing. In the absence of tax credits, most developers are anticipating charging higher rates for power. Our modelling and research demonstrates that low-cost state loans and public purchases of projects can replace a significant amount of the value provided by tax credits and allow stranded projects to reach completion without raising ratepayer electricity prices.

Whatever the future of national energy and climate policy, states will have to be critical players in economic development policy. Thus, undertaking active public investment is more than just helping sustain momentum before the federal government takes the lead: It is building up vital capacity for many possible futures. One of the roadblocks to IRA implementation was that states had very little experience and capacity in acting as developers and investors, or as partners to federal programs. Thus, they could not easily take advantage of many of the law’s many incentives or play a role in implementing federal policy on the ground. Working now to build up institutional knowledge and capacity will allow states to accelerate their efforts when the funding picture improves and, in the meantime, serve as the laboratories of democracy for the future of our energy system.",https://publicenterprise.org/wp-content/uploads/Norris_Dam_Norris_TN_-_51441440309.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:03:23.093349

Last month in Japan, U.S. President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10 billion investment in the United States. ""Go out and buy a Toyota,"" Trump said. He has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest automakers to move to full EVs but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

""We know there is no single path to progress,"" Ogawa said on Wednesday. ""That's why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.""

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided to retain the designation for PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA (Superfund)— a decision with sweeping implications for local governments, wastewater utilities, and other public entities that handle PFAS-contaminated water or waste.

While the designation aims to hold polluters accountable for cleanup costs, it also introduces significant liability questions for passive receivers, including municipal utilities that did not create or directly discharge PFAS.

To help agencies understand the potential impacts and next steps, SL Environmental Law Group is hosting a live forum featuring Senior Partner Ken Sansone, one of the nation’s leading attorneys in PFAS litigation and water contamination recovery.

What You’ll Learn

This session will provide critical insights into how EPA’s decision affects the public sector — including what risks and opportunities lie ahead for utilities and municipalities:

Understanding CERCLA Liability: How the designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA creates potential liability for passive receivers of PFAS, like wastewater utilities and local governments.

Cost Exposure and Risk: What types of cleanup or compliance costs agencies could face under the new classification.

Congressional Action and Next Steps: Why utilities remain vulnerable until Congress acts, and what agencies can do now to mitigate risk and prepare for potential liabilities.

Participants will also have the opportunity to ask questions during a live Q&A with Ken Sansone, who will discuss the latest developments and share practical strategies for navigating PFAS-related exposure.

Why This Matters

The EPA’s decision to retain the PFAS CERCLA designation marks a pivotal moment for utilities and municipalities.

Glenfarne/Baker Hughes

Glenfarne Alaska LNG and Baker Hughes announced a strategic alliance through definitive agreements to advance the Alaska LNG Project, a collaboration celebrated in Washington, D.C. Glenfarne selected Baker Hughes to supply main refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the North Slope gas treatment plant. Furthermore, Baker Hughes committed to a strategic investment in the project. This partnership, which was praised by U.S. government officials for strengthening U.S. energy security and global competitiveness, reflects the project’s momentum.

Venture Global CEO says CP2 capacity could grow to 30 million tpy

Oil & Gas Journal/Geert De Lombaerde

Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel announced that the $29 billion CP2 LNG plant’s capacity could reach 30 million tpy, up from 28 million tpy. This improved efficiency is based on data science and AI applied to operational learnings from the Calcasieu Pass and Plaquemines plants. Venture Global reported strong third-quarter results, posting a net income of $429 million on over $3.3 billion in revenue, reversing a year-ago loss. The company exported 100 LNG cargos in Q3, and updated its annual guidance, projecting 148 cargos for Calcasieu Pass and 234-238 for Plaquemines. The announcement came as the company signed a 1-million tpy supply deal with Naturgy and saw its shares rise.

Greece signs landmark 20-year LNG deal with Venture Global

Greek Reporter/Tasos Kokkinidis

Greece has secured its first long-term, 20-year LNG supply deal with US giant Venture Global, commencing in 2030, which cements its role in the transatlantic effort to displace Russian gas in Europe. The contract, signed by Greek companies DEPA Commercial and Aktor (Atlantic-See LNG Trade S.A.), guarantees a minimum annual supply of 0.7 billion cubic meters (bcm), with the potential to reach 4 bcm. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright publicly hailed the agreement, stating Greece is strategically moving from being dependent on Russia to a “launch point” for American energy into Europe. Greek officials, including Minister Stavros Papastavrou, are aggressively positioning the nation as an essential LNG hub, investing in infrastructure like the Alexandroupoli FSRU to facilitate transport northward via the Vertical Corridor, aiming to stabilize markets and enhance European competitiveness.

Massachusetts bill will “empower local climate action” by banning natural gas hookups

New Bedford (MA) NewBedfordGuide.com

Massachusetts lawmakers are advancing bill H3449 to expand a 2022 pilot program that currently allows 10 municipalities to ban natural gas hookups in new buildings. The expansion would permit 10 more cities and towns to join, supporting the state’s net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 through reducing fossil fuel reliance and cutting long-term energy costs. Proponents, including Rep. Manny Cruz, emphasize climate urgency and cite research showing all-electric homes have lower costs, while data suggests the existing pilot has not slowed construction. However, critics, like former Governor Baker, express concern over potential cost increases during a housing shortage. The bill awaits committee votes as a key step toward local climate action. [MDN: We wonder what it’s like living under Communism like that in Massachusetts. Do the people who keep electing dictators even care that their Constitutional freedoms are being extinguished?

New York’s bad energy policies are out of control — time for Trump to take over

Washington (DC) The Hill/Paul H. Tice

The op-ed argues that President Trump’s attempts to change New York’s aggressive anti-fossil fuel policies through bargaining, like the speculated deal linking the Empire Wind restart to natural gas pipeline approvals, are ineffective. Governor Kathy Hochul’s administration has enacted strict measures like the All-Electric Building Act and a new climate tax, despite temporarily greenlighting the NESE pipeline last week. The author contends that this partial pipeline victory does not signal an end to New York’s net-zero crusade. Instead of seeking one-off project approvals, the Trump administration should use the court system to establish federal preemption over state environmental and energy laws, citing New York’s policies as an ideal test case. [MDN: The author, Paul Tice, a senior fellow at the National Center for Energy Analytics, makes a great point. It’s time to permanently establish federal authority over the states with energy policy. It’s a Constitutional issue.]

Study shows resource scarcity, bureaucracy barriers to natural gas use in CT

Inside Investigator/Alex Appel

A report by the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research details significant hurdles to expanding natural gas use in the state. Connecticut possesses minimal natural gas resources and cannot geologically store gas, requiring reliance on interstate pipelines. Expanding these pipelines, such as the proposed Constitution project, involves navigating complex, protracted federal and state bureaucratic processes, potential use of eminent domain, and risks from public opposition and securing a viable customer base. An S&P Global study confirms growing demand and the obstacles, noting that previous state initiatives to limit financial risk failed. However, the study estimates that overcoming barriers to the Constitution pipeline could net ratepayers $8.5 billion in savings and generate an additional $8.5 billion for regional businesses over 15 years. [MDN: Yet another study that says the proposed Constitution Pipeline would massively benefit New Englanders, like those in Connecticut.]

Duke Energy five-year capital plan could exceed $100B

Utility Dive/Emma Penrod

Duke Energy is expanding its five-year capital plan to $95–$105 billion, up from the current $87 billion, to meet rapid load growth, largely driven by data centers. The company has already secured 3 GW in new electric service agreements with data centers this year, expecting build-out to accelerate into the early 2030s. System additions could exceed 13 GW over the next five years, including 7.5 GW of new natural gas generation, solar, and battery storage. New nuclear generation is also being evaluated, but only after cost and supply chain issues are resolved. Duke expects to finance 30% to 50% of this ambitious plan with new equity. [MDN: The article reveals that Duke has secured 19 natural gas turbines and selected sites for seven new gas plants. Duke’s service territory is primarily in the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky—all of which receive M-U molecules. The company is making a major investment in new gas-fired power.

Trump’s EPA ‘leaning into innovation’ instead of overregulation to protect environment

Brietbart/Hannah Knudsen

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the Trump administration is prioritizing innovation and utilizing domestic energy resources over excessive regulation to protect the environment. He emphasized the high environmental stewardship standards already maintained by U.S. companies, citing numerous examples of industry initiatives across the country. Zeldin mentioned an Exxon Mobil advanced recycling operation in Texas that breaks down plastic, as well as new projects like a nuclear facility in Idaho and natural gas expansions from the Permian Basin to Arizona. He believes firsthand perspective from visiting these diverse, “multi-dimensional” projects nationwide is crucial for effective environmental policy, asserting that relying solely on D.C.-based regulatory discussions is insufficient. [MDN: The enviro-left pretends that without the bludgeon of government regulation companies will pollute us all to hell. Nothing further from the truth. Yes, some regulation is necessary. But the pendulum has swung WAY too far to the left. Zeldin is restoring common sense and balance to the EPA and its onerous overregulatory ways.]

Deloitte puts focus on natural gas in 2026

Midland (TX) Reporter-Telegram/Mella McEwen

Deloitte’s 2026 Oil & Gas Industry Outlook notes that the sector maintains strong capital discipline and innovation following the 2014 downturn. According to Kate Hardin, oil prices are softening, contrasting with a tightening natural gas market driven by rising data center and power demand. Natural gas and LNG companies are expected to increase capital expenditures and expand shale acreage to meet this growth and supportive LNG export policies. However, oil companies will remain cautious in 2026, delaying major spending until structural changes in global fundamentals occur. Facing rising costs and uncertainty, nearly 70% of U.S. O&G companies plan portfolio restructuring, cost optimization, and divesting noncore assets, underscoring a continued focus on shareholder returns over production expansion. [MDN: Years ago, we hinted (maybe even predicted) that oil would eventually decrease, but natural gas would increase. It was easy to spot. And now it’s beginning to happen. Oil will never go away completely, but over time, natgas will grow and continue growing. At least for the next 50-100 years.]

Former Gov. McAuliffe joins pro-natural gas group as national co-chair

Virginia Mercury

Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has joined Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future as co-chair to promote natural gas as a necessary bridge for long-term energy reliability while renewable sources develop. The organization, which advocates for an “all of the above” energy approach, posits that using natural gas alongside solar and wind can lower utility bills and cut emissions compared to coal, despite Virginia’s plan to eliminate fossil fuels. Natural Allies, whose leadership includes former bipartisan politicians, argues that a 100% renewable transition is too costly and challenging for meeting peak energy demand. However, the group, reportedly backed by fossil fuel companies, is accused of “greenwashing” the climate impact of natural gas to appeal to Democrats and young constituents. They are currently focusing efforts in states like Virginia, where debates about proposed gas plants are ongoing. [MDN: Lib Dems like Terry McAwful join pro-gas groups like Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future for one reason and one reason only: money.

America at 250 needs energy overhaul – ARC is the place to start

RealClearPolitics/David DesRosiers

Rep. Troy Balderson introduced “The Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act” (ARC) to correct the focus of current energy policy, which the article argues prioritizes clean energy over affordability and reliability. The ARC bill would require federal agencies like the DOE, DOI, and EPA to prioritize affordability first, reliability second, and cleanliness third when evaluating energy projects. This “all-of-the-above” approach aims to codify the inclusion of all viable, cost-effective, and reliable sources, including natural gas and nuclear, to lower energy costs for American families and businesses. The author presents a nonpartisan appeal, arguing that current energy priorities lead to rising rates, citing examples in New Jersey and Georgia, and that the new framework is essential for economic growth and meeting future demands like AI. [MDN: An op-ed from the publisher of the RealClear websites. He lends his support to Balderson’s excellent bill.]

INTERNATIONAL

Oil gains as fuel prices surge

Bloomberg/A. Longley, R.W. Neo and W. Kubzansky

Oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate settling near $61 a barrel, rose for a third day, defying signs of a softer crude market, as support came from surging premiums for refined fuels like gasoline and diesel, and heightened concerns over Russian supply following a US crackdown. Analysts attribute the gains to strong product markets, which are keeping crude prices afloat despite a prolonged slump driven by widespread expectations of a global surplus and increased output from OPEC+ and other drillers. The narrowing WTI prompt spread suggests excess supply, but a major selloff is deemed unlikely unless the strength in refined products decisively ends. Traders also engaged in short covering after WTI successfully held the $60 level. [MDN: WTI for December delivery added 1.5% to settle at $61.04 a barrel. Brent for January settlement edged up 1.7% to settle at $65.16 a barrel. Despite its best effort to denigrate oil and talk the price down, the price keeps returning to the $60s, which is confounding for the leftstream media.]

Exxon CEO expects long-term role for oil and gas, maybe not as fuel

Reuters/Oliver Griffin

Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods stated that crude oil and hydrocarbons will remain critical for a long time, but their use as fuel (combustion) is likely to change as technology evolves, noting continued demand in other sectors, such as medical. Speaking ahead of the COP30 climate conference, Woods criticized current climate policy, stating that without effective carbon accounting to properly track emissions across value chains, “net zero is just a slogan.” He also expressed optimism about the company’s early-stage negotiations to return to Iraq to manage, develop, and operate the Majnoon oil field, emphasizing the need for a favorable, win-win investment proposition with the Iraqi government. [MDN: Darren Woods is undoubtedly a better CEO for Exxon than his predecessor, Rex Tillerson. However, Woods continues to dally with global warming nutters who insist we “transition” to non-fossil fuels for energy. No, Mr. Woods, we do NOT need “carbon accounting” (i.e., a carbon tax). Wise up!]

US urges Europe to stick to oil and gas, not renewables

Reuters/Edward Mcallister, Lefteris Papadimas

U.S. energy and interior secretaries recently argued that global renewable energy investments have failed to deliver, urging a focus on securing reliable fossil fuel supplies, particularly to Europe. Speaking at an energy conference, U.S. officials, reflecting the Trump administration’s policy, pushed to boost U.S. oil and gas exports to replace Russian imports entirely. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated the shift to renewables “hasn’t worked,” citing that despite trillions spent, solar and wind accounted for only 2.6% of global energy last year. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum claimed there is “no energy transition, there’s only energy addition,” underscoring a divergence from the European Union’s emissions reduction goals. [MDN: Two smart people whom we are glad are part of Trump’s cabinet, both delivering some hard truths to Euro weenies.]

China could crash the price of oil

Forbes/Michael Lynch

Despite the IEA’s forecast of a massive looming oil glut and inventory build for 2025-2026, critics highlight that observed inventory data has not shown the expected increase, implying a tighter current market. The article argues this discrepancy is largely explained by significant, non-transparent inventory builds in China’s strategic oil stocks, which absorbed 700-900 thousand barrels per day (tb/d). Although the IEA still projects a substantial market surplus (over 2 mb/d by 2026), the market’s stability and price level depend precariously on China’s future purchasing decisions. If China abruptly halts its unpredictable strategic stock-buying, the surplus could turn into a severe flood of oil, likely necessitating intervention by OPEC+ to prevent a price collapse. [MDN: The author makes the point that the price of oil is pretty much in the hands of the thug dictatorship of China. How did we get here?]

IEA backs bullish oil demand growth scenario in tone shift

Bloomberg/Grant Smith

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has reversed its previous outlook, reintroducing a “Current Policies Scenario” (CPS) where global oil demand continues to grow by 13% through 2050, a shift attributed to slower electric vehicle adoption. This latest report marks a softening of the IEA’s stance on a near-term peak in demand and aligns more closely with the views of OPEC. The CPS, which envisions consumption climbing to 113 million barrels per day by 2050 and temperatures rising by nearly 3°C, contrasts with the “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS), where demand peaks around 2030. Even in STEPS, the peak is now seen later than previously projected, highlighting a trend across the energy industry toward a bumpier road to net zero. [MDN: What’s really happened is that the IEA is (for now) dropping its propaganda advocacy for unreliable renewables and instead using real data once gain to make predictions. Why? Because the money-sucking agency was threatened with defunding by the Trump administration unless it changed.]

Climate delusions & gaslighting at COP30

Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)/Peter Murphy

The article harshly critiques the UN Climate Summit, COP30, labeling the proceedings as “absurdities.” It attacks UN Secretary-General António Guterres for raising “hysteria” with claims that a 1.5-degree temperature overshoot is “inevitable,” arguing he presented “zero evidence” for this catastrophe. The author contends that the globalists’ demands for massive annual funding (up to $1.3 trillion) are about control and will increase poverty by raising energy costs, noting that World Bank data shows poverty decreasing in nations developing oil and gas.

The first shipments went out this past summer.

Why it matters: The Japanese company says it is creating 5,100 jobs and investing $13.9 billion in the North Carolina facility.

Workers at the facility develop and manufacture lithium-ion batteries, which are becoming increasingly important to the world's largest automaker.

State of play: Toyota now has 11 plants across the U.S., but this is the ""first and only battery plant outside of Japan,"" a press release said.

The company on Wednesday pledged an additional $10 billion in American investments over the next five years.

The factory currently employs 2,500 workers.

Context: Earlier in 2025, Japan struck a deal with the Trump administration promising manufacturing investments in the U.S. in exchange for lower tariffs.

Ted Ogawa, Toyota's chief executive in North America, says the plant reflects the automaker's priority to ""build where we sell,"" a commitment he notes President Donald Trump praised on his recent trip to Japan.

Inside the room: U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Gov. Josh Stein both attended a flashy event held at the plant Wednesday, seated in the front row on either side of U.S. Sen. Ted Budd.

The ambassador from Japan, Shigeo Yamada, sat on Stein's other side.

What they're saying: Duffy joked he was relieved not to talk about aviation amid flight delays and cancellations caused by the government shutdown, and said, ""when companies invest in America, that means great American jobs.""

Stein says the factory helps ""build a state that is safer, stronger, cleaner and more resilient.""

Yamada says it will "" energize the economy of North Carolina — as well as the entire United States — while securing very vital supply chains.""

Zoom in: The site sprawls over 1,850 acres and runs 24/7. It will eventually accommodate 14 battery production lines for various vehicles.

That includes Camry, Corolla and RAV4 models, plus an all-electric 3-row SUV that's not yet been released.

Battery modules made in Liberty are shipped to assembly lines in Kentucky and Alabama, the company says. Factory workers say they're about 80% complete when they leave North Carolina.

Between the lines: Toyota no longer makes fully gas-powered Camrys, and its EV strategy has prioritized hybrids over all-electric models.

""I think the American people want hybrids,"" Duffy added. ""They want electric, but they also want the backup of a combustion engine.""

Don Stewart, who leads Toyota North Carolina, says the factory ""symbolizes the future of the automobile industry.""

Zoom out: For picking Liberty, Toyota is in line for around $664 million in incentives from the state and Randolph County, provided it meets hiring and investment goals.

""History tells us when a company like Toyota plants their roots in a town like ours, that community is going to thrive,"" says Rebecca Sams, a factory worker from Liberty.

“By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.”

The secretary, speaking at a conference held by the American Nuclear Society, noted that he expects electricity demand from artificial intelligence to attract billions of dollars from “very creditworthy providers,” CNBC reported. Wright was quoted as saying that his department could match those dollars by as much as four to one.

President Donald Trump directed the department in May to start building 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Wright reportedly added that he hopes there will be dozens under construction by the time the administration ends.

Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive. The president told Wright to use his loan office to build new advanced reactors, finish those that were prematurely suspended, increase the power output of plants that are operating and make resources available to restart closed plants.

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,” Trump said.

The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said in a May report that Trump’s order addressed “well-trodden issues” but was “ambitious.”

The president’s other directives on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are partially aimed at reducing the federal agency’s staff, also present issues for the country’s nuclear energy industry, according to the think tank.

“In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry,” the Atlantic Council explained.

Nonetheless, Stephan Singer, global energy senior advisor at CAN International, a global network of environmental organizations, said getting below that point is still possible.","Electricity demand will rise much faster than overall energy growth in the coming decades, underscoring the need for diversified energy sources, according to an analysis released Wednesday.

The report by the International Energy Agency said renewable energy, led by solar power, will grow faster than any other major source in the next few years and that coal and oil demand will likely peak globally by the end of this decade. The report noted that many natural gas projects were approved in 2025, due to changes in U.S. policy, indicating worldwide supply will rise even as questions remain about how it will be used. Meanwhile, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least a third by 2035 after being stagnant for years.

The release of the annual World Energy Outlook coincided with U.N. climate negotiations in Brazil this week where global leaders are calling for ways to curb the planet's warming.

Regional dynamics

The IEA says building greater resilience in energy systems is especially important as data centers, heating and cooling, electrification and more drive energy demand. Investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion this year, exceeding investment in the oil supply, according to the report.

Growing economies including India and nations in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, will “increasingly shape energy market dynamics in the years,” the IEA said, noting their potential for solar power.

China, meanwhile, has accounted for half the global growth in demand for oil and gas, and more than half for electricity, since 2010.

“In a break from the trend of the past decade, the increase in electricity consumption is no longer limited to emerging and developing economies,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a release. Birol said that electricity use is also rising in advanced economies.

Nations are grappling with meeting demand while preparing for the risks brought on by the planet’s warming. The IEA says the world is falling short on universal energy access and climate change goals. Around 730 million people still live without electricity, according to the IEA, and despite progress, nearly one-quarter of the global population still relies on inefficient cooking methods that hurt their health or the environment. 2024 was also the hottest year on record.

Nations should diversify their energy sources and cooperate to expand supply chains for critical minerals used to make things like batteries for electric vehicles and components for solar and wind power generation, the IEA said. This also includes making quick improvements to the grid, energy storage and broader infrastructure.

“When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,” Birol said. “With energy security front and (center) for many governments, their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals — on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change.”

In a conference call Wednesday, Birol said: “We will still use oil, we will still use gas. But the growth of electricity demand is spectacular.”

He noted the role transportation plays in accounting for 45% of global oil consumption, for example. “How the electrification of the transportation takes place, especially in countries beyond China and Europe, will determine the shape of the oil demand and growth.”

Global reaction

Wednesday's edition of the yearly report is the first released since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Trump's administration has for a second time opted out of the Paris agreement, rolled back dozens of climate regulations, slashed federal support for renewable energies such as wind and solar power and is reversing the “endangerment finding” that sits at the core of U.S. climate policy.

Trump has pledged his support instead to the fossil fuel industry, investing in coal and loosening restrictions on pollution.

But energy analysts said the shift to clean power is happening regardless of climate policy around the world.

“The evidence on the ground is overwhelming. EV sales are taking off in many emerging countries, solar is permeating even through the Middle East,” said Dave Jones, chief analyst at global energy think tank Ember. ""Renewables and electrification will dominate the future.”

Maria Pastukhova, energy transition program lead at climate change think tank E3G, said the report makes “the choices for the global energy system and the global economy unambiguous.”

“If countries want to grow their economies and protect their citizens from roller-coaster energy prices, they need to focus relentlessly on energy efficiency and the (decarbonization) of energy demand,” Pastukhova said.

Others, however, were critical of how the outlook addressed oil and gas. Ben Backwell, CEO of the Global Wind Energy Council, said the outlook does not fully capture the momentum in renewables, and that it should have emphasized the trajectory for renewable energy is accelerating, driven by the decreasing cost of the technologies, strong policy support and the move toward electrification.

“We’re accelerating,” he added. “You can see it all around the world and we can see it in our numbers for last year, but also in our numbers for the first half of this year. It looks very, very exciting, both for wind and for solar, in fact, and for next year, even more so.”

The outlook foresees the likelihood of surpassing the warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) established in the Paris Agreement. Nonetheless, Stephan Singer, global energy senior advisor at CAN International, a global network of environmental organizations, said getting below that point is still possible.

The IEA addressed some of the criticism in the call Wednesday. It said that it sees differences economically, politically and with regard to clean energy efforts across the globe, and that its analysis tries to account for those differences.

“In a nutshell, the IEA is backsliding. As a global think tank, the IEA has largely failed to represent where most countries in the (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and the developing world are, as they’re supporting net zero emissions with 98% CO2 emissions reductions by mid-century,"" Singer said.

LANSING, MI- Michigan Senate Republicans put out a press release Tuesday that claims: ""Without legislative intervention, new energy laws would force the RICE generators to shut down.” This claim is a thinly veiled attempt by one of the UP’s largest utilities to circumvent our clean energy laws – and worse, it is categorically false.

In fact, the proposal for decision hyperlinked in the Republicans’ release clearly contradicts their claim. The PFD reads: “This PFD agrees with AG-CUB that it is possible for UMERC to operate its RICE units beyond 2040 as merchant plants and still meet the RPS, that is that Act 235 does not per se require their retirement.""

Republicans are either hoping no one will read this dense document or have not read it properly themselves.

Upper Michigan Energy Resources (UMERC) – one of the Upper Peninsula’s largest utilities – claims that compliance with state renewable energy standards would force drastic bill increases for ratepayers. Meanwhile, UMERC’s largest ratepayer, the massive out-of-state steel company Cleveland Cliffs, is ginning up fear among UP miners by threatening an early closure of the Tilden Mine due to our clean energy laws.

One big problem: none of this is true.

UMERC argued that to comply with a 2023 act it would need to prematurely close two natural gas-burning power plants. The legislation actually requires gradual compliance levels through 2040 that are designed to insulate both utilities and ratepayers from unmanageable costs.

The law establishes a renewable energy standard of 50% by 2030 and 60% by 2035, as well as a clean energy standard of 80% by 2035 and 100% by 2040, it would need to prematurely close two natural gas-burning power plants.

Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) staff and an administrative law judge (ALJ) agree that the gas units will not need to shut down for UMERC to comply with these renewable and clean energy standards. They also agree UMERC greatly exaggerated its costs by including expensive, unnecessary battery storage in their proposal that are unlikely to be approved.

House Bills 4007 and 4283 are a “solution” to a fabricated problem.

DETROIT, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lotlinx, the auto industry’s first and only VIN Performance platform built to help dealers maximize profitability, announced today its Q3 2025 Quarterly Vincensus Report, the most comprehensive quarterly inventory report in the industry. Leveraging over 24 billion proprietary VIN-level data points and more than a decade of machine learning innovation, the report delivers unmatched insight into the state of the automotive retail market, including new and used vehicle performance, pricing trends, inventory risk, and consumer behavior. Click here to access the full Q3 Quarterly Vincensus Report.

Market Outlook:

The third quarter of 2025 presented a distorted view of the automotive market, driven by a last-minute rush for electric vehicles (EVs) ahead of an expiring federal tax credit. This surge, a 72% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase in new EV sales, represents a pull-forward of demand rather than organic growth, with EVs still comprising just over 5% of total Q3 sales across brands represented in Vincensus.

While overall new vehicle sales rose 11% QoQ and used sales increased 3%, the underlying data suggests a more price-sensitive and competitive landscape ahead. Inventory levels are stabilizing after years of volatility, exposing challenges for brands with older or mispriced vehicles. Lotlinx anticipates a highly competitive Q4, characterized by increased manufacturer incentives, deeper markdowns, and aggressive year-end sales events as automakers seek to clear aging 2025 model-year inventory.

Key Findings

Inventory and Pricing Trends

New vehicle day supply increased by 5 days QoQ to 62 days (up 1 day YoY)

Used vehicle day supply increased by 1 day QoQ to 40 days (up 4 days YoY)

Carryover for new vehicles decreased 2% QoQ to 52%; used increased 7% QoQ to 50%

Aged ending inventory decreased 3% QoQ to 42% for new vehicles and held steady at 48% for used

Units sold with a markdown increased by 1% QoQ for new vehicles and 3% QoQ for used

EV, Hybrid, and ICE Performance

New EV sales surged 72% QoQ, while hybrids rose 7% and ICE vehicles 9%

EVs made up just 5% of all sales, signaling that the surge is short-term and incentive-driven

New EV day supply dropped to 61 days and used EV day supply to 36 days — both below ICE averages

Average list price of sold new units: EVs $55,510; hybrids $44,100; ICEs $41,857

For used vehicles, EV prices fell 3% QoQ to $28,888, while ICE and hybrid prices remained stable

Market Dynamics and Competition

The stabilization of inventory has introduced new challenges, particularly for brands with aging 2025 stock

Dealers are expected to face the most aggressive pricing environment in years, with manufacturer incentives rising sharply to move inventory

Markdown strategies and real-time decisioning are becoming critical for profitability

Lotlinx Dealer Performance

Lotlinx dealers continued to outperform the broader market during Q3. On average, Lotlinx dealers had 1% less aged inventory for new vehicles and 4% less for used vehicles compared to the market. Additionally, 59% of new vehicle brands and 92% of used vehicle brands leveraging Lotlinx outperformed their respective market benchmarks.

“Dealers are navigating a new chapter of hyper-competition, where every VIN decision matters,” said Len Short, Executive Chairman of Lotlinx. “Our data shows that Lotlinx-powered dealers are winning by acting faster and smarter, using VIN-specific insights to reduce aging, optimize pricing, and preserve profitability, even as the market becomes more volatile.”

,Texas Environment,2025-11-12 15:32:01+00:00,Los Angeles Times,"At Brazilian climate summit, Newsom positions California as a stand-in for the U.S.","Melody Gutierrez, www.latimes.com, melody-gutierrez",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-12/newsoms-rise-as-americas-shadow-climate-diplomat,"But on climate, it’s not all performance.
“Absolutely,” he said when asked whether the state is in effect standing in for the United States at climate talks.
“I’m trying to call that out,” Newsom said, adding that in a normal political climate, leaders should model civility and respect.
Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of state leaders, said three governors from the United States attended COP30-related events in Brazil: Newsom, Wisconsin’s Tony Evers and New Mexico’s Michelle Lujan Grisham.
“But some of the decisions that he’s made, especially recently, don’t move us in as good a direction on climate.” Newsom is expected to return to the climate summit Wednesday before traveling deeper into the Amazon, where he plans to visit reforestation projects.","The expansive halls of the Amazon’s newly built climate summit hub echoed with the hum of air conditioners and the footsteps of delegates from around the world — scientists, diplomats, Indigenous leaders and energy executives, all converging for two frenetic weeks of negotiations.

Then Gov. Gavin Newsom rounded the corner, flanked by staff and security. They moved in tandem through the corridors on Tuesday as media swarmed and cellphone cameras rose into the air.

“Hero!” one woman shouted. “Stay safe — we need you,” another attendee said. Others didn’t hide their confusion at who the man with slicked-back graying hair causing such a commotion was.

“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference,” Newsom said when he reached a packed news conference on his first day at the United Nations climate policy summit known as COP30.

In less than a year, the United States has shifted from rallying nations on combating climate change to rejecting the science altogether under President Trump, whose brash governing style spawned in part from his reality-show roots.

Newsom has engineered his own evolution when coping with Trump — moving from sharp but reasoned criticism to name-calling and theatrical attacks on the president and his Republican allies. Newsom’s approach adds fire to America’s political spectacle — part governance, part made-for-TV drama. But on climate, it’s not all performance.

California’s carbon market and zero-emission mandates have given the state outsize influence at summits such as COP30, where its policies are seen as both durable and exportable. The state has invested billions in renewables, battery storage and electrifying buildings and vehicles and has cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21% since 2000 — even as its economy grew 81%.

“Absolutely,” he said when asked whether the state is in effect standing in for the United States at climate talks. “And I think the world sees us in that light, as a stable partner, a historic partner … in the absence of American leadership. And not just absence of leadership, the doubling down of stupid in terms of global leadership on clean energy.”

Newsom has honed a combative presence online — trading barbs with Trump and leaning into satire, especially on social media, tactics that mirror the president’s. Critics have argued that it’s contributing to a lowering of the bar when it comes to political discourse, but Newsom said he doesn’t see it that way.

“I’m trying to call that out,” Newsom said, adding that in a normal political climate, leaders should model civility and respect. “But right now, we have an invasive species — in the vernacular of climate — by the name of Donald Trump, and we got to call that out.”

At home, Newsom recently scored a political win with Proposition 50, the ballot measure he championed to counter Trump’s effort to redraw congressional maps in Republican-led states. On his way to Brazil, he celebrated the victory with a swing through Houston, where a rally featuring Texas Democrats looked more like a presidential campaign stop than a policy event — one of several moments in recent months that have invited speculation about a White House run that he insists he hasn’t launched.

Those questions followed him to Brazil. It was the first topic posed from a cluster of Brazilian journalists in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city and financial hub, where Newsom had flown to speak Monday with climate investors in what he conceded sounded more like a campaign speech.

“I think it has to,” said Newson, his talking points scribbled on yellow index cards still in his pocket from an earlier meeting. “I think people have to understand what’s going on, because otherwise you’re wasting everyone’s time.”

In a low-lit luxury hotel adorned with Brazilian artwork and deep-seated chairs, Newsom showcased the well-practiced pivot of a politician avoiding questions about his future. His most direct answer about his presidential prospects came in a recent interview with “CBS News Sunday Morning,” on which Newsom was asked whether he would give serious thought after the 2026 midterm elections to a White House bid. Newsom responded: “Yeah, I’d be lying otherwise.”

He laughed when asked by The Times how often he has fielded questions about his plans in 2028 in recent days, and quickly deflected.

“It’s not about me,” he said before fishing a malaria pill out of his suit pocket and chasing it with borrowed coffee from a nearby carafe. “It’s about this moment and people’s anxiety and concern about this moment.”

Ann Carlson, a UCLA environmental law professor, said Newsom’s appearance in Brazil is symbolically important as the federal government targets Californa’s decades-old authority to enforce its own environmental standards.

“California has continued to signal that it will play a leadership role,” she said.

The Trump administration confirmed to The Times that no high-level federal representative will attend COP30.

“President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.

For his own part, Trump told world leaders at the United Nations in September that climate change is a “hoax” and “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

Since Trump returned to office for a second term, he’s canceled funding for major clean energy projects such as California’s hydrogen hub and moved to revoke the state’s long-held authority to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than those of the federal government. He’s also withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, a seminal treaty signed a decade ago in which world leaders established the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels and preferably below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). That move is seen as pivotal in preventing the worst effects of climate change.

Leaders from Chile and Colombia called Trump a liar for rejecting climate science, while Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva broadly warned that extremist forces are fabricating fake news and “condemning future generations to life on a planet altered forever by global warming.”

Terry Tamminen, former California Environmental Protection Agency secretary under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, contended that with the Trump administration’s absence, Newsom’s attendance at COP30 thrusts even more spotlight on the governor.

“If the governor of Delaware goes, it may not matter,” Tamminen said. “But if our governor goes, it does. It sends a message to the world that we’re still in this.”

The U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of state leaders, said three governors from the United States attended COP30-related events in Brazil: Newsom, Wisconsin’s Tony Evers and New Mexico’s Michelle Lujan Grisham.

Despite the warm reception Newsom has received in Belém, environmentalists in California have recently questioned his commitment.

In September, Newsom signed a package of bills that extended the state’s signature cap-and-trade program through 2045. That program, rebranded as cap-and-invest, limits greenhouse gas emissions and raises billions of dollars for the state’s climate priorities. But, at the same time, he also gave final approval to a bill that will allow oil and gas companies to drill as many as 2,000 new wells per year through 2036 in Kern County. Environmentalists called that backsliding; Newsom called it realism, given the impending refinery closures in the state that threaten to drive up gas prices.

“It’s not an ideological exercise,” he said. “It’s a very pragmatic one.”

Leah Stokes, a UC Santa Barbara political scientist, called his record “pretty complex.”

“In many ways, he is one of the leaders,” she said. “But some of the decisions that he’s made, especially recently, don’t move us in as good a direction on climate.”

Newsom is expected to return to the climate summit Wednesday before traveling deeper into the Amazon, where he plans to visit reforestation projects. The governor said he wanted to see firsthand the region often referred to as “the lungs of the world.”

“It’s not just to admire the absorption of carbon from the rainforest,” Newsom said. “But to absorb a deeper spiritual connection to this issue that connects all of us. ... I think that really matters in a world that can use a little more of that.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a057d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2Fbe%2F2d6ba3ce41f0b78a8533ad865521%2Fla-me-newsom-climate-cop30-02.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:03:33.944843

Dramatic as it may be, experts say the drop is only temporary, as more people are interested in new EVs, even without the tax credit.

According to J.D. Power, the number of people who are considering a new EV is the highest since January.

EVs are far from done, despite the dramatic decrease in sales last month, the first full month after the $7,500 federal tax credit was repealed. Compared to September, EV sales plummeted by 53%, slashing the market share in half.

But that’s just part of the story, as data analytics, software, and consumer intelligence company J.D. Power recently discovered. For starters, last month’s steep sales dip can be partly attributed to consumers rushing to get the tax credit in September, which ballooned the numbers. So, naturally, fewer people bought new EVs in the following month.

Then–and this is important–consumer interest is growing, not faltering, even without the $7,500 incentive on the table. Per J.D. Power, more than half of new vehicle shoppers (59.7%) say they are “very likely” (24.2%) or “somewhat likely” (35.5%) to consider buying or leasing an EV in the next 12 months. The number of people who are actively looking for a new car and are “very likely” to consider an EV is up 2.6 percentage points from September and is now at its highest level since January.

Current EV owners also need to be thrown into the mix, because most of them–a whopping 94%–say they will buy another EV when the time comes for a new car. Among them, 79% say they “definitely will” buy or lease a new EV, while 15% say they “probably will.”

The explanation for this continued interest is customer satisfaction. Among current EV owners, the number one reason for buying an electric car was the expected lower running costs (57%), followed by the tax credits and incentives (51%), driving performance (48%), purchase price or lease offer (47%), and design (35%).

As J.D. Power notes, the end of the federal tax credit will certainly affect the value equation, but EVs have consistently met or exceeded owners’ expectations on running costs.

This might not mean much today, but it will mean a lot next year, when no fewer than 243,000 franchise EV leases will come to an end. Seeing how 94% of current owners say they won’t go back to gas, many of them will likely buy or lease a new EV, putting them back on the market. For reference, 62% of people who returned an EV at the end of the lease in 2025 chose to buy or lease another one, according to the data intelligence company.

It all comes down to cost. While many EVs are more expensive to buy than their combustion-powered counterparts, they are more affordable to own. Per J.D. Power, 60% of current EV owners say their vehicles are much less expensive to own and operate than gasoline-powered cars, and another 26% say they are slightly less expensive to own. At the same time, just 7% of EV owners say their cars are more expensive to own than gas cars.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/ZngjGz/s1/hummer-ev-tesla-model-y-tesla-cybertruck-ford-mustang-mach-e-and-rivian-r1t-at-a-tesla-supercharger-station.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:10.212644

“This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,” Newsom said.
“We’re ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing.
“President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam.
“But it is very positive that we have these other leaders from the United States that are here in Belem,” he said.","Calling America’s absence from key United Nations climate negotiations “doubling down on stupid,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the United States risks being left behind as an economic power.

Newsom, a Democrat eyeing a 2028 presidential run, is so far the highest profile of several U.S. governors and mayors at U.N. climate talks being hosted in Belem, Brazil. They say they are here to tell the 195 nations who are trying to fight climate change that much of the United States is doing its best despite Trump administration policies overturning environmental regulations and aiding the production of dirty fuels, such as coal, while stymying green energies like wind and solar.

As he did during his first term, President Donald Trump is also pulling America from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set international goals to limit average global temperature rise.

Newsom's presence as governor of the most populous U.S. state serves to draw a clear contrast with Trump's absence. He said Trump's decision to skip the talks tells the world: “You don’t matter, we don’t care.”

“This idea that somehow we can put up walls, we can put up barriers, we could put up tariffs, we put up our middle fingers and just turn our back is lunacy,"" Newsom said during an exclusive Associated Press interview at the climate talks in Belem, a city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. ""And every other country in the world understands that. That’s why every other country in this world is moving in a different direction.”

Green energy transition and China's dominance

Even Russia and Saudi Arabia get it and are going green, but not Trump, Newsom said. U.N. organizers said only four nations are absent from the negotiations called COP30: Strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar, tiny San Marino and the United States, which over the century has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air than any other nation.

California, with nearly 40 million residents, is a major economic hub and on the forefront of national climate policy. But the Trump administration has sought to roll back the state’s power to set aggressive climate policy, most notably by blocking a California regulation to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars within the next decade.

“This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,” Newsom said.

“We’re ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing. We’re ceding economic power to other countries, notably China, taking advantage of that absence,” Newsom said. “And they’re going to clean our clock economically unless we wake up to the economic imperative and opportunities of low carbon regrowth.”

Trump, who actively solicited money from the fossil fuel industry during his last campaign, has massively deregulated industry that spews heat-trapping gas and cut subsidies to renewable energy. This would give America — the No. 1 oil producer in the world — energy independence and cheaper prices, he has said.

“Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing!,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement, using one of Trump's favored nicknames for Newsom. “President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump’s common sense energy agenda.”

Climate impacts in California and around the world

Climate change is undeniable, despite Trump calling it a hoax, Newsom said.

“If you don’t believe in science, and a lot of people apparently don’t, you have to believe in your own eyes,” Newsom said. “Nighttime temperatures, record-breaking heat globally, acidification of our oceans, impacts on our coral reefs. You’re not able to go where your grandfather brought you for the first time, your dad brought you and bring your kids because there’s another fire and it’s another closure and the air quality’s been degraded.”

California has warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in the past 30 years — slightly more than the U.S. as a whole — and gets nearly 7 inches of rain (17.7 centimeters) less now than it did in 1995, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.

Some of California's largest and most destructive wildfires in history have sparked in the last five years, including two January infernos that devastated neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles. The previous winter, meanwhile, brought record-breaking rainfall as multiple atmospheric rivers pounded the state.

“I’m just privileged to represent one of the most blessed and cursed states in the world that’s on the tip of the spear of the impacts of climate change,"" Newsom said. “How about the simultaneous crisis of wildfires, drought, and floods stacked on top of each other.”

“Anyone paying attention here?” added Newsom.

California's ambitious climate goals and challenges

At home, Newsom has confronted the economic and political realities of pursuing the state's ambitious goal of by 2045 reaching carbon neutrality, or taking as much carbon pollution from the atmosphere as emitted. He recently signed legislation to boost oil production in part of the state, and his party has grappled with how to confront high gas prices. California also has some of the highest electricity rates in the country.

California is also dealing with the massive energy and water demands of data centers by keeping its last nuclear plant running longer than planned, adding huge chunks of solar power and battery storage and investing in nuclear fusion, Newsom said. Those energy needs will grow as AI continues to boom. Many of the nation's top AI companies are headquartered in California.

Veteran climate negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said it was unfortunate that America's federal government was not participating in the talks.

The plant in Liberty, North Carolina, about 60 miles west of Raleigh, is the company's first and only battery plant outside of Japan.
The facility will house 14 battery production lines supporting gas-powered hybrid (HEV), full battery-electric (BEV) and plug-in hybrid models (PHEV).
The initial lines are set to power the company's Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row vehicle.
Phil Berger, the longtime leader of the North Carolina state Senate, added: “This is a monumental day for North Carolina and Toyota.","Washington — Toyota Motor Corp.'s $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina began production Tuesday.

The opening comes less than four years after a 2022 groundbreaking at the site and marks a significant milestone for the Japanese auto giant. The plant in Liberty, North Carolina, about 60 miles west of Raleigh, is the company's first and only battery plant outside of Japan.

""Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers,” said Ted Ogawa, president and CEO of the automaker's North American branch, in a statement.

The plant opening also underscores the company's commitment to a future business model that relies more heavily on battery electric vehicles, even as the Trump administration cuts federal support for such a transition. Toyota, which has a massive gas-electric hybrid portfolio, has purposefully lagged behind other U.S. competitors on BEVs but still has long-term sights set on electrification.

The 1,850-acre site, according to Toyota, will be able to produce 30 gigawatt-hours annually at full capacity and support 5,100 new jobs. The facility will house 14 battery production lines supporting gas-powered hybrid (HEV), full battery-electric (BEV) and plug-in hybrid models (PHEV). Additional lines will launch by 2030.

The initial lines are set to power the company's Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row vehicle.

Toyota also announced $10 billion worth of investment into the United States as part of the launch, which would bring the company's total U.S. investment to $60 billion since beginning operations in the country nearly 70 years ago, per a press release.

The company highlighted support from prominent national and local Republican politicians as the Liberty plant begins production.

“Toyota’s move to expand production in North Carolina is the latest show of confidence in this administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing, generate new, great paying jobs, and inject billions of dollars into the economy. We’re just getting started!” said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.

Phil Berger, the longtime leader of the North Carolina state Senate, added: “This is a monumental day for North Carolina and Toyota. Even before the first battery rolled off the production line, Toyota has made a real impact in our state. I look forward to seeing North Carolina’s partnership with Toyota continue to grow for generations to come.”

The Liberty battery plant began shipping hybrid modules to the Georgetown, KY assembly plant in June of this year and is now supplying the Camry, Grand Highlander, Corolla Cross and new Rav4.","Toyota has been building vehicles in the US for nearly 40 years and started producing engines just a few years later. Over the years, most of Toyota’s supply base has also set up manufacturing facilities in North America as well. But despite selling more hybrid vehicles than any other company in the world, Toyota has never produced batteries here until this year. This week Toyota is officially opening a lithium ion battery production facility in Liberty, North Carolina.

The $13.9-billion plant was announced in 2021 with an initial investment of $1.29-billion but the scope of the facility quickly grew. The plant will ultimately have a production capacity of 30-GWh of cells which would support production of over 300,000 battery electric vehicles. However, initial production at the plant is focused on batteries for hybrid electric vehicles.

In recent years, Toyota has been shifting toward making hybrid powertrains standard on an increasing number of models as part of its multi-pathway approach to electrification. The company has argued that selling large volumes of hybrids will have more positive environmental impact than a small number BEVs. This includes both the direct vehicle emissions and the environmental impact of producing batteries.

The automaker has called out its 1-6-90 rule. The materials required for one BEV battery could produce 90 hybrid batteries and six PHEV batteries. With each hybrid giving about a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 3.5 hybrids would have a similar impact to one zero-emission vehicle. Through the first nine months of 2025, Toyota sold 17,760 zero-emission vehicles and nearly 875,000 hybrids and PHEVs.

In addition to the Prius, Sienna, Sequoia, Camry, Crown and the new 2026 Rav4 all have standard hybrid powertrains while all of the other Toyota and Lexus brand vehicles except for the bZ and RZ BEVs have hybrids at least as an option. Many of these models now also offer plug-in hybrid options which feature a larger battery pack.

The Liberty battery plant began shipping hybrid modules to the Georgetown, KY assembly plant in June of this year and is now supplying the Camry, Grand Highlander, Corolla Cross and new Rav4. Three of 14 planned production lines are already running with a fourth currently being installed. The hybrid batteries are typically about 1.5-kWh capacity with plug-in hybrids generally running from about 18-kWh to 22.7-kWh for the new Rav4. The cells being produced in North Carolina are all rectangular, prismatic can format.

The current Toyota bZ and Lexus RZ BEVs are built in Japan and have 74-kWh batteries. However, the Liberty plant will produce the batteries for an upcoming electric three-row SUV that may debut by the end of 2026 or sometime in 2027. That larger vehicle is likely to use a battery closer to 100 to 110-kWh, similar to what is found in competitors like the Kia EV9 and Hyundai Ioniq 9.

For a plant with a 30-GWh capacity, the $13.9-billion price tag is about three times the investment in other US plants with similar capacity. However, most of those other plants only produce the cells with cathode and anode material processing and module and pack assembly taking place elsewhere. Toyota will be doing all of this work in the Liberty facility. Given the slower rate of EV adoption since the plant was announced, it probably won’t reach its full capacity for several more years. Two million hybrid vehicles annually would only need about 3-GWH and another 200,000 PHEVs would take up another 4-GWh leaving enough capacity for well over 200,000 BEVs.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6913c3d0cd69709bc16d0f10/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-12 11:05:33.847805

The sterile insect technique (SIT) is an environmentally friendly pest control method used to control harmful fruit fly populations in Brazil, Chile and Mexico. Sometimes described as birth control for insects, SIT works by releasing male insects that have been sterilized using radiation, which mate with wild female insects, resulting in no offspring. The SIT reduces reliance on insecticides, protects crops and enables countries to gain access to international markets for food exports. It is showcased at COP30 as part of climate-smart agriculture efforts using nuclear science and techniques.

What Happened

According to an SEC filing released on Friday, WT Asset Management initiated a new position in NIO (NIO 3.39%), acquiring 18.7 million shares valued at $142.1 million as of September 30. This entry marks NIO as one of the fund’s largest equity positions at quarter-end, based on the reported holdings.

What Else to Know

This new position accounts for 6.6% of WT Asset Management’s reportable U.S. equity assets under management as of September 30.

Top five holdings after the filing:

NASDAQ:NVDA: $334.6 million (15.5% of AUM)

NYSE:RBLX: $158.2 million (7.3% of AUM)

NASDAQ:APP: $148.6 million (6.9% of AUM)

NYSE:NIO: $142.1 million (6.6% of AUM)

NASDAQ:HOOD: $128.8 million (6% of AUM)

As of Tuesday's market close, NIO shares were priced at $6.63, up 31% over the past year and well outperforming the S&P 500, which is up 14% in the same period.

Company Overview

Company Snapshot

NIO Inc. is a leading Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer focused on the design, development, and sale of smart electric SUVs and sedans. The company leverages a comprehensive ecosystem of charging and battery solutions to differentiate its customer experience and drive recurring service revenue. NIO's integrated approach positions it as a key player in China's premium EV market, supported by a robust service network and technology-driven product strategy.

Foolish Take

WT Asset Management’s new $142 million position in NIO signals a high-conviction bet on China’s EV rebound after a punishing multiyear downturn. The Hong Kong-based fund purchased 18.7 million shares in the third quarter, making NIO its fourth-largest holding at 6.6% of 13F assets, according to its latest SEC filing.

The move follows a strong second quarter for NIO, which reported record deliveries of 72,056 vehicles, up 26% year over year, and total revenue of $2.65 billion—a 9% year-over-year increase. The company also narrowed its net loss by 26% quarter to quarter. Despite these gains, shares remain down nearly 90% from early 2021 highs, underscoring both the opportunity and risk facing long-term investors.

For context, WT’s other top holdings—Nvidia, Roblox, and AppLovin—all tie to digital platforms and growth technologies with exposure to Greater China, suggesting NIO fits a broader thematic push toward innovation-driven assets. With EV adoption rising and NIO cutting operational losses, the firm’s timing could pay off if China’s demand stabilizes. Still, profitability remains elusive, and execution risks will determine whether this rebound proves durable.

In addition, the company throughout November will provide another $500,000 to at least 60 feeding programs statewide amid funding uncertainties as colder weather and the holiday season approaches

Since 2021, Duke Energy and the Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are contributing $100,000 to the One SC Fund recently activated by Gov. Henry McMaster to support food banks across the state.

Why it matters: As colder weather and the holidays approach, many South Carolina families turn to assistance programs that help support those facing hunger. But those programs are facing challenges of their own to support this tremendous need. That is why it is important to support the organizations that do this great work.

What they are saying

Gov. Henry McMaster: ""Duke Energy's contribution to the One SC Fund highlights the very best of South Carolina. At a time when many families are facing uncertainty, Team South Carolina is coming together to support our food banks and put food on the table. I'm grateful for their generosity and hope it will encourage others to join our effort to help families in need.""

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""These organizations are fighting the good fight every day in communities across our state, but they cannot do it alone. Duke Energy is happy to stand with the governor, and we encourage other corporate entities, organizations and citizens across the state to help support the fight against hunger.""

Bottom line: Duke Energy's support of these organizations and the issue of hunger in the Palmetto State is nothing new. Starting next week, Duke Energy, with support from Duke Energy Foundation, will kick off the company's monthlong annual campaign to support organizations in South Carolina that address food insecurities and inequities. The fifth year of the initiative will provide over $500,000 to more than 60 feeding programs leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday and culminate in final surprise grant announcements on Giving Tuesday.

Zoom in: This campaign is in addition to the support of the One SC Fund and will highlight critical community partners that do this incredible work to fight hunger, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina and AIM, among many others. Duke Energy employees will also provide their time and talents volunteering with organizations throughout the month.

Go deeper: Customers struggling to put food on the table are also likely making decisions about what bills to pay at home, including their electricity bill. That is why it is important to also offer information that can assist families to manage their energy bills when times are tough.

Summary

Energy Transfer LP lowered its 2025 growth capital guidance by 8%, reflecting justified execution risks and sector headwinds, but maintains a robust long-term outlook.

ET's diversified growth projects, including natural gas transportation and long-term contracts, reduce concentration risk and position ET for AI-driven electricity demand appetite.

Despite near-term DCF headwinds and deferred earnings accretion until 2027, ET's valuation has normalized, and its forward yield now exceeds 8.3%.

A salivating prospect awaits ET buyers willing to tide through the near-term uncertainties while allowing the buying accumulation to pan out.

Thus, I deemed that an upgrade is finally due, as I urge investors to capitalize on the weakness while the market looks elsewhere.

“India’s EV and energy storage sectors are entering a transformative decade,” a Maxvolt spokesperson said.","Maxvolt Energy Industries, a leading Indian lithium-ion battery manufacturer, has announced plans to triple its production capacity to 2.25 lakh units annually, marking a major milestone in its growth journey. The company has acquired 55,000 square feet of land in the Duhai Industrial Area, Ghaziabad, to establish a state-of-the-art battery manufacturing and recycling facility, which is expected to commence operations by December 2025.

The expansion aligns with India’s accelerating shift toward electric mobility and sustainable energy storage solutions. Maxvolt aims to enhance domestic production capabilities to meet the surging demand for EV batteries, energy storage systems (ESS), and renewable energy applications.

Strategic Expansion to Boost India’s Battery Manufacturing Ecosystem

The upcoming Ghaziabad facility will increase Maxvolt’s annual lithium-ion battery capacity from approximately 72,000 units to 2.25 lakh units, significantly boosting output. In addition to manufacturing, the plant will also focus on battery recycling, supporting India’s circular economy goals and minimizing environmental waste from used cells.

According to the company, the integrated facility will include advanced automated production lines, testing labs, and R&D units aimed at improving battery efficiency, safety, and longevity. This expansion will enable Maxvolt to serve a wider range of industries—including electric vehicles, solar power backup, telecom infrastructure, and industrial energy storage.

Commitment to Sustainability and Circular Economy

Maxvolt Energy has been at the forefront of promoting eco-friendly manufacturing practices. The company’s investment in recycling infrastructure reflects its commitment to a closed-loop energy ecosystem, reducing import dependency and ensuring the responsible handling of used lithium cells.

“India’s EV and energy storage sectors are entering a transformative decade,” a Maxvolt spokesperson said. “Our expansion in Ghaziabad will increase manufacturing efficiency and reinforce our role as a trusted partner for clean energy and mobility solutions.”

Industry and Policy Context

The move comes at a time when India’s battery demand is projected to reach 260 GWh by 2030, driven by electric vehicle adoption and grid-scale energy storage. The government’s policies, including the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme and Battery Waste Management Rules, have encouraged domestic manufacturers like Maxvolt to scale production and invest in sustainable innovation.

Industry analysts believe this expansion will strengthen India’s position in the global lithium-ion value chain while creating employment opportunities and localizing advanced energy technologies.

Looking Ahead

Once operational, we expect the Ghaziabad plant to significantly enhance Maxvolt’s market share in the EV battery pack and ESS segment. The company plans to further explore partnerships with electric mobility startups, OEMs, and energy service providers to meet the growing demand for high-performance lithium-ion solutions.

With a focus on scalability, sustainability, and innovation, Maxvolt Energy’s expansion represents a critical step in supporting India’s mission toward net-zero emissions and energy independence.

Last May, as blistering-hot weather broke records across South Florida and smoke from distant wildfires in Mexico turned the sky hazy, Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, signed legislation erasing most mentions of “climate change” from state law. “We’re restoring sanity in our approach to energy and rejecting the agenda of the radical green zealots,” he wrote on X.

Back then, it felt like just another Florida story, a fresh example of the culture war overriding reality. In hindsight, it was a preview of where the country was headed.

President Donald Trump’s second term has plunged the United States into “don’t say climate” politics. Even as horrific floods and fires unfolded around the country this year, Republicans in Congress reversed the country’s only climate plan. The administration has deleted “climate change” from hundreds of government webpages and dismissed facts about the warming planet as “brainless fear-mongering rhetoric.” Rather than pushing back, Democrats have been talking about climate change less since the 2024 election, emphasizing “cheap energy” instead.

Even if talking about climate change is politically radioactive, adapting to its effects is no longer optional. Florida tops some lists for the state most at risk from climate change, facing a combination of heat, drought, fires, flooding and hurricanes. Miami Beach and towns in the Florida Keys have been raising their roads as the sea begins to rise. DeSantis has committed more than $1 billion to Resilient Florida, a grant program that helps local governments address some of these problems.

You don’t necessarily have to mention climate change to start adapting to it — a phenomenon now seen all over the country. PG&E is burying its power lines underground to avoid sparking fires in California’s drying forests, in the name of “wildfire safety.” After Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, the county began buying homes that have been repeatedly inundated and relocating residents, turning their former homes into open space to absorb floodwaters.

“There’s been a radical increase in how many people are realizing that whether it’s flooding, drought, fire, air quality impacts from fire — take your example — the disasters have been getting out ahead of us,” said Katharine Mach, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami.

Since at least the 1980s, the public discussion over climate change has revolved around trying to get the world’s carbon emissions under control. But as time has worn on and emissions have continued to rise, it’s become much more about living with the effects of an overheating planet. A recent United Nations report found the world will soon overshoot its goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with current policies likely to lead to 2.8 degrees C (5 degrees F) of warming by the end of the century. That’s a slight improvement from previous estimates, but still translates to an unrecognizable planet.

“We have unleashed a world where many climate impacts are now locked in,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Because we did not act quickly enough, it’s not just about mitigation anymore. We have to adapt.”

Bill Gates, who’s long funded efforts to switch to clean energy, recently wrote an essay arguing that climate advocates have spent too much time and effort on reducing emissions, and not enough on programs that help people stay resilient in the face of increasingly dangerous weather.

“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it’s diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” Gates wrote.

The question of how to fund efforts for low-income countries to adjust to this new, unpredictable environment has become a central concern for this year’s global climate talks in Belém, Brazil, which started Monday. “It’s a responsibility that richer nations, major emitting nations, have been shirking for the longest time,” Cleetus said. Another recent U.N. report found that developing countries will need at least $310 billion a year over the next 10 years to prepare for the effects of climate change. In 2023, richer countries only provided $26 billion.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has eviscerated foreign aid, stripping away development funding for poorer countries while undermining its own ability to respond to disasters at home. Cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have hindered forecasters’ ability to predict what’s coming, at the same time as the diminished Federal Emergency Management Agency has forced local governments to fend for themselves. The U.S. isn’t sending any high-level delegates to the talks in Belém, marking the first time the country will go unrepresented at the annual U.N. climate conference.

“I’ve never seen an administration be so deliberately undermining a country’s capability to be prepared and to deal with challenges like this,” said Susanne Moser, a social scientist who’s considered one of the leading experts on climate adaptation.

Billionaires like Gates are stepping into the gap. MacKenzie Scott, another influential philanthropist, recently donated $60 million to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy to help with disaster preparedness and recovery.

Experts said the new focus on adapting to a changing climate was necessary, but they said that Gates — like many before him — needlessly pitted the need to adapt against the need to cut emissions when both things can happen at the same time.

“Adaptation can actually not succeed, ultimately, if climate change goes unchecked,” Moser said. Today, the world has seen about 1.3 degrees C (2.3 F) of additional warming since before industrial times, but as Gates notes, it could reach 3 degrees C (5.4 F) by the end of the century.

“A 3-degree world is not a world in which adaptation can provide well-being and health,” Moser said. “It’s just simply, people are living in ruins and are trying to basically survive.”

There’s an entrenched idea among environmentalists that discussions over how to adapt to climate change distract from the core mission of cutting planet-warming emissions, what’s known as mitigation. It’s sometimes perceived as a form of giving up. But studies have repeatedly shown that talking about adaptation doesn’t necessarily reduce public support for mitigation efforts. If anything, the challenges of adapting — the high price tag of raising roads in low-lying coastal areas, or the difficulties of relocating communities out of danger zones — highlight the need for reducing emissions. “Once you begin adaptation and you see how difficult it is, mitigation looks like a cakewalk,” Moser said.

If Florida is any indication, the two might go hand in hand. Yoca Arditi-Rocha, CEO of The CLEO Institute, a climate education nonprofit in Florida, says that the state has made a lot of progress that doesn’t often get discussed. In fact, it’s one of the largest markets for electric vehicles in the country, and also right near the top for installations of utility-scale solar and rooftop solar.

Arditi-Rocha hopes Florida can show the rest of the country that climate action can still move forward, even if the term itself remains politically off-limits. Getting specific helps, she said: Talking about how towns need more trees for shade, or how they need to be prepared for hurricanes and heat waves, is simply practical. Then again, so is reducing carbon emissions.

“We have to shut down the overflowing bathtub,” Arditi-Rocha said. “We cannot be mopping the floor forever.”

Total oil and gas sales for the third quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.7 million, compared to $5.0 million in the same quarter of 2024.
Adjusted EBITDA was ($1.3) million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024.","HOUSTON, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: USEG, “U.S. Energy” or the “Company”), a growth-focused energy company engaged in the development and operation of high-quality producing energy and industrial gas assets, today reported financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.

MANAGEMENT COMMENTS

“U.S. Energy delivered another quarter of meaningful operational progress in Q3 2025 as we advanced our Montana industrial gas project,” said Ryan Smith, CEO. “With disciplined execution across upstream development, infrastructure build-out, and carbon management, the Kevin Dome’s scale and strategic location continue to position us as a first mover in a rapidly expanding segment of the energy market. Design of our initial processing facility is now complete, with construction commencing in the coming months—unlocking new revenue streams from both industrial gas production and carbon initiatives. The capture of recycled CO₂ will support carbon management and enhanced oil recovery across legacy assets, creating an integrated platform that maximizes value realization. Our consistent performance, capital discipline, and long-term strategy continue to drive scalable growth and build sustainable shareholder value.”

ADVANCING FULL-CYCLE INDUSTRIAL GAS DEVELOPMENT

The Company continues to achieve significant milestones while advancing the full-cycle development of its industrial gas assets across the Kevin Dome in Montana.

Upstream Development

Drilled two additional industrial gas wells in the quarter, bringing the total to three high-deliverability wells in the CO₂ and helium-rich Duperow Formation, each positioned to deliver strong economic returns.

The three wells achieved a combined peak rate of 12.2 MMcf/d, with high-value composition of ~0.5% helium and 85% CO₂. After testing, flows were restricted to ~8.0 MMcf/d and then shut in to preserve reservoir value until infrastructure is online, setting up an efficient production ramp-up.

Planning one additional industrial gas well for Spring 2026 in the same formation.

Advancing EOR opportunities using recycled CO₂ on nearby Company-owned oil assets.

Undertaking helium offtake negotiations with third-party end users to support commercialization.

Infrastructure Development

Finalized the design for the initial gas processing facility, targeting high purity recovery of helium and recycled CO2, with capital deployment expected to begin in early 2026.

Acquired 80 acres in Toole County, MT for $240,000 to serve as the facility site.

Finalized design of the infill gathering system; construction scheduled for early 2026 to connect wells directly to processing and sequestration.

Permitting, land access, and utility connections progressing in parallel to support a timely startup.

Once operational, the facilities are expected to generate diversified cash flow from helium sales, incremental oil from EOR, and carbon management.

Carbon Management Initiatives

EPA Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) plan was submitted in October 2025, with approval expected by Spring-Summer 2026, creating the ability to capture federal carbon credits.

Preparing second MRV plan for EOR operations, with submission targeted for December 2025.

Sustained injection of 17.0 MMcf/d across two Company-owned wells, equivalent to ~240,000 metric tons of CO₂ sequestered annually.

Progressing near-term EOR projects using recycled CO₂ on legacy oil assets.

Second Class II injection well approved by Montana regulators in August 2025.

CURRENT INDUSTRIAL GAS RESOURCE REPORT

The Company recently had an industrial gas resource report prepared by Ryder Scott for the volumes in place on its initial target development area across its Kevin Dome asset. The report concluded 1.28 billion cubic feet (""BCF"") of net helium resources and 443.8 BCF of net CO2 resources, contingent upon economics and future development. The gas concentrations used for the report were 0.4% - 0.5% helium and 84% - 85% CO2, reflecting the composition of the Company’s recent development activities.

THIRD QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS

The Company’s proved developed producing (“PDP”) oil and gas reserve base as of October 1, 2025 consisted of approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) comprised of approximately 75% oil. The present value discounted at 10% (“PV-10”) of the Company’s reserves was approximately $20.5 million at SEC pricing, with assumed pricing of $67.45/bbl, $3.10/mcf, and $33.01/boe for oil, gas, and natural gas liquids, respectively.

Total hydrocarbon production for the third quarter of 2025 was approximately 35,326 BOE consisting of 75% oil production. Total oil and gas sales for the third quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.7 million, compared to $5.0 million in the same quarter of 2024. This decrease in production and revenue primarily reflects the effects of the Company’s divestiture program throughout 2024. Oil sales accounted for 91% of total revenue this quarter, an increase from 88% during the third quarter of 2024.

Lease operating expenses (LOE) for the third quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.0 million, or $29.36 per Boe, compared to $3.1 million, or $28.95 per Boe, in the prior year. The overall reduction in LOE is primarily attributable to fewer producing assets as a result of our asset divestitures.

Cash general and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.7 million, a decrease of 15 percent when compared to $2.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was due to a reduction in acquisition costs.

Adjusted EBITDA was ($1.3) million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024. The Company reported a net loss of $3.3 million, or a loss of $0.10 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2025.

ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION

In addition to our results calculated under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), in this earnings release we also present Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a “non-GAAP financial measure” presented as supplemental measures of the Company’s performance. It is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus net interest expense, net unrealized loss (gain) on change in fair value of derivatives, income tax (benefit) expense, deferred income taxes, depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, one-time costs associated with completed transactions and the associated assumed derivative contracts, non-cash share-based compensation, transaction related expenses, transaction related acquired realized derivative loss (gain), and loss (gain) on marketable securities. Company management believes this presentation is relevant and useful because it helps investors understand U.S. Energy’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare its results with those of other companies that have different financing, capital and tax structures. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it provides additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in this industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

The Company’s presentation of this measure should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure, below. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

This utility-first workflow helps fast-track PG&E solar installation in Grass Valley and keeps SMUD interconnections on schedule.
North Valley Solar Power continues to support Grass Valley and surrounding communities with trusted expertise and a deep understanding of what it takes to go solar successfully in California.
About North Valley Solar Power: North Valley Solar Power is a locally owned solar installer based in Grass Valley, CA.
Focused on maximizing customer savings and long-term energy resilience, North Valley Solar Power helps homeowners navigate the complexities of residential solar with confidence and clarity.","Grass Valley, CA - With the 30% Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) set to expire at the end of 2025, North Valley Solar Power is calling on homeowners across Northern California to begin the solar installation process now, before time runs out. Specializing in PG&E and SMUD solar programs, the company is helping residential customers take full advantage of the current incentives by offering highly tailored system designs that meet both financial and technical goals under the new Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM 3.0) structure.

The Investment Tax Credit has long made residential solar more affordable, but to claim the full 30% credit, systems must be installed and fully operational by December 31, 2025. This deadline is more than a formality; it requires every step, from design and permitting to installation and utility approval, to be completed on time. Given the complexity of working with utility providers and local jurisdictions, North Valley Solar Power, a leader among solar companies Grass Valley, advises customers to commit by November 2025 at the latest to avoid delays that could cost them thousands in lost incentives. Year-end installation schedules compress quickly; early commitments receive priority placement.

Against this backdrop of urgency, the company stands out among solar power companies for its deep expertise in designing systems that are both ITC-compliant and optimized for California’s evolving solar landscape. Under NEM 3.0, simply installing panels isn’t enough. The new rules reduce compensation for excess energy sent back to the grid, making accurate sizing and storage integration essential for maximizing long-term savings.

North Valley Solar Power takes a precision-focused approach, ensuring each system is properly designed to meet the homeowner’s unique energy needs while aligning with NEM 3.0 requirements. The company avoids the common mistakes seen in the industry, such as under-sizing or improper battery pairing, that can diminish system performance and reduce return on investment. By integrating batteries strategically, they help customers use more of the energy they generate, avoiding high utility rates and increasing energy independence. Engineering for right-sizing under NEM 3.0 delivers measurable NEM 3.0 solar savings by prioritizing self-use and intelligent battery dispatch.

Navigating utility interconnection is often the most time-consuming phase of a solar project. North Valley Solar Power’s direct coordination with PG&E and SMUD helps expedite the process, ensuring all paperwork, inspections, and approvals are handled efficiently and accurately. This local utility knowledge gives the solar providers a clear advantage in meeting the tight timelines required for ITC qualification. This utility-first workflow helps fast-track PG&E solar installation in Grass Valley and keeps SMUD interconnections on schedule.

With more than 2,500 residential projects delivered statewide, North Valley Solar Power fields a CSLB-licensed (California Contractors State License Board) team and keeps design, permitting, installation, and maintenance entirely in-house for quality control and clear accountability. As a locally staffed organization, NVSP supports sustainability events and clean-energy education with schools throughout Nevada County.

But what should be a moment of celebration is instead being overshadowed by rising uncertainty: the climate-finance gap still amounts to trillions of dollars, while support among the developed countries for climate action is fracturing.

The transition to a low-carbon global economy cannot succeed without the active participation of the private sector, yet businesses and investors are reluctant to commit funds amid uncertainty and instability. Above all, markets need predictability: coherent policy frameworks, clearly defined priority sectors, and practical strategies for managing the financial, environmental, and social risks.

The predictability and stability that investors and markets require, however, remain out of reach. The International Energy Agency has warned that policy uncertainty has stalled the development and usage of many promising clean-energy technologies that are ripe for scaling up. Excluding AI, venture-capital funding for energy innovation declined across sectors in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, most countries still lack the policy and investment mechanisms needed to mobilize private capital at scale.

While tighter financial conditions and policy uncertainty play a major role, they are only part of the problem. A deeper, often overlooked reason for the slow pace of progress is that the global climate movement has largely failed to focus on the people most affected by the energy transition: workers, consumers, and local communities.

From its very inception, the Council for Inclusive Capitalism (which I lead) has argued that major economic transitions provide companies and investors with a unique opportunity to build a more inclusive society. Inspired by the late Pope Francis’s call to “hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor,” we established a partnership with energy-intensive companies and investors to develop a framework for a just climate transition.

Created in collaboration with BP, Reliance, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, State Street, and others, this framework places people at the heart of the energy transition. It emphasizes universal access to clean energy, decent jobs that provide pathways for retraining and reskilling, support for local communities, and the need to strengthen supply chains. It also recognizes that investors’ capital-allocation strategies must align with these priorities through meaningful stakeholder engagement and sharing of best practices.

Together with the energy transition, the AI revolution is set to reshape labor markets. To this end, we co-hosted a meeting with World Bank President Ajay Banga at the recent UN Climate Week in New York to discuss how to learn from the mistakes of past transitions and ensure that no one is left behind.

Turning ambition into action requires achievable national strategies. When implemented effectively, nationally determined contributions can serve as more than just climate pledges – they can guide investment and act as roadmaps for economic transformation. Brazil provides a useful model: a joint report by the OECD and the UN Development Programme touts the country’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development as a leader in creating innovative financial instruments capable of attracting private capital at scale.

Other emerging markets are also making strides. Wind and solar power are expanding rapidly across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, with India on track to become the world’s second-largest renewable-energy market after China. For developing countries, inclusive growth is not a slogan but a socioeconomic imperative, particularly when it comes to ensuring access to energy and critical infrastructure.

Developed economies face a different set of challenges. In the United States, about 40% of energy and technology projects announced under former US President Joe Biden’s industrial and climate policies were already experiencing delays even before President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. At the same time, rising energy costs are jeopardizing the United Kingdom’s net-zero transition, while European manufacturers struggle to cut CO2 emissions and stay profitable in a global market increasingly dominated by Chinese firms.

Even so, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Although Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement, energy affordability and AI competitiveness remain top national priorities. Institutional investors and private capital have both the means and the incentive to back emerging technologies – including carbon-free, scalable nuclear energy – that can sustain AI growth without driving up utility costs.

The dozens of world leaders in Brazil for COP30 are meeting at a critical juncture. To build a just and sustainable future, we must bridge the divide between governments, financial institutions, civil society, and the private sector. Only by focusing on workers, communities, and consumers can we translate national targets into tangible progress that protects both people and the planet.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/985746892da40ba06638ff0c739308f2.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:58.003880

Long before it grows its classic black and orange wings, the Monarch butterfly begins its life among the hooded flowers of milkweed. As caterpillars, they can’t eat anything else. Alongside millions of human beings, these butterflies also call North Carolina home, feeding on the 16 species of milkweed that are native to the state, according to the North Carolina Wildlife Federation.

Native species are those that have formed interdependent, complex relationships with the flora and fauna of an area after co-evolving with these species for thousands of years, according to North Carolina State Extension.

But sometimes, they face competition from non-native or invasive plants, which are popular for their landscaping appeal.

As developments continue, it’s more important than ever that the plants we do have nourish the environment, says Amy Mackintosh, co-chair of the Margaret Reid chapter of the North Carolina Native Plant Society.

“We’re having so much impact between agriculture and residential and whatever else use, land use, that we can’t say, ‘Oh, well, [nature] will move to the next place in the country’,” she says. “There is no next place in the country. It’s us.”

The N.C. Native Plant Society and other organizations are encouraging the use of native plants in landscaping by focusing on one side of the business equation: demand. They’re educating the public on how native plants can be incorporated into landscape aesthetics, in the hopes that this will encourage people to buy them.

Here’s one thing that helps: across the state, there’s already a growing interest in native plants, they say.

Demand: Why are people interested in native plants?

In a 2021 survey sponsored by the Coastal Landscapes Initiative, most of the 20 commercial plant growers that were surveyed reported seeing the demand for native plants grow over the past five years, says Jane Harrison, coastal economics specialist for North Carolina Sea Grant, which manages the Coastal Landscapes Initiative. Native plants like Southern wax myrtle, native hollies, and milkweed were especially popular.

The N.C. Native Plant Society has also seen interest in their organization grow beyond membership. While it has around 900 official members, about 2,300 opted in to receive its newsletters, says Margaret Partridge, the other co-chair for the Margaret Reid chapter of the N.C. Native Plant Society.

Concern about native plants has even risen to the state level. In July 2019, the North Carolina General Assembly passed Senate Bill 606, which requires the Department of Transportation to prioritize planting native plants along roadways.

But where is all this interest coming from? Recent research linking native plants to preserving biodiversity formed a lot of the impetus behind this, Mackintosh says.

Thousands of years of co-evolution means that entire ecosystems depend on native plants. For example, many native wildflowers provide nectar for pollinating insects and seeds for animals, says Christopher Moorman, associate head of the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources at North Carolina State University.

Not only do native plants serve as foundations of the food web, but they also affect soil composition, plant community structures, and disturbance processes, such as fires, he says.

Non-native plants, even if they spread beyond their native range, can never fully replicate the complex interactions that naturally occur, according to N.C. State Extension.

For example, privets, non-native plants from the Ligustrum genus, are integrated into the North Carolina food web because birds eat them, Moorman says.

But if privets outcompete native plants that support invertebrates, such as milkweeds, then the baby birds that need protein from the invertebrates will not survive. So while privets certainly contribute to the food base for native birds, their growth may have other consequences to native bird species as a whole, he says.

When non-native plants outcompete various native plants in a certain area, it can reduce the diversity of plants in an area, as well. This homogenization of food resources is why it’s harder to find native bird species in urban or suburban areas, for example, Moorman says.

“They’re just not able to persist in these landscapes,” he says.

Many non-native plants are popular because they are resilient and grow well in most conditions. But these same characteristics can also crowd out native plants, which arguably makes them invasive.

For Moorman, nonnative plants that establish and reproduce on their own are invasive, primarily because they take up space that native plants could use.

“That also accounts for the fact that in many cases, it takes decades or centuries for a plant species population to become well enough established so that it’s recognizably outcompeting native plants,” he says. “And so if we see it reproducing and surviving on its own now, I think it’s a good indication that in decades in the future, that it would be more widely spread.”

Take Ficaria verna, also known as fig buttercup, for example. The plant was introduced to the United States from Europe, according to N.C. State Extension. In late April and May, the plant grows dormant, forming bulbs under the ground and tiny bulbs on its stems, says Peter Schubert, the citizen representative on the Board of Directors for the North Carolina Invasive Plants Council.

When the stem withers away, its tiny bulbs can spread far, especially through floodwater. Each becomes a new source. And where they settle, they can grow to outcompete native plants, thus harming the ecology of an area, Schubert says.

The N.C. Invasive Plants Council, a volunteer organization that spreads awareness about the dangers of invasive plants, has published a list of invasive plants in the state. It gets input from a variety of experts, including scientists, governmental and conservation organizations, and the landscape and nursery industries.

But there’s no consensus on what makes a plant invasive, Moorman says. Many in the scientific community would not define non-native plants as invasive until they’ve observed their harmful effects on an ecosystem – however long that may take.

“And I’ll also say there’s a component of the ecological community that says, ‘Quit whining, stop worrying about it,’” he says. “‘These plants are here. It’s part of the cycle now with humans, and so we just need to accept it and sort of adapt to it.’ There’s some truth in that.”

Non-native plants have become very integrated into multiple cycles that affect humans. One of the most important ones is the economic cycles, where they form a solid base of the landscaping plant supply.

Supply: Why aren’t there more native plants in the plant nursery supply?

Yousif Nazo, business manager for Nazo Landscaping in Durham, says he has noticed that while there’s a substantial subset of consumers who ask for native plants, most people still prefer to plant non-natives.

Nazo Landscaping is both a full-service nursery and landscaping company, which means it grows the plants it installs for its customers. It sells some native plants, especially ones that are in high demand and don’t grow so wild that they require more work on the company’s part.

However, the lion’s share of their sales comes from non-native plants.

“To be honest, we’re a business at the end of the day, so we try to grow what works really well here but also what’s in high demand,” Nazo says. “You know, I have to maximize all my space, being that we’re right here in Durham, I mean, we’re using almost every foot of space we have.”

Most people asking for native plants are homeowners, who spend around a couple hundred dollars when they shop, he says. But contractors, landscapers, and developers, who primarily buy non-native plants, put in orders worth thousands of dollars.

“It’s a big difference, you know. So the people who are buying the most are the people I have to cater to in order to stay in business,” he says.

Nazo is not the only one. While a mix of small and medium nurseries from the 2021 Coastal Landscapes Initiative survey focused exclusively on native plants, the largest ones did not, Harrison says. This is a trend Mackintosh sees too; while there are smaller nurseries which cater to native plants, they’re still not selling at a scale that would attract landscape contractors, she says.

Various organizations, from nonprofits to the state, are having to balance economic and environmental benefits in landscaping.

“We really have to build a demand so that the horticulture industry can shift to native plants and still be viable economically,” Moorman says. “And we certainly want them to be viable economically.”

Design: Are new aesthetics the solution?

Some of these organizations insist there’s a way to achieve both: emphasizing the aesthetic appeal of native plants.

Both the N.C. Native Plant Society and N.C. Sea Grant works to educate the public on intentional design, particularly when it comes to designing with native plants. There are many ways native plants can be incorporated into a garden or yard to create a neat and organized look, Harrison says. Or, they could be placed in such a way to have a freer, natural look.

“I often think of a garden, a really, you know, kind of attractive, organized garden should be like a living room, you know, just like in someone’s home,” she says. “Do you put a chair in the middle of the room, kind of randomly, or do you put it in a corner, you know, kind of situated so that it can talk to or see the couch across the way?”

There’s even an aesthetic appeal inherent to native plants that attracts North Carolina residents – especially new ones, Harrison says.

“I think people have an interest in what is uniquely North Carolina, you know, what kind of makes this place special,” she says.

It’s not just individual homeowners or gardeners who see the aesthetic appeal of native plants. When the landscape around the Old Well, one of the most famous sites on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus, needed refreshing, native plants proved to be the right ones for the job.

“You know, we’re the University of North Carolina,” says Daniel Widis, UNC University Facilities Landscape Architect. “Pulling in plants from across the state that are representative of the region, representative of this place, right, felt appropriate for that moment, right?”

Almost fifty different types of plants were added around the Old Well during the fall 2024 semester. Previously, the Old Well featured tall hedges, as well as the colorful azaleas that brightened graduation photos during the first two weeks of May, Widis says. Now, the hedges and large trees around the area have been removed. The native plants surrounding the well will bloom at various times throughout the year.

But this landscape will evolve and change over time. Each year, University Facilities will make small tweaks to it. Non-native plants may still be planted in the space in the future, and the design would still be successful, Widis says.

“I don’t think you need to be a strict nativist when it comes to planting, though it obviously comes with a number of ecological and environmental benefits,” Widis says. “In this moment, it just felt like the right thing to do.”

Rather than choosing between yard aesthetics and environmental benefits, organizations across the state seek to increase the demand for native plants by educating the public on how they can achieve both.

And one of the biggest reasons why is that there’s beauty that inherently comes from seeing the diversity of life that flourishes around native plants, Mackintosh says.

Many native plants undergo seasonal shifts throughout the year. From deciduous trees in January to the first hints of trout lily blooming in February, these plants also attract various creatures like butterflies, squirrels, and birds, she says. That’s the beauty of planting native plants.

“I don’t feel like I’m doing it just for the good of the world,” she says. “I mean, I think we get great pleasure out of it, but the greatest pleasure is seeing the life that comes around.”",https://thelocalreporter.press/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cropped-local-reporter-logo-round-3-option-1-3-e1566310206658-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-12 14:04:13.991888

We both subscribe to two fundamental principles that cross party lines: Nevada requires clean, secure power, and Nevada requires strong, secure jobs. What we saw at Steamboat Hills, a plant based on more than 30 years of successful history, is a great model of how geothermal power provides on both.

Our visit highlighted the future of American energy. While solar is an essential piece of Nevada’s clean energy puzzle, the most critical element of this facility is reliability. Geothermal provides always-on baseload power around the clock. This perpetual natural resource is a pillar of grid stability, offering energy independence and a truly resilient system capable of supporting our growing economy.

The economic and community dividends are just as persuasive, demonstrating how clean energy technology can be a cornerstone of regional wealth.

They employ nearly 400 highly skilled professionals right here in the state — high-tech, full-time jobs that support Nevada families throughout the region. In addition, these activities have a strong foundation in our society, producing more than $30 million per year in taxes, royalties and other important economic payments, directly contributing to our state budget and local communities.

This accomplishment is the product of good environmental practice, demonstrating the company's ""full commitment"" to the future in a responsible manner.

Creative solutions outside of IOUs are needed to facilitate a clean, equitable, and just energy transition in the utility space.
This brief will explore alternative models outside of the IOU structure — electric cooperatives, publicly owned utilities, and community choice aggregators — and outline the benefits and drawbacks of each of these in achieving an equitable, clean energy transition.","The energy sector needs creative solutions for addressing the worsening and unevenly distributed impacts of climate change. There is growing scientific consensus that we have already surpassed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, the limit that would have prevented even more dire and irreversible climate consequences like permanent ice sheet melting, loss of entire ecosystems, and intensifying ocean warming. Instead, we are on a trajectory for 2.5 degrees Celsius warming by the end of 2100.

Ever-increasing global temperatures are directly related to more catastrophic events like intensifying droughts, floods, and extreme heat. These climate effects also have disparate impacts on racialized and historically oppressed communities, including communities of color, immigrant groups, the working class, LGBTQ+ communities, and those with limited English proficiency. This is true across educational attainment and age categories.

Longstanding structural forces including white supremacy, settler-colonialism, patriarchy, capitalism, and imperialism have produced deep systemic inequalities and power disparities across economic, social, and political outcomes, and these power differentials perpetuate uneven impacts of climate change. A mix of racist policies and practices stemming from these structural forces, including gerrymandering, mortgage and lending discrimination, and historic disinvestment, has created segregated, under-resourced communities that are especially frontline to environmental and climate catastrophes.

These compounding and intersectional factors have led to a lack of energy-efficient and healthy housing and have led to high energy burden (high amount for energy bills relative to income) for these same communities. Households with higher energy burdens are disproportionately headed by low-wealth people, Black, Latino, and Native American people, older adults, renters, and multigenerational families. In other words, people who have contributed the least to climate change are experiencing its worst effects, including those related to energy pollution and energy burden.

Burning fossil fuels like methane gas, coal, and oil is the leading contributor to the rapid and unprecedented warming over the last 10,000 years. These fuels release carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, which traps heat and warms the planet. Burning these fuels also releases other greenhouse gases and nitrous oxides, which are linked to adverse health outcomes like respiratory illnesses (including asthma), cancer, and heart disease.

These adverse health outcomes are disproportionately high across racialized groups. Due to systemic racism in lending and zoning laws, people of color, especially those who are low wealth, are more likely than other groups to live near oil refineries, gas plants, and other dirty energy infrastructure. Higher and disproportionate exposure to these facilities’ toxic emissions corresponds to higher rates of respiratory problems.

Overall, the electric power sector is second only to the transportation sector in terms of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, 74 percent of all human-produced greenhouse gas emissions come from burning fossil fuels for electricity. Globally, the energy sector produces the most emissions of any sector, accounting for over 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. While the U.S. has seen a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity sector due to investment in renewable energy resources like solar, wind, and geothermal technologies since the 1990s, energy-related carbon emissions increased by 7 percent in 2021, in part due to increased electricity demand as more of the economy electrifies.

Bold action is needed to mitigate the catastrophic and disproportionate climate and health harms from burning fossil fuels for electricity. Decarbonization is one of these bold and essential actions.

Decarbonization — the process of reducing or removing fossil fuels from production by switching to renewable energy resources in energy and economic systems — is necessary to slow or halt the adverse consequences of climate change and carbon dioxide emissions. Some scholars have coined the phrase “deep decarbonization” to describe more specific, impactful interventions, including energy efficiency measures (upgrading residential and commercial heating and cooling systems and insulating homes), removing carbon from the electricity sector (ending the use of coal and natural gas and switching to wind and solar energy on the electric grid), transferring clean energy to building and transportation sectors (solar-powered electric buses), and utilizing natural carbon sinks (replanting forests). Decarbonization must be conducted through the lens of equity and justice to fully and adequately address historic and present harms associated with fossil fuel-based pollution.

The electricity sector needs to deeply decarbonize, and to do so rapidly. However, the predominance of investor-owned electric utilities (IOUs) complicates, disincentivizes, and impedes clean energy investment and development for reasons explained in the Introduction.

Utility decarbonization targets can stem from legislative action like state climate laws, mandates from regulators at public utility commissions, emerging clean energy technology that is lower-cost and lower risk, market demand from customers or other stakeholders, or corporate environmental, social, and governance goals. Collectively, the electricity sector must reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2035 to limit its impact on climate warming, but within the current decarbonization efforts of IOUs, aggregate progress has been lackluster and is only slated to meet 50 percent carbon reduction.

In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — the single largest piece of climate legislation in U.S. history — was signed into law to facilitate, among other things, widespread decarbonization. The IRA was intended to boost a clean energy transition for individuals, municipalities, nonprofits, and industrial stakeholders like electric utilities through subsidies, loans, and adders (a specific type of financial bonus) for energy communities (or, those communities historically overburdened by fossil fuel based pollution). Many core elements of the IRA — including Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Fund, Home Energy Performance-Based Grants, Whole House Rebates and Training Grants, and the High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program — are investments in low-income and disadvantaged communities to promote “legacy pollution reduction, affordable and accessible clean energy for disadvantaged communities, and a better quality of life and good jobs.”

The most prominent provisions of the IRA for utility-scale decarbonization are the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit, with additional credits for low-income communities. Unfortunately, these tax credits for utility-scale solar and wind projects, along with other credits, rebates, and subsidies, are now sunsetting earlier because of tax code changes in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (H.R. 1) passed on July 4, 2025. With the effective repeal of the IRA, three impacts relevant to this brief are likely:

“Reduction in cumulative capital investment in U.S. electricity and clean fuels production by $0.5 trillion from 2025-2035.

Increase of greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 190 million metric tons per year in 2030 and 470 million tons in 2035 — or about 2 percent of 2005 emissions in 2030 and 7 percent in 2035.

Decrease in clean electricity generation in 2035 by more than 820 terawatt-hours — more than the entire contribution of nuclear or coal to the electricity supply today.”

Within the IOU space, the scale and pacing of decarbonizing was already lagging; the effective repeal of the IRA means even fewer industry incentives to decarbonize and more carbon pollution. Creative solutions outside of IOUs are needed to facilitate a clean, equitable, and just energy transition in the utility space.

If IOUs aren’t up to the monumental task of deep decarbonization in the name of an urgent climate crisis, what are the viable alternatives for electricity? This brief will explore alternative models outside of the IOU structure — electric cooperatives, publicly owned utilities, and community choice aggregators — and outline the benefits and drawbacks of each of these in achieving an equitable, clean energy transition. We will also address legal mechanisms and barriers for adopting these alternatives.",https://cpr-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/uploads/2025/11/Advancing-a-Clean-Equitable-Energy-Transition-through-Alternatives-to-Investor-Owned-Utilities.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 10:01:14.263632

Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, has made a strategic decision to relocate its corporate domicile from Delaware to Texas. This move follows the approval of the majority of its stockholders through written consent and does not impact the company's current operations, office locations, or the trading of its shares. The decision is influenced by the favorable business environment in Texas, which is known for lower taxes, a pro-business climate, and a thriving technology ecosystem.

The rationale behind this shift stems from Texas's corporate laws that promote innovation and provide a more predictable legal environment. These laws come with lower litigation risks and enhanced protections for both boards and shareholders. As companies across various sectors reconsider their incorporation locations, Texas has emerged as a prime alternative due to these benefits.

#What Does This Move Mean for the Future of Coinbase?

This transition to Texas reflects broader trends among corporations exploring options beyond Delaware, especially following recent controversies regarding executive compensations that have raised eyebrows within the legal frameworks of some states. By opting for Texas, Coinbase seeks to leverage a more favorable regulatory atmosphere conducive to business growth.

This decision highlights the increasing interest of companies in finding more advantageous legal settings for incorporation. Texas's appeal as a destination for businesses looking to optimize their legal structures is becoming increasingly evident, positioning it as a formidable competitor to traditional hubs like Delaware in the corporate landscape.",https://d39vprqkrd8fxp.cloudfront.net/4eabbc94-a8c4-4f44-a6c6-68d573454ba5/icons/android-icon-192x192.png,N,,2025-11-12 11:04:16.108148

Our goal was to identify ways to change that.” “Participatory science is about science and people,” said David Bonter, co-director of the Center for Science and Engagement at Cornell.
Participating in science from home For many, observing nature from home offers an easy entry into science.
Democratizing discovery Community science invites anyone with curiosity and time to help advance research.
Dayer’s team is expanding who gets to take part in discovery while showing how welcoming science strengthens communities.","When Ashley Dayer, professor in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation, talks about her work, she starts with a simple idea: Everyone deserves a chance to take part in science.

That belief inspired a new study from Dayer’s lab in Virginia Tech's College of Natural Resources and Environment that explores how to make one of North America’s largest bird observation programs – Project FeederWatch – welcoming to everyone who enjoys feeding and watching birds.

Run by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Birds Canada, FeederWatch invites participants across the U.S. and Canada to report bird activity in their backyards. The project connects people to nature while contributing to decades of data about bird populations.

Despite its reach, FeederWatch, like many community science programs, tends to engage a narrow audience. Dayer and postdoctoral researcher Kelley Langhans, the study’s lead author, partnered with colleagues from Cornell University, North Carolina State University, and The Ohio State University to understand how the project could better reflect the broader community of people who feed birds.

“Community science has been a great success for research,” Dayer said. “We know more about birds and ecosystems because of public contributions. But not everyone feels these projects are designed for them, which limits their benefits and creates data gaps. Our goal was to identify ways to change that.”

“Participatory science is about science and people,” said David Bonter, co-director of the Center for Science and Engagement at Cornell. “This study provides vital information for helping us understand how to engage more people in observation, learning, and sharing information about the natural world.”

The study, published Nov. 11 in Citizen Science: Theory and Practice, recommends that FeederWatch collaborate with community organizations, develop educational resources to support participant learning, and clearly show participants how their data support conservation.

Participating in science from home

For many, observing nature from home offers an easy entry into science. Feeding birds and recording observations can provide meaningful connection to nature and contribute to data used by conservation scientists worldwide.

Langhans and Virginia Tech graduate students, including co-author Chris Blume, hosted online focus groups with people who already feed birds but don’t participate in FeederWatch. With help from organizations that promote welcoming outdoor spaces, the team explored opportunities and challenges to making the project more inclusive.

Participants appreciated FeederWatch’s flexibility and the ability to take part from home. The program’s structure — allowing people to collect data on their own time — helps those with busy schedules or limited mobility connect with nature and contribute to science.

Many also spoke about the joy that participation brings. Counting birds offers a chance to notice nature, engage curiosity, and make a meaningful contribution to environmental research.

Supporting participation

Some participants saw the annual fee as a barrier, while others mentioned the need for adaptive technology or materials in additional languages. In response, the research team focused on how the project itself could adapt.

“When we think about growing participation, it’s about designing the project to be welcoming to everyone,” Langhans said. “Adjustments such as waiving fees, creating user-friendly digital tools, and increasing representation in staff and materials can open the door to a wider range of participants.”

By focusing on project design, Dayer said, community science programs can reach more people and produce stronger, more representative data.

“When more people take part, the science gets better,” Dayer said.

Democratizing discovery

Community science invites anyone with curiosity and time to help advance research. Projects like FeederWatch have transformed ecology by generating millions of observations that help scientists monitor species and environmental change.

When done well, these programs also benefit participants — growing skills, addressing local needs, and creating a sense of belonging and purpose. Dayer sees this as a return to community science’s original promise: to democratize discovery.

“Science should be open to everyone,” she said. “Community science was designed to give people the tools to observe the world around them and know they’re contributing to something larger.”

From data to healing

For Dayer, the impact of this work goes beyond research. After her mother underwent a heart transplant, one of the first things Dayer did was help her mother return to watching the bird feeders at her home.

“Watching the birds brought her peace,” Dayer said. “It was something she could do every day — to sit outside, notice what was around her, and feel connected again. That’s the heart of community science. It’s more than data. It’s about what those experiences mean for people.”

This spirit reflects the college's mission to connect people and the natural world through learning and stewardship.

A more welcoming future

Through their partnership with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Dayer and Langhans are sharing their findings with community science programs nationwide. The team hopes the recommendations will guide future adaptations that make science more welcoming, flexible, and relevant to people’s lives.

Dayer’s team is expanding who gets to take part in discovery while showing how welcoming science strengthens communities.

“When everyone has the chance to participate,” Langhans said, “science truly becomes a shared endeavor. That’s how we all learn more about our world.”",https://news.vt.edu/content/dam/news_vt_edu/articles/2025/11/dowwoo1.jpeg.transform/l-medium/image.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 11:04:25.323267

—American Soybean Association","WASHINGTON — The American Soybean Association and the National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) sent a joint letter today [Nov. 12, 2025] to President Donald J. Trump urging swift finalization of key federal biofuel policies needed to strengthen domestic demand for U.S. soy and support farmers facing continued market pressure.

The organizations called for completion of several priority actions, including finalizing EPA’s proposed 2026 to 2027 Renewable Fuel Standard volumes, limiting RIN credit generation from foreign feedstocks and imported biofuels, discouraging imports of used cooking oil and beef tallow that displace domestic soybean oil, ensuring full reallocation of waived RVO volumes tied to small refinery exemptions, and issuing timely Treasury guidance for the revised 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit to reflect congressional changes that prioritize domestic agricultural feedstocks.

ASA has applauded the Trump Administration for its advocacy to secure American energy dominance and U.S. soybean farmers are eager to support domestically produced biofuels made with U.S. soy. Finalizing the 2026 and 2027 Renewable Fuel Standard volume obligations and updating 45Z tax guidance to reflect support for domestically-sourced feedstocks is urgently needed to expand domestic market opportunities for U.S. soybean farmers.

ASA CEO Stephen Censky said the administration’s decisions in the coming weeks will directly influence farmer profitability and future processing investments.

“Farmers need clear and consistent federal policy to expand domestic biofuel production and strengthen the market for American grown soy,” Censky said. “The administration has taken important steps to support U.S. biofuels, and it is essential that these policies are finalized before the end of the year.”

Roughly half of all U.S.-processed soybean oil is used in biomass-based diesel, making biofuels one of the most significant domestic markets for soybeans.

Environmental organizations that oppose the DEP’s intention to grant the permit have asked the department to hold a public hearing on the issue.

The DEP has not made a final decision on whether to hold a public hearing on the permit but will decide based on the substance of comments received during the comment period that ended last week, Aquiline said.

In a 25-page joint letter Nov. 3 to the DEP, the Environmental Integrity Project in Washington, D.C., and the Mountain Watershed Association, an environmental group in Melcroft, contended the DEP should hold a public hearing because of sufficient interest in the plant and its emissions as a large pollution source.

The draft permit “contains many substantive deficiencies that must be fixed before the permit is issued,” including failing to require adequate monitoring to assure compliance with pollution limits for several pollutants from multiple sources at the plant, the environmental groups stated. Those pollutants include volatile organic compounds, sulfuric acid mist and sulfur oxide from plant sources.

The company’s draft permit also should require testing of the smokestacks at least annually for seven pollutants, the Environmental Integrity Project and Mountain Watershed contended.

The agency’s new proposal under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) seeks to make reporting requirements more practical, eliminate duplicative submissions, and focus on collecting the most critical data about PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) – commonly known as ‘forever chemicals.’

With this approach, EPA hopes to ease compliance for manufacturers and importers while continuing to track the environmental and health impacts of these persistent chemicals.

Understanding PFAS and their risks

PFAS are a large family of artificial chemicals widely used for their water- and grease-resistant properties in products such as cookware, textiles, and firefighting foam.

Dubbed forever chemicals, PFAS persist in the environment and accumulate in the human body over time.

Studies have linked exposure to certain PFAS to adverse health effects, including liver damage, thyroid disease, developmental issues, and increased cancer risk.

Environmental contamination is also a concern, as PFAS can migrate from products into soil and water, creating long-term ecological impacts.

The 2023 PFAS reporting rule

In October 2023, the Biden Administration finalised a one-time PFAS reporting and recordkeeping rule under TSCA Section 8(a)(7).

This regulation required manufacturers, including importers, who produced PFAS between 2011 and 2022 to submit detailed data on exposure, environmental effects, and health impacts.

The rule, however, has faced criticism for imposing a nearly billion-dollar compliance cost on industry without providing clear guidance on how collected data would be used to protect the environment.

Significant IT system failures and administrative delays highlighted shortcomings in practical implementation, especially for small businesses and importers. Critics argue that the regulation burdens industry while delivering limited environmental benefit.

Proposed changes to streamline PFAS reporting

EPA’s new proposal seeks to reduce regulatory burdens while maintaining essential data collection.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin emphasises that the changes align with the ‘Powering the Great American Comeback’ initiative, aiming to provide regulatory certainty, lower compliance costs, and focus on the most relevant PFAS information.

Key proposed exemptions include:

PFAS present at 0.1% or lower in mixtures or products

Imported articles

Certain byproducts and impurities

Research and development chemicals

Non-isolated intermediates

Additionally, the agency plans technical corrections to clarify required data fields and adjust submission timelines, ensuring a smoother reporting process.

Zeldin commented: “This Biden-era rule would have imposed crushing regulatory burdens and nearly $1bn in implementation costs on American businesses.

“This proposal is grounded in common sense and the law, allowing us to collect the information we need to help combat PFAS contamination without placing ridiculous requirements on manufacturers, especially the small businesses that drive our country’s economy.”

Balancing safety and efficiency

The EPA’s proposal reflects a broader effort to implement TSCA Section 8(a)(7) in a way that supports both industry and environmental goals.

By targeting unnecessary reporting while retaining critical safeguards, the agency aims to collect meaningful PFAS data without overwhelming businesses.

The Paris-based IEA presented different scenarios for the future of energy in its annual World Energy Outlook -- the first since coming under fire from the government of US President Donald Trump over its oil forecasts.

""The pace varies, but renewables grow faster than any other major energy source in all scenarios, led by solar photovoltaics,"" the agency, which advises mostly developed nations, said in its 518-page report.

In one scenario, ""policy changes mean that the United States has 30 percent less renewables capacity installed in 2035 than in last year's Outlook, but at the global level renewables continue their rapid expansion"".

The report comes as world leaders meet at the UN's COP30 climate conference in Belem, Brazil, which Trump and his government have shunned.

Trump, who has pulled out of the Paris climate accord, wants to expand oil and gas production and roll back the clean energy policies of his predecessor, Joe Biden.

The IEA had to walk a fine line when drafting its latest outlook as it has faced criticism from the Trump administration for projecting dwindling demand for fossil fuels.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright threatened in July to pull out of the IEA if it did not reform how it operates.

- 'Politically motivated' -

The IEA used three scenarios for its World Energy Outlook: one takes into account policies that are currently in place, another looks at ""stated"" government policies including measures that have yet to be adopted, and a third considers a world that reaches net zero emissions by 2050.

Under the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), oil and natural gas demand would increase by 16 percent to 2035 and rise further through to 2050.

The IEA had dropped such scenarios from its reports in 2020.

""That (CPS) scenario is entirely politically motivated,"" Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told reporters at COP30 in Belem.

""The Trump administration, unfortunately, has been setting bad policy in the United States and trying to undermine policy around the world.""

In the IEA's Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), oil demand would peak ""around 2030"" and decline to 100 million barrels per day by 2035 before falling in subsequent years.

In a report in June, the IEA had forecast that global oil demand would fall slightly in 2030, which would mark the first drop since the 2020 Covid pandemic.

The World Energy Outlook said demand for electricity is rising, fuelled by data centres and artificial intelligence in advanced economies and China, along with increasing use of air conditioning in developing countries.

In every scenario, China remains the largest market for renewable energy, accounting for 45 to 60 percent of their global deployment over the next 10 years.

Under every scenario, however, the IEA said the world would exceed 1.5C of warming above pre-industrial levels -- the most ambitious goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

""There is less momentum than before behind national and international efforts to reduce emissions, yet climate risks are rising,"" the report said.

Under the CPS, warming would exceed 2C around 2050 and 2.9C in 2100 -- and then keep rising from there.

In STEPS, warming would exceed 2C by around 2060 and 2.5C by 2100.

But in the net-zero scenario, it would peak at about 1.65C around 2050 and decline slowly after that, before dropping back below 1.5C by 2100, according to the IEA.

The IEA has ""confirmed that no single country can stop the energy transition, with oil and coal demand to peak by 2030 in its business-as-usual scenario"", said David Tong, global industry campaign manager at Oil Change International, a non-profit advocacy group.

During these years, I’ve also done social service and environmental work. I have come to realize how interconnected the inner work of being a healthy human and the bigger efforts to be a healthy community really are. These are not separate, especially in our society right now. As I read comments on various news sources around our region, I realize that we really do have more in common than separates us – at least when it comes to the Google Data Center.

Each time Project Zodiac announces taking more wetlands, requires more unsustainable energy sourcing with ratepayers footing the bill, and applies for more massive diesel generators as back-up, I notice the breadth and depth of our community questioning if any potential benefit of this hyperscale AI data center in SE Allen County will be worth the resources they will extract. In the weeks since Indiana Michigan Power and Hatchworks, LLC have piled on four overlapping applications for more asks, I have met hundreds of new neighbors who have concerns about this center.

We, the people, understand that ordinary people bearing the cost of more energy production by I&M to fuel this complex is bad enough, but bearing the cost with our health and our lives is far too much.

To get into the nitty-gritty, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) uses a capacity of 25% to calculate its air permit limits. Emergency back-up diesel generators are allowed to run up to 100 hours per year for maintenance and non-emergency use, but could potentially be running much more. IDEM’s draft air permit allows the company to release over 980 tons each year of air pollutants! I want to be clear – there is no safe exposure to these ultra-fine particles emitted into the air (called PM 2.5) for human health. Even if there is compliance with the national and state standards, this does not ensure the air is healthy. Health impacts from exposure range from low birth weight, higher infant mortality rates, and cancer to asthma, COPD, and cardiovascular disease.

In a densely populated area, I believe there is no reason Google cannot reduce the total number of emergency diesel generators by increasing the use of battery storage, using renewable energy sources on site, and adding pollution controls to any generators on this site! As an innovative tech company that at one time aimed “to do no evil,” they could certainly bring innovation and ethics to DO better because we deserve better.

As we witness what is unfolding in other AI data center communities and look at the energy demand for this one, we can already predict that this is far from the last “ask” we will get that impacts our air, soil, water, energy and quality of life. More generators may follow, as these 177 massive generators are not nearly enough to keep this monstrosity going when the center is operating full tilt and the grid is unstable. We need to demand transparency about plans from Google regarding this site and urge our city and state leaders to be our advocates. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management must protect our community by requiring the best available control technology on any diesel generators at this site and deny this permit.

It takes a watchful eye to catch permit applications and be on top of the next vote at Citizens Square, but a large coalition of concerned citizens helps a little effort to make a big impact.

There are so many pressures that weigh on us and threaten to divide us, but one hope I have is seeing that throughout our community, we care about people’s health and life opportunities, not just for the wealthiest companies. We can be the best community when we make time to enjoy the goodness Allen County has to offer AND when we make time to invest in our community’s well-being. One engagement provides short-term sustenance and joy, the other makes way for a long-term impact of human resilience. Whether you are fascinated or repelled by AI technology, participate in the public process to learn more. Whether you feel ill-equipped but concerned or come armed with statistics and solutions, join the voices demanding that Google’s air permit be denied until they present a plan that literally has us breathing a little easier. Each of us is worth having the best chance at wholeness and health. Together we will foster a healthier community, one action at a time. Be of courage and hold fast to that which is good – we are worth this effort to protect Allen County.

,American Energy,2025-11-12 13:00:41+00:00,Energy-Storage.News,"71% of Americans surveyed support energy storage, but 'vocal minority' kill or delay projects",April Bonner,,,,,https://www.energy-storage.news/71-of-americans-surveyed-support-energy-storage-but-vocal-minority-kill-or-delay-projects/,"DeBellis says, “We found through the survey that actually, 71% of Americans support energy storage projects in their local community.
For us, this was a pretty surprising result, just because you see a lot of the attention-grabbing headlines in the news about energy storage.” He continues, “We found that only 29% of the Americans that were polled oppose energy storage, and that’s overwhelmingly the minority there, but that minority is very vocal about their concerns.” This vocal minority of Americans opposed to energy storage can significantly impact project development.
In these instances and others like it, fire was brought up as a major concern of residents located near BESS projects.
However, moderator Mike Ryan, the commercial director at developer Constantine Energy Storage, highlighted that public perception frequently contradicts this view.
This standard, titled NFPA 855: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems (ESS), is updated every three years and sets minimum requirements for installing energy storage systems across residential, commercial, industrial (C&I), and utility scales.","Cummings added, “It’s crucial the industry takes a proactive stance in both communication and standard setting. That means engaging early with local stakeholders, explaining the safety measures in place and pushing for modern codes and standards that reflect today’s technologies. We have to go beyond the minimum compliance thresholds.”

In April, Brian Cashion, Director of Engineering at Firetrace, wrote a guest blog for Energy-Storage.news, discussing how community opposition has the greatest potential to hinder the BESS sector’s growth.

“At a broader level, local communities are often unaware of the significant benefits that BESS sites can create, including lower electricity bills, cleaner air and more reliable power. Many local citizens, understandably, don’t want large infrastructure projects near their homes, fearing they could impact property prices and the aesthetics of the local area,” Cashion wrote.

Firetrace’s global head of clean energy, Joe DeBellis, expands on these ideas through the lens of the company’s new report and survey.

Firetrace International manufactures fire detection and suppression systems for various sectors, but with a particular focus on the renewables industry.

‘Unlocking Support for BESS’

The report, ‘Unlocking Support for BESS: How to boost public support for battery energy storage systems’, details the results of a survey of 4,000 people across the entire US, gauging awareness and attitudes toward BESS projects.

DeBellis says, “We found through the survey that actually, 71% of Americans support energy storage projects in their local community. For us, this was a pretty surprising result, just because you see a lot of the attention-grabbing headlines in the news about energy storage.”

He continues, “We found that only 29% of the Americans that were polled oppose energy storage, and that’s overwhelmingly the minority there, but that minority is very vocal about their concerns.”

This vocal minority of Americans opposed to energy storage can significantly impact project development.

DeBellis points out, “We’ve actually seen that through that 29% – various projects over the last few years. I believe there were upwards of nine separate projects that were rejected or delayed in the last year alone, solely due to safety concerns. That’s a lot coming from the vocal minority there that has concerns.”

In July, ESN Premium reported that Marion County in Oregon enacted a moratorium on utility-scale battery storage, following zoning law amendments approved by the Board of Directors (BoD) in June.

A similar situation was reported in June, when renewables developer Prospect14’s hybrid storage project application was reviewed and rejected by town authorities in Chino Valley, Arizona.

In these instances and others like it, fire was brought up as a major concern of residents located near BESS projects.

DeBellis notes of this common concern, “From that survey as well, we saw that 47% of the folks said that they’re going to be more comfortable with a battery energy storage site if they had a clear understanding of safety measures as well. That’s something that can be addressed very early on, not just when the public remarks that, ‘Hey, we’re a little bit concerned.’”

Providing BESS education

Effectively communicating the safety measures could go a long way in building trust with the public, because, as DeBellis highlights, about the 29% of Americans opposed to energy storage identified in the survey:

“Of that 29%, really half of that – so 52% of the folks that oppose energy storage – actually haven’t encountered information about battery energy storage at all. So, the way that we interpret that is a lack of information. It’s not necessarily that they’re truly concerned with the technology. It’s just they haven’t been educated enough.”

Kevin Smith, CEO of developer-operator Arevon Energy, also noted the importance of providing education and pushing back against BESS misinformation in a July interview with ESN Premium.

“If you’re not in the community from the beginning, a lot of misinformation starts circulating. People end up creating Facebook pages with all kinds of inaccurate information. That’s why it’s really important that we get in early and make sure residents have the right information.”

Smith continued, “Obviously, people are going to look online and find other perspectives, but we want to ensure they have accurate information from us so they can weigh that against whatever else they encounter.”

This task becomes increasingly difficult when, as seen recently, government officials parrot incorrect information about BESS safety.

In July, Josh F.W. Cook, the Administrator of the US EPA Pacific Southwest Region, addressed BESS fire incidents after the agency reached a settlement with IPP LS Power to oversee cleanup following a lithium-ion battery fire at the Gateway energy storage site.

Cook said, “I am alarmed by the incidents and impacts of utility-grade battery fires on first responders, specifically the professional firefighters who are exposed to horrible, toxic conditions when batteries catch fire. This settlement action is a step in the right direction, but the broader battery storage fire issue requires additional attention and EPA enforcement.”

While fire incidents involving BESS are serious, they are relatively infrequent, and the occurrence of failure incidents is decreasing. There appears to have been one incident to date in which firefighters in the US have been seriously hurt in a BESS fire incident. In 2019, at the 2.16MWh McMicken facility in Surprise, Arizona, members of a fire crew suffered injuries when an external door to an enclosure blew open while they were investigating.

The EPA did issue BESS safety guidance in August, which noted, “Since 2020, BESS failure incidents have decreased, but some recent fires have gained attention in the media.”

In the Firetrace report, DeBellis highlights what could be a crucial piece of info in helping developers gain support for BESS projects.

He says, “Roughly 70% of citizens said that if these energy storage sites created benefits, like cheaper electricity bills, they would be in favour of them.”

DeBellis continues, “68% wanted reliable power, two-thirds of folks highlighted local jobs and economic benefits as important factors to support.”

The company has also provided this information to the public in many instances, to help build community support and education around BESS.

“The responsibility for (Firetrace and the BESS industry) is to educate the community, educate the public, on technologies, different safety measures that can be done. I think that’s very important as technologies continue to evolve.”

DeBellis says, “It’s important to ask, ‘How do we get out ahead of some of these hurdles and navigate rough waters with some of these projects going up?’”

A similar sentiment was shared during the recent Battery Asset Management Summit UK & Ireland, where a panel of BESS owner-operators, investors, and technical services firms concurred that lithium-ion BESS is generally a safe technology in a discussion about safety strategies, technologies and best practice. However, moderator Mike Ryan, the commercial director at developer Constantine Energy Storage, highlighted that public perception frequently contradicts this view.

The BESS industry is constantly working to improve fire safety measures and communicate the safety of BESS.

In September, the US National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) released the latest version of its key safety standard for battery storage, NFPA 855.

This standard, titled NFPA 855: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems (ESS), is updated every three years and sets minimum requirements for installing energy storage systems across residential, commercial, industrial (C&I), and utility scales.

The standards are adopted by local authorities having jurisdiction (AHJs), various US states, and are often referenced by stakeholders such as financiers and insurers.

In an article for PV Tech Power (Vol.43), Drew Bandhauer, a BESS engineer at Leeward Renewable Energy, stated that NFPA 855 is “the primary fire standard guiding BESS site design and installation, supported by critical sub-chapters, including NFPA 68, NFPA 69, and NFPA 72.”

In April, the American Clean Power Association (ACP), a group representing clean energy industry interests, published Battery Energy Storage: Blueprint for Safety, a safety framework guide for BESS. This was based on an evaluation by fire protection engineering expert group Fire and Risk Alliance, which examined historical data and research on fire incidents in the US over the past decade.

Both ACP and Fire and Risk Alliance stated that their assessment results did not suggest any risks to public health or neighbouring communities stemming from the studied fire incidents.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-74.png,N,,2025-11-12 11:03:13.132831

Billions Flow to US Nuclear Sector With Payoff Still Years Away Back to video

Article content

Article content

In theory, $80 billion can buy enough reactors to power all of Virginia’s Data Center Alley. In reality, traditional reactors take 10 years or more to build, while a highly anticipated wave of small, modular reactors has yet to produce commercial power. That means the only plants that will go into service anytime soon are a handful of shuttered facilities that can be restarted.

Article content

“There’s a lot going on, and nothing is going on,” said BloombergNEF’s head nuclear analyst Chris Gadomski.

Article content

That dissonance underscores how radically, and rapidly, the US energy system has transformed in recent years. Not long ago, utilities were shutting down costly nuclear plants and replacing them with cheaper natural gas-fired and renewable plants. The AI boom has since supercharged electricity consumption, straining power supplies and driving up prices. But while nuclear is suddenly in demand again, logistics and technology constraints threaten to thwart development even with President Donald Trump’s moves to streamline permitting and commit billions of dollars in funding.

It’s possible the nuclear industry can meet Trump’s goal of starting construction on 10 big nuclear reactors by 2030. But there won’t be a lot of wiggle room, said Wyatt Hartley, head of North American asset management for Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. The company is emerging as a key player in the industry, in part because it’s the majority owner of Westinghouse Electric Co., which is expected to be a key beneficiary of the $80 billion reactor deal announced last month.

“Nothing in nuclear happens overnight,” said Jeffrey Merrifield, a former commissioner with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Article content

Besides permitting, developers must line up buyers for the power and hire thousands of skilled workers. And some of the most critical components of a plant, such as reactor vessels and steam generators, can take as long as four years to manufacture and deliver.

Article content

Hartley expects some of those orders to be placed “in the very near term” but, realistically, it will take 10 years to get just two plants up and running.

Until then, some reactor developers are relying on natural gas. Fermi Inc., an energy real estate investment trust co-founded by former Energy Secretary Rick Perry that is developing a massive data center in Texas, placed orders for reactor components last month, but doesn’t expect them to go into service until the early 2030s. Start-ups Blue Energy Global Inc. and First American Nuclear Co. also expect their reactors to be completed next decade. All three companies are installing gas systems to supply data center customers as soon as possible.",https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/reactor-revival-us-will-spend-more-than-350-billion-on-nu.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 10:01:29.946200

It is unclear whether the furloughs are related to this detention or a separate action—Qcells has not yet responded to PV Tech’s requests for comments on the decision—but the episode highlights the vulnerability in global solar supply chains that have undermined the US’ recent push towards greater domestic manufacturing of solar modules.
This imbalance means that US module manufacturers rely on foreign imports of critical components, such as cells, which are exposed to detention by the CBP.
“Our latest supply chain is sourced completely outside of China and our legacy supply chains contain no material from Xinjiang province based on third party audits and supplier guarantees,” Stoepker said.
“Our commitment to building the entire solar supply chain in the United States remains.","“As Qcells introduced new supply chains to support its growing solar panel manufacturing facilities in Georgia, the company was recently forced to scale back production while our shipments into the US were delayed in the customs clearance process,” explained Qcells spokeswoman Marta Stoepker to local news station WSBTV Atlanta.

Earlier this year, PV Tech reported that CBP had detained cells imported by Qcells from Korea to supply the company’s module manufacturing facility in Georgia. It is unclear whether the furloughs are related to this detention or a separate action—Qcells has not yet responded to PV Tech’s requests for comments on the decision—but the episode highlights the vulnerability in global solar supply chains that have undermined the US’ recent push towards greater domestic manufacturing of solar modules.

While the US has successfully expanded its module production—adding 50GW of new capacity last year alone—adding new cell capacity has proven more difficult, with just 2GW of new capacity added in the first nine months of this year. This imbalance means that US module manufacturers rely on foreign imports of critical components, such as cells, which are exposed to detention by the CBP.

QCells is working on what would be the US’s first c-Si integrated ingot-to-module production facility to minimise supply chain disruptions such as this; however, it is not due to be in operation until early next year.

‘No material from Xinjiang province’

The assumption is that Qcells is thought to not be in compliance with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which prevents materials and components made in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), and that are suspected of being made with forced labour, from entering the US.

Fellow manufacturer Maxeon has seen its modules detailed by the CBP under this act, and while CBP has not specified the conditions under which the Qcells cells have been detained, Stoepker emphasised that the company’s products are not linked to the XUAR.

“Our latest supply chain is sourced completely outside of China and our legacy supply chains contain no material from Xinjiang province based on third party audits and supplier guarantees,” Stoepker said. “Our commitment to building the entire solar supply chain in the United States remains. We will soon be back on track with the full force of our Georgia team delivering American-made energy to communities around the country.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/QCells-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 11:03:16.908289

The filings — Resource Report 1 (General Project Description) and Resource Report 10 (Alternatives Analysis) — define the project’s purpose, design, and site alternatives. They form a cornerstone of Argent LNG’s continued progress under the FERC pre-filing process, signaling engineering and environmental excellence guided by Louisiana know-how and American energy values.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, America is reasserting itself as the global energy superpower,” said Jonathan Bass, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Argent LNG. “Argent LNG is proud to carry that mission forward — a Louisiana-built project, aligned with a national strategy to expand energy exports, create American jobs, and restore our position as the arsenal of global energy security.”

Rooted in its ‘America First’ philosophy, Argent LNG’s project combines Gulf Coast expertise with U.S. innovation. The company’s engineering foundation is led by GIS Engineering, a Louisiana firm with over three decades of experience in coastal and industrial infrastructure, delivering below-the-bolts precision to every aspect of site design, marine works, and permitting.

Through partnerships with Baker Hughes (Power, Compression and liquefaction modules), Honeywell UOP (gas pre-treatment), ABB (power and automation), and GTT (LNG tank engineering), Argent LNG integrates proven American and allied technologies to deliver lower-carbon, modular LNG production that strengthens both energy supply and national security.

Meanwhile, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least a third by 2035 after being stagnant for years.
Regional Dynamics The IEA says building greater resilience in energy systems is especially important as data centers, heating and cooling, electrification and more drive energy demand.
But energy analysts said the shift to clean power is happening regardless of climate policy around the world.
EV sales are taking off in many emerging countries, solar is permeating even through the Middle East,” said Dave Jones, chief analyst at global energy think tank Ember.","ASSOCIATED PRESS (AP) – Electricity demand will rise much faster than overall energy growth in the coming decades, underscoring the need for diversified energy sources, according to an analysis released Nov. 12.

The report by the International Energy Agency said renewable energy, led by solar power, will grow faster than any other major source in the next few years and that coal and oil demand will likely peak globally by the end of this decade. The report noted that many natural gas projects were approved in 2025, due to changes in U.S. policy, indicating worldwide supply will rise even as questions remain about how it will be used. Meanwhile, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least a third by 2035 after being stagnant for years.

The release of the annual World Energy Outlook coincided with U.N. climate negotiations in Brazil this week where global leaders are calling for ways to curb the planet’s warming.

Regional Dynamics

The IEA says building greater resilience in energy systems is especially important as data centers, heating and cooling, electrification and more drive energy demand. Investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion this year, exceeding investment in the oil supply, according to the report.

Growing economies including India and nations in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, will “increasingly shape energy market dynamics in the years,” the IEA said, noting their potential for solar power.

China, meanwhile, has accounted for half the global growth in demand for oil and gas, and more than half for electricity, since 2010.

“In a break from the trend of the past decade, the increase in electricity consumption is no longer limited to emerging and developing economies,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a release. Birol said that electricity use is also rising in advanced economies.

Nations are grappling with meeting demand while preparing for the risks brought on by the planet’s warming. The IEA says the world is falling short on universal energy access and climate change goals. Around 730 million people still live without electricity, according to the IEA, and despite progress, nearly one-quarter of the global population still relies on inefficient cooking methods that hurt their health or the environment. 2024 was also the hottest year on record.

Nations should diversify their energy sources and cooperate to expand supply chains for critical minerals used to make things like batteries for electric vehicles and components for solar and wind power generation, the IEA said. This also includes making quick improvements to the grid, energy storage and broader infrastructure.

“When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,” Birol said. “With energy security front and (center) for many governments, their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals – on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change.”

Global Reaction

The Nov. 12 edition of the yearly report is the first released since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Trump’s administration has for a second time opted out of the Paris agreement, rolled back dozens of climate regulations, slashed federal support for renewable energies such as wind and solar power and is reversing the “endangerment finding” that sits at the core of U.S. climate policy.

Trump has pledged his support instead to the fossil fuel industry, investing in coal and loosening restrictions on pollution.

But energy analysts said the shift to clean power is happening regardless of climate policy around the world.

“The evidence on the ground is overwhelming. EV sales are taking off in many emerging countries, solar is permeating even through the Middle East,” said Dave Jones, chief analyst at global energy think tank Ember. “Renewables and electrification will dominate the future.”

Maria Pastukhova, energy transition program lead at climate change think tank E3G, said the report makes “the choices for the global energy system and the global economy unambiguous.”

“If countries want to grow their economies and protect their citizens from roller-coaster energy prices, they need to focus relentlessly on energy efficiency and the (decarbonization) of energy demand,” Pastukhova said.

Others, however, were critical. Ben Backwell, CEO of the Global Wind Energy Council, said the outlook does not fully capture the momentum in renewables, and that it should have emphasized the trajectory for renewable energy is accelerating, driven by the decreasing cost of the technologies, strong policy support and the move toward electrification.

“We’re accelerating,” he added. “You can see it all around the world and we can see it in our numbers for last year, but also in our numbers for the first half of this year. It looks very, very exciting, both for wind and for solar, in fact, and for next year, even more so.”

Yes, folks involved in agriculture do like each other. However, in an email to me Startling noted his biggest fear is that we still somehow end up circling the wagons and shooting at ourselves.

Cooperation is needed now more than ever in these difficult times. The livestock sector is doing well these days, while the crop side is suffering, so there is a disconnect. Indeed, the cycle will likely turn again to where the livestock side will suffer as crops prosper.

Certainly, both livestock and crop producers would prefer stability rather than the uncertainty of boom-and-bust cycles. Cooperation between both sectors remains paramount.

In difficult times, it is all the more important to stay unified. The good news is that farmers and those who serve them remain committed to the cause. They haven’t given up.

The listing comes after a wave of electric vehicle startups went public during the pandemic-era SPAC boom with the aim of capitalizing on the huge demand for clean-energy vehicles and government incentives for the purchase of battery-powered cars.

However, since then a number of trucking and vehicle tech startups including Nikola, Lordstown Motors, and Proterra have gone bankrupt due to competitive pressures, operational challenges, rapid cash burn due to high production costs, and an inability to achieve profitability.

Autonomous trucking firms are looking to automate shipping and logistics amid heightened demand for quicker freight deliveries as they seek to commercialize self-driving technology, which faces sharp regulatory scrutiny.

With the listing, Einride is seeking up to $100 million of private investment in public equity to accelerate its growth. The deal is also bolstered by the $100 million it raised in October from existing and new institutional investors.

Existing shareholders of Einride are expected to own around 83% of equity after the deal closes and the company’s existing management team will continue to lead the firm.

A SPAC is a shell firm that raises money through an IPO to merge with a private business and take it public, providing a quicker route to market than a traditional IPO.

Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, Einride’s business is based on self-driving technology for freight trucks. The firm has over 25 enterprise customers including GE Appliances and has a fleet of around 200 electric vehicles.

Hydrogen has seen significant growth over the past few years, with California displaying a special proclivity for the renewable energy resource. Some have noted that the shelving of federal funds is merely a punishment for California’s Governor waging a social media war with US President Donald Trump.

The cancellation of federal funds has been a hit to the California hydrogen dream

Hydrogen has long been overlooked by the international energy community as a viable energy resource, however, that reality has started to shift in recent years as many nations now have strategic plans and policies in place to boost hydrogen production and usage, While the majority of the United States has steered clear of hydorgen, California has plans to become the spirituial home for hydrogen in the United States.

Those plans for California to embrace the hydrogen sector have hit a major snag recently, with the federal government rolling back any progress made in the previous administration that aimed to boost the renewable energy sector in the United States. State-run ARCHES green hydrogen hub has been forced to halt development as the Trump administration has canceled over $1.2 billion in DOE support.

California has been waging a theoretical war with the current administration

Many insiders have noted that the real reason behind the cancellation of federal funds for ARCHES is the latest conflict between US President Donald Trump and California’s Governor Gavin Newsom. Newson has been posting satirical posts online that mock the President’s online style, not to mention the redistricting vote that California recently held to offset a similar move by Texas.

The Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems was supposed to establish a home for hydrogen in America

The joint project was supposed to build a flagship hydrogen hub in California, connecting several hydrogen facilities to a state-run project aimed at boosting production and usage of the renewable energy resource. However, the federal government has opted to cancel funding for the project as part of a broader fiscal cut to the budget.

The ARCHES project boasted support from several institutions and organizations that aimed to boost the standing and reputation of the American hydrogen sector, such as:

California Governor Gavin Newsom’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz)

the University of California

The State Building and Construction Trades Council

Renewables 100 Policy Institute

ARCHES was set to receive the largest single allocation of the $8 billion Hydrogen Hubs Program, which was set to roll out in the near future. The initial plan for the ARCHES project was to connect hydrogen pipelines and infrastructure to deliver 220,000 direct jobs in the energy sector and hopefully attract business from the state’s largest companies, such as Amazon, Chevron, GE, Toyota, and Plug Power.

The news comes after the French automaker terminated its project with technology firm Valeo focused on rare-earth-free EV motor and is part of efforts to reduce cost.

China accounts for about 70% of global rare earths mining and 85% of refining.

Beijing’s tightening export curbs have forced the industry to race for alternative supply.

Renault has deployed rare-earth-free motors since 2012 and said in late 2023 it was collaborating with Valeo on a higher-power, more compact unit.

One of the sources said: “The E7A engine project is no longer being done with Valeo. It will be done entirely in-house across the entire value chain, except for the stator which could be bought from a Chinese supplier.”

Even if a Chinese company supplies the stator, Renault plans to manufacture the motor at its Cléon plant in France.

STMicroelectronics will provide silicon carbide modules for the inverter.

A representative for Renault’s EV subsidiary Ampere said, “A Chinese partner is a possibility” but a decision is yet to be made.

Valeo did not comment.

The new rare-earth-free motors are slated to power Renault’s next generation of compact EVs from 2028.

The E7A motor is expected to deliver 200 kW, around 25% more than current units used in models such as the Scenic.

It will incorporate an 800-volt system, double that of current Renault EVs, to shorten charging times.

Rise and fall of solar subsidies Congress first established a tax credit for some residential solar investments in 1978, but the subsidy expired in 1985.
That solar credit will now largely disappear at the end of 2027, at least five years earlier than it would have.
“Look, they were going to expire,” Lawler said of the solar subsidies.
Dampening a solar boom The use of rooftop panels by Republicans illustrates the growing economic appeal of solar energy, industry data shows.","At least three Republican lawmakers took advantage of a decades-old rooftop solar credit that will end in January due to President Donald Trump’s megalaw, according to a review of property records and satellite imagery by POLITICO’s E&E News.

The lawmakers — with solar arrays on a California villa, a $3 million Utah manse and an off-the-grid Kentucky homestead — all supported ending the perk this summer that sliced thousands of dollars off the cost of installing their panels.

California Rep. Ken Calvert, a long-serving Republican who was thrust into a race next year with a member of his own party when the state redrew his conservative district, defended voting to end the solar credit that he used about 15 years ago to offset the cost of putting two rows of panels on the back roof of his ranch-style house in Southern California.

“It never was supposed to be permanent,” Calvert said of the credits — a line echoed by other Republicans who criticized renewable energy as unreliable and dependent on subsidies. The law that Trump called his “one big beautiful bill” passed Congress with no Democratic votes and the support of all but five Republicans.

E&E News examined the rooftops of 112 members of Congress: every Senate Republican and 59 House GOP lawmakers who are in leadership or facing tough reelection races.

The search found that at least seven Republican lawmakers had rooftop panels. Three of them acknowledged using the federal tax credit to help pay for the arrays. One couldn’t recall. Another had leased a solar system that was indirectly subsidized via a separate tax credit for installers. And two other lawmakers didn’t respond to questions about their panels, which were on properties they had recently owned.

In addition to Calvert, the other Republican lawmakers who are known to have collected the residential solar credit are Sen. John Curtis of Utah and Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian who voted against Trump’s megalaw but said in an interview he supports rescinding the solar subsidy — and all tax credits. Curtis said Democrats and solar companies “knew that it was time for the subsidies to go.”

The revelations come at a time of rising utility rates and increasing politicization of energy as the Trump administration scraps grants, loans and permits for solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies. The president has dismissed solar panels as part of Democrats’ “green new scam” and called them “a blight on our country.”

Trump’s megalaw reinforced the partisan divide on energy. While the legislation primarily extended tax cuts passed in the president’s first term and provided $300 billion for border enforcement and military programs, it also slashed over $484 billion in clean energy incentives. Despite the megalaw’s deep cuts for climate programs, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

The law was a double-whammy for the solar industry. It speeds up the phase-out of both the rooftop solar subsidy tapped by Calvert, Curtis and Massie as well as another credit relied on by project developers to cut the price of leased panels. At the same time, it boosted an oil subsidy created in the early 1900s and included other provisions to increase the production of fossil fuels that are primarily responsible for global warming.

“There has been a push, as you know, for a long while to get rid of those tax credits,” said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, whose Capitol Hill rowhouse roof has been layered with solar panels for about a decade. “And then when you had Trump come into office, he made it very clear that this was not something that he was going to continue supporting.”

A key swing vote on the megalaw, Murkowski couldn’t recall if she received the credit, which can save homeowners thousands of dollars by refunding 30 percent of the cost of buying and installing panels. Analysts say almost everyone who buys a new solar system — the average cost of which is now about $30,000 — files for the benefit.

Rise and fall of solar subsidies

Congress first established a tax credit for some residential solar investments in 1978, but the subsidy expired in 1985.

The tax credit was revived in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 — a sweeping law signed by President George W. Bush that Murkowski and Calvert voted for at the time.

In the years since, the so-called residential clean energy credit has been extended and broadened in scope several times, most recently when Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 with no Republican votes. The clean energy spending package would have allowed homeowners to claim tax credits of between 22 and 30 percent of the cost of qualifying solar, wind, geothermal and battery projects through 2034.

Then on July 4, Trump signed the megalaw that moved up the expiration of the residential clean energy credit by nearly a decade.

The legislation also accelerated the end of a 30 percent investment tax credit that’s used by solar installers to lower the cost of leasing panels for their customers. That solar credit will now largely disappear at the end of 2027, at least five years earlier than it would have.

New York Rep. Mike Lawler lives in a suburban home in the Hudson River Valley with rooftop panels that he leases from Vivint Solar. His district narrowly supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, making him one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress.

Lawler was among a group of GOP lawmakers who repeatedly urged House leaders to protect clean energy subsidies when the party was overhauling the tax code this year. Those efforts were largely unsuccessful, and Lawler voted for the bill.

“We didn’t get everything we wanted, but we were able to keep a lot of the provisions and labor standards, etc.,” he said in an interview.

The panels on Lawler’s house have helped him avoid the impacts of rising electricity costs. Since he began leasing the solar system in 2016, it has saved him “a few thousand bucks,” he estimated.

“Look, they were going to expire,” Lawler said of the solar subsidies. “And it was phased out — a little more accelerated than some would like — but people are still able to utilize them.”

Lawler indirectly benefited from the investment tax credit, analysts say, because it helps companies reduce the costs their customers pay for leasing rooftop solar systems. After 2027, when the investment tax credit disappears, it could be harder for people to lease panels or buy electricity from community solar projects, according to Zoë Gaston, an analyst at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

“Solar will definitely be more expensive,” she said. “It could be as much as a 30 percent increase. I know from talking to lots of installers that they’re trying to find other opportunities to cut costs.”

California Reps. Darrell Issa and Young Kim, both Republicans who voted for the megalaw, also had solar panels on homes they once owned. Public records show Issa sold his property last year. Kim transferred hers to a family trust in 2024 that now operates it as a rental property. She is facing a primary from Calvert.

Their offices did not respond to questions about whether the lawmakers had taken advantage of federal subsidies to purchase or lease the panels.

Dampening a solar boom

The use of rooftop panels by Republicans illustrates the growing economic appeal of solar energy, industry data shows.

A renewable energy trade group estimated in 2004 that the nation installed enough panels that year to produce a total of 58 megawatts of power, enough for about 8,000 homes. Installations have exploded in popularity since then. Last year, the U.S. added over 50 gigawatts of solar capacity — 865 times higher than 2004 levels — with 4.8 GW of that annual growth coming from the residential sector alone, according to solar industry data. Seven percent of U.S. homes now have solar systems.

The megalaw is likely to blunt the solar boom as it amplifies other challenges facing the industry, such as high interest rates and Trump’s tariffs, according to analysts. Three large companies have already filed for bankruptcy protection this year, with more expected to become insolvent in the coming months. Wood Mackenzie estimates that solar installations over the next decade would be 17 percent lower than it had previously forecast.

Curtis and Murkowski both argued that phasing out solar subsidies was necessary.

“I think universally, everybody — including our Democratic colleagues, including the industry — knew that it was time for the subsidies to go,” said Curtis, who along with Murkowski shaped the megalaw to make it slightly less difficult for companies to access the investment tax credit before it ends. “Nobody fought harder than I did for the off-ramp for those, because I felt like the off-ramp was appropriate.”

Democrats and solar companies disagreed with Curtis. Abigail Ross Hopper, the head of the Solar Energy Industries Association, warned on July 1 that the compromise legislation he and Murkowski had brokered “will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide.”

Curtis founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021 while he was serving in the House. Two years later, he invited a climate media company to tour his home in Provo, Utah, where he showed off his solar panels and geothermal heat pump, while bragging about the hundreds of dollars per month they helped him save in energy costs. The panels and heat pump were both eligible for the residential tax credit he voted to terminate.

Back on Capitol Hill, Murkowski said her husband decided to install panels on their rowhouse about a decade ago. The senator, who once chaired the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, couldn’t recall if they had filed for the federal tax credit.

“He was a real skeptic of solar and solar panels, more specifically, because he didn’t think that they were really going to make a difference for him as a consumer, as an individual,” Murkowski said, referring to her husband, Verne Martell.

What changed his mind, she said, was seeing the electricity savings of his then-87-year-old mother, who has solar panels on her home in Maui, Hawaii.

“It was an education for him that allowed him to do more research about how it might work in Washington, D.C.,” Murkowski said. “I do like the fact that our utility bills are really manageable now. And you know, it took a while, but it paid off.”

New fossil fuel subsidies

Republicans’ justification for killing rooftop solar credits are undercut by their continued support for incentives that go to the fossil fuel industry, argued Jesse Lee, a former senior adviser to the National Economic Council during the Biden administration.

“We’ve had subsidies and tax credits for oil production for more than a century. So I don’t really understand this argument that all clean energy tax credits must come to an end,” said Lee, who is now a spokesperson for the environmental advocacy group Climate Power.

“And not only did they leave the century-old oil industry subsidies untouched, they gave new tax loopholes to the oil industry,” he added. For instance, the megalaw established a 2.5 percent production tax credit for steel-making coal, cut royalty rates for coal mining and oil drilling on federal land, and eased restrictions on tax deductions for oil drilling costs — a subsidy that dates back to 1913.

Murkowski wasn’t comfortable with the megalaw’s energy contradictions.

“It’s kind of putting your finger on the scale, if you will, and picking winners and losers in the energy space,” she said. “I don’t think we should do that.”

But overall, she thought the bill was “more positive than negative in a lot of different areas,” she said. Murkowski was one of the final Republican holdouts on the bill, which passed the Senate with a tiebreaking vote by Vice President JD Vance.

Massie, whose Kentucky farmhouse appears to have more solar panels than the homes of his GOP colleagues, was one of only two House Republicans to oppose the megalaw. He voted against it because he thought the bill didn’t go far enough in cutting energy and health care subsidies.

“I would end all the tax credits. For everything,” said Massie, who earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has enough solar and battery systems to live off the grid. “I bought the bulk of mine before the federal tax credit.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d7/41/b41a2dcd46419e20c32ff86c2217/main-ee-solarcredits-new.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:01:10.805356

Kennedy famously implored a new generation of Americans to serve their country. Almost 64 years later, Jack Schlossberg, his only grandson, is now heeding the call for generational change from Democratic voters as the party’s leaders continue to cling to office well into their 70s.

Schlossberg, 32, announced Wednesday morning in a video posted to social media that he’s running for the House seat of 78-year-old Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who is set to retire after 34 years representing the heart of Manhattan. The video was not cheeky, controversial and eyebrow raising as much of his content as “JackUno” often is.

Instead, Schlossberg notified his nearly 800,000 follower in a serious and earnest tone of his desire to represent his hometown district and fight against the Trump administration from within the halls of Congress.

“It’s certainly time for a new generation of Americans to step up and ask what they can do for their country,” Schlossberg said in an interview with MSNBC ahead of his announcement. “And I think that it shouldn’t just be about someone’s age. It should be specifically about young candidates — any age candidates — who understand policy and how to compete in this political environment, which is toxic.”

Like other Democrats, Schlossberg sees President Donald Trump’s policies and behavior as causing what he called corruption, affordability and constitutional crises. But unlike other elected Democrats and candidates, the New York City native is leaning into his influencer credentials to fuel his first run for elected office. He sees taking it to Trump on social media as not just clickbait but a necessity in an attention economy dominated by right-wing X posters, podcasters and YouTube influencers spreading the Trump gospel.

“One thing we can do is elect candidates who know how to communicate and cut back in this toxic political environment that we find ourselves in,” Schlossberg said. “New media is completely polluted and the air is dirty. I figured out a way to breathe in that environment, and we need to elect candidates who understand how to do that, and I think that’s what makes me an effective representative.”

Schlossberg isn’t shying away from the personal nature of the fight against Trump — who has sought to dismantle the Kennedy legacy — or against his cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump appointed Health and Human Services secretary after a failed presidential run that was Camelot-coded.

Schlossberg’s online following ballooned last year, in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, as he tried on various characters and presented his followers with accented impersonations. He was the first in his family to publicly criticize his cousin, and drew attention for trolling the now-HHS secretary and Trumpism.

Schlossberg also appeared as a surrogate on the 2024 campaign trail, spending the months ahead of the election traveling the country and making cameos in viral videos with elected officials in hopes of turning out young voters. Schlossberg’s “trolling for a cause” model, as he called it, recently has been embraced by high-profile Democrats such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and others who have started posting slightly unhinged or lacerating social media messages directed at Trump and MAGA world, oftentimes in all caps and with exaggerated punctuation.

“In the lead-up to the 2024 election, I saw a problem that I wanted to do something about, and that’s that the internet and new media is dominated by the right — and it has been for a decade,” said Schlossberg. “I want to offer a different perspective, an alternative perspective, and get the Democratic Party’s message out there to reach people. So I use my own creativity, a little bit of courage, to put my neck out there and speak up for what I believe in. And I learned a lot doing that.”

But Schlossberg’s in-real-life takeaway from his experience on the campaign trail wasn’t as sarcastic or mischievous, departing from his online brand.

“I learned that the Democratic Party is not dead or dying there,” he added. “I met thousands of people across the country. I went to almost every single swing state, and I met people, young and old, who are excited to join our cause and do whatever they can to stop this president from enacting his agenda.”

Schlossberg joins a growing primary field for Nadler’s heavily Democratic district in which a primary win is tantamount to victory. Micah Lasher, a New York state assembly member and Nadler protégé, jumped into the race in September, along with Liam Elkind, a 26-year-old nonprofit founder. Nadler told The New York Times last month that any endorsement of a successor “is way down the road.”

If elected, Schlossberg could serve in Congress while his cousin holds a Cabinet position. As HHS secretary, RFK Jr. has departed radically from his uncle’s Democratic legacy, slashing health research funding, laying off hundreds of federal workers, and weakening vaccine policy. Schlossberg argued that fighting the Trump administration is not just about his family’s legacy, but about the “generations of Americans and New Yorkers who fought and sacrificed to build this country.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251111-jack-schlossberg-kennedy-congress-es-571c58.jpg",N,,2025-11-12 07:01:15.931091

Young people and those with higher education are the most optimistic.

The transition to a sustainable economy — based on renewable energy and clean technologies — have broad popular support in Brazil. According to research released by the Brazilian Agency for Industrial Development (ABDI) in partnership with Nexus, Three out of four Brazilians believe that the green economy will bring new jobs..

The survey indicates that 75% of respondents believe that the shift to a sustainable economic model will be accompanied by... generating job opportunities, while only 16% express pessimism regarding this scenario. The research therefore reinforces that the advancement of clean energy is seen not only as an environmental response, but also as a solid alternative for social and economic growth.

Positive outlook across all income levels.

According to the study, the perception that the green economy can boost the job market is stronger among higher-income individuals. Among those who receive above five minimum wages78% believe that the sustainable transition will create new jobs. The same percentage is observed among those who earn from two to five minimum wages, followed by 76% among those with income between one and two minimum wages.

Even among workers who receive up to a minimum wageHowever, optimism remains high: 67% say they expect an improvement in job opportunities. These numbers indicate that confidence in job growth is strong. renewable energy It is widespread across all social strata, albeit with varying degrees of intensity.

Education and professional qualifications influence perception.

The study also shows that education has a direct impact on the vision of the future of the green economy. Among Brazilians with complete higher education79% believe that the transition to a sustainable model will increase job creation. Among those who completed the... high school, 78% share this opinion, while 68% of respondents with complete primary education They believe that the green economy will bring improvements to the job market.

To Ricardo CappelliAccording to the president of ABDI, the advancement of renewable energies will require more qualified and better-paid professionals.

""Therefore, it is natural that those with more education and income are better able to see the opportunities that this change can bring,"" he highlighted in an official statement.

The official's statement reinforces the importance of investing in technical and technological education to meet the growing demand for professionals prepared to work in the low-carbon economy.

Gender, age, and region also shape the optimism of Brazilians.

The research shows striking differences in perception between demographic groups. Men 59% believe more in the creation of new jobs through the green economy than women (49%).

Age also influences perspectives on the topic. younger, between 16 and 24 years, are the most optimistic: 62% believe that the renewable energy New opportunities will open up. The same pattern holds true among people of 25 the 40 years (59%). Among the 41 and 59 years, the confidence rate falls to 49%, and among the over 60 years, it reaches 46%.

Terry McAuliffe has joined Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future as a co-chair to promote natural gas as a route to long-term energy reliability as renewable energy sources are built out, the organization announced Tuesday.

The organization promotes moving away from coal burning plants and using natural gas to reliably support solar and wind power generation. Touted as advocates for an “all of the above” energy profile, the group is expanding their reach into the commonwealth to promote gas power alongside renewable energy in hopes to bring down utility bills while cutting emissions, despite the commonwealth’s plan to eventually eliminate fossil fuels.

“As a Virginian who knows the importance of natural gas to my Commonwealth’s economy, I believe that we must come together to secure a reliable and affordable energy future,” McAuliffe said in a statement.

McAuliffe will lead the organization with former Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, former U.S. Reps. Kendrick Meek of Florida and Tim Ryan of Ohio and former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter.

The group points to studies that suggest transitioning to 100% renewable energy will be cost prohibitive and meeting peak demand for energy will prove a challenge. Natural gas in conjunction with renewable sources will allow the demand to be met at a reasonable cost, the group has said.

Reporting by the Guardian and Floodlight show that Natural Allies is backed by fossil fuel companies to appeal to young, liberal, non-White constituents. Their mission is to focus on how gas is “cleaner” than coal, yet fossil fuels remain a major driver in climate change.

Ryan said this strategy “can show Democrats they don’t have to choose between environmental progress and economic reality. We can lead on both fronts.” Environmental groups believe the messaging from the group is “greenwashing” the impacts of gas power on the climate.

Natural Allies states that they work with lawmakers to educate them on how they can marry gas power and renewable energy to meet their states’ needs. The group is largely focused on Virginia, New York, and New Jersey and stresses the significantly lower carbon emissions that natural gas emits compared to coal fired plants.

In Chesterfield, that is a common argument made in support of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, a proposed gas peaking plant to be built on the site of a former coal plant. Hundreds of residents in the area have been fiercely opposing the plant and say they want to prevent additional pollutants being released into the surrounding communities.

Still, Natural Allies’ website reads that “Without natural gas, higher-emitting fuels like coal and oil would be needed to keep lights on. Additionally, rising energy costs will disproportionately impact vulnerable households — worsening health, education, and economic outcomes.”

McAuliffe served as Governor of Virginia from 2014-2018, before the Virginia Clean Economy Act passed in 2020 – which mandates utilities retire gas powered plants by 2050.

He is “recommitted more than ever” to advocating for a universal health care system in the U.S.
The shutdown was not a waste of time because “fighting for Americans’ health care is not a waste of time,” Bennet said.","After the Senate passed a stopgap funding bill that does not include extended Affordable Care Act tax credits, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet is not confident that a future floor vote in the Senate will lead to an extension.

“I don’t have confidence about how that vote is going to turn out,” Bennet said in a press call Tuesday. “I don’t expect any Republicans in the Senate to change their vote, and I don’t expect the House to try to pass that bill. We could end up being surprised by that, but I wouldn’t hold out hope for that.”

The U.S. Senate voted 60-40 Monday on a stopgap spending bill that will reopen and fund the federal government through Jan. 30 following the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Members of the House of Representatives began traveling back to Washington, D.C. this week, as the chamber will need to pass the Senate-approved measure before the government will reopen.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Democrats a floor vote on an extension of the tax credits will occur in December, part of a deal struck with seven Democrats and one independent to advance the spending bill, despite it not including an extension of enhanced premium tax credits to support Americans who purchase health insurance through the individual marketplace.

The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. In the absence of those enhanced federal subsidies, the average cost to purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace, will more than double next year.

Bennet and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, both Colorado Democrats, voted against the measure because it “did nothing” to extend the tax credits expiring at the end of the year, Bennet said. He said he thinks the Democrats who voted to pass the stopgap measure made a judgement that the downsides of continuing the shutdown overrode the benefits.

“I obviously didn’t share that judgment, but that was their judgment,” Bennet said.

While he is “deeply disappointed” with the outcome in the Senate, Bennet, who is running for Colorado governor in 2026, said he will continue to push for an extension of the tax credits as well as broader reform of the country’s health care system. He is “recommitted more than ever” to advocating for a universal health care system in the U.S.

The shutdown was not a waste of time because “fighting for Americans’ health care is not a waste of time,” Bennet said. But he said there is no plan B to help Coloradans facing higher insurance premium costs.

“For months, we urged President (Donald) Trump and Republicans to come to the table and extend the tax credits — which are already existing law and simply need to be extended — to give families a little bit breathing room, to make healthcare a little bit more affordable, and they’ve refused,” Bennet said.

Bennet declined to say if he still supports Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has faced calls from progressive groups and some Democratic House members to step down from leadership after failing to hold his caucus together in the shutdown fight.

Americans will make the judgement that Democrats continue to fight for affordable healthcare while Republicans make it more expensive, Bennet said, as Republicans have fought against the Affordable Care Act since it was first introduced.

“We now know that we will never have an improved health care system as long as Donald Trump is our president and we have a majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate,” Bennet said.

Many major federal government operations have been shut down since Oct. 1. The Trump administration laid off many federal workers during the shutdown, a move that will be reversed under the Senate-approved measure. Bennet said his office will work to reach out and make sure workers who were laid off in Colorado know that they could be reinstated.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-11-at-4.24.05 PM-2048x1309.png,N,,2025-11-12 07:01:18.525390

U.S. automakers are adapting to these pressures.
Q: Can U.S. automakers match Chinese prices?
Q: What advantages do U.S. automakers have?","Detroit’s automotive leaders are sounding alarms as Chinese automakers rapidly expand in the global electric vehicle (EV) market, highlighting both opportunities and challenges for the U.S. industry. While China’s automotive sector has surged under extensive state support, U.S. executives insist that adopting similar practices is not a feasible or desirable path.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley described Chinese EV companies, including BYD Co. Ltd., which sells models under $10,000, as “an existential threat” to traditional U.S. manufacturers. However, he emphasized that American companies have distinct advantages in infrastructure, innovation, and workforce experience, which can help them maintain a competitive edge.

“Ford will always advocate for policies that level the playing field,” Farley told The Detroit News. “We’ve made progress in the U.S., but government support still lags behind the extensive subsidies and incentives offered by China.” Farley also noted growing bipartisan support for policies aimed at strengthening U.S. automakers’ global competitiveness.

China’s dominance in automotive manufacturing is the result of decades of coordinated policy efforts. After the 1980s, foreign automakers entered China through joint ventures with domestic companies, often state-controlled, and the market only exceeded 2 million vehicle sales annually after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. By 2024, China’s annual vehicle sales topped 31 million, with EVs and plug-in hybrids now representing the majority of the market.

Experts point to China’s long-term industrial planning, particularly the 2015 “Made in China 2025” initiative, as a critical factor in the country’s sustained growth. According to Bill Russo, CEO of Automobility Ltd., “China’s consistency in policy and industrial direction gives it a significant advantage over the U.S., where regulations and incentives often fluctuate with political changes.”

Chinese EV manufacturers have benefitted from at least $230 billion in subsidies between 2009 and 2023, not including regional incentives or support for battery production and infrastructure. These subsidies, combined with low-cost labor and rapid automation, allow companies to price vehicles aggressively, fueling intense domestic competition often referred to as “involution.” While some companies, such as BYD, have seen net income declines due to the competitive market, government interventions aim to stabilize pricing and shift focus toward innovation and vehicle features.

U.S. automakers are adapting to these pressures. Ford has launched its Universal Electric Vehicle (UEV) platform, aiming to produce a midsize EV truck priced around $30,000 at the Louisville Assembly Plant by 2027. The company seeks to match Chinese production costs while maintaining U.S. labor standards and sustainability practices. Similarly, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe noted that while Chinese firms benefit from subsidies and low-cost labor, their manufacturing methods and technology are not inherently superior to U.S. standards.

Concerns over intellectual property, supply chains, and national security are also shaping U.S. strategies. China controls large segments of critical materials such as rare earths and EV battery production, prompting U.S. policymakers and companies to prioritize domestic sourcing and innovation to protect competitive advantages.

Despite these challenges, the U.S. automotive industry retains significant strengths, including a highly skilled workforce, strong university-industry collaboration, established consumer loyalty, and experience in large-scale manufacturing. Experts argue that leveraging these assets while investing in EV technology, supply chains, and partnerships can allow American automakers to compete globally without replicating China’s intensive and often ethically problematic practices.

As the EV race accelerates, executives like Farley and analysts warn that the stakes for U.S. manufacturers could not be higher. “We’re in a global competition for manufacturing dominance,” Farley said. “China wants every one of our jobs, and we need to respond strategically without compromising our values or workforce standards.”

FAQ

Q: Why are Chinese automakers a threat to U.S. companies?

A: Chinese EV manufacturers benefit from extensive subsidies, low-cost labor, and government-backed industrial policies, allowing them to produce vehicles at lower prices and gain global market share.

Q: Can U.S. automakers match Chinese prices?

A: U.S. companies like Ford and Rivian aim to reduce costs through advanced production platforms, economies of scale, and innovation, but direct cost parity is challenging without compromising labor and ethical standards.

Q: What advantages do U.S. automakers have?

A: Legacy infrastructure, experienced workforce, consumer trust, and research collaborations with universities give U.S. manufacturers a competitive edge in quality, safety, and innovation.

Q: How is the U.S. government supporting automakers?

A: Policies include EV tax incentives, tariffs on imports, domestic supply chain support, and regulations to protect intellectual property and industrial independence.",https://crispng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1020.jpeg,N,,2025-11-12 07:01:58.277256

We talk a lot about the grid of the future. The truth is, that future is already showing up in Texas.

Batteries are being built at record pace, data centers are chasing cheap and reliable power, and Texans are adding gigawatts worth of backup systems in homes, schools, and factories.

I sat down with energy analyst Nat Bullard to ask a simple question: if we look at what is actually being built — not the rhetorical arguments happening online, but what is actually happening around the world — where are energy systems headed?

We started with a comparison of batteries and gas peakers. Batteries respond in milliseconds, don’t rely on fuel deliveries during a freeze, and can make money all day providing grid services between scarcity events. Increasingly, duration is less of an issue as prices fall.

As Nat reminded us, during Winter Storm Uri it was “largely things in the thermal fleet” that failed. Winterizing batteries is likely much less onerous and complicated than winterizing gas plants.

Behind-the-meter systems are also booming. One- to ten-megawatt batteries can turn schools or factories into mini-resilience hubs. If Texas keeps adding storage at this pace, we could end up with the equivalent of dozens of peaker plants—only more responsive and decentralized.

Nat concluded with a description of his family as a mix of, a ground source heat heat pump, a mini split, and a Franklin stove. A small hybrid system built to ride out different conditions.

That is a good picture of where ERCOT is headed: a mix of gas and batteries, large wires and local resources, data centers and smart devices. The question is whether we design structures to speed up that hybrid grid on purpose or stumble along and end up there eventually anyway. The first path costs a lot less.

The more we learn from what’s actually happening — the focus of Nat’s excellent annual decarbonization presentation — the more cost effective our decisions will be for Texas.

Doug Lewin (00:06.422)

Welcome to the Energy Capital podcast. I’m your host, Doug Lewin, and welcome to part two of my conversation with Nat Bullard. Nat, as you heard last week, is the co-founder of Halcyon. He is also the one who puts together a fantastic energy transition and decarbonization presentation that comes out every January, which we talked about in this podcast. All around, one of the great experts on all things energy transition and decarbonization. I learned a ton from talking to Nat. I couldn’t let him go after the usual 45 to 50 minutes. We ended up going long, so we split it into two parts. This is part two.

This is a free episode, but it is not free to produce, and your support is extremely important to us. And you’ll get all kinds of benefits: access to the entire archives, grid roundups, reading and podcast picks, special episodes of the Energy Capital podcast that are paid only, like those with John Arnold and Dan Barcelo from T1, Rudy Garza from CPS Energy, et cetera. And please leave us a five-star review wherever you listen to your podcasts. Please enjoy part two with Nat Bullard. Thanks for listening.

So that kind of leads me to where I wanted to go next. You obviously do a whole lot of tracking of batteries. We’ve been talking about electric vehicles a lot. Obviously batteries first started their performance improvement and cost declines because of their use in computers and phones. But now we’re seeing them go into cars on a mass scale and now onto the grid in a really mass scale. I mean, how do you think about that as far as the price comparisons for batteries, particularly gas peakers? Combined cycle, I would almost put in a little bit of a different category because you’re talking more about something that’s going to have a much higher utilization. These days, I think there weren’t a lot being built. There were very few being built, particularly in Texas, but I think just about anywhere with data centers, I think we’ll see some more built.

But still in Texas, for instance, in the Texas Energy Fund—this is obviously the subsidy program the Texas legislature put in place a couple of years ago, $7.2 billion in subsidies for gas plants—something like 80% of the projects that applied and were chosen, I think it actually is closer to 85%, were peaker plants. And that’s because we do have an energy-only market. Like you said, in a market, people respond to incentives. The incentives are for short bursts of very high prices. And when you start to stack the peakers up against batteries, and of course the old thing was, you can only go an hour or two, an hour or two is enough for 90, 95% of the high prices in the market. And for the rest, now we’re starting to get to where batteries are going to four or five, six, even longer hour durations. So how do you think about both the price comparison and then the attributes? How do you think differently about the attributes of a peaker versus a battery? Are they really doing the same thing?

Nat Bullard (03:13.294)

What’s so funny—we had this four-hour standard, more or less. And what’s fascinating about that to me is that is largely an artifact of regulation, not of anything technical. In California back in the day, all you would get paid for was four hours worth of storage. So guess what? Everybody optimizes around this artificially binding constraint that I think we’re starting to see people move past. Again, energy-only market—if there was any place that is going to be ready to do more, or for that matter, to do less, it would be Texas. And also to combine things. When I talk to the biggest of the developers, what their view is, is to meet, let’s say a 500-megawatt load for a data center, the quickest path, the critical path is probably going to be mostly renewable electrons. And within that almost entirely, probably solar, a bunch of batteries. And then you have a combustion turbine to serve the rest of the purpose, but it comes in kind of after the purpose served, obviously, by the generation, but also by the storage.

And that kind of stack is the one that seems to be moving the quickest, probably at the lowest cost, and probably the best fit for anybody who’s out there operating. It’s also the one in the future that, if you want to think about future-proofing it, you’re not talking about having to rip out 600 megawatts of solar and 3,000 megawatt-hours of batteries or whatever you might be doing. You’re talking about keeping those, improving them with software, with new hardware, and then altering the final step at the end. If you were to make this a zero-carbon or zero-net-emissions in the long run, maybe the combustion turbine is running on hydrogen. Maybe you’re doing some kind of durable binding, verified carbon removal to cover the cost of the emissions that are there.

So I guess my way of thinking is to be a bit more ecumenical about all of this and also watch what the smartest people who build stuff are already doing, watch how they’re going about it and thinking about doing this and viewing these things as generally part of a portfolio approach as opposed to either “if this then that” or an “either/or” approach. Not like if I’m doing this I therefore have to do that, but I’m doing that because it makes the most sense and not I’m doing this or I’m doing only that. Now there are constraints elsewhere. Again, Texas is a unique market where if you have the land and the wherewithal to go build a 500-megawatt data center, you probably can locate the land and have the wherewithal to do a similar amount of power generation. It is less the case in, say, Pennsylvania or in Maryland. So it’s going to be different elsewhere, but you all have a unique market down there for this kind of thing.

Doug Lewin (05:51.948)

Yeah, it’s incredibly challenging here too, but I think it is more doable than in those other places. I also think that there is too much kind of either/or. I think there’s actually benefits to having both on the system—gas peakers and batteries. Obviously batteries, whatever the duration is, they are duration-limited at some point. They’re going to run out. Now the sun will come back up and charge them or wind blows and charges them or turn the gas plant on and charge them, if you have enough power to do that. And we also get times when the gas plants aren’t working, particularly in extreme cold. We’ve had severe problems with that. Having a battery that can operate while you’re getting people to the site to figure out what’s going on with the gas plant to get it working, right? Or getting that gas plant turned on so the battery can recharge. There’s actually, I think, a bit of a symbiosis there.

And from the emissions perspective, if gas peakers allow you to displace other much more higher emitting baseload plants and still have the capabilities of those thermal units, you may not get your system to zero, but if you get it damn close, because we’re nowhere close to zero right now. So like, yeah, it’ll still be progress.

Nat Bullard (07:10.252)

That’s right. The best renewable developers I know are relentlessly practical people. I would argue that power developers in general are relentlessly practical, but renewable developers, maybe I should uplevel a little bit, are ruthlessly practical. And if this is going to be the path to market, then that makes most sense. As a quick thought experiment, when you mentioned about batteries, batteries operating until you can go turn on your combustion turbine is fascinating, right? If you think about during Winter Storm Uri, what assets had seized up was largely things in the thermal fleet that had seized up and were not able to provide this, that, and the other services at that time. If you’re a new battery, winterizing it is probably more straightforward than winterizing an existing thermal plant.

I remember at that moment, because I still had access to all this North America-wide data, during Winter Storm Uri, people were like, does this mean gas plants don’t work? And I said, let’s take a quick look at Saskatchewan right now, which is at the heart of the polar vortex that has dipped down to Texas. And it was like well below zero degrees Fahrenheit and everything’s running. But that’s because that’s within the normal design parameters. So a lot of this is thinking about how are we going to parameterize our future? And it’s a lot easier to parameterize brand new assets for something different than those that are already existing.

So I appreciate your practicality in thinking about this. I know that developers think that way. I know that given the capability that all grid operators want to think that way too. So let’s watch closely to see in an energy-only and competitive market, what moves fastest, what moves first, what has the most flexibility, literal and figurative, what’s the most supple in terms of how the capital markets are going to treat it, what has the most supply, what can provide the most capacity, you name it. All of these things, I think, will become more clear and less ideological one way or another over time.

Doug Lewin (09:11.342)

I want to ask you also just what you’re seeing. I don’t know how much you’re tracking this, but residential battery—we’re recording on October the eighth and today Base Power in Texas announced they just raised their Series C of a billion dollars. And by the time this podcast comes out, there’ll be another one out where Zach Dell was on a panel that I’d moderated at Gulf Coast Power Association, where he said they’re doing 20 megawatts per month at this point. It’s a small company on kind of a growth trajectory. And that’s just one company, right? Tesla’s doing batteries. I mean, I want to test this against you. I am very, very bullish on distributed batteries. We’ve also seen, by the way, there is some good data on this. Maybe this will make it into your slideshow in January. I’ll send you this slide.

There is a slide that ERCOT has on distributed energy resources in Texas. The fastest growing segment in Texas—well, the bulk battery storage is growing—but on DERs is between one and 10 megawatt batteries. There’s developers all over ERCOT putting in 9.9s, because when you get above 10, you reach a certain threshold where you change your status and the way you interconnect. There’s just tons of these 9.9-megawatt batteries. So between garages and this one to 10 segment, which literally doubled from ‘23 to ‘24, I really think this is going to be a mega trend and one that is really, really good for the grid for the very things we were just talking about, these reliability and resiliency problems, having batteries scattered all over. Is that something you’re tracking? Have any thoughts or stats or anything like that on?

Nat Bullard (10:49.526)

At Halcyon, we’re tracking now—we just set up another subscription to cover this—is going to be looking at the grid-tied battery and energy storage systems. So those that, again, go through a kind of public certification and necessity process. The speed with which these things are happening is fascinating because it’s consumer-led. Obviously, policy and regulation informs it. But there are other dynamics at work. There are neighborly dynamics to it. As we know, if you’re the only house on the block that’s got power during another winter outage, your neighbors are going to notice. And hey, you’re going to invite your neighbors over to charge up.

My folks when they were still with us, when they had a farm in coastal Virginia and they had a gen set because hurricanes would come and knock things out for like a week at a time. And just as an anecdote, the only thing that they ran their gen set for was the chest freezer full of meat and fish that people would give them in exchange for cords of firewood. And so people will find a way to put power to use and do something with it and help each other out.

I would say that the one to 10 megawatt—was that the battery size that you quoted?

Doug Lewin (11:58.666)

Yeah, yeah, exactly.

Nat Bullard (12:00.814)

So again, listen, why is it 10 megawatts? No reason, except there’s a tripwire and regulatory above that at which you shall not pass. But I mean, I’ll give you something fascinating. So I was looking recently at some data from Australia, smaller in every way than Texas, and they have a new incentive for batteries. So Australia has installed just under 800 megawatt-hours of batteries residential only in two months under a new support mechanism. Like these things go really quick and you can watch how people optimize up to their limit. And what’s really cool was that they do it with smart providers who are ideally looking out for their best interests, but they do it according to their ability and according to their need, according to their financial ability and according to their need for stored power. And that’s really cool.

What other models are going to get built on top of that? I think is a really good question for us to be thinking about and to be asking. But also it’s one that we can observe. We’ll be able to see that as markets take off and start to ship more and do more. It’s funny, I can’t remember who it was. I was listening recently talking about vehicle to grid. I think it was on Shayle Kann’s podcast and the discussion was like, we should think about rebranding it from vehicle to grid to vehicle to home. Vehicle to grid—I’m supporting the abstraction of everybody. Vehicle to home—I am in a blackout, but I can watch telly. Like that’s different.

Doug Lewin (13:26.006)

Absolutely. And like you said, help your neighbors. I think that’s really—people want to do that kind of stuff. Some people will—there are people, I’m not doing that as long—if it came to it, of course you’d help your neighbors and you’d be happy to do it. I just actually recorded a podcast with Brett Biggart. He’s the CEO of Freedom Solar, which is the, or one of the largest installers in the state of Texas. And he said, attachment rate in Houston right now is 90%. So 90% of the solar installations they’re doing—for new systems, 90% of the systems they’re installing include storage at this point, which kind of makes sense, because if you’re in Houston and you just lived through Hurricane Beryl and you’re worried about the next hurricane, why would you get solar without storage? So I really do think we’re going to see this more.

Nat Bullard (14:10.22)

And you know, I’m also fascinated to think of this not just as an installation, but as the beginning of a relationship in the sense that’s not just a relationship with a vendor, but a relationship with how you think about power and the grid. Like if you’ve even done this, you were probably not going back and you’re going to have somebody come to you in four or five years, buying your old battery off of you and getting you twice as much storage for the last money or whatever it might be. There’s a lot of different ways we could cut this. But for people to come in and be like, do you want to get much more for the same dollars or do you want to pay less and get the same as you’re getting right now? Like there will be a lot of things that come in here and there’ll be a lot of innovation in terms of getting these things to market for everybody. And let’s see what happens.

It’ll be done, I think, in a—it’s definitely not permissionless because you literally need permission to do this—but it will be done in a much more literally distributed fashion than the Texas Energy Fund. This isn’t the Texas Energy Fund approving $7 billion that goes out to what, no more than 30 entities. How many total plants are gonna draw funding from the Texas Energy Fund?

Doug Lewin (15:22.798)

That’s a good question. I think it’s 15 to 20 or something like that. Yeah, right. The sizes vary as some of them drop out and others get in, but we’ve seen some as big as a gigawatt, some as small as 100 megawatts. I think it’s like, because they’re trying to get 10 gigawatts, it’s probably about 15 to 20.

Nat Bullard (15:38.04)

But we’ll see that much equivalent instantaneous storage capability deployed probably by the same time that the Texas Energy Fund plants have been built. And into what market? This is another great question for those of you who are thinking from a market’s perspective. When the Texas Energy Fund assets are fully commissioned at whatever price point it is, what market are they competing in? Are they competing in a market that’s installing a gigawatt-hour of distributed storage a month in Texas? It’s entirely within the possibility that that will be happening four or five years’ time. And then what? Right?

One of the things that you do such a good job of, and I would hope to be able to do, is ask the next question for people, which is if you’re in the combined cycle business in Texas, are you watching what the Base Powers of the world, the Freedom Solars of the world are doing when they’re watching battery installation or their attachment rates because an electron is an electron. Obviously there’s plenty of other qualitative things that come into it, but it’s really worth keeping an eye out on this stuff as it goes.

Doug Lewin (16:34.734)

It absolutely is. All right. So you, if I’m not mistaken, you started your career as a solar analyst, right? At NEF?

Nat Bullard (16:41.5)

I did.

Doug Lewin (16:42.5)

So solar, obviously we’re in a moment right now as one of your slides showed, I think 600 gigawatts of solar installed in 2024. Is that about right? It looks like we’re probably trending higher. Chinese capacity, again, one of your slides crested over a terawatt. I believe last year or maybe in 2023 they have a terawatt of capacity that they could produce. That is astounding. I think most of the audience probably knows this, but just to be sure to put that in perspective, the entire installed base of the United States of America is about 1.2 terawatts. So the Chinese could produce that entire amount in a given year. So when you’re talking earlier about exporting to Africa and other places, right? Latin America, Southeast Asia, et cetera, they’ve got plenty of capacity to do that.

Let’s talk a little bit about the outlook for solar. Are we going to reach a point where we’re like, okay, yeah, 600 gigawatts, 800 gigawatts, like that’s where it’s going to stop? Or do you see that that kind of growth is going to continue as we pick up with data center load growth and that kind of thing?

Nat Bullard (17:47.158)

It is a fascinating technology that I think confounds other ways of thinking by analogy. And you just have to sort of YOLO it and think about the incentive of building for the manufacturing side, Red Queen style. You’ve got to run to stand still. You’re always competing against more efficient plant, more efficient models. Your equipment depreciates very quickly. So there’s no such thing as like a 15-year-old solar manufacturing line that I know of that anybody would pay anybody for. So everybody’s doing more constantly. There’s always an urge to sort of tap these companies down so that they can make more money. It never seems to work in a durable fashion, but like the upstream issues of solar manufacturing are meaningless to the downstream advantages of anybody trying to buy and install and build comfortably within capability that we’re shipping a terawatt of PV modules every year, which would account for, currently there would be like multiple single-digit percent of total electricity demand every year being added from just solar electrons.

The question is, to my mind, less how much of that can be built and more what’s the rest of demand going to be? And how much demand inception is there going to be by this? Like if I think about all these exports to sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, that’s providing electricity that didn’t previously exist. It’s not displacing demand for electrons. It is potentially displacing potential future demand for thermally generated electrons, but it’s not displacing some existing demand. That’s only happening in places that have a grid. That’s more of an example as your guest Bill McKibben talked about in Pakistan. So I just think we should watch carefully how the rest of the world is approaching this and think as well about how a system will begin to design itself around the kind of native conditions of very, very low cost, but variable as available electrons with this generation profile and just lay that in. This is a truth. And now what?

Either what are you going to do to match your demand to that supply or what are you going to do to mitigate it? What are you going to do to smooth it, store it? How are people going to sort of configure themselves around that? And that’s where flexibility on the demand side is to me, the more interesting question for the future than it is. How much solar are we going to manufacture? That’s a question that is honestly, it’s almost like hilarious. Like it’s fever dream stuff for me as an analyst almost two decades ago, right? The IEA would come out and be like, there’s no problem meeting that narrowly defined net zero goals of solar already to the middle of the century, because there’s just so much being made and there’s so much capacity. Like you just have to sort of take that as a given and then start to think more creatively and constructively about every other thing that happens to outstrip that.

Doug Lewin (20:48.238)

Totally. I think that’s exactly right. And I think also your point about Africa is a really good one, right? And again, you have this slide of 10 or 12 different African countries and some of them as much as 57% of their power is coming from—these are countries that—and this is one of the things that drives me crazy about some of the crowd that is pro-fossil fuel and anti-everything else. I don’t mind people that are pro-fossil fuel. I do mind people that think that somehow emissions and pollution just aren’t a problem. Like even if you didn’t believe in climate change, we’ll put that aside. There’s pollution that obviously impacts human health from fossil fuels, and we should at least take that into account.

But the people that are just pro-fossil fuel and anti-everything else are like, if you hurt fossil fuel production, Africa will never get electrified. And I’m like, how long have we been producing fossil fuels? Stop kidding yourself that the United States or anybody else is going to fund the buildout of a macro grid. You’re going to build central station plants and you’re going to build high voltage transmission lines and you’re going to build an entire distribution system in Burkina Faso. No, you’re not. But you might put solar panels and batteries and LED light bulbs, just like the Pakistan example Bill McKibben gives, right? They’re literally—forget this about solar—they’re solar modules. They are modular. You could do one at a time and add to them. And the fact that it is producing power in concert with what is one of the most important energy uses for human health, which is air conditioning, which still a lot of the world does not have to any appreciable measure.

Like solar and air conditioning go so well together. And to think that somehow if we don’t fully develop fossil fuels, Burkina Faso is not going to get electricity. It’s insane. And it kind of drives me crazy. So I do think this is one of the places where solar will really stand out is really bringing power to billions of people around the world that just don’t really have it in any appreciable way.

Nat Bullard (23:03.872)

And one other thing to add on that, and it’s brought me back to my point about thinking about distributed storage in Texas is to ask the permission framework on which this happens. No one that’s importing solar modules from China to Zambia or to Mongolia is looking to whatever policy and politics-driven examples are happening elsewhere and saying, well, if this is being said in the United States, then I guess I shouldn’t do this. They don’t care. There’s essentially no overlap there whatsoever. And so another way to view this is that these are rhetorical discussions that we tend to have that are becoming increasingly academic.

And so it reminds me of the old joke about the French philosophers that that’s all well in practice, but how does it work in theory? Like this is sort of how these arguments are now starting to go. And so I would urge us all to be as observational as possible about all of this. And to also remember what is being observed and what is being adhered to elsewhere. Like, I don’t really think that there are a lot of solar module importers in Algeria who are following policy and politics-driven discussions elsewhere at the moment and using those as the basis for their business.

Doug Lewin (24:25.9)

Right. They’re just buying Chinese panels and batteries and electric vehicles as fast as they can.

Okay. So you talked about flexible demand. I want to talk about that next. And this might be a good last segment for this, coming back to where we started. The load projections for data centers, you have a great slide. I think this is the first time I saw this slide. I think Grid Strategies had a really good report that had something like this too, because I hadn’t seen quantified the data center demand in Texas, and you had a slide on this that in 2023 it was about 22 terawatt-hours. I would imagine in your next iteration of the slideshow, that number is going to be much, much higher.

And one of the things that is really interesting that is happening here right now, Nat, we talked earlier about the 85.5-gigawatt peak. That was in 2023. In 2024, it was a little less. It was like 85.1 or something. This year, throughout the summer in 2025, we were right at about 84. Now, it wasn’t as hot this summer as it was the last few, but it was still—people around here say it was a mild summer, but they’ve got recency bias. It was actually in the top third for hottest summers ever recorded compared to the last three years before that, which were all top six, not even top 6%, top six out of 150 years. It seemed cool.

So we’re seeing this lowering of the peak, but a significant increase of the minimums. Every single minimum this year is higher, and some of them, some months 20 to 25% higher. Some of that is driven by climate change, because even though it’s not as hot in summer, the nighttime lows aren’t as much. But a lot of that is being driven by data centers, and it’s being driven by flexible demand. So there’s flexible demand on the bulk side of data centers, crypto miners, those kinds of entities using power more off peak. I’d love for you to talk a little bit about the potential you see there, but then also that flexible demand on the smaller sites. We’ve already talked about residential batteries. That is like the ultimate flexible demand, right? You’re going to fill those batteries when there’s plenty of power, but we can also think about homes, if they have some minimum level of insulation at least as thermal batteries and actually moving demand around to create a system that has higher utilization, lower peaks, lower net peaks. How do you think about that? How are you tracking that? And yeah, what do you see as some of the trends in that space?

Nat Bullard (27:06.678)

I’m not tracking it much yet, but I’ll walk through my thought process on how I consider this, which is there’s no one who wants to go and set this up on their own. There’s also no one who wants to have no control over things. So there needs to be a really subtle, well-designed behavioral economics sort of modality here to have people saying like, yeah, use my home as one way or another, a thermal asset for the grid. Crypto mining—great. Like that’s a pretty clear incentive structure for people to be like, do this now, don’t do that then. Homes and consumers are a little bit more subtle, a little bit more fickle. Maybe it would be another way to say it. So I want to watch very closely to see what emerges that acknowledges that aspect of consumer nature. Right. How do you make it so people don’t feel like they’re getting surge priced, but they do want to opt out of something. How do people feel rewarded in a way that’s not just virtue signaling for doing something at the right time.

And you already alluded to it. How do you optimize other things around that? Well, if your house is a lot better insulated, then your thermal envelope is going to be better and your thermal battery capability, so to speak, is also going to be much better. Like if your house is essentially a leaky sieve, because it’s from the 1930s and it hasn’t been insulated, then you are going to pay a price for not cooling it at that moment. If it is insulated, then it’s much less of a big deal to you to go and do a ride through. This is why the classic old industrial and large commercial demand response was something like an industrial freezer, right? Things are chilled to well below zero degrees C. It’s not like a 30-minute ride through is going to make 80,000 pounds of beef rot instantly. Like there’s enough time for 30 minutes, whatever it might be for things to be okay.

You need a housing stock and a capability that’s better designed around that. That could be part of the package that goes into designing that to begin with, which is I’m not asking you to boil and bake here. What I’m asking you to do is in exchange for this, I’m also going to make sure that your house is more comfortable for everything. I do think this is a really important thing to consider. This is anecdotal data because I’ve seen it written about in multiple markets, but you have people in parts of the United States. It’s more common in Appalachia and in the mid-Atlantic who have an older home for which they have summer power bills higher than their mortgage. Like that’s not a state of affairs that we should be encountering. And how do we remedy that? It’s not just cheaper power. It’s a better thermal envelope. It’s a better business model to help shave the peak off for them or to pay people for not using it at certain moments.

But it’s very episodic. Not everybody’s like that, obviously. It can be very, very acute. But how do we, in a full stack, policy, regulation, society, behavior, business model, economics, finance, come together to make sure that we can meet all of those needs for everybody involved in a smart and quick and reliable way?

Doug Lewin (30:18.754)

That’s a huge question. Yeah, right? Look, it’s one that I’ve spent a long time on, I’m going to spend a lot more time on. You were talking about gigawatt-hour of batteries a month on the residential side. We could see that kind of scale. I also wonder if we can’t start to get to gigawatt scale of reduction of, for instance, winter peak in Texas. We’re worried about winters and Winter Storm Uri. We’ve got all this inefficient resistance heat. We know the heat pump technology is out there. I was really heartened in that conversation I had with the Freedom Solar CEO, Brett Biggart, that one of the ways he’s responding to the removal of the tax credits is he set up an HVAC company. Because he’s like, I have these relationships with people that have solar and storage. They probably have a really inefficient HVAC. Next time it breaks, I’d like to give them the high-efficiency heat pump.

If we can think about the integrated demand side, we can have a system that can take much more load growth. Again, not just data centers, it’s industrial electrification, transportation electrification, all of these things, which leads me to one other thing I did want to ask you about is one of the smartest people I’ve ever heard talk about energy. I am curious about how you think about primary energy. There’s been this big debate at the federal level around—it was Chris Wright, the secretary of energy said the other day, he doesn’t think in his lifetime we’ll ever get to 10% of global energy being solar. Now we were just talking about 600 gigawatts in 2024. He’s kind of playing a game there where he’s talking about primary energy as useful energy. Solar’s probably already pushing four or 5%, something like that. But this is where I think that the shift has to happen is we have to think about like, how do we use energy in the maximal possible way with as little waste as possible, then you’re really optimizing the economy.

Nat Bullard (32:12.568)

So the way that I think about that one is that the solar competition with primary energy is like, how good is it competing with 60% waste? How good is solar competing with mostly exhaust heat, rejected heat and emissions? To be less cheeky about it, what I think we’re likely to see is more and more things that are directly electrified by the final energy that is provided by solar and therefore changes the frame. So the good reliable modeling to think about the long future when it’s deeply decarbonized is that actually primary energy demand goes way down because you’re removing that waste heat rejection element of the equation. And you’re going to a world of even resistance heat in Texas that would be powered by solar directly. Like imagine it’s on your roof. You’ve got solar on the roof. You’ve got your battery. You have your even inefficient resistance baseboard.

What you do not have in there is the coal plant that’s maybe running at 30 to 35% efficient, all the transmission and distribution losses, all the conversion losses in the middle to then reconvert that into resistance heat. Like that’s something that is more cognitive at first than anything we need to think and imagine that that’s going to be the way that things go. But I would not bet against solar, particularly not in a lifetime fashion. That requires a suspension of disbelief in a way in the trend that was happening. It also is not using some very evidence-based imagination, I think, to think about what might be happening in the future and to be relatively neutral about all that kind of thing.

It’s a matter of what you’re competing with. And then as with any of these distributed technologies that get cheaper and better over time, not just what do they engage with at first and not just what do they displace. Well, what do they create? Like what different models are going to be created out of that process that changes the way that we think about this as the equivalent of thermal fired primary energy.

Doug Lewin (34:21.078)

Yeah. And on the piece of resistance heat, right? The bigger thing would be at night, right? When it’s really, really cold, you would have to then run your resistance heat with batteries where you would have some losses, but still far less than with fossil fuels. That’s of course partly why you’d want to have a heat pump because otherwise you’d have to size the battery to an absurdly high level. But your point remains, you’d have no waste.

Nat Bullard (34:45.235)

You know, my family farm’s frontier technology model for running the farm throughout very cold winters, ground source heat pump, one mini-split unit upstairs and a Franklin stove. Great.

Doug Lewin (34:58.853)

Yeah, that’s one way to do it. And it worked.

Nat Bullard (34:59.448)

The house was a little dry. Not going to lie to you. It was a rather low humidity house, but yes, price was right.

Doug Lewin (35:08.344)

There you go. All right, last thing. So earlier, I think at the beginning, I asked you one of those multi-layered three-part questions, and I don’t think we got to the third part, which is what’s coming in the 2026 slideshow? Drop a couple of nuggets to the audience of what they can look for that might be different in the 2026 slideshow.

Nat Bullard (35:27.682)

I’m not—if it’s going to be thinking about trade flows again, how that’s manifesting in markets outside the US. It will be thinking about pricing, how changes in electricity impacted pricing. I will be calling you up and asking you, Doug, what’s the very best ERCOT data set for me to pull in terms of volatility and prices here. I will do my best to look at other markets as I always do outside the US to try to help everybody see things as clearly as possible.

My one last thing I always hope is that I get a good clear view of the present moment. That’s my goal. That in and of itself, I think, helps us talk longer about the future. The challenge in thinking about the future is that a lot of people don’t even adequately understand the present moment. People are living in different, informationally living in a different present, not just a different future, but a different present. And how can I pull this in really quick? I had a couple of dinners in New York at Climate Week. Even people in the US are well informed. One of the arguments is like, look at India, India’s emissions are going to go crazy. I was like, India’s emissions from fossil fuels topped last year and were rather flat in the first six months of this year. Like I didn’t know that. It was like, well, I’m not saying you should have known it, but it’s something to know. Let’s put it that way.

I’m very accommodating in terms of what people know and don’t know because we all have areas of focus. We all have things we look at. My motivating pathology is to try to look as broadly as I can across all of these sorts of things. And in so doing, be as useful as I can to everybody in terms of the information.

Doug Lewin (37:04.94)

Yeah, and it’s always worth spending time with. I’m already looking forward to seeing the next iteration. Nat, thank you so much for doing this. Is there anything that I should have asked you that I didn’t or anything else you just wanted to say you didn’t have a chance to yet?

[4] Bronwyn Cumbo, ‘Australia is set to get more AI data centres.","The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving profound transformation in global data infrastructure and energy demand. The integration of AI into a range of commercial and industrial products, from refrigerators to virtual assistants, is placing mounting pressure on both domestic and foreign energy networks. With global data centre demand projected to surge 165% by 2030, concerns around the adequacy of existing legal frameworks, energy access, and environmental sustainability have been raised.[1] This article will explore the significant energy demands of AI, the capacity for the NEM and national transmission infrastructure to adapt, and international responses to this evolving demand-side challenge.

What’s the issue with AI’s energy demands?

Data centres are already significant energy consumers, and the rapid uptake of artificial intelligence – particularly generative AI – is accelerating this trend. AI requires immense computational power, placing growing demands on both existing and new data centres. As AI products and services become further embedded in the economy, data centre energy consumption will continue to rise.

Globally, the scale of this demand is striking. For example, ChatGPT alone is estimated to use 39.98 GWh of electricity and 148.28 million litres of water daily for cooling.[2] Meeting the worldwide appetite for AI is projected to require $5.2 trillion in capital expenditure by 2030.[3]

In Australia, data centre development is accelerating. AI-intensive sectors such as finance and telecommunications are driving a substantial surge in demand for high-performance data infrastructure.[4] These facilities require uninterrupted, highly reliable electricity, placing disproportionate pressure on local energy distribution systems. Data centres already consume approximately 4–5% of Australia’s electricity,[5] with projections suggesting this could rise to 8% by 2030.[6]

As the scale and complexity of data centres expand, so too do the regulatory challenges surrounding AI deployment. In response, the Federal Government has introduced the Voluntary AI Safety Standards, encouraging companies to self-regulate across all stages of AI development and implementation.[7] While a positive step, the voluntary nature of these standards leaves room for inconsistency and non-compliance. Introducing mandatory regulations would likely be more effective in ensuring responsible, industry-wide adoption of AI and its supporting infrastructure.

Meeting AI’s growing energy demands will require major investment in both infrastructure and policy reform. Yet AI is evolving rapidly, outpacing the development of domestic and global energy systems. Without timely and consistent investment, energy prices may surge – ultimately leaving consumers to bear the cost of the AI revolution.

International responses

United States of America

The United States has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to manage rising AI-related energy demand, focusing on investment, regulation, and research. Through the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act, the federal government is directing billions of dollars toward grid modernisation, clean energy expansion, and semiconductor manufacturing critical to AI development.[8] The Department of Energy is also conducting assessments on improving data centre efficiency and developing performance standards in light of growing AI workloads.[9] However, the continued viability of these federal programs remains uncertain under the Trump administration, which has expressed a desire to repeal the Biden-era AI and clean energy initiatives.[10] As a global hub for AI, the United States’ regulatory volatility will influence the industry’s future growth.

China

China’s energy generation development and policy has shifted significantly as AI becomes a cornerstone of the digital economy. China has responded to escalating AI energy demand by implementing its “Eastern Data, Western Computing” policy. This police relocates energy intensive computing centres to western provinces with abundant renewable resources.[11] Also, new data centres must meet stringent energy efficiency and carbon intensity benchmarks, with projects failing to comply denied approval. The policy is designed to balance regional development, reduce pressure on eastern urban grids (which trend toward higher residential concentration), and align AI infrastructure with China’s broader dual-carbon goals: peak emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.[12]

Ireland

Ireland is a case study on AI regulation and infrastructural lag. The nation is facing an unprecedented surge in energy consumption from AI and data centre operations. In 2024, data centres accounted for 21% of the nation’s total electricity use, overtaking all urban residential consumption.[13] This rapid growth has raised concerns about energy affordability, grid reliability, and compliance with European climate targets. In response, Ireland’s energy regulator has proposed a policy requiring data centres to match their energy load with equivalent new power generation.[14] This approach shifts the burden of infrastructure expansion – across generation, transmission, and storage – onto developers, effectively making data centre approval contingent on securing additional supply.[15]

Looking Forward

The energy demands of AI are no longer a future challenge but a present and escalating reality. Countries at the forefront of AI adoption are beginning to experiment with policy tools to avoid grid instability, rising costs, and environmental backsliding. Internationally, a clear trend is emerging as governments shift responsibility for infrastructure upgrades onto data centre developers. While the regulatory mechanisms vary, the common goal is to integrate AI into energy systems without compromising grid security or climate targets.

In Australia, a more coherent, enforceable framework is necessary. Current state-federal fragmentation, coupled with voluntary AI guidelines, lacks the clarity and enforceability needed to support long-term planning. Looking ahead, policy reform will likely focus on mandatory emissions reporting, enhanced environmental approval standards, and greater integration of data centre load into national transmission planning. Australia may also consider following international models by linking new data centre approvals to infrastructure contributions or renewable procurement. If the energy transition is to remain viable in an AI-driven economy, legal frameworks will need to evolve just as quickly as the technologies they aim to govern.

He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil.","TAGANGA, Colombia – On Colombia's Caribbean coast, a fishing village lies in a cove where green hills meet the turquoise sea.

A few years ago, oil companies found natural gas off the coast and now plan to drill Colombia's deepest gas wells there.

It's been more than a century since Colombia began drilling for petroleum. But the country's president, Gustavo Petro, wants these wells off the coast to be among Colombia's last.

Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on the need for urgent climate action. Key to his administration's climate agenda is transitioning the country away from fossil fuels, the single-biggest driver of global warming.

In 2023, Petro pledged to stop approving new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal. On the world stage, this was a big deal. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers. Scientists say that to reach global climate targets, some fossil fuel producers will have to leave oil, gas and coal in the ground. Stopping new fossil fuel exploration is a pivotal step.

Now the question is: how is Colombia's energy transition going?

When it comes to growing its renewable energy sector, the country has made progress, says Margarita Nieves Zárate, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, a research group. Meanwhile Colombia's government oil company, Ecopetrol, is continuing its multi-year strategy of diversifying away from oil.

But Colombia's energy transition has also faced obstacles - some external, and some of Petro's own making, says Ana Carolina González Espinosa, senior director at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute. While Colombia has become a global poster child for saying no to fossil fuels, it isn't such a simple story, González Espinosa says.

""I remember the international community, and especially the climate community, clapping,"" she says. ""But maybe they didn't look at all of the challenges that this government would have to overcome.""

""It is not a happy story, it is not a sad story, it's just a real story,"" she says.

Why Colombia is doing this

Many in Colombia's government see the transition away from fossil fuels not just as good for the climate, but as a prudent economic strategy.

Colombia is not a petrostate with extreme reliance on fossil fuels like its neighbor, Venezuela, is. It has manufacturing and tech industries, agriculture, and a growing tourism sector.

But the oil and coal industries are still critical sources of taxes and export revenues. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to fall over time with the global energy transition, and that poses serious risks for the country, according to a study from insurance broker WTW and the Universidad de los Andes. The study found that if Colombia is too slow in transitioning away from fossil fuels it could face lost economic output equivalent to around 27% of its GDP between now and 2050.

Also, Colombia's oil sector isn't very competitive compared to some regional neighbors, says Guy Edwards, who researches Colombia's energy transition at the University of Sussex. He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil. A recent oil industry bright spot was the major gas discovery in the Caribbean, but it's deep and expensive to develop.

"" If we don't think about how to diversify the economy,"" González Espinosa says, ""then we are going to be in trouble.""

Today Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, is diversifying, says Julián Lemos, corporate vice president of strategy and new business at Ecopetrol.

The year before Petro took office, the company acquired an electricity transmission company. In recent years, they've acquired more solar and wind projects. And they're investing in geothermal energy, drilling deep into the earth to create electricity.

""The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company,"" Lemos says, ""but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power, transmission.""

""We need to, as a company, be prepared to lead the country in the transformation of our fuel system. And in the transformation of our energy supply matrix.""

Renewable progress and failures

A key part of Colombia's transition away from fossil fuels is growing the renewable energy sector. Much of that growth has come from solar, says Andrés Camacho, the former minister of mines and energy under Petro.

Solar made up around 9% of the country's total installed power capacity in 2024, according to data from XM, Colombia's electricity market operator. That's up from roughly 1.5% in 2022.

Petro's government has introduced something called ""energy communities,"" funding solar and battery projects for Colombian communities that lack regular electricity. The government is trying to attract international financing for some of these community-scale renewable projects. And the government recently streamlined the environmental licensing process for solar making it more efficient, says Manuel Schulte, chief executive of Colombian renewable developer Colibri Energy.

But Colombia's renewable energy sector has faced challenges. In some parts of Colombia the grid still isn't big enough to handle many of the new renewable projects. And many of Colombia's big wind, solar and transmission projects are on land belonging to indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve indigenous groups in planning, Nieves Zárate, the renewable energy researcher, says.

Struggles with local communities are among the reasons why some foreign investors have given up on renewable projects, particularly wind projects. The national oil company, Ecopetrol, has acquired some of these abandoned wind projects.

Losing the messaging fight

Petro's energy transition policies haven't been popular with many Colombians. According to Susana Muhamad, former environment minister in Petro's cabinet, the government often encountered the ""myth,"" she says, that the country's energy transition ""will be an economic hindrance.""

"" The opposite,"" Muhamad says. ""What we see is that making [an energy transition] that is planned will be economically beneficial.""

Edwards says a lot of opposition to Petro's energy transition agenda was stirred up in the Colombian press. His research finds several Colombian newspapers and magazines have mostly framed the pledge not to award new oil and gas contracts as ""disastrous for the Colombian economy.""

Still, González Espinosa thinks Petro's government fumbled the ball on messaging. She says the government didn't focus enough on the local benefits of the energy transition, like how it will help the Colombian economy, and the health advantages of moving away from fossil fuels.

"" They didn't resonate with the national audience,"" González Espinosa says in an email. ""It was all about climate and that argument is not always very easy to sell without connecting it to local realities.""

Looking to the future

Petro's term ends in 2026. Looming over next year's election is a question: Will Petro's policies around stopping fossil fuel expansion outlast his administration?

Colombia's president is a vocal opponent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a type of oil and gas extraction. Many of the presidential candidates have indicated they'll authorize fracking. While Petro's government has put forward legislation in congress to ban fracking, they haven't been able to get it to a vote.

As for Petro's pledge to stop awarding new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal, Estefanny Pardo, mining attorney at Holland & Knight, says a right wing government could reverse it.

""The current government has made a mistake, which is that instead of processing everything as a law to be approved by the congress of the republic, they have issued their own decrees and resolutions that could be repealed or changed by the next government,"" Pardo says in Spanish.

An upcoming conference

Andrés Gómez is Latin America coordinator of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation treaty, an initiative to make a global treaty to phase out fossil fuels. Colombia was one of the first oil-producing countries to join the movement in 2023.

Modeled after treaties to stop nuclear proliferation and landmines, the goal is to create a binding international agreement to stop expanding fossil fuel production.

Next spring, before the country's presidential election, Colombia will host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels.

It is being presented as a major boost to Africa’s clean energy ecosystem, industrial capacity, and local manufacturing.
At the same time, there is a growing need for inexpensive, clean energy.
Energy-efficient appliances like freezers, fans, and televisions that integrate seamlessly with Sun King’s solar systems, as well as smartphones, are among the many solar products and electronics that Sun King designs, installs, and finances.
Kenya is positioned as a major player in this new chapter, which is a historic development that connects solar energy distribution and local industrial development in Africa.","Kenya is now home to Sunking’s first African manufacturing facility. Sun King is one of the world’s leaders in solar off-grid energy. By localizing production, this action signifies a significant strategic change from merely distributing goods across the continent. It is being presented as a major boost to Africa’s clean energy ecosystem, industrial capacity, and local manufacturing.

Sun King was established in 2007 and provides homes and small businesses with solar kits and appliances, such as fans, lights, and televisions. One in five Kenyan households now own a SunKing product, according to the company, which claims to deliver over 330,000 solar kits per month throughout Africa, a notable increase from 10,000 in 2017.

The company’s solar systems will be effectively integrated with solar-powered smartphones and televisions that will be assembled at the new facility. With the potential to scale up as demand increases, it will be able to produce up to 700,000 units per year.

What was said

T. Patrick Walsh, Sun King’s co-founder and CEO, stated,

“This facility enables us to harness Africa’s talent and ingenuity while delivering affordable, high-quality products.”

The Nairobi plant will help shorten supply chains, lower logistics costs, and increase product accessibility, according to the company, which serves millions of customers in Asia and Africa. In order to bolster local supply and manufacturing networks, it intends to eventually open a second plant in Nigeria. The company wants to reduce its environmental effect and increase the value of local economies by moving production to Africa.

Wale Aboyade, the company’s senior vice-president for public policy and government relations, stated, “Our new facility in Kenya reflects Sun King’s long-term partnership with governments and communities to advance Africa’s manufacturing capacity.”

Sun King’s investment coincides with the continent’s growing need for reasonably priced, clean energy as well as rising investor interest in cleantech and climate-focused sectors.

The timing couldn’t be more vital. Despite only making up around 2% of the world’s manufacturing value at the moment, Africa’s population is expected to double by 2050. Inclusive economic growth requires the development of industries that create skilled jobs, and Sun King’s facilities are a significant step in that direction.

At the same time, there is a growing need for inexpensive, clean energy. One in five Kenyan households now receive Sun King’s products, and the company now distributes over 330,000 solar kits monthly throughout Africa, up from just 10,000 in 2017. The company already has almost 40,000 employees worldwide, with 99 percent of them working in Asia and Africa, demonstrating its strong ties to the areas it serves.

Energy-efficient appliances like freezers, fans, and televisions that integrate seamlessly with Sun King’s solar systems, as well as smartphones, are among the many solar products and electronics that Sun King designs, installs, and finances. Millions of homes and small businesses rely on these products for connectivity and clean power.

Conclusion

In the end, Sun King’s choice to produce in Africa is an indication of their faith in the continent’s capacity to sustain itself. The business is contributing to the development of a cleaner, more robust, and self-sufficient energy future for the region by manufacturing locally, educating its employees, and creating for African realities.

To sum up, this is more than just the opening of a new factory. Kenya is positioned as a major player in this new chapter, which is a historic development that connects solar energy distribution and local industrial development in Africa.",https://amebopreneur.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-6-e1762935987402.png,N,,2025-11-12 08:00:32.764976
,EPA,2025-11-12 10:13:49+00:00,Cato Institute,Robbing Peter to Pay Paul: The Impact of California's Cap-and-Trade Program on Toxic Emissions,"Narae Lee, Aseem Kaul",,,,,https://www.cato.org/research-briefs-economic-policy/robbing-peter-pay-paul-impact-californias-cap-trade-program-toxic,"California facilities subject to cap-and-trade increased toxic emissions by 75 percent on average between 2013 and 2018—the first five years of the program.
We investigated this question by comparing California facilities subject to cap-and-trade with similar facilities in other states not subject to cap-and-trade.
Treating toxic waste is a substantial source of greenhouse gas emissions; hence, increasing the cost of greenhouse gas emissions also makes treating toxic waste more expensive.
First, the facilities whose toxic emissions increased the most were those that relied on treating toxic waste after producing it.
Third, facilities increased toxic emissions the most for the least harmful chemicals—those least likely to invite increased scrutiny.","Researchers, however, have paid less attention to the impact of cap-and-trade programs on other environmental outcomes, such as toxic chemical emissions. This is a crucial oversight. California facilities subject to cap-and-trade increased toxic emissions by 75 percent on average between 2013 and 2018—the first five years of the program. This is a startling increase given that California has historically had some of the lowest levels of toxic emissions in the United States. No comparable increase occurred among facilities not subject to cap-and-trade in California or other states. Could cap-and-trade programs be causing firms to reprioritize their efforts away from reducing toxic chemical emissions toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thus improving one environmental outcome while worsening another?

We investigated this question by comparing California facilities subject to cap-and-trade with similar facilities in other states not subject to cap-and-trade. Our research uses detailed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emissions data on 1,100 large US manufacturing facilities from 2010 to 2018. Our findings reveal that toxic emissions from facilities subject to cap-and-trade policies were about 26–42 percent higher on average in the five years after the introduction of the program than they would have been otherwise. Why? Treating toxic waste is a substantial source of greenhouse gas emissions; hence, increasing the cost of greenhouse gas emissions also makes treating toxic waste more expensive. As a result, cap-and-trade has inadvertently prompted firms to strategically cut back on their efforts to treat toxic waste, causing them to release more of it. Indeed, the more a facility reduced greenhouse gas emissions from its waste treatment processes after cap-and-trade was imposed, the more its toxic emissions increased.

Our research finds additional evidence that the increase in toxic emissions resulted from firms’ strategic choices. First, the facilities whose toxic emissions increased the most were those that relied on treating toxic waste after producing it. The smallest increases came from facilities that modified their manufacturing process to produce less toxic waste to begin with. Second, facilities that incurred recent EPA penalties for their toxic emissions increased their toxic emissions by less, presumably because these firms were trying to avoid additional penalties. Third, facilities increased toxic emissions the most for the least harmful chemicals—those least likely to invite increased scrutiny. Finally, even facilities not subject to cap-and-trade increased their toxic emissions if they were owned by firms with other facilities that were subject to the program. These observations suggest that firms are strategically choosing to increase toxic emissions at the corporate level.

Overall, our study shows that a major policy initiative meant to combat climate change has had the unintended consequence of increasing toxic emissions by causing firms to cut back on their voluntary environmental efforts. These findings have important social implications. Increased levels of toxic emissions have been linked to several serious health conditions—including asthma, cancer, and infant mortality—as well as ecological damage and economic harm. Although California’s cap-and-trade program reduced greenhouse gas emissions, the sharp increase in toxic emissions may pose a higher risk to California residents. Our study thus highlights the need for a more holistic approach when designing environmental regulations, one that considers the connections between different environmental goals.",https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/styles/optimized/public/2022-04/climate-change-2.jpg?itok=riOdvZ0b,N,,2025-11-12 10:00:26.789466

Addressing a ceremony marking the 80th founding anniversary of the sector (1945–2025) and its first patriotic emulation congress held by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment on November 12, the Party leader stated that developing agriculture and protecting natural resources and the environment are not merely economic responsibilities but also vital political, cultural, social, security, and defence missions.

The ceremony also saw the attendance of former Politburo member, former General Secretary Nong Duc Manh; former Politburo member, former State President Truong Tan Sang; Politburo member, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh; former Politburo member, former Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung; former Politburo members, former National Assembly Chairpersons Nguyen Sinh Hung and Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan; former Politburo members, former Standing members of the Secretariat Phan Dien and Tran Quoc Vuong, among others.

The Party chief commended the accomplishments made by the sector through emulation movements during the last five years, and throughout its 80-year history of formation and development. He attributed the achievements to the wisdom, dedication, and efforts of generations of officials, workers, farmers, intellectuals, and enterprises, as well as the leadership and guidance of the Party and the State.

However, he pointed out major and complex challenges that the sector is facing in economic development, resource management, and environmental protection, stressing that issues related to natural resources, the environment, and climate change, along with internal limitations in agriculture and rural areas, are becoming major bottlenecks hindering the nation’s goal of rapid and sustainable development.

These challenges go beyond economic and technical dimensions, touching on political, social, security, and ethical aspects of development, and therefore demanding strategic foresight along with bold and resolute actions in the new era, the General Secretary said.

He urged the sector to continue renewing its mindset and take stronger and more effective actions to contribute significantly to the success of the upcoming 14th National Party Congress and the nation’s prosperous and sustainable development.

General Secretary Lam called for strengthening institutions and policies to lay a strategic foundation for the new period; and accelerating the comprehensive review and full institutionalisation of the Party’s guidelines on agriculture, farmers, rural areas, resource management, environmental protection, and climate change into the legal framework.

He stressed the need to set up mechanisms for controlling power, ensuring transparency and openness in land planning, allocation, leasing, land-use conversion, and resource exploitation, while preventing group interests, corruption, and wastefulness.

Attention must be given to strictly managing, fairly regulating, and restoring river and lake ecosystems and groundwater; controlling pollution; proactively adapting to climate change; upgrading irrigation systems, dikes, and reservoirs; applying technology for flood, landslide, and salinity intrusion warnings; restoring protective and mangrove forests and conserving biodiversity; and fully addressing environmental pollution in large cities, industrial zones, craft villages, and river basins, he said.

Science, technology, innovation, digital transformation, and data must be key drivers of agriculture production, covering everything from crop and livestock breeding, biotechnology, and automation to traceability, logistics, and digital commerce, he said, noting that collaborative models linking scientists, businesses, cooperatives, and farmers should be promoted, while extension services must be practical and closely tied to fields and production facilities.

The Party chief requested a decisive resolution of administrative bottlenecks in land, resource, and environmental management, as well as challenges facing farmers and businesses in accessing capital, land, and scientific and technological resources.

He suggested restructuring the agricultural sector toward ecological, organic, and circular models with high-tech applications to generate higher added value; shifting agriculture from extensive growth to intensive development, focusing on quality, value addition, and brand building; developing national brands, expanding markets, and integrating more deeply into global agricultural value chains; and building model new-style rural ecosystems with comprehensive infrastructure, clean environment and civilized rural society.

He expressed his belief that the sector will continue to uphold its proud tradition, strongly renew mindset, take bold and effective actions, dare to innovate and take responsibility, and make the greatest possible contribution to the nation’s development.

The Party General Secretary called on all officials, public employees, workers in the sector, as well as scientists, entrepreneurs, cooperatives, and farmers nationwide to unite and innovate further, successfully achieving set goals and building the model of “Ecological agriculture – modern rural areas – civilised farmers” model.

At the event, the Party leader presented a First-class Labour Order to the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment for its GDP growth, as well as in recognition of its outstanding contributions to the nation’s socio-economic development.

On this occasion, Minister of Agriculture and Environment Tran Duc Thang launched a patriotic emulation movement, calling on all officials, public employees, and workers of the sector across the country to promote innovation and creativity, turn aspirations into concrete actions, towards accomplishing all tasks entrusted by the Party, State, and people./.",https://mediaen.vietnamplus.vn/images/f579a678cf9e90879541752073c26005d8fe7312e689c8acf02f7fa1571fefe9aadcc81920719f07bf6f07a5b8d3ae096d1811f5e396ffb309611b8337595828/agriculture.jpg.webp,N,,2025-11-12 07:01:30.495283

By now, you've probably heard the rumor that Ford may be dropping the F-150 Lightning due to the EV credits evaporating and electric trucks occupying a relatively small corner of the already niche electric vehicle market in the US.","""I wouldn't mind driving an electric pickup, but they're so expensive!"" That's something you hear a lot, seeing as a Ford F-150 Lightning starts at an MSRP of $62,995 for the 2025 model year, and a Rivian R1T starts at $69,900, but an entry-level 400-horsepower combustion-powered F-150 can be had for just $37,290 for 2026, and a Tacoma starts at $32,145. If you need a practical, daily driver that can haul some furniture now and then, it's hard to justify spending twice the price just to go electric.

But here's the good news for people who haven't bought into the electric revolution just yet: these trucks depreciate as fast as a carton of milk. It seems like as soon as they're sold, they're ready to go for half their original price. That's a bummer if you're trying to trade a two-year-old Lightning in for something newer, but, if you're a patient buyer, the model could save you tens of thousands of dollars on a practically brand-new truck. Here's what you need to know if you're looking to make that work in your favor.

The Days Of Underpowered Electric Vehicles Are Over

You don't necessarily want to buy something just because it's selling for half its original price, right? Let's compare the specs of entry-level models.

You really can't go wrong with any one of these trucks when it comes to sheer performance specs. However, range is critically important if you're considering any long-haul towing. In the past, we've reported on the Cybertruck's range being cut nearly in half when towing a two-ton trailer, which accounts for way less than half of its maximum capacity. The Model X actually turned out to be the better tower, pulling the trailer around 256 miles.

A study shared by Fiver-O in the F-150 Lightning Forum compares the Rivian R1T to the Lightning, finding that they both lose plenty of range while towing a heavy load. However, the Lightning's available upgrades, such as ProTrailer Backup Assist, and its ability to utilize trip data and GPS planning to provide a more accurate range estimate, make it the easy choice if you're looking for a work truck. Meanwhile, the Silverado EV boasts the most impressive overall range among the entire lineup.

Electric Pickups Are Losing Around Half Their Value In The First Two Years

Vehicles are expected to lose a significant portion of their value immediately. However, a typical gas-powered F-150 is still worth more than 60% of its sale price after two years, and a Toyota Tundra takes over a decade to lose 50% of its value. Electric vehicles are lucky to retain that much after two years on the market. Here's how the leading battery-powered trucks stack up according to data from CarEdge and iSeeCars.

Please note that any projections beyond the first few years are based on current trends. None of these trucks has been on the market for all that long. Now, are any of these trucks likely to bounce back or hold steady at 40% or 50%? Stranger things have happened, but a lottery ticket would be a safer investment than betting on the long-term value retention of an electric pickup.

The Cybertruck may be the biggest surprise here, as it is the only one of these trucks projected to retain half its value after five years on the road. Meanwhile, the Lighting and the Silverado are the fastest depreciators of the bunch. The Silverado actually loses nearly half its value in the first year alone, selling for around 53% of its original price just one year after it rolls off the dealer's lot. The Lightning takes two years to get there, selling for 52.08% of its original value after two years on the road.

Can You Count On An Electric Pickup?

Note, for the following JD Power Quality & Reliability ratings, that JD Power does not have separate ratings for the Silverado EV and the F-150 Lightning at the moment. This means that the ratings listed here are for the respective nameplates overall, while the R1T and Cybertruck ratings are specifically for the R1T and the Cybertruck. The maintenance estimates come courtesy of CarEdge.

It can be challenging to ascertain reliability when a vehicle has only been on the market for a few years. According to AAA, the annual maintenance cost for an electric vehicle should average around $949, which is $330 less than AAA's estimate for a gas-powered vehicle.

The Cybertruck Has Its Issues, But So Do The Other Electric Pickups

Much has been made of the Cybertruck's issues when it comes to build quality. We've seen panels flying off on the highway and carwashes turning the trucks into expensive bricks. In Tesla's defense, a new Cybertruck is less likely to fall apart than an older model. But we're specifically looking to get a deal on a used model, so what good does that do us?

The other trucks on this list have also had their own share of embarrassing recalls. More than 29,000 Lightnings were recalled earlier this year for suspension problems. The Silverado EV has been recalled for malfunctions in the electronic stability control system, and Rivian had to recall around 28,000 units back to the shop in June for faulty turn signals.

Used Silverado EVs And F-150s Lightning Are The Most Affordable Electric Trucks, New Or Used

If you're looking to use depreciation to your advantage and get a great deal on a basically new pickup, the Silverado EV and the F-150 Lightning are the only reasonable choices on this list. These trucks both lose around half their MSRP value after just a couple years on the road, and they start at lower MSRPs than the Rivian R1T or the Cybertruck to begin with.

A 2023 Ford F-150 Lightning initially sold for a base MSRP of $49,995. According to CarEdge, that would put the current resale value at around $26,037. Kelley Blue Book estimates it a bit higher, at a fair market price of $31,968, assuming around 15,000 miles a year.

The Silverado EV, meanwhile, hasn't been around for long enough to take full advantage of depreciation. The oldest Silverado EV on the market is the 2024 model, and a lot of the data found on iSeeCars and CarEdge, as it pertains to depreciation, is theoretical, based on market projections. So we're still waiting for the first significant drop in sticker price.

The F-150 Lightning Is The Best Buy On The Used Market

The Ford F-150 Lightning ultimately wins our comparison almost by process of elimination. The Ford has been around long enough to have shed a significant amount of market value, and it's one of the most affordable models available, even if you're buying brand-new. Upon reviewing AutoTempest, we identified the following listings.

A 49,043-mile 2022 Lightning XLT is selling in Virginia for $26,999.

A 40,053-mile 2022 Lightning Pro is selling in Florida for $34,084.

A 32,195-mile Lightning Pro is selling in Washington for $34,998.

A 43,719-mile 2023 Lightning XLT is selling in New York for $34,900.

A 30,885-mile 2023 Lightning XLT is listed for sale in North Carolina for $36,450.

These listings are only provided as an example. There's no telling what will be available in your area when you're ready to run a search of your own. But these numbers should illustrate that those KBB and CarEdge estimates aren't just whistlin' Dixie.

By now, you've probably heard the rumor that Ford may be dropping the F-150 Lightning due to the EV credits evaporating and electric trucks occupying a relatively small corner of the already niche electric vehicle market in the US. There's always a chance that this could turn the existing F-150 Lightnings into collector's items, but we wouldn't count on it. When a vehicle is canceled for disappointing sales, the tendency is usually for the price to keep falling, so, at the very least, you don't need to worry about missing the boat when it comes to getting a great deal on a slightly-used F-150 Lightning.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cropped-f-150-lightning_lariat_rally-course_01.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-12 08:01:29.726846

Or can we be smart and come to our senses before we hit a disaster?” Miodownik thinks we can, and repair cafes are part of what’s fueling his belief.","Last Friday, a group gathered inside a building in East London, holding an unusual medley of used goods, from tattered teddy bears and old shoes to an elegant but broken vintage blender.

These people weren’t there to donate their weathered wares. They were there to resurrect them.

Welcome to the “Repair Café” at the University College London, an occasional event where locals can bring their damaged items to be fixed by a team of experts and engineers, free of charge. The project is part of a growing chain of more than 2,500 workshops popping up around the world to help reduce rampant consumption by building “a culture of care and repair,” according to the nonprofit Repair Café International Foundation, which launched in 2010.

As carbon-hungry consumer production and its subsequent waste surge to all-time highs, experts say that the concept can help curb pollution while promoting a more circular economy. But a few major barriers stand in the way of this repair revolution. Among the top threats? Free, one-day delivery.

A Repair Mindset: In a global economy that runs on consumption, products aren’t always built to last.

The rise of cheap, fast fashion has led to shorter life cycles for clothes, with items often lasting less than 10 wears before falling apart. Big technology companies, such as Apple and Microsoft, have been accused of and sued for deliberately designing phones or laptops with limited lifespans or that cannot support updates to spur consumers to buy newer models.

In certain cases, companies have created products with incredibly long lifespans, but discontinued them after realizing they generate less revenue because users don’t have to buy them as frequently. Light bulbs, for example. A discontinued incandescent bulb—nicknamed the Centennial Light—is still working more than 120 years later at a fire station in California (there is a livestream to prove it).

This consumerism has led to massive waste. Each year, billions of tons of discarded products end up in landfills around the world or overflow into the ocean and other fragile ecosystems.

“Waste drives the economy, it turns out,” Mark Miodownik, a materials scientist and engineer at University College London, told me. He helps run the college’s repair cafe events. “Of course, the downside of it is that it will reach physical limits of the planet to absorb all the waste, and we’re reaching them now, and we haven’t really taken care of that bit of the problem.”

To buck this consumerist culture, Amsterdam-based sustainability advocate Martine Postma organized the first official “Repair Cafe” in 2009. It has since grown into an international network of tinkerers who have expanded or iterated on the concept to fit their local communities. New York alone has nearly 70 cafes across the state, which host at least one event each year to help locals bring their beloved jewelry, home goods or technology back to life.

Suzie Fromer has spent three years as a coordinator at the nonprofit Sustainable Hudson Valley, which helps organize and run dozens of cafes in the region. She told me that at the nearly 160 cafe events held last year, volunteers fixed more than 7,400 items. Lamps are the most commonly brought items, but fixers have repaired everything from decorative vases to beloved doll houses.

“It changes your relationships to your things because you no longer see them as something that you’re bothered by and have to throw out. It’s something you can work with. … It’s an item that can be repaired, and it can last a long time,” Fromer said.

It isn’t a drop-off service; rather, people sit with the fixer to try to learn how they might be able to repair their own items in the future, which has helped build a sense of community at each event, she said. Sometimes there are emotional moments; for example, Fromer, a jewelry designer in her spare time, recently helped someone repair a necklace their uncle had given to them before he passed away.

Jewelry often “has value, you know, separate from its financial costs,” she said.

Miodownik said repair cafes in London have a similarly communal vibe. In fact, a 2024 report by his team found that repair activities such as cafes have broader mental health benefits, from skills development to social inclusion and wellbeing.

“There is a sort of rejection of the disposable culture, but you don’t feel that vibe in the room. It’s actually people just trying to resurrect these beloved objects,” Miodownik said. “I think the truth is that people aren’t coming thinking they’re going to go away with a lot of skills, but they are going to come away feeling supported and that they know people with the right skills, and that they might have something to offer, too.”

Right to Repair: Experts say a few major hurdles are preventing repair culture from dominating modern society.

For many products, such as clothes and appliances, buying a new product can often be cheaper than fixing the one you own. The convenience of free, rapid shipping also means that you are likely to get a new product faster than your old one can be fixed if the repair is more complicated—or there may not even be someone nearby with the expertise to fix it, Fromer said.

On top of this, some products, such as phones, cars and tractors, are produced in a way that prevents mechanics from accessing diagnostic tools or broken parts without taking it to the manufacturer. For example, repair advocates have pointed out that Apple AirPods are extremely difficult to disassemble and repair without damaging the casing, Vox reports. States including California, Colorado and Minnesota have passed “Right to Repair” legislation to protect consumers’ ability to fix or modify their purchases, but many states still lack these safeguards.

If the current rate of consumerism and waste continues, Miodownik said that at some point “we are going to hit a wall.”

“Carbon dioxide in the air is going up, plastic in the sea is going up, microplastics in our blood [are] going up. You just look at any of these metrics of our consumerist addiction, and that’s going to kill us,” he said. “There’s going to be a big wall and the question is, when is the big wall going to cause such destruction that people come to their senses? Or can we be smart and come to our senses before we hit a disaster?”

Miodownik thinks we can, and repair cafes are part of what’s fueling his belief.

“You see people’s delight in bringing these things back to life,” he said. “Their lives are just as rich having a repaired thing that’s old than if they bought something new.”

I asked if he practices what he preaches, and whether he had ever repaired the sweater he was wearing during our Zoom interview.

“I’m afraid that’s true,” he said with a laugh, holding it up to show off a stitch in the side.

More Top Climate News

An analysis by The Washington Post found that Democrats in the United States have largely pulled back from messaging around climate change in social media posts, podcast appearances and speeches. The reporting reveals that references to “climate change” peaked in August 2022 when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden. Now, the analysis found, Democrats are instead focusing more on energy and electricity costs.

“The pendulum is going to swing back, for sure,” Jason Bordoff at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University told The Post. “We know that the impacts of climate change are going to be quite bad, and I don’t think people can ignore those forever.”

The Senate passed a bill on Monday to end the longest government shutdown in history, which is now headed to the House for a final vote as soon as Wednesday. However, the delay has caused widespread damage to crucial government programs and the people who depend on them. One of the hardest hit has been the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps provide food for around 42 million Americans. While the program has been paused, Indigenous groups have emphasized the importance of traditional practices for hunting and farming to secure food and increase food sovereignty, Miacel Spotted Elk reports for Grist.

The United Nations’ 30th climate conference, COP30, is in full swing as representatives meet in Brazil to map out the next steps to lower greenhouse gas emissions and curb climate change. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is in attendance and has been taking shots at the Trump administration’s absence and recent tariffs on the host country, Reuters reports.

“We’re in Brazil, one of our great trading partners, one of the world’s great democracies. I mean, hell, home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with instead of giving the middle finger with 50 percent tariffs,” Newsom said at a global investors summit held on Monday in São Paulo.

The new language, McConnell said, will “keep the dangerous products out of the hands of children while preserving the hemp industry for farmers.”","The Senate late Monday passed a funding package that would reopen the government and fund the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. Tucked into the funding bill is a provision that would re-criminalize many of the intoxicating hemp-derived products that were legalized by the 2018 Farm Bill.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) waged a last-minute fight to try to keep the provision out, threatening to drag out the process of debating the underlying bill until he got a vote on an amendment to strip the language.

He got the vote on Monday; Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) were the only Republicans who voted in favor.

“The bill, as it now stands, overrides the regulatory frameworks of several states, cancels the collective decisions of hemp consumers and destroys the livelihoods of hemp farmers,” Paul said on the floor ahead of the vote. “And it couldn’t come at a worse time for America’s farmers. Times are tough for our farmers.”

The provision “prevents the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products,” according to a Senate Appropriations Committee summary.

The proposal was first included in the House’s funding bill for the Department of Agriculture, but it was removed from the Senate version over the summer following a disagreement between Paul and his fellow Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell.

Hemp industry representatives and lobbyists have spent months campaigning against the language. Many said they were caught by surprise when the funding bill text was unveiled on Sunday.

McConnell was a champion of legalizing hemp in the 2018 Farm Bill. But he’s since soured on what he says is a “loophole” that companies use to take legal amounts of THC (or tetrahydrocannabinol) from hemp and turn it into intoxicating substances.

The industry is largely unregulated, they argue, and Congress in 2018 failed to distinguish between intoxicating and non-intoxicating hemp products. As such, THC products are widely available for sale on store shelves.

By Billy House

Long Island’s congressional delegation should show a unified, bipartisan front in convincing Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin against delaying enforcement of new limits to so-called ""forever chemicals"" in drinking water, environmentalists say.

""This is not a controversial issue. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue,"" said Adrienne Esposito, executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, based in Farmingdale. ""The issue of safe drinking water has always bridged the gap between political parties.""

Drawing controversy is the recent decision by the agency under Zeldin to postpone a deadline by two years, to 2031, for water utilities or public water systems to comply with new federal water standards for the targeted polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.

That extended a previous 2029 deadline finalized during the administration of former President Joe Biden.

All four Nassau and Suffolk U.S. House members told Newsday Wednesday they're each fully behind efforts to deliver safer, cleaner drinking water solutions for Long Islanders. Some instances were provided of funding and technical assistance already secured to help water suppliers to add the necessary filtration and other equipment.

But there was little sign of a coordinated effort to get Zeldin to reverse the decision that will give utilities another two years to meet the new standards.

Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-Glen Cove) wrote a letter last week directly appealing to Zeldin, who previously represented Long Island's 1st Congressional District, on that issue.

Rob Hayes, with Environmental Advocates NY, said Nassau and Suffolk county residents have been ""bearing the brunt"" of a PFAS drinking water crisis in New York. He noted Zeldin was a congressman from Suffolk County, saying the Long Island congressional delegation is uniquely positioned to come together and get Zeldin to ""step up"" and do the right thing.

Esposito echoed that the four Long Island lawmakers should be working together to convince Zeldin.

""There is absolutely no reason to delay the public health need,"" she said.

Suozzi’s letter to Zeldin last week argued against the two-year compliance delay, noting studies — including from the National Institutes of Health — have found PFAS in drinking water is associated with a higher incidence of a variety of cancers.

The EPA’s press office acknowledged receipt of that letter, but on Wednesday

declined to comment further.

In a statement Wednesday, Suozzi said, ""I’ve made cleaning up the water on Long Island a priority because we all must.""

He ticked off several instances where he has succeeded in securing tens of millions of federal dollars for PFAS filtration projects and other efforts, and said, ""We need the EPA to make this a priority, too. I’m fighting on every front to get it done.""

Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-Bayport), said in a statement, ""Ensuring Long Islanders have access to clean drinking water is one of my top priorities in Congress."" He added he will ""continue working with the EPA, the Suffolk County Executive, and the Suffolk County Water Authority to make sure our federal and local partners have the resources they need.""

But he did not say if he Zeldin should reverse course on the compliance deadline.

Freshman Rep. Laura Gillen (D-Rockville Centre), in Congress for just nine months, was more clear: ""Rolling back PFAS protections puts Long Island families’ health at risk. These cancer-causing ‘forever chemicals’ are already in our water, and delaying action will only put more people in danger.

""Administrator Zeldin should put protecting the health of Long Islanders and the American people first by ensuring our communities have safe, clean drinking water now,"" she said.

But Rep. Nick LaLota (R-Amityville), Zeldin's successor whose office secured millions of dollars worth of drinking-water safety and cleanup project funding jabbed, ""Democrats can’t have it both ways — claiming to care about clean water while voting last week to shut down the EPA and the entire government.""

He was referring to the current Republican and Democratic standoff over a bill to keep government funded past next Tuesday.

""I’ve delivered real clean drinking water dollars for Long Island families, while they’ve delivered only hypocrisy,"" he said of the Democrats.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b72eb5b8ab7222baffc8dbb/5b7f05ddcd8366e8f19436ec/6913ff4497f7b672128a27ea/1762918545133/News+Logo.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-11-12 10:00:31.547848

Now the country is trying to ensure some of its biggest electricity users — aluminum smelters — aren’t left behind in the clean-energy transition.
”This is going to be a big question going forward: How [can countries] get these big industries off of fossil fuels and onto using variable renewable power, and all the adaptations that are necessary?” Bataille said.
Aluminum smelters typically sign long-term contracts with utilities that lock in the price of electricity the companies pay over years or decades.
Coal power is steadily declining in Australia as renewables surge, owing primarily to market forces.","Australia’s power sector is steadily shifting away from coal and toward running on 100% renewable energy. Now the country is trying to ensure some of its biggest electricity users — aluminum smelters — aren’t left behind in the clean-energy transition.

The Australian government is developing a Green Aluminium Production Credit, or GAPC, to reduce the cost of using solar, wind, and energy storage to power the country’s four giant smelters. The AU$2 billion (US$1.3 billion) program is part of a larger federal industrial policy that aims to decarbonize Australia’s economy over the next decade.

“Australia is sending a signal that it wants this industry to stay,” said Marghanita Johnson, CEO of the Australian Aluminium Council. ​“Therefore, what do we need to do to keep the industry during this challenging transition?”

Smelters everywhere are power-hungry facilities. That’s because the process of converting raw materials into aluminum can require hundreds of megawatts of electricity running at near-constant rates. In Australia, a country of nearly 28 million people, the four smelters consume roughly 10% of the nation’s electricity and contribute about 4% of total greenhouse gas emissions.

As in many places, renewables are the country’s cheapest new electricity sources, and battery storage costs are plunging. But the fact that wind and solar power aren’t available around the clock means that smelters need to procure more total megawatts from multiple sources to make sure that, at any moment, they have enough capacity to operate, Johnson said.

Australia’s Department of Industry, Science and Resources is still finalizing the design of its GAPC. Generally, though, it will cover between 30% to 40% of the extra costs associated with using renewables to produce aluminum instead of conventional sources like coal and gas. The program will provide credits to aluminum producers for every metric ton of ​“green” aluminum they produce for up to 10 years, starting from the 2028-2029 financial year.

The initiative is part of an emerging movement by countries to subsidize or otherwise support domestic heavy industries as they work to decarbonize, said Chris Bataille, an adjunct research fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.

He noted that, under the Biden administration, the United States had been considering developing tax credits to incentivize industrial manufacturers to use more renewable energy, though those discussions have sputtered under the second Trump administration. In China, meanwhile, the central government is investing more money into projects that reduce or replace coal use in sectors like steel, cement, and chemicals.

”This is going to be a big question going forward: How [can countries] get these big industries off of fossil fuels and onto using variable renewable power, and all the adaptations that are necessary?” Bataille said.

Aluminum smelters typically sign long-term contracts with utilities that lock in the price of electricity the companies pay over years or decades. In Australia, those contracts are coming to an end, and as manufacturers look to sign new deals, they’re finding themselves in a dramatically different energy market, Johnson said.

Today, three of Australia’s smelters get most of their electricity from coal-fired power plants: Rio Tinto’s Boyne Island facility in Queensland, Alcoa’s Portland plant in Victoria, and Tomago Aluminium’s smelter in New South Wales. Only Rio Tinto’s Bell Bay smelter in Tasmania runs predominantly on hydropower.

Coal power is steadily declining in Australia as renewables surge, owing primarily to market forces. About 90% of the aging coal fleet will likely be gone by 2035, and the rest could shutter later that decade, the head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, which oversees the nation’s power markets, recently told Canary Media’s Julian Spector. (Australia banned nuclear energy decades ago, so it’s not an option.)

For now, coal still accounts for 46% of Australia’s annual electricity production, according to the International Energy Agency. Renewables contribute about 35%, though existing projects aren’t necessarily located near smelters that need them.

Rio Tinto, which owns a majority share of Tomago Aluminium, warned in late October that the smelter is bracing for a potential shutdown by the end of 2028 owing to the soaring costs of both ​“coal-fired and renewable energy options from January 2029” that would make the facility’s operations commercially unviable. Tomago is the country’s largest smelter, accounting for about 40% of Australia’s annual aluminum production.

“There is significant uncertainty about when renewable projects will be available at the scale we need,” Jérôme Dozol, CEO of Tomago Aluminium, said in an Oct. 28 statement.

Johnson said Tomago’s troubles point to the broader limitations of initiatives like the GAPC. While the production credit can reduce power costs for smelters, other measures are needed to support the buildout of not just wind, solar, and battery storage but also transmission lines and grid infrastructure that connect the resources to the energy-gobbling smelters.

The Australian Aluminium Council is also advocating for energy policies that reward smelters for the benefits they are able to provide to the grid. For example, smelters can rapidly reduce their power consumption for about an hour at a time to help stabilize the system during emergencies. Alcoa is participating in such a demand-response program in Australia, as is Rio Tinto’s Tiwai Point smelter in New Zealand. Aluminum plants can also be an important source of demand for solar power plants in particular, since factories use plenty of power during the day when households generally consume less.

“We’re doing a lot of work here in Australia, in terms of the energy transition and how all these pieces of the puzzle need to fit together,” Johnson said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Rio-Tinto-Bell.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=4393c4a35dd974461e7cf765cea57214,N,,2025-11-12 08:58:43.609833

Texas Gateway is one of several proposals designed to boost gas supply to Gillis.
However, Texas Gateway stands out from the other projects in its choice of route.
In this scenario, Texas Energy Gateway would not be the last pipeline project built in the region.
We expect the open season volumes offered on Texas Gateway will be enticing to LNG facilities looking to expand supply diversity and gain access to a very liquid Katy hub.","Boardwalk Pipelines has launched a binding open season for the Texas Gateway project on Gulf South Pipeline. The project joins a crowded field aiming to move more natural gas from Texas hubs to meet growing LNG demand in Louisiana.

Boardwalk proposes to build 155 miles of greenfield pipeline and upgrade existing facilities on Gulf South to provide at least 1.45 Bcf/d of capacity from Katy and Carthage to the Gillis hub in southwestern Louisiana. The company expects the project to enter service in November 2029.

Gulf South has executed a precedent agreement with a foundation shipper for 1.45 Bcf/d, enough to proceed with the expansion, according to the announcement. The open season will gauge additional interest to potentially upsize the project.

Texas Gateway is one of several proposals designed to boost gas supply to Gillis. Kinder Morgan (KMI) is developing Trident Intrastate and the Texas Access Expansion on its Louisiana Pipeline, WhiteWater and Venture Global (VG) are partnering on Blackfin Pipeline and CP Express, and ARM Energy Holdings recently announced a final investment decision (FID) on Mustang Express Pipeline. However, Texas Gateway stands out from the other projects in its choice of route. The new greenfield line would run directly between Carthage and Gillis, opening up egress from the rapidly developing Western Haynesville and the egress-constrained Shelby Trough.

Currently, East Daley Analytics estimates there will be 23.3 Bcf/d of existing and FID’d capacity into the Gillis hub and the surrounding LNG export region by 2030. That is just enough capacity to meet our expectations for LNG feedgas demand, but there are several more facilities and expansions in development that would require more inbound supply to run full. Assuming projects like Sabine Pass Stage 5, Lake Charles LNG, and Commonwealth LNG are all able to make FID, Gillis could see as much as 28 Bcf/d of LNG demand by the early 2030s. In this scenario, Texas Energy Gateway would not be the last pipeline project built in the region.

East Daley estimates the daily stacked rate on KMI’s Trident and Texas Access is ~$0.55/Mcf, while the stacked rate on Backfin and CP Express is ~$0.40/Mcf. We speculate that the rate on Mustang will also be in the ballpark of $0.30-0.40 given the shorter route relative to the paths offered by the other projects.

Given that Texas Gateway is a combination of greenfield pipeline and existing facility upgrades, we speculate that the project can offer better returns than some of the alternatives that are purely greenfield expansions. Additionally, the Boardwalk project is unique among these options, as it offers full-path service from Katy to Carthage to Gillis on one system.

See East Daley’s Southeast Gulf Supply & Demand Report for more information on the regional market. We expect the open season volumes offered on Texas Gateway will be enticing to LNG facilities looking to expand supply diversity and gain access to a very liquid Katy hub. – Oren Pilant and Zach Krause Tickers: KMI, VG.

Gillian Martin MSP, Cabinet Secretary For Energy & Climate Action

Scotland’s future prosperity will be built on renewable energy, with offshore wind at its centre. It offers a once-in-a-generation chance to drive economic growth, foster innovation and create high quality jobs across the country.

Offshore wind is already delivering real and lasting benefits to communities across Scotland. The Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm is a clear example, combining the generation of clean electricity with project investment in the Highlands and Moray. Since becoming fully operational in 2019, it has had the capacity to power up to 450,000 homes at any one time, created long term skilled jobs with up to 90 personnel now safely operating the wind farm, established a long-term operations and maintenance base at Wick Harbour, and provided £6 million in community benefits.

Over the next decade, the sector can support thousands more skilled roles, from the hands-on work of building and maintaining turbines and offshore structures, to the engineering and design of the systems that keep them safe, efficient and connected to the grid. These careers can inspire young people, provide security for families and open new opportunities for those moving into the sector as part of a just transition.

Realising these opportunities means building on and expanding the excellent training provision already in place as well as testing out innovative new approaches. We need to continue to work in partnership across private and public sectors to ensure that we have enough people with the right skills at the right time to realise the benefits we all want to see.

Earlier this year, the Scottish Government convened the Offshore Wind Skills Short-Life Working Group with industry and public sector partners to identify the priority job roles for the sector, agree a common set of objectives, and commit to additional actions to be taken forward from now into 2026/27. This plan marks the first step in a long-term, coordinated programme of joint work to position Scotland as the world’s leading destination for developing the offshore wind workforce of the future.",https://www.gov.scot/assets/images/logos/SGLogo1200x630.png,N,,2025-11-12 08:01:08.916719

Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the United States risks being left behind as an economic power.
“This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,” Newsom said.
“We’re ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing.
“President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam.","BELEM, Brazil(AP) — Calling America’s absence from key United Nations climate negotiations “doubling down on stupid,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the United States risks being left behind as an economic power.

Newsom, a Democrat eyeing a 2028 presidential run, is so far the highest profile of several U.S. governors and mayors at U.N. climate talks being hosted in Belem, Brazil. They say they are here to tell the 195 nations who are trying to fight climate change that much of the United States is doing its best despite Trump administration policies overturning environmental regulations and aiding the production of dirty fuels, such as coal, while stymying green energies like wind and solar.

As he did during his first term, President Donald Trump is also pulling America from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set international goals to limit average global temperature rise.

Newsom's presence as governor of the most populous U.S. state serves to draw a clear contrast with Trump's absence. He said Trump's decision to skip the talks tells the world: “You don’t matter, we don’t care.”

“This idea that somehow we can put up walls, we can put up barriers, we could put up tariffs, we put up our middle fingers and just turn our back is lunacy,"" Newsom said during an exclusive Associated Press interview at the climate talks in Belem, a city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. ""And every other country in the world understands that. That’s why every other country in this world is moving in a different direction.”

Even Russia and Saudi Arabia get it and are going green, but not Trump, Newsom said. U.N. organizers said only four nations are absent from the negotiations called COP30: Strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar, tiny San Marino and the United States, which over the century has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air than any other nation.

California, with nearly 40 million residents, is a major economic hub and on the forefront of national climate policy. But the Trump administration has sought to roll back the state’s power to set aggressive climate policy, most notably by blocking a California regulation to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars within the next decade.

“This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,” Newsom said.

“We’re ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing. We’re ceding economic power to other countries, notably China, taking advantage of that absence,” Newsom said. “And they’re going to clean our clock economically unless we wake up to the economic imperative and opportunities of low carbon regrowth.”

Trump, who actively solicited money from the fossil fuel industry during his last campaign, has massively deregulated industry that spews heat-trapping gas and cut subsidies to renewable energy. This would give America — the No. 1 oil producer in the world — energy independence and cheaper prices, he has said.

“Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing!,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement, using one of Trump's favored nicknames for Newsom. “President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump’s common sense energy agenda.”

Climate change is undeniable, despite Trump calling it a hoax, Newsom said.

“If you don’t believe in science, and a lot of people apparently don’t, you have to believe in your own eyes,” Newsom said. “Nighttime temperatures, record-breaking heat globally, acidification of our oceans, impacts on our coral reefs. You’re not able to go where your grandfather brought you for the first time, your dad brought you and bring your kids because there’s another fire and it’s another closure and the air quality’s been degraded.”

California has warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in the past 30 years — slightly more than the U.S. as a whole — and gets nearly 7 inches of rain (17.7 centimeters) less now than it did in 1995, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.

Some of California's largest and most destructive wildfires in history have sparked in the last five years, including two January infernos that devastated neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles. The previous winter, meanwhile, brought record-breaking rainfall as multiple atmospheric rivers pounded the state.

“I’m just privileged to represent one of the most blessed and cursed states in the world that’s on the tip of the spear of the impacts of climate change,"" Newsom said. “How about the simultaneous crisis of wildfires, drought, and floods stacked on top of each other.”

“Anyone paying attention here?” added Newsom.

At home, Newsom has confronted the economic and political realities of pursuing the state's ambitious goal of by 2045 reaching carbon neutrality, or taking as much carbon pollution from the atmosphere as emitted. He recently signed legislation to boost oil production in part of the state, and his party has grappled with how to confront high gas prices. California also has some of the highest electricity rates in the country.

California is also dealing with the massive energy and water demands of data centers by keeping its last nuclear plant running longer than planned, adding huge chunks of solar power and battery storage and investing in nuclear fusion, Newsom said. Those energy needs will grow as AI continues to boom. Many of the nation's top AI companies are headquartered in California.

Veteran climate negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said it was unfortunate that America's federal government was not participating in the talks.

“But it is very positive that we have these other leaders from the United States that are here in Belem,” he said.

Now, the AFPM, or the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, has submitted comments to the EPA, or the Environmental Protection Agency, regarding its proposed supplemental rulemaking to the 2026-2027 Renewable Fuel Standard. The EPA has become a vestige of the US energy industry and regularly proposes changes to mandates and regulatory standards for US energy generation.

The EPA has added an addendum to its June RFS proposal, which has been lamented by the AFPM

The EPA has a somewhat controversial reputation in the US energy industry as it regularly delivers bad news for energy companies and petroleum producers. In June, the EPA released its initial RFS proposal, but recently amended it as it seeks to add to the already historic 2026-2027 RFS biofuel blending mandates.

The EPA has stated that the plan is to waive RFS costs from certain refineries over the period between 2023 and 2025 for the next tranche of RFS obligations. Renewable Fuel Standards were initially created by Congress way back in the mid-2000s, and the aim was and still is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and expand the United States’ renewable fuel sector while also reducing reliance on foreign oil imports. Sounds good, right? Not according to some.

The AFPM has lamented the proposal by the EPA, pointing to the incredible compliance costs in the future

While some might view the RFS proposal as a step in the right direction, the AFPM has noted that by reallocating the RFS mandate, the energy industry’s compliance costs will skyrocket beyond the already historic expenses we are already seeing, noting that the estimation is already sitting at an astonishing $150 billion for 2026/27. The EPA released a statement that kicks the can of responsibility back down the Presidential line to the previous administration.

“This proposal is an important step in the EPA’s tireless work to repair the damage done after four years of the Biden-Harris Administration neglecting key components of the RFS program, including threats to transform the RFS program into a subsidy for electric vehicle charging stations as part of a larger strategy to electrify the transportation sector. – EPA statement on RFS reallocation

Reallocation would raise the RFS well beyond what the market claims is acceptable

The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers has lamented the move proposed by the EPA to reallocate RFS, and has stated that the reallocation will raise biofuel feedstock costs and force the United States to continue to rely on foreign imports, the polar opposite of what the RFS is designed to do. The AFPM has noted that the EPA’s reallocation mandate will significantly increase soybean oil costs, thereby raising RFS compliance costs to record levels.

If that does happen, market analysts have noted that the total RFS costs, which we should mention are paid by American consumers and refiners, will increase from the projected $150 billion to an astonishing $190 billion over 2026 and 2027. With the latest round of sanctions on Russia placing the energy sector internationally in a precarious position, any other increases in compliance costs could negatively affect the US energy sector.

An estimated $1.6 billion in clean energy factories and projects were cancelled in September facing pressure from Trump administration and 500 solar projects, nearly 116 gigawatts (GW) of capacity, are also at risk, according to industry analyses.

There has been a steady drum beat of cancellations for clean energy industrial projects in 2025, now totaling $24.3 billion for the year, according to an analysis by E2, a clean energy industry group.

September cancellations hit four major battery storage and electric vehicle (EV) facilities in Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee.

General Motors downsized EV production in Tennessee and Kansas and Natron Energy shuttered its Michigan plant and halted a planned $1.4. billion North Carolina factory.

For the year, manufacturing projects account for almost all the investment cancellations, about $19.8 million, with battery storage and EV projects making up three-quarters of the scrapped projects.

“The findings underscore the growing risk that federal and administrative policy rollbacks—especially the removal of clean energy incentives—are destabilizing one of the nation’s fastest-growing industries, with ripple effects across supply chains, manufacturing hubs, and rural economic development,” the E2 analysis said.

A study by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) also identified 500 solar projects at risk due to “political attacks on the solar and storage industry.”

President Donald Trump has called solar energy part of “the scam of the century” and the administration’s budget bill adopted in July rapidly sunsets federal tax credits for wind and solar. In addition, permitting approvals and awarded funds have been slow in coming.

SEIA, using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, said it identified 73 GW of solar and 43 GW of storage projects that have not yet received all the required federal, state and local permits and are “at risk of being targeted by the administration.”

Projects must start construction by July 1, 2026 or be in operation by Dec. 31, 2027 to receive the federal Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit. The two credits can cover as much as 50% of the cost of a project.

The 116 GW of projects make up more than half of all new power planned to be built in the United States through 2030 and are spread across 44 states.

The states with most projects in jeopardy, according to SEIA, are: Texas with 165 projects, New York with 53 projects, and Virginia with 32 projects.

Based on projected new capacity, the states hardest hit would be Vermont where its two solar projects make 97% of the new capacity for the state, Nevada where eight projects make up 94% of new capacity, and Oregon where 9 at-risk projects make up 93% of slated new capacity.

“This federal red tape also undermines the energy security and policy certainty that businesses need to plan for the future,” said SEIA.

E2 also did a geographic and political analysis the factory cancellations finding that while Democratic congressional districts and states are losing the most from the administration cancelling federal clean energy funding, Republican districts are losing the most from private-sector cancellations.

“More than $12.4 billion in investments that would have created almost 15,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far in 2025,” E2 said. “Over $7.5 billion and 5,000 jobs have been lost in Democratic districts.”

Rapid Retooling of South Carolina Facility

Clarios plans to fast-track the restart of currently idled infrastructure at its Florence, South Carolina facility to quickly expand battery recycling capacity and add critical mineral processing capability. This existing site provides one of the fastest routes to scale and secure domestic capacity. With major infrastructure in place, the facility represents a unique opportunity to expand battery recycling in the U.S.

New U.S. State-of-the Art Greenfield Facility

Clarios is in the site selection and engineering phase for a planned state-of-the-art U.S. based battery recycling and critical mineral processing facility. This facility would represent a major investment in U.S.-based recovery and refining, creating a cornerstone for domestic supply chain resilience. Once operational, it will help ensure American capacity essential for growing demand and energy independence.

North American Capacity Expansion

To immediately increase U.S. available battery supply, Clarios is implementing A.I., automation, and capacity upgrades at its existing North American facilities in Mexico. These enhancements will increase throughput and efficiency, ensuring an increased flow of recycled critical materials to U.S. manufacturing sites, essential for the resilience of the North American supply chain.

Collectively, these initiatives would provide additional recycling capacity of up to 400,000 MT.

To complement these investments, Clarios will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire existing battery recycling capacity.

Taken together, these initiatives will allow the company to further scale battery recycling, accelerating efforts to secure supply chains and meet growing demand.

This marks a significant step forward in Clarios’ commitment to help advance American energy independence, support the circular economy, and ensure long-term access to essential materials for advanced energy storage technologies. These strategic initiatives are components of Clarios’ $6 billion American Energy Manufacturing Strategy, announced earlier this year, which aims to advance American energy and critical mineral independence by strengthening the nation’s critical supply of batteries essential to start every vehicle in the U.S. and would expand existing operations, build new facilities, unlock innovation and create American jobs.

For households not powered by electricity or natural gas, heating costs are expected to drop or remain steady this winter.
Wolfe encourages families to take small, consistent steps to manage heating costs before winter peaks.","ATLANTA — This week's cold blast is setting the stage for winter, and experts say heating your home could cost more this year.

“Everyone is saying prices are going up,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. ""Nobody is saying prices are coming down.""

Wolfe said rising costs for electricity and natural gas will make home heating more expensive for most families this winter. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association projects average home heating costs will rise 7.6%, from $907 last winter to about $976 this season. Families using electric heat will see the biggest jump — up 10.2% to about $1,205 — while natural gas costs are expected to rise from $639 to $693.

The organization, which represents state directors of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, said electricity and natural gas prices have been climbing at more than twice the rate of inflation, driven by higher gas prices, growing demand from data centers and grid maintenance.

“Electric utilities are rebuilding the grid, and that’s pushing up prices,” Wolfe said. “Data centers are also placing new demands on the grid, which is driving up costs even more.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2025–26 Winter Fuels Outlook, the majority of Americans heat their homes with natural gas or electric heat, with 46% using natural gas and 43% using electricity. The EIA’s outlook is less bullish, forecasting the average electricity bill will rise about 4% from November through March 2026, to a national average of about $1,130.

For households not powered by electricity or natural gas, heating costs are expected to drop or remain steady this winter. The EIA expects heating oil and propane costs to fall by just under 10%, while NEADA predicts savings closer to 5%.

Wolfe encourages families to take small, consistent steps to manage heating costs before winter peaks.

“Every one degree you turn your thermostat down can save about 2% on your bill,” Wolfe said. “Turn it down gradually — one degree a week — so you stay comfortable.”",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/bc4a27be-180e-4669-acdf-523c3abcc992/20251111T161005/bc4a27be-180e-4669-acdf-523c3abcc992_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 00:58:20.320969

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

(Reuters) -Global sales of fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 23% in October to 1.9 million units, driven by strong demand across major markets, market research firm Rho Motion said on Wednesday.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

Europe led regional electric vehicle growth with strong demand in Germany, France and the UK, while overall sales eased after a peak month and the European Union approved more battery projects.

China is the world’s biggest car market and accounts for more than half of global EV sales, which in Rho Motion’s data include battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.

The price parity between electric and ICE vehicles in China is a lot closer when compared with the European or the North American markets, Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said.

North America was a drag on monthly figures, with EV sales down 41% following record highs in August and September, as demand eased after a $7,500 tax credit expired, Lester added.

Battery-electric vehicles remain much pricier than comparable internal combustion models in the U.S., contributing to steep October sales declines across major automakers.

BY THE NUMBERS

Global sales of battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids rose 23% to 1.9 million units in October, Rho Motion data showed.

Chinese sales rose to about 1.3 million vehicles. European sales jumped 36% to 372,786 units, while North American sales dropped 41% to 100,370. Sales in the rest of the world jumped 37% to 141,368 vehicles.

KEY QUOTE

“In Europe, the overall year-to-date growth figure remains relatively high and we’re expecting strong sales towards the end of the year,” Lester said.

“Chinese automotive market is expected to show strong growth in November and December, helped by pull forward effect as the country is moving from a full purchase tax exemption to just a 50% exemption on NEVs,” he said.

In June 2025, California and a coalition of 10 other states in State of California et al. v. United States et al., No. 4:25-cv-04966-HSG (N.D. Cal.) filed a lawsuit challenging the authority of congressional Republicans and President Trump to revoke a waiver granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the waning days of the Biden administration permitting California to adopt more stringent emissions standards than those imposed under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA). Now auto industry participants will have to wait until at least early 2026 to learn whether they will need to comply with these emissions standards, after California and the other states in October 2025 filed an amended complaint mooting a pending motion to dismiss.

The Regulatory Backdrop: California’s Unique Clean Air Act Waiver Authority

Under the CAA, states typically are preempted from setting their own vehicle emissions standards. The CAA authorizes California to request from the EPA a special preemption “waiver,” however, which if granted, permits that state to adopt stricter emissions standards given historic air-quality challenges there. Moreover, although other states may not request such a waiver, Section 177 of the CAA permits states to follow California’s lead and adopt the emissions requirements imposed by California regulators (the “Section 177 States”).

In the closing days of the Biden administration in December 2024, the EPA granted three preemption waivers allowing the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to implement its Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II), Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT), and Omnibus Low NOx (Low NOx) rules. These rules and the EPA waivers would have allowed California and the Section 177 States to, among other things, require the complete phase out of the sale of new gas-powered passenger vehicles in those states by 2035 and require more heavy-duty trucks to be zero-emission vehicles.

Congressional Review Act Challenge to California’s EPA Waivers

In January 2025, congressional Republicans formally challenged the EPA’s grant of these waivers by invoking the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The CRA is an oversight tool that allows Congress to revisit and revoke federal agency rulemaking actions by requiring all final rules to be submitted to Congress and allowing any member of Congress to introduce a joint resolution disapproving an agency’s final rule. A CRA resolution passed by Congress and signed by the President has the force and effect of federal law and prevents the rule in question from going into effect. Moreover, no agency rule revoked under the CRA can be reissued by a federal agency in the same or “substantially similar” fashion.

On June 12, 2025, President Trump signed three joint resolutions under the CRA that revoked the three California CAA waivers. As a result, California and the Section 177 States no longer had the authority to implement and enforce the ACC II, ACT, and Low NOx rules in their states. If these CRA resolutions are upheld, those waivers arguably could not be granted by the EPA again in the future, effectively curbing California’s regulatory power in this area.

California and Affected States Bring Lawsuit Challenging CRA Authority

The same day the CRA resolutions were signed into law, California and a coalition of 10 other states filed a lawsuit in federal court in California against the EPA, the federal government, and related entities alleging that the use of the CRA to revoke the waivers was improper. Their argument focus largely on the EPA’s historical treatment of preemption waivers as case-specific adjudicatory orders, not rules. That distinction is critical, because the CRA is only available to Congress to review “final rules,” a term with a specific meaning under Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and for the purposes of the CRA.

Even before the federal government responded to the complaint, numerous industry participants sought to intervene, voicing serious concerns about both the technological feasibility of ACC II, ACT, and Low NOx emission standards and the consumer demand necessary to make them commercially viable. This included a motion to intervene filed on September 5, 2025 by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (“Auto Innovators”) and the National Automobile Dealers Association (“NADA”), trade associations representing the interests of U.S. automobile manufacturers and dealers, respectively. These associations argued their members would suffer direct and substantial economic harm if the EPA’s preemption waiver were reinstated, particularly “in light of California’s threat that it will retroactively enforce the ACC II regulations as to vehicles already sold and as to model years already past, should it be successful in this litigation.”

Motion to Dismiss Met with Amended Complaint

For automakers, suppliers, dealers, and ancillary sectors, the stakes are high. Regardless of its outcome, the case is likely to heavily impact the future of U.S. vehicle-emissions policy, including vehicle design, manufacturing investments, supply chains, and market roll-out strategies. On September 19, 2025, the United States moved to dismiss the complaint filed by California and the other states, arguing that Congress and the President had acted within their authority under the CRA. Rather than oppose this motion, California and the other states on October 10, 2025 filed an amended complaint, mooting the federal government’s motion to dismiss and the multiple motions filed by potential intervenors—including Auto Innovators and NADA—seeking to file amicus briefs in support of the federal government’s motion.

On October 23, 2025, the court entered an order requiring that the United States file its renewed motion to dismiss by November 23, 2025; responses from California and the other states be filed by December 23, 2025; replies be filed by January 19, 2026, with a motion hearing set for January 29, 2026. It appears auto industry participants will have to wait until at least early 2026 to learn whether they will be required to comply with these stringent new California emissions standards. Longer term, it remains to be seen whether these developments will curb the ability of California to adopt regulations requiring manufacturers and dealers to phase out the sale of new gas-powered passenger vehicles in that state, and by extension, the Section 177 States.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15875_2214.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 23:00:34.316867

“The regulatory agency staff… are not telling us anything about the proposed cleanup plan, they are adamant,” said Janet Johnson, Richmond Shoreline Alliance coordinator.
Neither the earlier EPA plan nor the community’s proposed plan has a solution to the disposal problem.","On the 37th day of the federal government shutdown, about two dozen Richmond residents and environmentalists met at Easter Hill United Methodist Church to discuss the cleanup of the United Heckathorn Superfund Site.

The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for monitoring and decontaminating the site, which includes the Lauritzen Channel (pictured above) in Richmond’s Inner Harbor and an adjacent section of land. The federal government shutdown has delayed the development of an agency-approved cleanup plan. However, Richmond residents at last Thursday’s meeting said a lack of urgency and transparency around the cleanup is nothing new.

The EPA first attempted to remove the carcinogenic pesticides dieldrin and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane in the 1990s by dredging sediments from the channel and laying a concrete cap over the land portion to contain toxic substances, but a 2016 study showed that toxins remained in soil, sediments, water, and tissues of marine organisms, so the agency went back to the drawing board.

Early this year, the EPA launched a robust community consultation process and proposed a timeline for developing a second cleanup plan. It promised to lead six open community meetings and additional meetings with representatives from the environmental nonprofits Richmond Shoreline Alliance, SF Baykeeper and the Sierra Club. The EPA planned to release the plan for public feedback in early 2026.

At the first five meetings, EPA representatives shared information about the Superfund process and details about the site’s history, contaminants and resulting health risks. They told how the site was home to the United Heckathorn Chemical Co. from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s. The company was one of several in the area that manufactured or shipped pesticides, including DDT, which the federal government banned in 1972, and dieldrin, which was banned the following decade. Both pose a plethora of health risks — from cancer and respiratory issues to damaged reproductive and nervous systems.

Last month, the EPA was supposed to hold the sixth and final community meeting about ridding those chemicals from the Lauritzen Channel, which feeds into the San Francisco Bay. But the meeting has been pushed back to January.

Feeling left out

An EPA spokesperson said the delay was agreed to by community partners, given the government shutdown. Environmentalists involved in these conversations said uncertainty over if and when EPA employees involved in the project would be furloughed during the shutdown was the deciding factor.

Residents and environmental groups said that they felt frozen out of meaningful dialogue even before the shutdown.

“The regulatory agency staff… are not telling us anything about the proposed cleanup plan, they are adamant,” said Janet Johnson, Richmond Shoreline Alliance coordinator.

This prompted RSA, the Sierra Club and SF Baykeeper to draw up a separate cleanup plan based on consultations with engineers, environmental scientists, former government workers and the community. They propose draining the Lauritzen Channel, then removing all contaminated soil, sediment, rocks and industrial debris.

More than two months after submitting the plan to the EPA, the coalition has received no response to the proposal. The agency told Richmond Confidential that the government now plans to release its plan in the first half of next year.

Without divulging the government’s plan, an EPA spokesperson stated in an email that “the EPA’s focus has been, and will continue to be, fulfilling the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment by cleaning up the marine sediment area of the United Heckathorn site.”

The pace of the cleanup process has been a source of frustration for residents, who note that the neighborhoods nearest the site are low income and predominantly Black and Latinx communities.

“If it was another area, would it have been 30 years to take care of it? I don’t think so,” said Linda Whitmore, a Santa Fe neighborhood council member, at Thursday’s meeting.

Disposal remains a problem

Lejon Fahim Reese, another Santa Fe neighborhood council member, highlighted generations of health issues in his community. “Just growing up down there, my grandmother passed of cancer, and there’s a lot of people being affected.”

Residents also raised concerns about where any contaminated material would be disposed of. When the channel was first dredged in the 1990s, Richmond journalist Vernon Whitmore followed the dredged material to a landfill in the Arizona desert. He said he was shocked to see the landfill bordered a Native American reservation.

“The dumpsite is dirty and dusty. The wind is plowing. That made me think, they’re breathing in all this toxic dust,” Whitmore said. “It was really sad.”

Toxic compounds like dieldrin and DDT never break down. Neither the earlier EPA plan nor the community’s proposed plan has a solution to the disposal problem.

Johnson, of the Shoreline Alliance, urged those in attendance at the meeting to keep pushing the cleanup process forward.

“Especially in light of the challenges posed by climate change and sea level rise, our community must advocate strongly for the complete removal of all contaminated materials,” she said. “This is not just an environmental issue. It’s about ensuring the health and safety of our community for generations to come.”",http://richmondconfidential.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lauritzenchannel.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 21:06:05.930214

This year’s abrupt shift in federal energy policy has sent the US decarbonization journey into a tailspin. Nevertheless, the tea leaves are lining up for a fresh burst of wind and solar activity after the current occupant of the White House decamps as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully this time, one hopes. One good indicator is the pace of activity in the long duration energy storage field, where long years of R&D are finally beginning to pay off.

The Long Road To Long Duration Energy Storage

Traditional lithium-ion batteries have already enabled wind and solar energy to become a widespread feature in the nation’s electricity grid. To get to the next level of renewable energy saturation, though, the grid needs new energy storage systems that can store more clean kilowatts for longer periods of time. Decarbonizing industrial processes also requires longer lasting, more powerful energy storage systems.

That’s going to be a tough row to hoe. Currently, a single, century-old technology — pumped hydro — commands about 95% of utility-scale long duration energy storage capacity in the US. Hydropower innovators have been devising new systems to expand the reach of pumped storage, but access to water resources will continue to be a limiting factor.

The search for more flexible, transportable, and economical long duration energy storage systems has ranged far and wide, with thermal storage being a particular area of focus. Thermal systems transfer wind or solar energy into a storage medium, the molten salt in concentrating solar power plants being one example.

In 2018, the US Department of Energy launched a new initiative aimed at stimulating investor interest in new long duration energy storage systems. Called DAYS (short for Duration Addition to electricitY Storage), the program set a goal of 10 hours and up, far longer than the capabilities of conventional lithium-ion batteries.

One of the first US startups to receive funding through the DAYS program was the California firm Antora Energy. In 2019 the company received a grant through the Energy Department’s ARPA-E office for the delivery of a “thermophotovoltaic heat engine capable of efficiently and durably converting high-temperature heat into electricity,” aimed at decarbonizing industrial processes.

All That Hard Work Is Beginning To Pay Off

As the name suggests, thermophotovoltaic devices convert heat to electricity. TVP technology began surfacing in the 1990s. Though it initially resisted commercial application, it began to show more promise by the time DAYS launched, and the Energy Department decided to give it a closer look.

“[The new battery] will seek to double panel efficiency through new materials and smart system design, potentially enabling a cost effective grid storage solution,” the Energy Department noted.

Antora’s “heat battery” solution can function as a TVP device or it can deliver direct high-temperature heat for industrial processes. Either way, the same basic economic factor is at work. The battery can soak up excess wind and solar power when electricity rates are low, and deploy it whenever needed.

“Antora leverages renewable electricity to heat blocks of solid carbon — a low-cost, earth-abundant, and safe storage medium that’s used extensively across industries — to glowing hot temperatures in an insulated battery module,” the company states. “The stored heat is then reliably delivered at the scale and temperatures that large industrial operations demand, or can be converted directly into electricity using Antora’s TPV technology.”

Scaling Up Long Duration Energy Storage

Antora came into the DAYS program with a head start through the Shell GameChanger Accelerator at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which verified a 35% conversion efficiency for the technology. By 2023, Antora achieved two milestones considered necessary for commercial applications, providing heat at 1,800°C while achieving a conversion efficiency of 40%. The benchmarks earned Antora a combined total of $4 million in new grants from ARPA-E and the California Energy Commission that year.

That was peanuts compared to last year. In 2024 Antora nailed down $150 million in Series B funding, with Decarbonization Partners in the lead. Last March, the Energy Department also selected Antora to receive a substantial award for commercial scaleup under its Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, though the office has since been vaporized by the Trump administration.

Energy Department or not, Antora is still on track for commercial scaleup. In 2023 the company announced plans to build a manufacturing facility in San Jose, and earlier today the software-based advanced manufacturing systems engineer Manufacturo took note of its role in lifting Antora beyond the prototype phase.

“As they moved from engineering prototypes to real production, they needed an operational backbone that could keep pace with rapid iteration while establishing audit-ready traceability for future scale,” Manufacturo explained.

“When I started at Antora our production floor was an empty building. Manufacturo is one of the tools we relied heavily on to rapidly scale into our current steady-state production line,” said Antora’s New Product Introduction Manager, Ian Reed, in a press statement.

Next Steps For Long Duration Energy Storage

As described by Manufacturo, the operation is in the pilot phase leading into volume production. “As routings and approvals stabilize, the team is progressing from pilot cadence toward a regular output rhythm. The emphasis is a predictable drumbeat without adding friction on the floor,” Manufacturo explains.

Meanwhile, Antora already has several irons in the fire, including a proposed hookup with POET’s Big Stone City biofuel plant in South Dakota and a potential agreement with Shell to assess its technology for use in chemicals production, among other processes.

Keep an eye on the renewables-friendly state of New York for additional activity. In June of 2024 Antora received an award of $14.5 million from ARPA-E, part of which was earmarked for an energy storage partnership between Antora and Con Edison, the utility covering New York City and Westchester County.

In 2024, Con Edison produced a detailed plan for decarbonizing its district steam network, based on an initial assessment of two dozen clean energy technologies. From that pool, Con Edison selected thermal energy storage as one of three technologies that will drive its near term steam decarbonization efforts, along with electric boilers and industrial heat pumps.

“These assets represent the most technologically- and- commercially-mature decarbonization technologies available, the use of which would result in the electrification of up to one third of the total steam capacity by 2035,” the company states.

A strident political foe of U.S. President Donald Trump, Newsom has for months been teasing a run for the White House in 2028. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he is expected to meet with officials from some of the 195 governments attending this year’s U.N. climate negotiations.

He has planned meetings with a series of subnational leaders, including the governor of Brazil’s state of Para, the location of the summit.

Though California is just one of 50 U.S. states, its economy is the world’s fourth-largest – making it a key player in influencing markets and energy policy.

“The reason I’m here is in the absence of leadership coming from the United States,” he said at an investors summit in Brazil’s financial hub of Sao Paulo on Monday. “This vacuum, it’s rather jaw-dropping.”

Newsom has touted California’s embrace of green tech, highlighting that the state has seven times more renewable energy jobs than fossil fuel jobs and reminding people that EV giant Tesla was founded in California. This is in sharp contrast to Washington’s climate denial and determination to boost global use of polluting fossil fuels.

Newsom also lamented the U.S. rollback on clean energy policy as ceding the fast-growing green-tech market to China.

“China gets it,” Newsom told investors. “United States is toast competitively if we don’t wake up to what the hell they’re doing in this space, on supply chains, how they’re dominating manufacturing, how they’re flooding the zone here, EU, elsewhere, Africa.”

China not only dominates the markets for electric vehicles, renewable energy components and batteries, he said, but it also leads in software while U.S. automakers like General Motors are “trying to recreate the 19th century,” Newsom said. GM recently slowed its production of EVs.

The United States has conspicuously snubbed this year’s COP30 summit, with Trump falsely declaring climate change a hoax.

Some diplomats worried that Trump’s Republican administration might try to disrupt the summit from afar.

Newsom, a Democrat, said last month that he is mulling a presidential run in 2028. He has started to parrot Trump’s brash style of messaging on social media.

Last week, California voters backed his proposal to redraw the state’s voting districts to offset redistricting in other states aimed at boosting the number of congressional seats held by Republicans.

Newsom told investors in Sao Paulo that Trump was emulating Russia and Saudi Arabia in turning the United States into a “petro state” and embracing Chinese-style “state capitalism” over the free market. He criticized Trump’s aggressive tariff policies as “madness from an investment perspective.”

“I feel like it’s modeled a little bit on President Xi, not President Reagan. The hell’s going on?” he said.

Atlanta. More than two decades ago, Porsche succeeded in transferring the legend of the sports car brand to a new market segment with the Cayenne. Since 2002, the SUV has represented the ideal blend of performance, versatility and everyday practicality. With the Cayenne Electric, Porsche is now opening a new chapter in the success story of the model series – with outstanding driving dynamics, excellent long-distance comfort, off-road capability and the efficiency of modern e-mobility. Based on Porsche's latest electric vehicle architecture, the Cayenne Electric aims to set new standards in the SUV segment – both in terms of performance and charging capability as well as comfort and digital connectivity. The Cayenne Electric will complement the existing range of combustion-engined and plug-in hybrid Cayenne variants, allowing the most diverse model lineup offered in the car’s 23-year history.

Porsche will broadcast the world premiere of the Cayenne Electric on November 19, 2025 from 9:00am EST in the Porsche Newsroom – at newsroom.porsche.com, on the Porsche YouTube channel and on LinkedIn – and will afterwards be available on demand.

Shortly after, on November 22 and 23, the Cayenne Electric will celebrate its public premiere at the fifth Icons of Porsche festival in Dubai, one of the most important brand events in the region. Last year, an estimated 28,000 sports car fans from around the world flocked to the Porsche-themed exhibition area.

This trend is defined by the rapid acceleration of used Electric Vehicle (EV) sales, which are selling significantly faster than comparable gas vehicles and even new EVs. The core implication is that affordability, driven by the influx of off-lease, three-year-old models, is now the primary catalyst for mass EV adoption.

The Velocity Discrepancy: Used EVs (specifically three-year-old models) are moving off dealer lots faster than the market average and much faster than hybrids. The Tesla Model S, for example, sells in 21.5 days compared to 29 days for the Toyota Corolla Hybrid. This speed indicates high consumer demand and limited available supply.

This rapid turnover signals a massive shift in consumer priorities, where the used EV's value proposition is immediately clear and highly desirable.

The market is no longer dominated solely by Tesla; models from Hyundai, Kia, Ford, and Audi are also seeing quick sales, indicating the trend is broadening across EV manufacturers.

The increased competition for these limited used units is one of the reasons buyers ""act fast,"" highlighting the supply constraint in this specific market segment.

Affordability as the Adoption Driver: The average price of many three-year-old used EVs is clustered in the mid-$20,000s (Model 3, Ioniq 5, ID.4, EV6). This price point is dramatically lower than the new car average of $50,000 and the original MSRPs of $50,000-$70,000.

This mid-price range makes high-tech vehicles accessible to consumers who are ""balking at new cars"" due to high inflation and rising transaction prices.

The affordability factor has surpassed the influence of the now-expired $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, demonstrating a self-sustaining market dynamic.

The used EV provides a superior technology-to-price ratio compared to used gas cars, offering better performance and lower operating costs at the same price point.

Insight: The real tipping point for EVs is not new car incentives, but the maturing of the lease cycle creating an accessible mid-market price segment.

Why it is Trending: Price Pressure Meets Performance Value

The trend is gaining momentum because the soaring cost of new cars is forcing consumers into the used market, where EVs offer a superior value proposition in terms of technology and total cost of ownership (TCO).

New Car Price Ceiling: With the average new car price exceeding $50,000, used EVs in the mid-$20,000s provide a compelling alternative for value-seeking buyers.

This affordability factor is essential as buyers become more ""selective and cautious,"" taking longer to make purchase decisions on high-priced used gas cars.

The rising costs are causing market friction, which used EVs are uniquely positioned to exploit.

The used EV market offers a predictable and established price point, unlike the volatile new EV market.

Superior Technology and Performance at a Discount: For a price in the mid-$20,000s, used EV buyers gain access to vehicles with technology, acceleration, and quiet operation that is an ""order of magnitude better than used gas cars"" at the same price.

Buyers get a ""far more high-tech vehicle"" due to the rapid advancement of EV platforms over the past three years.

The promise of lower operating costs (fuel and maintenance) further enhances the total value proposition.

The existing and ""growing fast-charging network"" removes a major barrier to adoption for used EV buyers.

The Limited Supply Catalyst: The current scarcity—used EVs account for only 1.6% of the three-year-old market—creates a sense of urgency.

This low availability means buyers must ""snag the deal before it's gone,"" contributing to the faster days on lot (DOL) metric.

The supply constraint is a temporary, but powerful, market driver pushing up the sales velocity.

As EV sales grew rapidly only recently, the three-year-old supply is naturally limited, but this will change soon.

Insight: Used EVs are trending because they provide the best combination of price relief, functional technology, and performance thrill in the current inflationary auto market.

Overview: The Maturation of the Electric Vehicle Economy

The rapid sale of used EVs signifies the transition of the electric vehicle market from a fringe technology subsidized by incentives to a mature economic segment driven by supply, demand, and genuine consumer value.

The used EV market is demonstrating remarkable resilience, bucking the trend of slower turnover seen across the general used car sector. Edmunds data shows that while the average used car price rose by 5% to $31,000 in Q3 2025, used EVs are selling faster than gas vehicles, a trend now broadening beyond just Teslas to include high-volume models from Hyundai, Kia, Ford, and Audi. This momentum is not reliant on tax credits or aggressive incentives, but purely on the strong value proposition: getting a highly technological, performance-driven vehicle for an affordable price in the mid-$20,000s. The challenge remains supply, as three-year-old EVs are scarce (1.6% of the market), but this is forecasted to improve as the first large wave of new EV leases matures, ensuring the trend is likely to continue.

Insight:Used EVs are the true bellwether for mass electrification, proving consumer demand when the price is right.

Detailed Findings: The Dual-Action Blueprint: Price Point and Technology Premium

The success of the used EV market is rooted in the synergistic effect of hitting a mass-market price point while delivering performance and technology that drastically outperform gas equivalents.

The Affordability Cluster: The data clearly shows a cluster of desirable used EVs (Model 3, Model Y, Ioniq 5, ID.4, EV6) priced between $23,000 and $28,000. This makes them directly competitive with used mid-range gas cars like the Honda Accord or high-end used hybrids like the Lexus NX 350h, but with significantly higher original MSRPs and technology.

The initial price erosion from the original MSRP (e.g., Model 3 down from $57,009 to $24,447) creates a massive perceived value win for the used buyer.

This mid-price segment offers the greatest delta in value compared to new cars, which are averaging over $50,000.

The price drop essentially makes premium performance and technology accessible to the median consumer.

The Performance and Experience Advantage: Buyers are not just getting a ""green"" car; they are getting vehicles known for ""neck-snapping acceleration,"" silent operation, and high-tech cockpits.

This performance differential is a major selling point that used gas cars cannot replicate.

The driving experience is a core part of the value proposition, extending beyond mere cost savings.

Low operating costs (less maintenance, cheaper ""fuel"") further sweeten the deal over the expected lifespan.

Market Predictability: The used market offers stability and predictability, contrasting with the new EV market where automakers ""tinker with pricing"" and incentives change monthly.

This certainty is attractive to cautious buyers in an inflationary economy.

The stability reduces the fear of buying at the wrong time, driving faster purchase decisions.

The used market's transparent pricing process aids buyer confidence.

Insight: The market is rewarding functional and economic predictability combined with superior dynamic performance.

Key Success Factors: The Pillars of Used EV Momentum

The momentum of used EV sales is driven by a unique combination of external economic pressure, internal product superiority, and market dynamics.

Inflationary Economic Pressure: The soaring average price of new cars ($50,000+) and rising used gas car prices pushes buyers towards the used EV segment as the only remaining high-tech, affordable alternative.

The financial pain points of the broader auto market create a pull for used EVs.

The trend is externally driven by inflation and consumer budgeting.

The Lease Cycle Flood (Future Supply): The forecast that the current generation of new EV leases (purchased during the tax credit frenzy) will mature soon suggests an imminent strong supply wave.

Anticipation of this supply stabilizes expectations for future inventory.

Current buyers are ""snagging"" the initial scarcity before the flood arrives.

Technology & Performance Superiority: The core product delivers a quieter, faster, and more high-tech experience than equally priced used gas cars, offering an unmatched value-for-performance ratio.

This is an inherent, unchangeable advantage of the EV platform.

The technology is only three years old, remaining highly relevant and functional.

Expanded Brand Presence: The acceleration of sales across multiple brands (Hyundai, Kia, Ford, Audi, not just Tesla) validates that the trend is about the EV platform's inherent value, not just brand hype.

This breadth indicates market maturity and consumer acceptance of electrification generally.

Insight: The combination of economic necessity and genuine product excellence creates an irresistible buying climate.

Key Takeaway: Affordability Decides the Future of Electrification

The critical takeaway is that mass adoption of EVs is contingent upon achieving a sub-$30,000 price point, a threshold currently being met almost exclusively by the used market.

The Price-Point Mandate: The success of the mid-$20,000 used EV confirms that mass consumers are ready for EVs, but only at a significant discount from the new MSRP.

The market has clearly spoken: the sweet spot for widespread EV adoption is in the mid-twenties.

New EV manufacturers must accelerate cost reductions to compete with their own three-year-old models.

Demand Outpaces New Supply: Production bottlenecks and limited runs for new affordable models (like the cut in Nissan Leaf production or the ""limited run"" Chevy Bolt) mean the used market is the most viable path to affordable EV ownership for the near future.

The used market is providing the volume and pricing the new market cannot currently deliver.

The Predictability Premium: Consumer choice is increasingly driven by market transparency and predictability, which the used EV market currently offers over the volatile, incentive-heavy new EV space.

Buyers want certainty, and the used market delivers it.

Insight: The used car lot is currently doing more to accelerate electrification than the new car showroom.

Core Consumer Trend: The Value Electrification Pursuit

Consumers are actively seeking out the best functional technology and performance for the lowest possible price, driving them directly to the value proposition of off-lease EVs.

The core consumer trend is the Value Electrification Pursuit. This segment is financially pragmatic and technologically aware. They are primarily motivated by the desire to access superior EV performance and low operating costs, but without paying the high $50,000+ new car premium. They view the used market as the smart, low-risk way to ""buy into the future"" without paying a depreciation tax. Their decision is rooted in a sober calculation of technology-per-dollar and a desire to avoid the unpredictability of new car pricing.

Description of the Trend: Broadening Accessibility via Secondary Market

The Scarcity Factor: The current low supply (1.6% of three-year-old vehicles) contributes to the rapid sales velocity, forcing buyers to act quickly. This supply crunch temporarily amplifies the demand.

Brand Diversification: The shift from a Tesla-only phenomenon to one including models from Hyundai, Kia, and Ford indicates that the technology has been fully validated and is no longer reliant on the ""early mover"" status of one brand.

The Predictable Supply Cycle: The current high demand and low supply will soon be rectified by the maturing of the first wave of leased EVs, signaling a self-correcting supply cycle that will sustain the trend.

Insight: The secondary market is serving as the critical launch ramp for mass electrification that the primary market could not financially sustain.

Key Characteristics: Velocity, Mid-Price Clustering, and Brand Breadth

The trend is defined by its speed of sale, the tight clustering of desirable models at an affordable price point, and the broadening of brands participating in the accelerated turnover.

High Sales Velocity (Low DOL): EVs are selling significantly faster than the average used car (21.5 days vs. ~29 days), demonstrating intense, focused demand.

Mid-$20K Price Sweet Spot: The most desirable used EVs are priced in the mid-$20,000 range, confirming this price point as the market's most sensitive affordability threshold.

Broad Brand Representation: The top 20 fastest-selling used vehicles include eight EVs from diverse manufacturers (Tesla, Hyundai, Kia, Audi, Ford), proving the trend is platform-driven.

Insight: The data confirms that affordability is a function of price segmentation, with the mid-$20K range being the most potent driver.

Market and Cultural Signals: Inflation, Performance, and Supply Constraints

This trend is supported by clear market signals indicating consumers are reacting defensively to high new-car prices while simultaneously seeking high-performance technology.

New Car Price Rejection: The average new car price hitting $50,000 is the primary market signal driving buyers away from the new market and into the used EV segment.

Used Market Selectivity: The fact that average used vehicles are sitting longer on lots (as buyers are more ""selective and cautious"") contrasts with the quick turnover of used EVs, signaling that used EVs are a specific, highly sought-after category.

The Post-Incentive Demand: Used EV sales surging without the immediate lure of the $7,500 tax credit proves the demand is based on inherent economic value (TCO, depreciation, etc.), not just temporary subsidies.

Insight: The market is filtering for superior intrinsic value over low-quality inventory.

Consumer Motivation: Financial Relief and Technology Upgrade

Consumers are fundamentally motivated by solving two problems simultaneously: finding financial relief in an inflationary environment and accessing next-generation technology/performance.

Financial Prudence: The desire to avoid the ""egregious price tag"" of new cars is the initial motivation, making the mid-$20,000 used EV a calculated act of financial relief.

Performance Upgrade: The opportunity to acquire a vehicle with ""neck-snapping acceleration"" and high-tech features for the same price as a slower, aging gas car is a powerful performance motivation.

Risk Reduction: The used market offers more predictability than the volatile new EV market, appealing to a motivation for purchase certainty.

Insight: The core motivation is the calculated avoidance of financial and technological obsolescence.

Motivation Beyond the Trend: Escaping Automotive Volatility

Beyond the immediate price and technology benefits, consumers are motivated by the stability offered by the used market, escaping the volatility and supply issues plaguing the new EV sector.

Escaping Pricing Tinkerers: Buyers are motivated to avoid the new market where automakers ""tinker with pricing,"" seeking the stability and transparency of the used market.

Avoiding Supply Chain Frustration: The reality of limited-run new models (Nissan Leaf, Chevy Bolt) drives buyers to the used market, where they have a better chance of finding an available vehicle that satisfies their needs.

Lower Operating Costs: The motivation to secure lower long-term operating costs (lower fuel, less maintenance) is a rational economic decision that transcends the initial purchase price.

Insight: The secondary market provides a refuge of stability and certainty from the chaotic, high-cost primary market.

Description of Consumers: The Pragmatic Tech Adopter

,North Carolina Environment,2025-11-11 23:27:00+00:00,N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative,"On the Backroads, Again | N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative",Dee Shore,,,,,https://cals.ncsu.edu/psi/news/on-the-backroads-again/,"If you can do that cheaper with a machine, that’s a lot easier.” After meeting with Lemkes, the tour group met with NC State Apple Wedge’s Greg Nix and Bryson Nix-Edney and Tom Kon, a NC State Extension apple specialist who has worked closely with them.
Engaging with Extension In addition to learning more about WNC agricultural research, tour participants also gained insight into another asset for the region’s farmers: N.C.
Extension has 101 centers across the state, with local agents working directly with growers to provide unbiased knowledge and leading-edge technology.
When it comes to feeding the world, we need discoveries that drive innovation, especially for small- and medium-scale farms.
Sarah Kirby, NC State Extension assistant director, said such partnerships between researchers and Extension agents are critical to the state’s agricultural future.","In what has become a nearly annual tradition, the North Carolina Plant Sciences Initiative hit the road this fall, giving researchers from multiple disciplines the chance to learn about key problems facing North Carolina agriculture.

This year’s Backroad Tour, held Sept. 29-30, took over 30 researchers from five NC State University colleges and N.C. A&T State University on a bus trip to the western part of the state.

Like tours in 2022 and 2023, this year’s expedition gave participants the chance to learn more about farm challenges and potential solutions and to build relationships with other experts, growers, agricultural leaders and Extension agents and specialists to tackle them.

As Rachel Vann, director of N.C. PSI’s platform for extension outreach and engagement, explained, “The overarching goal is to connect people who aren’t from an agricultural background with applied issues and stakeholders so they can really understand what are the problems that need to be solved, see them with their own eyes, and form teams to address those problems.”

To get to concrete solutions .. you have to have the computer scientist and the crop specialist and all of these other areas of expertise together, talking — and talking with the producers that have the challenges.

Along with staff and faculty from the N.C. PSI, participants included researchers from NC A&T and NC State’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), College of Natural Resources, College of Engineering, College of Sciences and the Wilson College of Textiles.

As Amy Grunden, an N.C. PSI faculty affiliate and CALS’ co-interim associate dean for research, noted, “This kind of networking, along with seeing how these production operations really happen, is going to make a difference when it comes to innovation that helps our growers feed people.

“To get to concrete solutions that make a difference,” she added, “you have to have the computer scientist and the crop specialist and all of these other areas of expertise together, talking — and talking with the producers that have the challenges.”

Leveraging the N.C. Ag Analytics Platform

At the tour’s first stop at N.C. A&T State University in Greensboro, participants learned more about the N.C. Ag Analytics Platform and its capabilities, and they were encouraged to think about how it could be leveraged to address regional challenges and opportunities they’d hear about during the rest of the tour.

Funded in 2024 by the state General Assembly, the platform taps the power and potential of real-time and historical data to enable farmers to increase agricultural productivity and sustainability.

The platform is a partnership of NC State, N.C. A&T and SAS Inc. SAS’ Dominique Moon, N.C. A&T researcher Hermandeep Sharma and Ag Analytics Program Manager Brad Lewis discussed a range of platform projects designed to:

aid farmers’ decision making about soybean and dairy production

improve waste lagoon management

create interventions for producers with disabilities

centralize data from agricultural research trials

uncover patterns in consumer perceptions of value-added agricultural products

From Greensboro, the group traveled southwest toward Asheville. At a lunch stop, Joe French, assistant commissioner for agricultural services with the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCDA&CS), discussed the devastating short- and long-term impacts that last year’s Hurricane Helene had on the agricultural industry on Western North Carolina (WNC) and other areas of the state, as well as the state of ongoing recovery efforts.

Seeing WNC Agriculture in Action

Participants spent the rest of the afternoon getting an up-close look at two important agricultural operations: Tri-Hishtil in Mills River and Apple Wedge Packers and Cider in Hendersonville.

Tri-Hishtil specializes in the greenhouse production of grafted plants, including seedless watermelons. Grafting involves joining the root stock of one plant with the shoot or bud of another to create plants with increased vigor and less susceptibility to soilborne diseases.

We’re only busy for six months out of the year, so every year I hope I get returning grafters. Otherwise, I’ve got to train for two weeks to get them up to speed. If you can do that cheaper with a machine, that’s a lot easier.

As he guided participants through the company’s greenhouse and grafting facility, General Manager Bert Lemkes described the need to automate the delicate, now labor-intensive grafting process in ways that don’t drive up what are already high seed costs.

“A good grafter does anywhere from 130 to 180 plants per hour,” said Lemkes, a member of the N.C. PSI Grower Advisory Council. “We’re only busy for six months out of the year, so every year I hope I get returning grafters. Otherwise, I’ve got to train for two weeks to get them up to speed. If you can do that cheaper with a machine, that’s a lot easier.”

After meeting with Lemkes, the tour group met with NC State Apple Wedge’s Greg Nix and Bryson Nix-Edney and Tom Kon, a NC State Extension apple specialist who has worked closely with them.

With a farmgate value of about $20 million, North Carolina’s apple industry ranks seventh in the nation, and Apple Wedge Packers and Cider plays an integral part.

Nix greeted the tour group in the company’s parking lot, talking over the engine noise and beeps of construction equipment completing a new 52,000-square-foot packing house and cidery.

A fifth-generation farmer, he started the packing business with his uncle in the 1980s, then began cider production in the 1990s. The family-owned company now packs and markets apples to grocery stores in the southeastern United States and beyond. A fire on Jan. 31 had destroyed the facility, but the family immediately set out to reconstruct the business.

Leading the group into a gleaming new building, Nix outlined steps the company takes to ensure sanitation, pointing out how the apples are cleaned, dried, waxed, sorted, labeled and packaged for sale.

Next, the group traveled to the family’s nearby orchard. There, Nix, Nix-Edney and Kon outlined some of the tools, technologies and management practices they use to improve production of a range of apple varieties.

Considering the ‘Real Goal’: Helping Society

Kristin Thoney-Barletta, of NC State’s Wilson College of Textiles, came away from the Apple Wedge tour with ideas to use her experience addressing challenges in military logistics and the textiles industry to solve agricultural problems.

Thoney-Barletta’s is an expert in operations research and analytics, and she’s already proposed a collaborative project to develop user-friendly artificial intelligence-driven tools to help small- and medium-scale apple farmers and packers minimize apple spoilage, maximize post-harvest labor efficiency and fulfill orders on time.

“It’s one thing for people to imagine what the problems of growers are, and it’s quite another to hear specifically from them. These are the problems they live, day in and day out,” said Thoney-Barletta, a professor and interim head of NC State’s Department of Textile and Apparel Technology and Management.

“You’re not solving a problem just because somebody thinks it is a problem. It’s a real problem, and to have the opportunity to form collaborative teams with interdisciplinary skill sets to address real problems interests me a lot,” she said.

To have the opportunity to form collaborative teams with interdisciplinary skill sets to address real problems interests me a lot.

Like Thoney-Barletta, James Reynolds appreciated getting to hear firsthand from Nix and Lemkes.

“One of the strengths of this trip is that it gives us the chance not only to hear from the people whose lives depend on these crops, but also to be in the environment that they’re in and get a better idea of what might work in that setting, under the conditions they face,” said Reynolds, an assistant research professor in electrical and computer engineering working with the N.C. PSI, the Advanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technology and the Institute for Connected Sensor-Systems.

This kind of experience reminds us not to lose sight of the real goal, to help society.

“You get to see things you might not think of if you are just working in a lab and focused on papers. This kind of experience reminds us not to lose sight of the real goal, to help society.”

Learning More About Ag Research in WNC

The next morning, the group turned its attention to the role of agricultural research and extension in Western North Carolina. They visited the Mountain Horticultural Crops Research and Extension Center in Mills River, one of 18 statewide locations operated through a partnership of CALS and the NCDA&CS.

The stop emphasized research to strengthen the region’s key agricultural industries:

Apples: Kon followed up on the discussion in Nix’s orchard the day before by showing the group his research plots. He focused on a current project that could ultimately help apple farmers make better decisions about labor-intensive production practices such as pruning, thinning and harvesting.

Kon previously connected with diverse expertise through a N.C. PSI Connecting2Grow event, and with Chenhan Xu, an assistant professor of computer science, and Edgar Lobaton, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, he is studying ways to use portable, noninvasive imaging, near-infrared and visible spectroscopy to estimate key characteristics of buds, fruitlets and mature fruits. That insight could help growers lower production costs and raise yields.

Christmas trees: North Carolina is the second-leading state in U.S. Christmas tree production, harvesting 5 million to 6 million trees a year. NC State College of Natural Resources scientist and Extension specialist Justin Whitehill discussed his efforts to better understand the molecular interactions that occur when insects and diseases attack Christmas trees and use that knowledge to create trees that withstand shifting climate conditions and shifting pest pressures. Whitehill also described a partnership with the NCDA&CS to get genetically improved seeds to the industry.

Rusty Barr added insights from his perspective as owner of Barr Evergreens in Ashe County. A member of the N.C. PSI Grower Advisory Council, Barr produces seedlings and fully grown trees for wholesale and retail markets. Hurricane Helene wiped out a quarter-million seedlings on his farm last year, while damage from deer, drought and emerging diseases are ongoing threats.

Tomatoes: Reza Shekasteband of NC State’s Department of Horticultural Science outlined efforts that support the state’s fresh market tomato industry, valued at $34 million annually. While the tomato breeding program has traditionally focused on disease resistance and flavor, Shekasteband is also working to develop compact plants that would be suitable for low-cost mechanical harvesting. Automation could be a way for growers to manage rising labor costs and shortages.

Shekasteband’s work caught the attention of tour participant Kara Peters, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and associate dean with NC State’s College of Engineering.

After the tour, Peters joined Shekasteband, horticultural scientist Emmanuel Torres Quezada and communications professor Roy Schwartzman in proposing interdisciplinary, stakeholder-informed research to evaluate plant yield at regular time points during the plant growth cycle.

Tapping into the Ag Analytics Platform, the project could speed the breeder’s efforts to evaluate breeding lines and identify the most promising parent plants.

Engaging with Extension

In addition to learning more about WNC agricultural research, tour participants also gained insight into another asset for the region’s farmers: N.C. Cooperative Extension. Extension has 101 centers across the state, with local agents working directly with growers to provide unbiased knowledge and leading-edge technology.

Horticulture agent Karen Blaedow, of Henderson County, and Sam Marshall, an area specialized agent for the ornamental nursery and greenhouse industry, discussed ways they are collaborating with N.C. PSI-affiliated researchers to finetune their cutting-edge technology and ensure its relevance to farmers they serve.

When it comes to feeding the world, we need discoveries that drive innovation, especially for small- and medium-scale farms. That can start with experiences like these.

Sarah Kirby, NC State Extension assistant director, said such partnerships between researchers and Extension agents are critical to the state’s agricultural future.

“When it comes to feeding the world, we need discoveries that drive innovation, especially for small- and medium-scale farms,” she said. “That can start with experiences like these that provide insight not only into what happens on farms but also into the relationships that researchers can have with our Extension agents and with our agricultural colleagues to bring about positive change.”

As the tour concluded, Vann said she was excited to see bonds forming among Extension agents, specialists and researchers who took part.

“One of the things that the N.C. PSI does is catalyze diverse expertise and get it connected to agriculture,” she said. “I saw people asking a lot of questions of our stakeholders and Extension representatives, so I think this has been a really good start, and I am excited to see what comes next.”

According to a Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter, the facility is slated for completion by March 2026 and is expected to be India’s largest battery storage installation and among the biggest globally.

The project will be located in Khavda, Gujarat, where the Adani Group is already developing an expansive renewable energy complex spanning thousands of acres. The group’s long-term goal, Bloomberg reported, is to expand storage capacity to as much as 50 gigawatt-hours (GWh) within the next five years, signaling a decisive shift toward large-scale energy storage to complement solar and wind generation.

Battery energy storage is emerging as a crucial component of modern electricity grids, helping to stabilize systems that increasingly rely on intermittent renewable sources. As India pushes toward its national target of reaching 500 gigawatts of clean energy capacity by 2030, such storage projects will be vital. BloombergNEF data indicates that India’s total power capacity is expected to reach about 800 megawatts this year, underscoring the urgency of scaling up energy storage to meet growing demand and ensure grid reliability.

While Adani Group representatives have not yet commented on the project, Bloomberg noted that the conglomerate is in active discussions with several international technology firms to support the development. The group’s growing interest in advanced battery technology is consistent with earlier reports from August, when Bloomberg News revealed that Adani was exploring a partnership with Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD Co. for battery manufacturing ventures.

The Khavda project marks another milestone in Adani’s aggressive renewable energy expansion, which includes massive investments in solar and wind power infrastructure. If completed as planned, the new facility will not only reinforce India’s renewable energy ambitions but also position the country as a global player in large-scale energy storage innovation.",https://slguardian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4018c49808f97a-lk.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 22:05:00.506721

Here are some takeaways (in speaker order):

G77 and China: Their core focus is scaling up climate finance for developing countries. The representative also called for a successful outcome on the Global Goal on Adaptation and the just transition work programme, as well as an outcome on loss and damage that would lead to better coordination between the Warsaw Mechanism, the Santiago Network, and the Fund for responding to Loss and Damage (the three major loss and damage entities under the UNFCCC).

EU: The EU emphasized the importance of science, the need for major economies to show leadership, and the urgency of the Action Agenda. They noted that the EU, along with EU development banks, are the largest providers of public climate finance globally. They also called out the importance of the gender action plan talks at this COP.

Environmental Integrity Group (Mexico, Liechtenstein, Monaco, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland, and Georgia): Represented by Switzerland, the group underscored their commitment to climate science, stating that “the next global stocktake has to be anchored in evidence, even if the evidence is uncomfortable.” They also discussed the imperative to protect natural ecosystems, and are looking for coherence on loss and damage, in agreement with the G77 and China.

Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America: This group of Latin American and Caribbean countries emphasized that all actions at COP30 need to allow for “people’s right to development.” They also called out what they see as a lack of political will in developed countries to adequately address climate change and distribute climate finance.

Like-Minded Developing Countries and BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, China): India spoke on behalf of both of these groups, which account for more than half the world’s population. They reaffirmed their commitments to multilateralism and international cooperation on climate change. They also called back to a core tenet of the UNFCCC, common but differentiated responsibility, which puts the onus on countries with high historic greenhouse gas emissions to take the greatest share of responsibility for reducing emissions. They called for this to be the “COP of adaptation,” and said that commitments on adaptation, like the doubling of adaptation finance by 2025, should be met.

Africa Group: The Africa Group emphasized the intersection of the climate challenge and sustainable development, and pointed to Mission 300 as an example of action on the ground. They also spotlighted the climate finance gap, and highlighted the latest work of the Fund for responding to Loss and Damage. Like almost all other groups, they mentioned the just transition work programme and the Global Goal on Adaptation. They said that adaptation indicators should include means of implementation—that is, technical, financial, and capacity-building support for developing countries.

Least Developed Countries Group (LDCs): LDC Chair Evans Njewa of Malawi called this the COP for justice and action. He outlined the stark challenges people face—from crop loss to homes destroyed by floods—and emphasized that people “deserve to live and thrive.” The LDCs stated that trust in the process needs to be restored, and called for countries to meet the adaptation finance goal due at the end of this year.

Arab Group: The group called on countries “to focus on emissions, not their sources,” and suggested that countries promote technologies like carbon capture. The statement also underscored that commitments to action are, and must remain, nationally determined.

Technical Negotiations Begin: Today’s schedule included more than 30 negotiating sessions on different agenda items, covering almost all the topics countries highlighted in their opening remarks detailed above. For additional updates on the negotiations, see the Earth Negotiations Bulletin’s comprehensive daily reports and quick highlights posted every day.

EESI Briefing: What’s on the Table for the Negotiations

Presidency Consultations: The COP30 Presidency began taking up issues that countries had wanted to add to the agenda at the last minute through a set of dialogues instead. Topics in queue include the responsibility of developed countries to provide financial assistance to developing countries, progress on—and implementation gaps in—countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs), overall outcomes of developed countries’ biennial transparency report submissions, and trade measures.

What Do They Want? With nearly 200 countries in the Paris Agreement, it is impossible to keep track of all their positions on various issues. Where does the UK stand on the deployment of renewables and energy efficiency? Does Australia support reforming COP to cap the size of the summit? What is India’s stance on carbon markets? Carbon Brief has an interactive table to answer these questions and more.

“That’s the question here for Madison College,” said Mattsson, who also joined the Student Senate this spring.
Mattsson, Wong and a few other students started the Green Club in April.
Now, the Green Club and the Green Team have a plan for building a new momentum toward further action.
Dozens of students have joined Green Club, but more are needed to fill the gaps where part-time participation is the general reality.","Quinn Mattsson and Noah Wong stood beside the Capital City Bike Trail on one of the last warm mornings in the fall of 2024. Greasy fast-food bags waved halfheartedly in the breeze, and dented cans glinted in the weeds. The young men surveyed the morning’s work ahead of them while donning their gardening gloves, armed only with grocery bags and smiles.

Mattsson, a second year liberal arts transfer student, led weekly litter-gathering groups through the winter– sometimes changing tactics, picking off the seed heads of invasive species when snow was too thick – and into the spring. He then formed the idea of starting a new Green Club to build a renewed sustainability mindset into the school’s identity.

“That’s the question here for Madison College,” said Mattsson, who also joined the Student Senate this spring. “How can we support the environment and care for the planet and be good stewards all in support of our driving purpose of serving our students?”

Wong, a math instructor and a friend of Mattsson, became the club’s faculty advisor. He remembers becoming more aware of sustainability issues near the end of the COVID pandemic.

Invited by a friend to a Louisiana climate conference, Wong stayed with family where they lived by a Mississippi River refinery. “The whole town was depressing. Super loud and ugly, just kind of soul-crushing. Seeing the environmental abuse kind of radicalized me, I guess,” Wong said.

Mattsson, Wong and a few other students started the Green Club in April. They found strong support from both the student body and college staff.

Around the same time the Green Club was forming, the idea of creating a sustainability-focused subcommittee of the college’s Facilities Planning and Investment Council (FPIC) has been gaining momentum.

“I was noticing all of the opportunities for the college to be good stewards of the land that we sit on,” said David LeClair, manager of the college’s Career and Employment Services. “That’s why I applied to serve on the FPIC in the fall last year. And from there, we were able to start the Green Team this year.”

The Green Team, not to be confused with the Green Club, is the new subcommittee within FPIC, which itself composes one body within the College Assembly’s Shared Governance Councils (SGC).

“MATC has already done a lot to reduce our energy footprint,” said Sylvia Ramirez, Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration. Ramirez helped spearhead the creation of the Green Team with LeClair. “Geothermal. A green roof on the health building. And of course, the solar array. But there’s a lot more that we can do on that side of things.”

Ramirez was contacted by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), which helps colleges and universities to equip and coordinate green efforts.

“We got a lot of good information and resources from AASHE,” said Ramirez. “They focus on integrating sustainability into the curriculum, and networking institutions that are in a position to help each other.”

Reaching out to the director of the more regionally focused organization, Upper Midwest Association for Campus Sustainability (UMACS), LeClair found additional support and an even tighter network of schools working within cultural and ecological contexts like Madison’s own.

Mattsson dove right in. He began attending a month’s-long AASHE session on decarbonization, and he joined UMACS’ annual conference. “The goal is to connect ideas of sustainability and conservation to who we are and what we do,” Mattsson said.

In this energized group of leaders and students, a thread emerges. Taking action changes, one’s self-perception, and changes to this self-concept empowers one to take further action. This kind of change-and-action becomes a constructive feedback loop.

“I always cared about green issues, but I didn’t know anything about ecology and how important it is,” said LeClair, recalling his general interest and good intentions before learning about the invasive species plaguing his own property. “Once you see it and learn it, you can’t unsee it and unlearn it.”

“That moment of saying these are the things I care about and that I have the capacity to make a change in. That’s when I started to see the opportunities where I could act,” said Ramirez.

Undoubtedly, there’s a temptation to simply convince oneself or others of an appealing narrative. In business, it’s called green washing. For individuals, we might call it green signaling.

“It’s more about what actions you take out in the world,” said Wong, acknowledging the temptation to simply appear invested. Yet, he also acknowledges that we don’t have to be perfect before making an effort. “Even though I don’t know everything perfectly, doing what I can do is making a difference.”

“You want to implement the actions and understand yourself as someone who’s doing those actions,” said Mattsson. “It’s been really rewarding to try and reshape my identity as a member of these communities. I have a context. It’s not just me. I’m a part of this neighborhood and this ecosystem.”

Madison College has made great strides toward sustainability and conservation in recent history. Now, the Green Club and the Green Team have a plan for building a new momentum toward further action.

“We’re trying to put a sustainability page on the school’s website,” said Mattsson. “That doesn’t help directly with sustainability exactly, but it will help change our image of ourselves as an organization.”

In highlighting past achievements and future priorities, the aim is to acknowledge environmental stewardship as an integral part of fulfilling the mission of equipping learners.

“The goal is to promote eco-literacy, to make a plan and move forward with it,” said LeClair.

Mattsson acknowledged the weight of implications as an organization hones its mission this way.

“If we change our identity, we kind of expand our brand, and then people will expect it of us,” he said.

Challenges abound, and foremost among them are consistency and persistence.

“The biggest problem trying to do sustainability work is that we don’t have enough people who have enough time to do it,” said Mattsson.

Dozens of students have joined Green Club, but more are needed to fill the gaps where part-time participation is the general reality.

“What we need is a lot more people who want to do this in their spare time,” he added.

Beyond the immediate needs, every club at a college focused on two-year programs faces the urgent pressure of turnover. “It’s important to plan for succession,” said LeClair. “How are you going to grow and build your leadership for next semester or next year?”

“The club’s longevity is my priority,” said Mattsson. “If the club outlasts me, I’ll call that a success.”",https://www.theonlineclarion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SolarPanelsRGB.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 19:03:29.044681

The awards announced Nov. 5 by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) will pay for overnight chargers at 31 multifamily properties where residents typically lack at-home EV charging options, the agency said.

The reimbursement grants are sourced from the state’s Clean Fuel and Charging Infrastructure (CFCI) Program launched in 2024 with a one-time $30 million appropriation. Forty percent of the money is reserved for disadvantaged communities.

The awards are concentrated in metro Detroit suburbs such as Taylor, Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Dearborn Heights and Southfield. Other sites include Kalamazoo, Flint and Lansing.

The grants range from roughly $20,000 to $98,000 per site for installing two to ten Level 2 chargers, which typically take about 4 to 8 hours to charge a standard EV battery.

Current Charging of Birmingham is installing most of the chargers.

Large property owners receiving multiple grants include the Huron River Apartments group of Southgate and Lansing -based Simtob Management & Investment.

A new request for proposals will make another $5 million available for multifamily charging projects with grants capped at $300,000 per site.

The awards are part of ambitious targets under Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s MI Healthy Climate Plan of getting two million EV registration and deploying roughly 100,000 EV chargers by 2030. The state is far short of those targets as of this summer.

Growth in the EV market has been decelerating this year as consumers pivot toward hybrids and federal tax credits for EV buyers face repeal under the Trump administration’s rollback of clean-energy incentives.

In Michigan, the cost of EV registration is expected to rise after the state overhauled how it taxes fuel as part of a road funding deal between Republicans and Gov. Whitmer.

President Donald Trump’s anti-wind energy agenda is harming Louisiana businesses that form the backbone of America’s offshore oil and gas industry, which stands to lose billions if the president fulfills his campaign promise to end construction of offshore wind turbines.

In recent years, offshore leases have opened in state and federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind farms to be built. Wind technology has advanced, allowing for taller turbines to capture more of the Gulf region’s wind power higher up in the air. A trained workforce, built off the back of oil and gas, provided a wide base of support for the industry to expand.

On his first day back in the White House, Trump signed an executive order halting construction on all offshore wind projects. The president has long expressed a dislike of wind turbines, sometimes making dubious claims that they “destroy everything,” are the “most expensive energy there is” and that they produce noise that causes cancer.

These actions and statements have slowed supply chain investments and threatened the jobs of blue-collar workers in Louisiana and nationwide, all while electricity demand is growing, in large part because of increasing numbers of large, power-hungry data centers.

There are no offshore wind projects under construction off Louisiana’s coast, but the state is deeply entwined with developments in other parts of the country. Most of the businesses working on offshore wind farms on the East Coast come from the oil and gas sector in the Gulf of Mexico.

Even without a single industrial-scale wind turbine generating electricity in Louisiana, offshore wind has so far spurred over $500 million worth of supply chain investments in the state, according to Oceantic, an offshore energy trade association with about 400 members worldwide. Almost all of Oceantic’s members work in both the wind and fossil fuel sectors, spokeswoman Stephanie Fracoeur said.

It’s the same across the Gulf South. The offshore wind sector has spurred roughly $14 billion in investments into U.S. supply chain and manufacturing companies, with nearly two-thirds coming from businesses in Republican congressional districts, according to Oceantic.

But those investments have grown risky as many offshore wind projects that were planned have been paused or scrapped altogether.

“Oil and gas hasn’t been exceptionally busy over the last decade, so offshore wind was helping keep many of these companies in business,” Francoeur said. “Unfortunately, these policy changes have put a pause on things … The federal actions have been crippling for hundreds of American businesses that were planning on this work.”

State Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Golden Meadow, represents an area of the state that has invested and made a lot of money in the wind industry. Lafourche Parish is home to shipbuilders, metal fabricators, ocean crane operators and many other companies in the offshore energy sector. Having once built and serviced the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, these businesses on the bayou were called on to do the same thing for offshore wind farms along the East Coast, Orgeron said.

Orgeron, a former Nicholls State University professor with a doctorate in experimental physics, once managed his family’s offshore vessel business and helped it expand into the wind sector. Like other companies, they didn’t abandon oil and gas; they expanded into wind energy because it offered a stable revenue stream to offset volatile fossil fuel commodity prices, he said. While an abundant oil supply and low fuel costs are good for consumers, Louisiana’s energy service sector hits the doldrums when profit margins lead exploration companies to press pause on their Gulf drilling plans.

“For 60 years, we went through economic booms and busts, and it’s just so nice to know there’s an alternative market where your identical expertise is required and appreciated,” Orgeron said. “I really don’t wanna see one of our down-the-bayou operators lose an alternative revenue stream that’s not tied to the price of oil.”

A handful of offshore wind projects are still in progress on the East Coast, where dozens of Louisiana oil-and-gas service companies are now working.

Jake Cheramie is the general manager of Encore Group, a company in Houma that provides cooks, cleaners, crane operators and other personnel to offshore work sites. Just a few years ago, all of Encore’s clientele were in the oil and gas sector, but Cheramie said Encore gravitated to East Coast wind energy development in 2021. It now encompasses roughly 20% of their business, he said.

“Most of the major vessels in lower Lafourche are up in the Northeast working now, and that’s cool to see,” Cheramie said. “It’s been good to us. I certainly don’t wanna see offshore wind go away.”

Oceantic categorizes Encore as one of many auxiliary services businesses that work for one of Louisiana’s 42 offshore energy companies that currently hold active wind contracts.

Much of the work has gone to shipyards that build vessels that specialize in offshore construction. For instance, Edison Chouest Offshore in Cut Off spearheaded construction of the $97 million Eco Edison vessel for Revolution Wind, a wind farm project off the Rhode Island coast, and other East Coast projects. That single contract, one among several others like it, employed nearly 600 Edison Chouest workers across multiple states.

About a year ago, Encore opened an office in Rhode Island to support its personnel working on the Revolution Wind project. That wind farm made headlines Aug. 22 when the Trump administration rescinded its federal permit and issued a stop-work order, citing vague national security concerns. Scheduled to come online in early 2026, the $5 billion project was about 80% complete at that time.

Revolution Wind sued the Trump administration, and a federal judge sided with the company a month later, ruling the government’s actions “arbitrary and capricious” and unsupported by any evidence of national security concerns.

The judge’s temporary injunction allowed the company to resume work for the time being, but the order is temporary and could change if the Trump administration succeeds on appeal. The setback has already cost Revolution Wind $77 million, according to company officials who also blamed Trump’s anti-wind policies and tariffs for increasing the cost of steel and other construction materials.

It’s a new reality that Encore and other businesses are having to grapple with. The part of their business model that was the most stable just a year ago has suddenly become shaky.

“Louisiana is going to be one of the hardest-hit areas,” Francoeur said. “Once the current projects are completed, some of those companies will have idle shipyards or idle vessels.”

Cheramie said Encore is working on other offshore wind projects in New Jersey and Virginia but worries about losing them if the Trump administration continues to target the industry. If things stay on track, Encore should have steady work for another two to three years, he said, admitting new contracts for future jobs are now hard to come by.

“There’s been quite a few projects that aren’t being permitted or may be canceled,” Cheramie said.

The pause is largely due to Trump’s executive orders, pausing all wind leases and permitting. He has followed those up with actions that have made business particularly difficult for wind and solar companies, including directing his Commerce Department to investigate the wind sector for any national security implications and directing his Interior Department to block the nation’s largest solar project, which was planned for federal land in Nevada.

“Things are likely not to move forward in the next couple of years because of the actions by the Trump administration to essentially put a pause on federal permitting for offshore projects,” said Madelyn Smith with the renewable energy industry group Southeastern Wind Coalition.

One example is RWE Wind, a German company that held the first federal wind lease off the coast of Louisiana in addition to leases on the East and West coasts. It scrapped all three projects this year and laid off 73 of its U.S. employees after Trump started his assault on the wind sector, according to a Reuters report. The company said it is focusing on onshore wind and solar for the time being while still holding onto its offshore leases.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/eco_edison-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 19:03:33.320399

“Stephens County–and all counties don’t have the expectations to operate these programs and the amazing thing about PACE is that we can contract them to administer the program,” County Judge Michael Roach said.

The court unanimously approved the resolution for establishing the PACE program Monday, Nov. 10 after hearing from Texas PACE Authority President Charlen Heydinger and Breckenridge Economic Development Corporation CEO Michael Paris.

Authorized by the Texas Legislature in 2013, the PACE program allows cities and counties to create voluntary financing mechanisms that allow commercial, multi-family and industrial property owners to fund upgrades to HVAC systems, lighting, roofing and plumbing–all without using taxpayer dollars or assuming financial risk.

“We see this as increasing the probability of local businesses taking advantage in order to develop their infrastructure–their cooling needs or heating needs. Any efficiency within their manufacturing process,” Paris said. “It’s also going to help us in attracting businesses here. So if we can articulate a way which a business that’s coming here or a business that’s currently here can take advantage of discounts on the interest rates for banks. And also reconsideration of terms…I think it’s going to help the business community be successful here in Breckenridge.”

As part of establishing the PACE program, the commissioners also approved a professional services agreement with Texas PACE Authority to administer the program in Stephens County.

“Stephens County–and all counties don’t have the expectations to operate these programs and the amazing thing about PACE is that we can contract them to administer the program,” County Judge Michael Roach said. “That really leaves us hands off for the most part.”

Heydinger signed the contract to officially begin the process of administering the program and get it off the ground. The Texas Pace Authority president had explained the inner workings of the program and its potential impact at a previous commissioners court meeting on Monday, Oct. 27.

“What you would be doing if you create your PACE program is you create a mechanism that eliminates the risk for lenders,” Heydinger explained last month. “So lenders will loan over a longer period of time, and if you stretch our financing long enough, the savings will exceed the cost.”",https://www.breckenridgeamerican.com/sites/breckenridgeamerican.com/files/field/image/WEB%20IMG_9948.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 22:06:13.228149

“Everyone is saying prices are going up,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. ""Nobody is saying prices are coming down.""

Wolfe said rising costs for electricity and natural gas will make home heating more expensive for most families this winter. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association projects average home heating costs will rise 7.6%, from $907 last winter to about $976 this season. Families using electric heat will see the biggest jump — up 10.2% to about $1,205 — while natural gas costs are expected to rise from $639 to $693.

The organization, which represents state directors of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, said electricity and natural gas prices have been climbing at more than twice the rate of inflation, driven by higher gas prices, growing demand from data centers and grid maintenance.

“Electric utilities are rebuilding the grid, and that’s pushing up prices,” Wolfe said. “Data centers are also placing new demands on the grid, which is driving up costs even more.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2025–26 Winter Fuels Outlook, the majority of Americans heat their homes with natural gas or electric heat, with 46% using natural gas and 43% using electricity. The EIA’s outlook is less bullish, forecasting the average electricity bill will rise about 4% from November through March 2026, to a national average of about $1,130.

For households not powered by electricity or natural gas, heating costs are expected to drop or remain steady this winter. The EIA expects heating oil and propane costs to fall by just under 10%, while NEADA predicts savings closer to 5%.

Located adjacent to the JSW Steel facility in Vijayanagar, within the Indian state of Karnataka, the plant is part of Tranche I of the Production Linked Incentive scheme.

The newly commissioned plant will supply green hydrogen directly to JSW Steel’s direct reduced iron (DRI) unit, enabling low-carbon steel production.

This initiative is backed by a seven-year offtake agreement with JSW Steel to supply 3,800 tons per annum (tpa) of green hydrogen and 30,000tpa of green oxygen to the steelmaker.

The project forms a part of JSW Energy’s 6,800tpa allocation under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) programme, run by the Solar Energy Corporation of India.

JSW Energy has also signed a memorandum of understanding with JSW Steel to supply 85,000-90,000tpa of green hydrogen and 720,000tpa of green oxygen by 2030.

These developments support JSW Energy’s sustainability vision and are aligned with India’s green hydrogen plan to achieve around five million tons per annum by 2030.

JSW Energy joint managing director and CEO Sharad Mahendra said: “We are proud to commission India’s first green hydrogen plant under National Green Hydrogen Mission, implemented through the SIGHT programme, by Government of India.

“The project is a key milestone in our country’s clean energy journey and reflects our unwavering commitment to support India’s transition toward a low-carbon economy and decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors such as steel. Green hydrogen will assume a pivotal role in shaping a sustainable and Atmanirbhar Bharat [self-reliant India].”

JSW Energy currently has a total locked-in power generation capacity of 30.5GW.

This comprises 13.3GW that is operational, 12.5GW under construction across thermal and renewable sources, 150MW under acquisition in hydro, and a further 4.6GW in the pipeline.

Looking ahead, JSW Energy aims to reach 30GW of generation capacity and 40GWh of energy storage capacity by financial year 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

“The United States of America is as dumb as we want to be on this topic, but the state of California is not,” Newsom declared to delegates. “And so we are going to assert ourselves, we’re going to lean in, and we are going to compete in this space.”

Newsom, one of Trump’s most outspoken political opponents and a potential 2028 presidential contender, highlighted California’s commitment to green technology and renewable energy. The state, with the world’s fourth-largest economy, has seven times more renewable energy jobs than fossil fuel positions and is home to electric vehicle pioneer Tesla.

At an investors’ summit in São Paulo earlier in the week, Newsom described the absence of federal climate leadership as “jaw-dropping,” noting that U.S. inaction risks ceding the booming clean energy market to China. “China is flooding the zone and will dominate in the next great global industry,” he said.

Despite the tropical heat, Newsom emphasized a nonpartisan approach, pointing to climate initiatives under Republican California presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. “We can’t do this without all of you,” he told COP30 attendees. “We’re here with an open hand, not a closed fist.”

The governor is expected to meet with officials from multiple nations, as well as subnational leaders, including the governor of Brazil’s Pará state, the summit’s host region.

Neighbors have warned that toxins and heavy metals like arsenic still remain at the site, though the state agency has said environmental remediation on the site is complete.
What they found was “what experts typically see on industrial properties like this one,” according to Related Midwest.
NietoGomez said the coalition is currently reviewing the entire environmental remediation plan, which spans more than 5,000 pages.
“This is why we need to have a community benefits agreement because that should have been done before they start construction,” she said.","Developers behind the forthcoming quantum computing campus at the former U.S. Steel South Works plant have submitted remediation plans to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. But neighborhood organizations are still pushing for more assurances that they’ll benefit from the site’s transformation into a technology hub.

Related Midwest and CRG voluntarily re-enrolled the 440-acre site in South Chicago last month into the environmental agency’s site remediation program. Their remediation plan is currently under review by the IEPA, according to a spokesperson for Related Midwest.

The former steel mill closed in 1992, and various redevelopment plans for the site withered over the years — in part, because of environmental concerns lingering at the site.

Neighbors have warned that toxins and heavy metals like arsenic still remain at the site, though the state agency has said environmental remediation on the site is complete. The agency issued “No Further Remediation” letters for the land in 1997 and 2010, after previous cleanup efforts.

A No Further Remediation letter verifies site investigation and remediation has been completed and meets state cleanup standards, according to the state agency.

Once the developers receive a new letter, construction will officially be able to start, though Related Midwest and CRG did hold a ceremonial groundbreaking in September on the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park.

The park is a 128-acre portion of the massive project dubbed Quantum Shore Chicago. Quantum Shore will also be home to housing and a 52-bed Advocate Health Care hospital.

Soil and water tests

Related Midwest worked with Little Village-based Pioneer Engineering and Environmental Services to complete soil and groundwater testing at Quantum Shore.

What they found was “what experts typically see on industrial properties like this one,” according to Related Midwest.

The developer also said the “vast majority” of results are consistent with previously completed tests, though five areas within 1,200 feet of nearby homes contain petroleum levels “that exceed today’s cleanup standards.”

The testing also found petroleum hydrocarbons, metals and other isolated substances in soil and groundwater.

Related Midwest said it will be installing an engineered barrier around the site to “protect air quality, minimize respiratory health risks, and improve safety on and around the site.” The developer will also excavate and dispose of contaminants in two areas that are closest to residential areas and install dust monitors.

The barrier around the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park is estimated to cost $25 million, according to the company, while the “remainder of the development area [will] cost more than $100 million over the life of the project.”

Community benefits agreement

Brian Gladstein, executive director of the nonprofit Friends of the Parks, was “not surprised” to hear the findings.

“What we have heard from community folks for a long time is the belief that the land is polluted and there needs to be remediation,” Gladstein said. “There needs to be a commitment by [Related Midwest] to remediate that land and to make it safe for the community.”

In the past, Friends of the Parks has taken the legal route to protect Chicago’s lakefront and conserve its open space. At the old South Works site, the nonprofit is calling for the developers and elected officials to commit to four key benefits for the Southeast Side community.

The nonprofit wants the establishment of a fund to benefit residents, along with a framework plan for the Southeast lakefront. Their Southeast Side Parks Benefits and Commitments plan also demands full remediation of the land and ongoing environmental monitoring, plus a guarantee that public spaces remain open, accessible and free of surveillance.

Friends of the Parks released its call for commitments on Oct. 28. Gladstein said it fits within the broader push for a legally-binding community benefits agreement and efforts to protect the area’s green space.

“For too long, there’s been a lack of equity on the Southeast Side, where other parks are getting resources,” he said. “This is the moment, with this massive development that is moving forward, for us to make sure that the community is not left behind.”

Since the quantum project was announced, the Coalition for a South Works CBA has been one of the leading community voices — presenting updated demands for community benefits in early September. The group includes residents and more than 40 organizations like the Alliance of the Southeast, as well as businesses and churches.

Amalia NietoGomez, executive director of the Alliance of the Southeast, said work for a community benefits agreement is ongoing. The coalition and Friends of the Parks are pushing for meetings with Related Midwest and elected officials to discuss their concerns — and hopes — for the site, even as work begins.

NietoGomez said the coalition is currently reviewing the entire environmental remediation plan, which spans more than 5,000 pages.

While NietoGomez said the coalition is happy the report has been submitted, she thinks it should’ve been filed sooner.

“This is why we need to have a community benefits agreement because that should have been done before they start construction,” she said. “That should have been in discussions with the community.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7c9063/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3048x1740+0+138/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa9%2Fad%2Facbeab45ad2d666685bd0aebb48d%2Fsweet-cst-070614-south-works-aerialjpg.JPG,N,,2025-11-11 18:07:01.320600

Jones, www.facebook.com, WesleyMuller.news",,,,,https://lailluminator.com/2025/11/11/epa-suit-smittys/,"The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, filed their lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply on Nov. 5 with a federal court in New Orleans.
The infractions culminated with the Aug. 22 explosion at the Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland.
Attorneys for Smitty’s Supply have not responded to a request for comment.
Garside represents the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, an environmental advocacy group planning to sue Smitty’s Supply.
Companies are rarely made to pay the maximum penalties in these kinds of cases, Garside said, but even lesser fines can lead a company like Smitty’s Supply into bankruptcy.","Louisiana and federal officials are taking legal action against Smitty’s Supply Inc., seeking fines and penalties that could exceed a billion dollars for years of environmental violations and the recent industrial fire and mass spillage at its petroleum products plant in Tangipahoa Parish.

An attorney for private litigants worries that such a high amount, if awarded, could become an obstacle for neighbors and local businesses seeking their own reparations.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, filed their lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply on Nov. 5 with a federal court in New Orleans. They allege a long list of violations of the federal Clean Water Act and similar state laws and regulations for incidents going back nearly five years. The infractions culminated with the Aug. 22 explosion at the Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland.

“Plaintiffs ask this Court to hold Defendant accountable for unlawfully polluting the Nation’s and the State’s waters, and to require Defendant to take all appropriate measures to prevent future spills or discharges,” the lawsuit states.

Attorneys for Smitty’s Supply have not responded to a request for comment.

Its Roseland plant, which bottles and manufactures a wide variety of oils, fluids and petrochemical products for distribution to automotive and industrial retailers, was almost completely destroyed in the August disaster. Storage tanks and drums holding as much as 11 million gallons of hazardous substances caught fire, with some exploding. The fire took two weeks to fully extinguish while millions of gallons of oil and chemicals stored at the plant contaminated public land and waterways, reaching as far as 47 miles downstream on the Tangipahoa River, according to the EPA.

Flowing through a series of ditches and channels, the hazardous substances entered the river through at least four separate points of entry, the lawsuit notes.

The EPA estimates cleanup crews have recovered oily waste and petroleum-based materials totaling 11 million gallons, which matches the facility’s storage capacity, from nearby ponds, rivers and drainage channels.

Clay Garside, an environmental litigator with the New Orleans-based Waltzer, Wiygul & Garside law firm, said he’s concerned the government’s lawsuit could leave little money for Tangipahoa residents and other private litigants with claims related to the disaster. Garside represents the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, an environmental advocacy group planning to sue Smitty’s Supply.

“To the extent they have to pay penalties, it takes away available funds to compensate folks,” Garside said.

Neither the U.S. Department of Justice nor Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill’s office would offer further comment on the case.

Shortly before the government filed its complaint, Garside said U.S. Department of Justice attorneys contacted him to ask about Louisiana Environmental Action Network claims and to confirm a filing deadline, adding that he expected its lawsuit to be filed before his.

Companies are rarely made to pay the maximum penalties in these kinds of cases, Garside said, but even lesser fines can lead a company like Smitty’s Supply into bankruptcy.

The state’s claims in the lawsuit carry significantly lighter penalties of up to $32,500 per violation per day.

Smitty’s has filed its own lawsuit, blaming the disaster on two other businesses — the New York-based Fulton Thermal Corp., whuch manufactures industrial boiler tanks, and Baton Rouge’s J&M Boiler Combustion Control Services, which installs and maintains the tanks. Smitty’s alleges the boiler malfunctioned, exploded and caused the fire but hasn’t said how or why it malfunctioned.

State and federal environmental officials have been unable to determine what started the fire but discovered numerous violations of laws and environmental regulations they allege could have prevented the disaster or mitigated its impacts.

They accuse Smitty’s of violating the federal Clean Water Act, the Louisiana Water Control Law and Louisiana Water Pollution Control regulations, among other regulations.

The agencies allege the company failed to implement EPA-required plans for oil spill prevention and emergency response and repeatedly failed to comply with other laws regulating pollutant discharges during the years leading up to the fire.

Lawsuit details prior violations

The state and EPA complaint cites hundreds of previous wastewater discharge, pollution reporting and permit exceedance violations going back three years, as well as seven separate chemical spills since 2021 that reached offsite and contaminated public areas.

One occurred July 21, 2024, involving 950 gallons of hydraulic oil that spilled from a burst railcar transfer line. While cleaning up the initial spill, the oil spilled a second time when the facility’s oil-water separator tank overflowed. It went into a ditch along U.S. Highway 51, flowed into a nearby creek and then to a private pond, creating 14,000 gallons of contaminated material that had to be removed, the complaint states.

Another spill the following month, on Aug. 30, 2024, involved a 55-gallon drum of Navilan Yellow 73, a dye added to other fluids for the purpose of detecting spills and leaks. The dye spilled into a drainage ditch along Highway 51 and migrated to a pond on private property. It’s unclear if it was the same pond that had been contaminated the month before.

The lawsuit discusses some of the impacts the most recent incident had on the Tangipahoa River, which flows into Lake Pontchartrain, though officials have said the contaminants were blocked before reaching the lake. The incident shut down a 47-mile-long section of the river, which only recently reopened after being closed to the public for over two months.

“Defendant’s unauthorized discharge … was toxic to human, plant, or animal life or significantly increased health risks due to exposure to the substances or consumption of contaminated fish or other aquatic life,” the filing states.

Recovery and cleanup efforts in the area are still ongoing more than two months after the incident, and the court filing points out that oil and other hazardous substances on the site still pose risk.

“As of the filing of this Complaint, the cleanup of the discharge is ongoing, but there is still a threat of another discharge if there is a significant rainfall event,” the lawsuit states. “Although a temporary storm water collection is in place at the Facility, it may not be able to withstand significant rainfall.”

One of the EPA’s claims carries a potential penalty of up to $7,093 per barrel of oil discharged. With 11 million gallons of waste recovered, that penalty could total as much as $1.8 billion if the court finds the company acted with “gross negligence or willful misconduct” and awards the maximum fine. Potential penalties for the other claims listed could reach hundreds of millions.

Is Tesla’s energy storage bet the right move, or should the company be doubling down on affordable EVs instead?","Tesla is ramping up hiring for its $200 million Megapack battery factory in Brookshire, Texas, just outside Houston, with 41 positions currently posted and a job fair scheduled for the week of November 10, 2025. The facility represents Tesla’s aggressive push into utility-scale energy storage at a time when its automotive division faces mounting challenges from expired tax credits and intensifying competition.

The Houston-area factory will mirror Tesla’s successful Lathrop, California facility, producing 10,000 utility-scale Megapack batteries annually—equivalent to 40 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy storage capacity. This expansion comes as Tesla’s energy business has emerged as a bright spot in the company’s portfolio, with recent quarters showing the division outperforming the struggling automotive segment.

1,500 Advanced Manufacturing Jobs Coming to Waller County

Tesla has committed to employ at least 375 people at the new facility in Empire West Business Park by the end of 2026, according to tax abatement agreements approved by the Waller County Commissioners Court in March 2025. That figure increases to at least 750 by the end of 2027 and must reach 1,500 by the end of 2028, a level the company must maintain for a decade to qualify for its tax breaks.

Current job openings span the full manufacturing spectrum, from welders and technical writers to senior manufacturing engineers and various management roles. Ramiro Bautista, project manager for the city of Brookshire’s economic development department, told the Houston Business Journal that Tesla will hold a job fair the week of November 10 to accelerate hiring.

“We are building the future of energy right here in Waller County,” a Tesla representative stated at the March commissioners court meeting. “This facility will not only bring cutting-edge technology to the region but will also create long-term, high-quality jobs that support families and communities.”

Massive Investment in Automation and Robotics

Tesla is investing heavily in advanced manufacturing technology for the Brookshire facility. The company plans to spend $44 million on real estate improvements and $150 million on cutting-edge manufacturing equipment, including automated robotic welding cells and robotic assembly stations.

The facility will lease two massive buildings in Empire West Business Park, a thriving industrial development by Dallas-based Stream Realty Partners. Tesla has been leasing the 1.04 million-square-foot Building 9 since 2022, though a third-party logistics company previously occupied the space. The company is now taking full control to manufacture Megapacks for global distribution.

As part of the tax abatement agreement, Tesla must maintain a minimum of $75 million in taxable inventory by January 1, 2026, which will increase to $300 million after three years—ensuring long-term economic benefits for schools, public services, and infrastructure projects in Waller County.

Energy Business Emerges as Tesla’s Growth Engine

The Houston Megafactory expansion comes as Tesla’s energy storage business has become one of the company’s strongest performers. In the third quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed a record 12.5 GWh of energy storage products, with the energy division now representing approximately 25% of overall company revenue.

The contrast with Tesla’s automotive business is stark. While EV deliveries are down 6% year-to-date through September 2025, energy storage deployments have surged. The energy division achieved gross margins of 30% in recent quarters—significantly higher than the 17% margins in automotive—making it Tesla’s most profitable business segment on a percentage basis.

“The energy business is doing extremely well, and the opportunity ahead is gigantic,” CEO Elon Musk said during a recent earnings call, predicting the division will eventually surpass automotive in total gigawatt hours deployed.

Shanghai Megafactory Already Ramping Production

Tesla’s Houston facility will be the company’s third major Megapack manufacturing plant, following its original Lathrop, California facility and the recently operational Shanghai Megafactory. The Shanghai plant began production in February 2025 and produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter, with the company stating it’s on track to match the 40 GWh annual capacity of the Lathrop facility.

The rapid expansion of Megapack manufacturing capacity reflects surging global demand for utility-scale battery energy storage systems. These massive batteries help stabilize electrical grids by storing energy from intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind, then dispatching that power when needed. Each Megapack can store over 3 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy—enough to power approximately 3,600 homes for one hour.

Major customers for Tesla’s Megapacks include utility providers like Intersect Power and even Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI, which purchased $191 million in Megapack products in 2024 to power its data centers.

Texas Cements Position as Tesla’s Manufacturing Hub

The Houston-area Megafactory reinforces Texas’s status as Tesla’s primary U.S. manufacturing base. The company relocated its corporate headquarters from California to Texas in December 2021, and its Gigafactory Texas in Austin has become a critical production hub for the Model Y, Cybertruck, and the upcoming Cybercab robotaxi.

Justin Beckendorff, Waller County Precinct 4 Commissioner, expressed enthusiasm about the economic impact during the March commissioners court meeting.

“We are super excited about this opportunity—1,500 advanced manufacturing jobs in the county and in the city,” he said.

The facility is expected to generate significant spillover benefits for the region. Local suppliers, logistics companies, and retail businesses will benefit from Tesla’s workforce spending, while the Empire West Business Park could attract additional high-tech tenants, reinforcing Brookshire’s emergence as an innovation hub west of Houston.

EVXL’s Take

Here’s what the mainstream coverage is missing: this hiring push reveals where Tesla sees its actual future, and it’s not primarily in selling cars. While the automotive division struggles with collapsing European sales, executive departures, and post-tax-credit demand erosion, the energy storage business is absolutely printing money with those 30% gross margins.

The timing is particularly revealing. Tesla is launching a major manufacturing hiring initiative just as the September 30, 2025 federal EV tax credit expiration makes its vehicles instantly $7,500 more expensive. That’s not coincidence—that’s strategic allocation of capital toward the business line that doesn’t depend on government subsidies or consumer sentiment about Elon Musk’s political activities.

The Houston Megafactory also represents Tesla’s response to a genuine market need. As battery makers pivot to energy storage amid soft EV demand, Tesla is already years ahead with operational Megafactories and a proven product. The company’s Q2 2025 earnings showed energy storage revenue hit $3.04 billion, up 176% year-over-year, while automotive revenue declined.

But let’s be clear about the competitive landscape: Tesla faces intense pressure from Chinese manufacturers in energy storage just as it does in EVs. The Shanghai Megafactory is already dealing with Chinese competitors offering complete battery systems at prices 60-70% lower than Tesla’s. The company’s Megapack pricing has dropped 51% in China over the past year, from approximately $1.15/Wh to $0.56/Wh, while Chinese manufacturers quote as low as $0.15/Wh for some systems.

The Houston facility’s success will depend on whether Tesla can leverage automation and American manufacturing incentives to compete on cost while maintaining the quality and integration advantages that have made Megapacks the preferred choice for major utility-scale projects. With 1,500 high-paying manufacturing jobs on the line and Waller County’s economic future partly riding on this facility, the stakes extend well beyond Tesla’s corporate balance sheet.

For EV enthusiasts watching Tesla’s evolution, this Houston expansion crystallizes a truth we’ve been tracking: Tesla is transforming from an automotive company that sells batteries into an energy infrastructure company that also happens to make cars. The question is whether that transformation happens fast enough to offset the challenges mounting in the vehicle business.

Greenidge’s legal battle began in 2022 when the DEC denied its air permit for CLCPA noncompliance.
At the time, local climate advocacy group Seneca Lake Guardian lauded her action and encouraged her to “finish the job” by shutting Greenidge Generation down completely.

Seneca Lake Guardian is upset with Hochul’s decision.","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Bitcoin mining company Greenidge Generation has reached an agreement with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation for an air permit at its site on the western shore of Seneca Lake. The move ends active litigation between the two parties.

The agreement includes an emissions reduction of 44 percent for permitted greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030, along with a mandate for a 25 percent reduction from Greenidge’s actual emissions. It also requires the company to submit a permit modification application.

“The agreement holds Greenidge Generation accountable to new proposed permit conditions that are protective of the community and brings the Greenidge facility in line with greenhouse gas and co-pollutant emissions levels consistent with the (Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act),” a statement from DEC reads.

Greenidge noted that its status as a quick-dispatch power generator will aid the state’s power grid amid increased electricity demand. The facility is a retrofitted natural gas-powered plant with a capacity of 106 to 108 megawatts. Greenidge took over the location in 2017 and began proof-of-work cryptomining in 2019. The company also has cryptocurrency facilities in Mississippi, North Dakota and South Carolina.

“This new permit includes historic emissions reductions that go far beyond anything required by the CLCPA or ever implemented in New York and validates our national model cryptocurrency operation, which does not pull power from the grid, but rather sends power to it daily,” says Greenidge President Dale Irwin in a statement.

The local International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers also spoke in support of the decision.

Greenidge’s legal battle began in 2022 when the DEC denied its air permit for CLCPA noncompliance. Over the following three years and legal fights, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a temporary moratorium on cryptomining.

At the time, local climate advocacy group Seneca Lake Guardian lauded her action and encouraged her to “finish the job” by shutting Greenidge Generation down completely. However, Greenidge was exempted from the moratorium and Hochul declined to push any further legislation.

Greenidge also caught another break from the state last year when DEC’s permit denial was annulled, laying the groundwork for this agreement and permit renewal.

Now, both the state and Greenidge will withdraw their appeals and discontinue the pending administrative hearing.

“While this process has been lengthy, we thank the Hochul Administration and the current team at NYSDEC for allowing the law and the facts to drive policy. We’re pleased with this tough, fair new permit, and happy to put this process where it has belonged for years – in the rear-view mirror,” Irwin says.

Local climate advocates, however, slammed DEC’s decision. They claim that Greenidge’s facility has negatively impacted the region by increasing gas emissions, polluting water with thermal discharge, and contaminating groundwater used for the region’s agriculture, especially in its wineries.

“Originally, they said it was only going to be operated as a ‘peaker-plant.’ It was only going to operate about 6 percent of the year, and only do that to provide power to the public in times of high demand,” says Yvonne Taylor, president of Seneca Lake Guardian. “Then, once they got up and running, they installed these bitcoin mining machines and the power being produced was not going to the public, but to fuel these machines.”

“Along with that, they’re raining down things like formaldehyde, mercury, lead, benzine, on to our homes, our farms, and our vineyards. Those places are (the region’s) lifeblood,” Taylor continues. “Seneca Lake is also a drinking water source for over 100,000 people. Greenidge is allowed to withdraw up to 139 million gallons of water every single day and dump it in hot back into the lake, an area where we’re already experiencing increasing harmful algae blooms, a toxin to humans and animals.”

Seneca Lake Guardian filed a lawsuit in 2023 to shut the Greenidge Generating Station. The suit was dismissed in federal court later that same year.

Seneca Lake Guardian is upset with Hochul’s decision.

“She put out her own press release applauding the region for getting these accolades of being the best viticulture area in the country,” Taylor says of Hochul. “Yet at the same turn, she’s letting us down by capitulating to Greenidge.”

Eric Wood, senior environmental program coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group, says, “The Governor has been ordered by the State’s courts to follow the Climate Law, but her decision to approve permits for the Greenidge fracked gas power plant for a private cryptomining facility flouts that order. “

Taylor also levied criticism against Greenidge’s impact on the local economy. She says it overemphasizes its impact on jobs in the local economy. In the past, the company has said that it created around 40 to 50 full-time jobs with additional impact through electricians and other contracted work.

“Tourism in the Finger Lakes is our driving economy engine,” Taylor outlines instead. “It brings in $4 billion worth of revenue into New York State’s economy every year and supports 60,000 jobs.”

For his part, Irwin says that the data center has brought high–tech jobs and opportunity to a region of New York which “has been economically underserved for far too long.”

An evidentiary hearing for Greenidge’s air permit renewal application has been scheduled for next week.

Vietnam’s policies and international commitments make clear that the transition toward a green, circular, and low-carbon economy is the pathway to sustainable development. It is essential to abandon short-term, profit-driven approaches that neglect environmental responsibilities and to remain steadfast in the principle of not sacrificing the environment for economic gain.

Commenting on the draft, Dr. Truong Ba kien, Deputy Director of the Centre for Meteorology and Climatology under the Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Climate Change at Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, emphasised that the inclusion of environmental protection and climate adaptation is both timely and necessary, aligning with Vietnam’s real-world challenges. He noted that proactive and effective adaptation to climate change is a trend that Vietnam must continue to pursue in the years ahead.

To enhance resilience to extreme weather and climate-related disasters, relevant agencies need to comprehensively upgrade real-time forecasting and early warning systems, integrating meteorological, hydrological, radar, and reservoir data. The use of AI, Big Data, and ensemble modelling will help detect hazardous weather patterns early. Multi-channel public alerts, regular drills, and inter-regional coordination mechanisms should also be strengthened.

In parallel, Vietnam should standardise and expand inter-reservoir operations, improve dam safety monitoring, and promote reforestation. Developing flood and landslide risk maps using satellite data and LiDAR technology will support evidence-based planning. Building green infrastructure such as water-absorbent urban systems, maintaining natural floodways, and ensuring data sharing across regions are also crucial to balancing development with watershed safety.

Localities are urged to integrate climate adaptation into regional and provincial planning, establish AI- and IoT-based early warning systems, and enhance climate risk management capacity for local authorities. Promoting nature-based and green development models and nurturing a culture of preparedness will help build safer, more resilient communities.

According to Dr. Mai Van Khiem, Director of the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, Vietnam must continue modernising its observation technologies, expanding monitoring networks, and applying artificial intelligence to improve forecasting accuracy, particularly for extreme weather events. He also underlined the need for clear, concise, and accessible communication to ensure early warnings reach vulnerable communities.

Strengthened coordination between meteorological agencies, local governments, disaster response units, and media outlets is vital to translating forecasts into effective action. Public education and training in disaster preparedness should be expanded, with climate and environmental awareness integrated into school curricula.

Le Thi Dinh, Secretary of Xuan Non hamlet Party Cell in Hanoi' Thu Lam commune, noted that recognising environmental protection as a core development pillar provides a new benchmark for all socio-economic policies. However, genuine sustainability must start with each individual’s mindset and daily actions, from planting trees and flowers to embracing broader goals such as green transformation and green economy. She also stressed the importance of environmental education at all levels to foster a “green living” consciousness among citizens, laying the groundwork for a sustainable and resilient future./.VNA",https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2025/11/11/draft-party-document-highlights-climate-and-green-development-c897a331809943c7b2e1b47838c96a38-1831.webp?width=0&s=KXkoY5bHvBq8QnbmBe3g3w,N,,2025-11-11 16:07:53.445878

Customers receive electricity from two aging, out-of-state coal plants that lose a lot of money.
She adapted her analysis to calculate how much Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia customers were overpaying for OVEC power versus what power from the market cost.
Gary, of the Kentucky Resources Council, said replacement parts for coal plants are getting scarce.
“Those commissioners are walking a political very fine line if they ever move to undo ties to coal plants,” she said.","In October, Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities and other parties came to an agreement in a case before the Kentucky Public Service Commission.

Under it, KU customers would pay $9 more a month on average, and LG&E customers would pay $5. The Kentucky commission would have to approve the pact.

The Kentucky PSC has approved a plan by the utilities to spend $3.7 billion on electricity generation projects, including two natural gas power plants costing a combined $2.8 billion.

Behind the rates paid by the companies’ customers is a hidden cost that doesn’t show up on their bills. Customers receive electricity from two aging, out-of-state coal plants that lose a lot of money.

Together, the utilities own a share of the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC).

OVEC has a plant in Madison, Indiana, across the Ohio River from Kentucky, and another in Cheshire, Ohio, across the river from West Virginia.

An analysis adapted from a case in Michigan shows that KU and LG&E customers have paid nearly $168 million in losses generated by the OVEC plants in the past seven years.

“That’s bad by any account, and definitely costing ratepayers as compared to what it would have cost them just to self produce their own energy,” said Byron Gary, program attorney for the Kentucky Resources Council.

A West Virginia Public Broadcasting story in September showed that Appalachian Power customers in West Virginia and Virginia paid for more than $328 million in losses at the two plants from 2018 to 2024. Mon Power customers in West Virginia have paid more than $10 million.

Indiana customers of two more utilities have paid a combined $167 million in losses. That breaks down to $136 million for Indiana-Michigan Power and $31 million for CenterPoint Energy.

Indiana-Michigan Power and Appalachian Power are subsidiaries of American Electric Power. AEP owns the biggest share of OVEC, at 39%.

Other states have walked away from the OVEC plants. Michigan regulators stopped Indiana-Michigan from charging Michigan customers for the OVEC losses. Ohio lawmakers repealed a scandal-tainted bailout of the plants.

“I think it is helpful to know that other states who are not embroiled in our historical ties to coal have already determined that they are not smart for the ratepayers in their states,” said Elisa Owen, Kentucky senior organizer for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign.

Indiana regulators decided over the summer that Indiana customers of Indiana-Michigan would pick up the losses no longer absorbed by Michigan customers.

Devi Glick, an energy analyst at Synapse Energy Economics, testified in the Michigan case.

She adapted her analysis to calculate how much Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia customers were overpaying for OVEC power versus what power from the market cost.

She said the structure of OVEC’s ownership makes it hard to change anything about the way the plants operate.

“If all of them got together and were saying, ‘Yeah, this is a bad idea,’ they could make a change,” Glick said, “but it’s kind of an a nice, easy way out for them to say, ‘oh, we can’t make a unilateral decision.’”

Liz Pratt, senior communications director for LG&E and KU, said she wasn’t familiar with Glick’s analysis and couldn’t comment on it.

“We dispatch least-cost generation first, and this balanced generation approach gives us the flexibility to hedge against fuel price increases for our customers, while continuing to ensure safe, reliable and affordable service,” she said, adding, “Our residential electric rates remain well below the national average.”

Nationwide, electric utilities are scrambling to meet the demand for power from data centers and advanced manufacturing.

Meanwhile, federal policy has shifted from favoring renewables to supporting fossil fuels, including coal. The Trump administration wants to prevent the retirement of coal plants, and has used its executive power to keep at least one plant on the grid after it was scheduled to shut down.

The price of electricity has risen faster than inflation. Data centers may be driving some of that. The price of natural gas has also gone up, leading to an increase in coal generation.

The contract the region’s utilities have with OVEC runs until 2040, and utility analysts don’t expect the plants to become profitable. The Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek plants were built in 1955, making them older than the average coal plant.

Gary, of the Kentucky Resources Council, said replacement parts for coal plants are getting scarce. No new coal plant has been built nationwide since 2013.

“Nobody wants to continue making parts for Oldsmobiles anymore if they’re not going to keep making Oldsmobiles, so the parts just aren’t available,” he said. “And that’s probably only going to get worse and worse.”

Coal generates 68% of Kentucky’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. While that’s far less than in the past, and lower than West Virginia’s 86%, the Republican legislative supermajority has made moves to prevent coal plants from retiring.

The Sierra Club’s Owen said that puts pressure on utility regulators, who are appointed by the governor but approved by the state Senate.

“Those commissioners are walking a political very fine line if they ever move to undo ties to coal plants,” she said. “Now, does it matter that they’re out of the state? I think it helps.”

President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill ends the 30 percent tax credit for residential solar installations and equipment in 2026.

Solar panels have to be fully installed and operating by the end of December to get the tax credit.

Brad Morton founded Morton Solar and Electric in Evansville. He said they've been busier than ever — both for residential and commercial solar installs.

""Our local utility company had a large rate increase almost simultaneously with the passing of the Big Beautiful Bill. We believe that's compounded the demand,"" Morton said.

The average CenterPoint Energy customer's bill is expected to go up by about $26 a month next March.

Several other electric utilities have seen big rate hikes recently. According to Citizens Action Coalition, Indiana residents paid an average of $28 a month more for electricity this summer than they did last year.

Morton said he expects solar sales to go down slightly next year, but he believes there will still be a high demand for home solar installations.

David Mann owns MPI Solar out of Bloomington. He said he's seeing more requests for quotes as people rush to take advantage of the credit.

Mann said many of them are from people who already have solar panels, but want to expand their system or add a battery for backup. He expects MPI will be booked solid until next year.

Mann is less certain about how the residential side of his business will fare when January comes around. He said they might shift their marketing strategy to businesses and nonprofits.

The commercial solar tax credit is also expiring, but projects don't have to be completed until the end of 2027.

""We'd be happy to help anybody with any project they have in mind. There's just — I have a feeling that it's going to dampen the enthusiasm for the residential sector,"" Mann said.

Mann advises anyone who wants to get the home solar tax credit to contact local solar installers in their area as soon as possible — both to ensure the installer will be available and that the project will be a practical addition to your home.",https://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/original/file_FmjSANXK.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 16:08:10.696733

Participants from around the world sweated through song, dance and prayers, improvising without microphones and cooling themselves with fans made of paper or leaves.

But the ill-timed blackout fed an undercurrent of skepticism that this year’s summit — dubbed “the Indigenous peoples COP” — will deliver on organizers’ promise to put them front and center at the event on the edge of the Amazon rainforest where many Indigenous groups live.

Indigenous peoples safeguard much of the world’s biodiversity and are among those who contribute the least to climate change, yet they’re disproportionately harmed by the devastation it causes.

“We’re working within a mechanism and we’re working within an institution that we know wasn’t built for us,” said Thalia Yarina Cachimuel, a Kichwa-Otavalo member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, a global group of Indigenous people from around the world. ”We have to work 10 times harder to ensure that our voices are a part of the space.”

This year’s climate talks, which run through Nov. 21, aren’t expected to produce an ambitious new deal. Instead, organizers and analysts frame this year’s conference as the “implementation COP,” aimed at executing on past promises.

A conference that’s not easy to attend

The climate talks — known as Conference of the Parties, or COP30 for this year’s edition — have long left Indigenous people out or relegated them to the sidelines.

Many aren’t represented robustly in the governments that often violently colonized their people. Others encounter language barriers or travel difficulties that keep them from reaching conferences like COP30.

The Brazilian government said hosting this year’s summit in Belem was partly an homage to the Indigenous groups skilled at living sustainably in the Earth’s wild spaces.

But Indigenous groups, as with other activists, aren’t traditionally included in climate negotiations unless individual members are part of a country’s delegation. Brazil has included them and urges other nations to do the same. It was not immediately clear how many have done so in Belem.

But there’s a big difference between visible and being included in the heart of negotiations, Cachimuel said.

“Sometimes that’s where the gap is, right? Like who gets to go to the high-level climate, who gets to go to the high-level dialogues, you know, who are the people that are meeting with states and governments,” she said.

She worried that the inclusion effort won’t continue at future COPs.

Edson Krenak, of the Krenak people and Brazil manager for Indigenous rights group Cultural Survival, said he has seen less participation from Indigenous people than he expected. He attributed that partly to the difficulty of finding space to stay in Belem, a small city that struggled to quickly expand lodging options for COP30.

He said it’s frustrating when Indigenous people aren’t involved from the beginning in developing policies but are expected to comply with them.

“We want to design these policies, we want to be involved in really dreaming solutions,” Krenak said.

Still, the fact that this COP is in the Amazon “makes Indigenous peoples the host,” said Alana Manchineri, who works with COIAB, an organization of Indigenous people of the Amazon basin like herself.

Fighting to make voices heard

At the opening of the Indigenous People’s Pavilion, the lack of power wasn’t the only issue. Presenters made do without an official translator.

One presenter, Wis-waa-cha, of Coast Salish and Nuu-Chah-Nulth lands, said lack of attention to such details can make people feel “continually dismissed through very passive ways.”

The office of Brazil’s presidency didn’t immediately respond to a question about why no translator was available for the event. It said they worked to fix the power outage as quickly as possible.

World leaders should focus on directly financing the communities that need support, said Lucas Che Ical, who was representing Ak’Tenamit, an organization that supports education, climate change and health initiatives in Indigenous and rural villages in Guatemala.

He knows that often at past COPs, the agreements reached don’t directly have a positive impact on the lives of Indigenous peoples. He hopes it’s different this year.

“I’m an optimistic person,” he said, speaking in Spanish. “There is a perspective that yes, it could give good results and that the governments that are deciding could make a favorable decision.”

Above all, he said he hopes that decision makers at this COP “can listen to the voices of Indigenous villages, local communities and all the villages of the world, where they live in poverty and who are part of the impacts of climate change.”

Democrats’ letter follows previous congressional efforts targeting rising rural utility costs connected to AI data centers and warnings to the Department of Energy over how canceled projects will worsen data center demands.

This story was updated Nov. 11 with comments from a White House spokeswoman and a White House official.","Senate Democrats are ratcheting up pressure on the White House over artificial intelligence data centers and the surging utility costs that have accompanied their nationwide buildout.

In a letter sent Monday to Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, five senators blasted the Trump administration for the “sweetheart deals” it has made with Big Tech companies on data centers, and its “reckless abandonment” of consumers as their electricity bills soar.

“​​Since his second inauguration, President Trump has cozied up to Meta, Google, Oracle, OpenAI, and other Big Tech companies, fast-tracking and pushing for the buildout of power-hungry data centers across the country,” the letter stated, which was led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.

“While the Administration has gestured at eventually adding some more power sources and improving grid infrastructure,” the letter continued, “it has failed to keep up with increasing demand. As a result, everyday Americans are already being forced into bidding wars with trillion-dollar companies to keep the lights on at home.”

According to the letter — which was also signed by Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont — national power consumption from data centers could jump from 5% to 12% within three years, and even the White House noted in its AI Action Plan that “technological advancements of AI are increasing pressures on the grid.”

At the same time, the second Trump administration has seemingly traded in the all-of-the-above approach to energy sources pursued during the president’s first term for a decidedly anti-renewables bent that the senators said has “supercharged this cost-of-living crisis by making it harder to increase and diversify sources of household electricity sources.”

“President Trump has hiked tariffs on critical energy infrastructure, expanded liquified natural gas exports that could push natural gas prices up by 30% by 2050, and undermined energy assistance programs that millions of families rely on,” the lawmakers wrote. “In addition, President Trump’s attacks on wind and solar — the cheapest and fastest-to-deploy energy sources — through imposing burdensome regulatory requirements and revoking tax credits are driving up costs and prolonging timelines for deployment.”

Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement that energy prices were driven up by former President “Joe Biden’s radical climate agenda and destructive energy policies.”

“On day one, [Trump] declared an energy emergency to reverse four years of Biden’s disastrous policies, accelerate large-scale grid infrastructure projects, and expedite the expansion of coal, natural gas, and nuclear power generation,” Rogers added.

In an email to FedScoop, a White House official credited Trump with expediting the expansion of those energy sources — “all industries the Biden administration sought to dismantle” — in addition to ending “massive government handouts for wind and solar.”

“The only viable way to meet the energy demand of data centers and to lower energy prices is to unlock the potential of US natural gas, coal, and establish robust nuclear power to grow our grid,” they said.

The Democrats were also highly critical of Big Tech firms whose executives “cozied up to” Trump. The administration, they wrote, has “already failed to prevent those new data centers from driving up electricity prices from a surge of new commercial demand.”

“Despite President Trump’s promises to lower Americans’ bills, since January, families have seen the average price of household energy climb by ten percent,” the letter stated. “Americans should not be expected to bankroll Big Tech’s infrastructure through excessive electricity bills and threats to their water supplies.”

The lawmakers asked Kratsios and Lutnick to respond to a series of questions by Nov. 21, including what steps OSTP and Commerce have taken to measure the cost of AI data centers on consumers via higher electricity bills and depleted water supplies, as well as details on legal arrangements made with tech companies to ensure rates don’t increase and water supplies aren’t environmentally compromised.

They also want information from OSTP and Commerce on which companies the Trump administration has coordinated with on the buildout of data centers, as well as where those facilities are located, plus what has been done to inform states of changes to electricity demand and water supplies. A final question asks if the administration and its AI and crypto partners will take any steps to “compensate American households for drastic increases in their utility bills.”

Commerce did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

Democrats’ letter follows previous congressional efforts targeting rising rural utility costs connected to AI data centers and warnings to the Department of Energy over how canceled projects will worsen data center demands. Meanwhile, the DOE’s national laboratories are full steam ahead on AI data centers, including at Oak Ridge, which is currently seeking proposals for long-term leases on its Tennessee campus.

A brownfield is real estate that is abandoned or inactive or may not be operated at its appropriate use, she told NIRPC’s Environment Committee. Indiana further defines it as making expansion or redevelopment complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, a contaminant, petroleum or a petroleum product.

“There has to be a risk that the property is creating or helping to create that might be a problem,” Luther said.

“Most people might not think a strip mall could be a brownfield, but it could be,” she said. An underground storage tank could be nearby. A car repair facility, factory or empty field? “All of these are brownfields. Sometimes you can tell, and sometimes you can’t.”

Brownfields have been in the news lately because the Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority decided to create a land development entity that would address the proliferation of brownfields in getting land ready for redevelopment.

Northwest Indiana has 12 Superfund sites – eight in Lake County, one in Porter County and three in LaPorte County – but that’s far from a comprehensive list of brownfields.

Luther zipped through a list of brownfields that have been addressed for redevelopment.

Lost Marsh Golf Course and Recreation Area in Hammond is one of the most well-known examples. That development, opened in 2003, sprawls across 322 acres. The total investment was $55 million.

Removing contaminated soil for Lost Marsh Estates in Hammond cost $80,000, clearing the way for 14 paired patio homes and five single-family homes. “That was one of the first new housing developments in Hammond in 20 years,” Luther said.

The Banc, which turned the former Bank Calumet building in downtown Hammond into a residential building, is another success story. “Yes, we found some contamination, but more on the alley side,” she said.

“I’m excited about this one, because it’s a housing project right near the new train station,” Luther said. “If we hadn’t done it, I’m not sure if the housing project would have gone on,” but the brownfield cleanup provides environmental certainty to residents.

A new subdivision is going in near the Wolf Lake pavilion, where the old Clark High School athletic field stood.

In East Chicago, a new dialysis clinic replaced a former auto parts store

At 4400 Homerlee in East Chicago, the property was purchased at a tax sale without due diligence, Luther said. “There were literally squatters doing business in their building that they weren’t aware of.”

“Mystery barrels” were found in the building. “There was actually solvent coming out of that facility and under the street,” she said. The city addressed that when it tore up the street for another project.

Lakeshore Manor in East Chicago hit the trifecta of previous troubled uses for a property. It was a former dry cleaner, gas station and lumber yard where they treated lumber as the site went through various iterations. It’s now a housing facility.

“There’s actually a limit to how many roll-off rental carts you can get,” Luther learned. A lot of money was spent on testing to reduce the amount of soil that had to be removed. “It was very expensive to do all that – $650,000. A lot of that was due to testing,” she said.

The former Sheraton Hotel in downtown Gary, right by City Hall, was a see-through building for years. It was finally razed, allowing the land under it to be tested for contaminants. “They put a green garden under there,” she pointed out.

Clearing the way for the South Shore Line’s new Miller station took considerable effort. There were 620 parcels screened, just by looking at the paperwork, for potential contamination. At $80 each, that added up. But compare it to $3,500 per parcel to test the soil at each, and it was a bargain.

Of the 620 parcels, 83 were identified as having potential environmental concerns. Only one came back clean.

“The state wanted this to be just the cost of doing business as part of due diligence,” Luther said.

For developers, it can be tempting to build without considering potential contamination of the site. That’s the “if I go to the doctor for this cold, they’re going to find eight other things that’s wrong with me, so I don’t want to go,” mentality, Luther explained. “The question is, what you don’t know can hurt you.”

When the RDA drafted its new strategic plan for the next 10 years – the final version is still being polished although its contents have already been explained – President and CEO Sherri Ziller said the RDA plans to create the local development entity as a nonprofit to work with communities across Lake and Porter counties to assemble parcels and deal with potential barriers to redevelopment, including environmental cleanup.

At the Northwest Indiana Business Roundtable’s economic outlook program Oct. 31 at Ivy Tech Community College in Valparaiso, Ziller said preparing “challenging” properties for productive use will help boost transit-oriented development in the areas surrounding South Shore Line stations, but the efforts won’t be limited to the transit development districts.

The RDA is providing $5 million in seed money for the new local development entity, along with $500,000 from the brownfields revolving loan fund the RDA oversees. Ziller expects the new nonprofit will seek a plethora of grants.

“A lot of the pre-work that has to be done to make these properties suitable for development comes from grants,” Luther said. As federal support for brownfield cleanups changes on a political whim at the federal level, the region needs to be more resilient in how to make this happen, she said.

We’re already doing some of that here in Texas but we’re not doing it enough.” The research on climate change in Austin, San Marcos, and Texas has already started.","New federal funds are on their way to Texas to pay for climate change research. On Monday, Congressman Lloyd Doggett announced a $2 million project to better protect Texas aquifers, rivers, and lakes and figure out how to deal with dwindling water supplies.

“I think we have some very serious challenges,” said Rep. Doggett, (D) 35th District of Texas. “This will provide tools that many local governments don’t have today to plan and adapt to the climate crisis.”

Congressman Doggett took a glass-bottom boat tour of Spring Lake to see the impact of climate change on Texas water. The tour at Texas State University provides a unique underwater view of how droughts and low water flows are changing the state.

“I think that we will see Texas become much more like the Sonoran Desert as the heat continues to go up,” said Rep. Doggett.

The Sonoran Desert covers more than half of Arizona and the southeastern tip of California.

In San Marcos, sizzling temperatures in June have pushed the water level at Spring Lake down about a foot. Underwater, Congressman Doggett was quick to notice how few bubbles he was seeing. San Marcos Springs normally puts on a show, bubbling up from the Edwards Aquifer to form Spring Lake.

“When we toured the lake today very few of those areas were bubbling. Then we saw almost like a scum on top of where normally there would be a field of sand and that’s due to the low flows,” said Robert Mace, Executive Director and Chief Water Policy Officer at The Meadows Center for Water and the Environment.

Mace thinks the $2 million project will provide much-needed local and state climate information that will help Texas figure out how to protect the state’s water.

“We’ll end up with climate information at a local level. Temperature, rainfall, evaporation, things like that,” said Mace. “That information then helps people access how much climate change might affect their water resources. They’ll know how much less water is there going to be in the river because of climate change than if we didn’t have climate change.”

The local climate change research could help Texas push back against the drought conditions that are impacting California, Arizona, and West Texas and threaten to do similar damage in Austin and San Marcos.

“Maybe it’s more aggressive water conservation. Maybe it’s more aggressive water reuse. Maybe there’s some other things that can be done that can help offset the detrimental effects of climate change on water,” said Mace.

“We know that conditions will continue to worsen, and we have to plan for protecting the invaluable water resources we have and beautiful areas like this from the rising heat,” said Rep. Doggett. “We have the potential, with the technology in our area, to develop good renewable energy resources. We’re already doing some of that here in Texas but we’re not doing it enough.”

Treaty Oak Clean Energy recently announced it entered into agreements with the technology company Meta for two utility-scale solar projects totaling 385 MW in Louisiana. The solar projects are backed by power purchase agreements with Meta.

Chris Elrod, the Co-Founder and CEO of Treaty Oak Clean Energy, answered some questions for CleanTechnica. (Treaty Oak is a developer and operator of utility-scale solar and battery storage projects.)

When will the two solar power farms be up and running?

Both projects — Beekman Solar in Morehouse Parish (185 MWac) and Hollis Creek Solar in Sabine Parish (200 MWac) — are expected to begin commercial operations before the end of H1 2027.

How many jobs will be created during installation and how many to operate them after installation?

Together, the two projects are expected to generate around 300 jobs at peak construction and up to 10 permanent positions over their 40-year lifespans.

How will the solar power farms be connected to the grid?

Energy generated from the projects will flow to the local grid within MISO’s Southern footprint, supporting reliable, clean power for Louisiana communities. Technical interconnection details are not provided in the release.

What will the clean electricity be used for?

Beekman Solar and Hollis Creek Solar will bring a combined 385 MWac of new, clean energy to the grid, while Meta will purchase the power and the environmental attributes from both projects to help meet its sustainability goals.

Will all the solar panels be ground-mounted?

Yes, combined 385 MWac of ground-mounted panels.

On what kind of land will the solar panels be installed?

The solar panels will be installed on low-productivity timberland that is not producing tax base for the community. We’ve intentionally avoided prime farmland to preserve agricultural value and ensure responsible land use.

Letters from Belém (Cont.): The COP30 Presidency released its final letter in the lead-up to COP30. The previous nine letters called on countries to embrace international cooperation, bolster the “climate change regime,” and accelerate implementation of the Paris Agreement. In the tenth, the COP30 president wrote that “we are privileged to have been destined the opportunity to make history as those who chose courage over omission to turn our climate fight around. We must embrace this privilege as a responsibility for the people we love, for the generations that came before us, and for those yet to come.”

Looking Back and Looking Ahead: Under the Paris Agreement, countries committed to submitting in-depth reviews of their own mitigation and adaptation results—or biennial transparency reports (BTRs). The UNFCCC has released a synthesis report of 101 of these BTRs. Collectively, countries reported about 3,404 different policies being implemented at the time of reporting, in alignment with their respective nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Over 60% of these policies are in the energy and transportation sectors. This interactive version of the report provides graphs to illustrate all the key findings. The UNFCCC has also released an update to the recently published synthesis report of the latest NDCs. The update includes all 86 NDC submissions to date, and finds that, if countries carry out their commitments, greenhouse emissions will be about 12% lower by 2035 (compared to 2019 levels). By comparison, without these commitments, emissions would increase 20 to 48% by 2035 (compared to 2019 levels).

Paris Progress Report: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s International Programme for Action on Climate published its latest Climate Action Monitor, which tracks countries’ progress on meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. The 2025 report found that only 30 countries have set legally-binding commitments to achieve net-zero emissions and that global climate action grew by only 1% in 2024. Broadly, countries’ existing emissions targets are misaligned with the Paris Agreement, and getting back on track will require significantly more ambitious action at the national level.

Ecuador REDD-y for Equitable Distribution: The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) held a press conference spotlighting Ecuador’s benefit distribution plan for the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) framework, which guides global forestry policy. Ecuador’s plan is designed to make sure that all groups involved in conserving forested areas are compensated. Panelists representing Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities stated that the country’s distribution plan was co-built inclusively, and stressed the importance of equity for all organizations and territories in the process.

This would build up confidence in the sector and get early supply chain investment flowing so we can build floating wind farms faster, and at a lower cost.
Let's be clear, the power from these demonstration scale wind floating wind farms was never going to shift the dial on the Government's Clean Power 2030 targets.
What this CfD round represents for floating wind is early, strategic investment to accelerate cost reduction and build industrial capability.
Industry and Government are committed to maximising ambition and opportunity in the UK's floating wind sector.","The UK has a huge strategic opportunity in floating offshore wind, but the upcoming clean power auction risks under-delivering on the opportunity at precisely the time we need strategic investment to prime the supply chain and build confidence.

The low level of budget set for the auction is likely to mean less than half of the projects in the running will win contracts, adding only a dozen new floating turbines, compared to last year’s auction which secured double that. Early projects unlock supply chain investment, cut costs, and create jobs. The Government is right to keep bills in mind and push down energy costs, but going slow on floating wind risks decelerating the learning curve and delaying cost reductions.

The UK has built our global leadership in offshore wind in the shallower seas of the southern North Sea. But sites in deeper waters further away from shore offer stronger, more consistent winds, meaning more productive wind farms. The UK’s deepwater wind resource could theoretically meet the UK’s future electricity needs four times over. But we’re starting from a low base - of the nearly 3,000 turbines operating in UK waters, just 10 are floating.

The UK has a world-leading pipeline of sites earmarked for floating wind and the immediate priority has to be strategic investment to secure a steady stream of projects coming through. The key tool to unlock this is the Government’s annual clean power auction of Contracts for Difference (CfDs), which earmarks specific support for floating wind as an innovative technology, separate to support for mature renewables like solar and onshore wind. For this year’s Allocation Round (AR7), there are five eligible projects that total c.460MW of capacity – or around 30 turbines.

The budget set for AR7, however, falls short of maximum ambition. Our analysis shows that the budget could realistically support 2 projects (c. 200MW), perhaps stretching to 3 projects (c.300MW) if costs were to be significantly lower than expected – which at this early stage of technology development is not likely or reasonable to expect. AR7 is therefore expected to add about a dozen or so floating turbines to the ten currently operating in UK waters, in marked contrast to last year’s auction (AR6) which secured double that amount.

The £180 million budget for AR7 equates to about £2 a year on an average household energy bill. In the current context the Government is, quite rightly, focused on consumer bills and the need to bring down costs for households while also maintaining investment in secure, domestic energy production. But an overly cautious approach to early investment risks slowing the pace of cost reduction, and it is imperative that we take a longer-term view on a sector that could create tens of thousands of new jobs across the UK.

This would build up confidence in the sector and get early supply chain investment flowing so we can build floating wind farms faster, and at a lower cost. The greater number of early projects we can build, the quicker we can de-risk investment in floating wind for major financial institutions like banks and pension funds. Reducing that investment risk reduces the cost of borrowing, which in turn reduces the price that consumers pay for the power generated by floating wind farms.

The spread of the test and demonstration scale projects eligible to bid into AR7 illustrates key opportunities to develop new industry to manufacture, install and operate floating wind farms – with a focus on Scotland and the Celtic Sea. Key ports like Cromarty Firth, Port Talbot and Ardresier have lined up investment support, including from Government and investment agencies, to develop industrial clusters, and they now need customers – in the form of floating wind projects – to ensure those investment plans can translate to jobs and factories on the ground.

Let's be clear, the power from these demonstration scale wind floating wind farms was never going to shift the dial on the Government's Clean Power 2030 targets. What this CfD round represents for floating wind is early, strategic investment to accelerate cost reduction and build industrial capability. It’s about investing now to secure future growth and long-term energy security.

Industry and Government are committed to maximising ambition and opportunity in the UK's floating wind sector. But looking at the numbers, AR7 will not deliver maximum ambition.",https://www.renewableuk.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-11 16:07:29.276294

In what some members saw as retaliation, then-EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler stripped rank-and-file board members of any role in deciding which proposed rules warranted attention.
The push for more board members from Republican-leaning states meanwhile continues.
Through a separate FOIA request, E&E News has sought comments to EPA from other organizations on the board nominees.","A chemical company lobbyist, an advocacy group that soft-pedals the dangers of climate change and an organization seeking to end animal testing in research are among those pushing candidates for EPA’s premier scientific advisory panel, according to records obtained by POLITICO’s E&E News.

The records show who nominated each of the 165 contenders for seats on the Science Advisory Board, created by Congress to furnish independent expert advice on topics that have included hydraulic fracturing and standards for “forever chemicals” in drinking water.

With Administrator Lee Zeldin yet to announce his picks, former members of the panel are worried that expertise will take a back seat to special interest agendas.

Advertisement

The board “is not a stakeholder advisory group,” Thomas Burke, a former member who also served as the agency’s deputy research chief during the Obama administration, said in an interview. “It’s about the excellence of the science and the independence of the science and the depth of the science.”

The Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees opposed to Trump administration policies, voiced similar concerns this summer. “The SAB is a scientific expert committee, not a representative stakeholder committee,” they said, adding, ”Members should be recognized experts in relevant fields.”

The board’s work remains at a standstill more than nine months after appointees of President Donald Trump orchestrated the blanket ouster of all previous incumbents in January. When Zeldin in May opened the door to nominations to reconstitute the panel, he called the outcome “critical” to advancing the agency’s mission of protecting human health and the environment.

To date, he has named no new members. At least in recent years, there is no precedent for leaving all board seats vacant for so long.

Asked this month when Zeldin intends to fill them, EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said the review of the candidates is continuing and that more information will be released once the assessment is complete.

To Burke, now on the public health faculty at Johns Hopkins University, and other observers, the lag is indicative of a broader disregard for science at EPA. Besides gutting the Office of Research and Development as part of a reorganization, agency leaders have outright scrapped several other advisory committees.

“There’s been a lot of problematic removal of bodies that were providing outside advice to the government in decisionmaking,” said Kristie Ellickson, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Because the board also has wide-ranging authority to review the scientific basis for EPA regulatory decisions, Zeldin’s eventual choices could be key to determining the level of scrutiny on his contested plans for revisiting — and potentially rolling back — an array of rules issued under prior administrations.

In one corner are university-based researchers who have traditionally formed the backbone of the board’s membership. Dozens are in the mix of nominees, according to the records, which EPA released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. Also up for appointments, however, are representatives of businesses and other organizations with a potential stake in the board’s work.

Among the latter group of candidates are four Chemours employees nominated by Mary Cordes, a registered federal lobbyist for the Delaware-based corporation entangled in litigation over the forever chemicals technically known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.

Cordes did not reply to email and phone messages. A Chemours spokesperson declined to comment on the company’s rationale for seeking participation on the board, which several years ago carried out a closely watched assessment of EPA drinking water standards for the chemicals.

Another 15 candidates were nominated by the CO2 Coalition, which downplays the impact of heat-trapping carbon dioxide.

Although climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are having increasingly harmful effects, “there should be a debate,” Gregory Wrightstone, the coalition’s executive director, said in an interview.

“We want to make sure we have representation with highly qualified advisers,” he said.

And an adviser to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals recommended two researchers with Dow Chemical and Corteva Agriscience, as well as an independent consultant who previously worked for both EPA and Syngenta Crop Protection, according to biographical summaries posted by EPA.

Asked for comment, Amy Clippinger, the managing director of PETA’s regulatory toxicology program, said in an email exchange that the group works with other scientists to advance reliable and relevant toxicity testing without the use of animals.

The three nominees “are subject matter experts in chemical toxicity testing, broadly — including expertise across animal and non-animal tests,” Clippinger said.

EPA is also seeking to reseed five panels affiliated with the SAB that work on drinking water, chemical assessments and other more specialized topics. In play on a parallel track are seats on the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, which aids in reviews of national air pollutant standards and has similarly been mothballed since January.

Reshaping advisory boards

Congress created the Science Advisory Board in 1978, accompanied by a provision that members “shall be qualified by education, training, and experience to evaluate scientific and technical information on matters referred to the Board under this section.”

In recent years, however, congressional Republicans and other critics have faulted the SAB’s bent toward academia as isolated from real-world consequences. During Trump’s first term, EPA barred agency grant recipients from joining its multitude of advisory panels, a step that critics said effectively sidelined many reputable experts from serving.

That policy was eventually struck down in court, but — along with other changes — it opened the door to more members from regulated industries as well as state, local and tribal agencies.

Even so, the SAB emerged as a tough critic of the scientific underpinnings of high-profile rollbacks during that period. In what some members saw as retaliation, then-EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler stripped rank-and-file board members of any role in deciding which proposed rules warranted attention.

Wheeler’s approach was discarded under President Joe Biden. But by leaving the board dormant, Zeldin has so far effectively leashed one potential watchdog. The push for more board members from Republican-leaning states meanwhile continues.

The current crop of SAB candidates includes five staffers from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, which is headed by Clint Woods, who served as EPA’s deputy air chief during Trump’s first term.

In an interview, Woods confirmed that their nominations were coordinated. “People from our agency, people from other state environmental agencies bring really important perspectives,” he said following his September testimony before a House panel on Clean Air Act permitting changes.

But in its comments on the nominees, the Environmental Protection Network noted that one of the Indiana candidates is a field inspector whose official biography does not indicate any publications or research grants.

The network also highlighted “the substantial number of candidates who are employed by, or serve as consultants to, companies and industries that are directly regulated by EPA.”

“While these individuals may possess valuable expertise,” the group wrote, “they may also lack impartiality and an inclination for protecting the interests of their employers.”

The group voluntarily posted the feedback on its website. Through a separate FOIA request, E&E News has sought comments to EPA from other organizations on the board nominees. In its most recent update, the agency indicated that those records would be released in late January at the earliest.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/6d/fa/d838de3e42bca754f33d0d078c47/washington-dc-40091.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 14:06:01.446052

Neonics & the FFDCA

Neonicotinoids are a class of synthetic insecticides developed in the 1980s that are chemically similar to nicotine. Neonicotinoids work by targeting the central nervous system and are significantly more toxic to insects than mammals. Additionally, neonics are water soluble, which means that they break down more slowly in the environment and can be absorbed into plant tissue to provide protection from insects while the plant grows. For that reason, neonics are commonly used as a coating to treat crop seeds prior to planting. Plants grown from seeds treated with neonics absorb the pesticide, rendering the entire plant immune to various pests throughout its lifecycle. The use of neonicotinoid-treated seeds is particularly common for corn, soybeans, and other row crops.

Efforts to restrict or eliminate the use of neonicotinoids have increased in recent years with several states banning or limiting their use. Environmental groups have also sought unsuccessfully to have EPA more strictly regulate neonic-treated seeds. In general, those arguing that use of neonics should be restricted point to evidence which suggests that neonicotinoids pose a threat to pollinating insects such as bees and butterflies, and concerns regarding human health and child development.

In the United States, pesticides are primarily regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”). Under FIFRA, EPA approves pesticides and registers them for use. While most pesticide regulation is done pursuant to FIFRA, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) governs one crucial aspect of pesticide registration. Specifically, section 346a of the FFDCA authorizes EPA to set limits known as “tolerances” on the amount of pesticides that can legally be in or on raw agricultural commodities or processed foods. Without an established tolerance, a pesticide may not be used on crops intended to enter the food system. 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(a), 346a(a)(1).

The FFDCA provides that EPA may “establish or leave in effect a tolerance for a pesticide chemical reside in or on a food if [EPA] determines that the tolerance is safe.” 21 U.S.C. § 346a(b)(2)(A)(i). The statute further elaborates that with respect to pesticide tolerances, “safe” means that EPA “has determined that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue.” 21 U.S.C. § 346a(b)(2)(A)(ii). In other words, a pesticide tolerance is safe if human health is not harmed by repeated exposure to the pesticide’s residue on food products. Additionally, the FFDCA requires EPA to “ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue,” 21 U.S.C. § 346a(b)(2)(C)(ii). When setting pesticide tolerances, the FFDCA instructs EPA to take care that the residue limit is not so high that repeated exposure will cause harm to infants and children.

EPA may decide to establish, modify, or revoke a pesticide tolerance at any time based either on the agency’s own initiative or in response to a petition filed by a third party. 21 U.S.C. § 346a(c)(1). While anyone may request that a pesticide tolerance be modified, if someone files a petition to revoke a tolerance, then they must include data supporting the request. 40 C.F.R. § 180.32(b). EPA must publish a copy of the petition in the Federal Register within 30 days of receiving it and provide at least 60 days of public comment before issuing a response. 40 C.F.R. §§ 180.7(f), 180.29(b).

Although it is up to EPA to make the final decision on whether or not to grant a petition to establish, revoke, or modify a pesticide tolerance, a 2021 decision from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that EPA should either revoke or modify an already established pesticide tolerance once the agency finds that the tolerance is unsafe. In League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Regan, No. 19-71979 (9th Cir. 2021), the court held that once EPA becomes aware of “genuine questions” as to the safety of a pesticide tolerance, then the agency has a duty to determine whether the tolerance is still safe. If EPA then finds that the tolerance is unsafe, it may no longer remain in effect. To reach this conclusion, the court relied on language from the FFDCA which provides that EPA may “establish or leave in effect” a pesticide tolerance “only if [EPA] determines that the tolerance is safe.” 21 U.S.C. § 346a(b)(2)(A)(i). That case arose out of a petition to revoke tolerances for the pesticide chlorpyrifos, a commonly used insecticide, that the plaintiffs had submitted to EPA along with scientific data suggesting that current tolerances were not safe for infants and children. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs raised the type of “genuine questions” that should have triggered an EPA review. As a result of the ruling, all the tolerances for chlorpyrifos were revoked. More information on that decision is available here.

NRDC’s Legal Challenge

The lawsuit filed by NRDC focuses on EPA’s delay in responding to a petition the group submitted in 2020 asking the agency to make changes to the current tolerances for neonicotinoid pesticides. In its petition, NRDC claimed that evidence suggests that current tolerance levels lead to an unsafe rate of exposure to neonicotinoids, particularly for children. NRDC argues that the delay is unreasonable and asks that the court order EPA to make a response.

NRDC submitted its petition to EPA on May 4, 2020. In that petition, the group asked EPA to revoke all pesticide tolerances for five specific neonicotinoid pesticides – acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam – until the agency could fully assess their overall toxicity. As part of that request, NRDC cited recent studies purporting to show that exposure to neurotoxic chemicals such as those found in neonicotinoids can cause greater neurodevelopmental harm than previously realized, particularly in children. NRDC claimed that EPA had failed to fully evaluate the cumulative effects of exposure to neonics that are likely to occur based on current tolerances. Although NRDC requested a response to its petition “as soon as practicable,” EPA’s current schedule indicates that it is not planning to respond to the petition until after 2026.

In its complaint filed with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, NRDC argues that EPA has both a legal duty to respond to the 2020 petition, and that the agency’s “unreasonable delay” weighs in favor of the court compelling EPA to respond. According to NRDC, EPA’s duty to respond stems from the FFDCA itself which provides that EPA “shall” issue a final response to a petition to modify pesticide tolerances either by establishing, modifying, or revoking the tolerance or denying the petition. 21 U.S.C. § 346a(d)(4). NRDC also argues that EPA’s duty to respond is established under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), which requires federal agencies to issue final decisions within a “reasonable time[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 555. While the APA does not specify what constitutes a “reasonable time,” courts generally measure that period by months rather than years.

NRDC goes on to argue that EPA’s delay in responding to the 2020 petition should prompt the court to compel the agency to respond. First, NRDC argues that EPA’s five-year delay violates the general understanding that a reasonable time for response is measured by months rather than years, and that the text of the FFDCA requires EPA to make a response. Next, NRDC claims that the human health concerns raised in the 2020 petition make EPA’s failure to respond even more unreasonable. Once again, NRDC cites the FFDCA which provides that EPA may establish a pesticide tolerance only if it is “safe” for aggregate exposure, in particular for infants and children. NRDC argues that because the 2020 petition presented evidence suggesting that current pesticide tolerances for neonics are not safe for adults or children, that five years has been “too great” a wait. Finally, NRDC claims that EPA has presented no reason to justify the delay, and that for those reasons, the court should order EPA to make a final response to the 2020 petition.

The Road Ahead

NRDC’s request to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is likely the beginning of what could be a long legal battle. However this particular legal action is resolved – whether the court orders EPA to respond, sides with the agency, or approves a settlement agreement between the parties – whatever final action EPA does take on the 2020 petition is likely to result in further litigation. Should EPA ultimately deny the 2020 petition, NRDC is likely to challenge the denial. In such a challenge, it is likely that NRDC would cite the Ninth Circuit’s ruling in League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Regan that EPA’s duty to modify or revoke established pesticide tolerances is triggered once the agency receives evidence showing that the current tolerance is no longer safe. While courts are not bound by rulings from different circuits, they can be persuaded by such rulings. In that way, League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Regan could ultimately play a role in the matter at hand.

A pesticide may only be used on a food crop so long as it has a tolerance in place for that particular crop. Any modification to the pesticide tolerances for neonicotinoids is likely to result in limiting their overall use. While it is still early days, the outcome of this litigation could impact the future use of neonicotinoids across the country.

(NASDAQ: GEVO) delivered a major earnings surprise for the third quarter of 2025, posting results that exceeded Wall Street expectations and highlighted a sharp turnaround in its financial performance.

Record Revenue Growth and Strong Financial Recovery

For Q3 2025, Gevo reported revenues of $43.6 million, far above analyst forecasts of $37.03 million, and a dramatic increase from about $2 million during the same period last year. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) came in at a loss of $0.03, beating the expected loss of $0.04.

Most notably, Gevo achieved a positive adjusted EBITDA of $6.7 million, marking its second consecutive quarter of profitability. This was a major improvement compared to a loss of $16.7 million a year ago, reflecting improving operational efficiency and higher cash flow from its facilities.

The company ended the quarter with $108 million in cash, ensuring a strong liquidity position as it continues investing in growth projects.

North Dakota Facility Powers Carbon and Ethanol Gains

Gevo’s North Dakota operations were the cornerstone of its quarterly success, contributing $12.3 million in operational income. This performance was driven by efficient low-carbon ethanol production, carbon sequestration, and robust sales of clean fuel and voluntary carbon credits.

During the quarter, the site achieved several operational milestones:

Produced 17 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol

Generated 46,000 tons of protein and corn oil co-products

Sequestered 42,000 tons of carbon dioxide

Produced 92,000 MMBtu of renewable natural gas (RNG)

Gevo’s Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) system has now stored over 560,000 metric tons of CO₂ since its launch in June 2022, making it the world’s first ethanol dry mill to achieve commercial-scale carbon storage.

The company also capitalized on Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits (CFPCs), selling all its remaining 2025 credits worth $30 million, bringing total CFPC sales for the year to $52 million. This reflects Gevo’s ability to monetize carbon-linked incentives effectively.

Carbon Credit Expansion Strengthens Revenue Mix

Gevo is rapidly scaling its carbon revenue streams. In Q3 2025, the company signed a multi-year offtake agreement expected to generate around $26 million in Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) credit sales over five years, with the potential to increase volumes.

By the end of 2025, Gevo expects carbon co-product sales to grow to $3–5 million, up from $1 million in Q2. The company projects that long-term annual carbon revenues could exceed $30 million as it optimizes its carbon accounting and trading systems.

Gevo’s carbon credits are certified under the Puro.Earth standard, ensuring over 1,000 years of permanence, among the most durable forms of carbon removal on the market. Its customers include Nasdaq and Biorecro, signaling growing confidence from corporate buyers in Gevo’s durable carbon removal capabilities.

This dual-income approach, combining low-carbon fuel sales with carbon credit monetization, strengthens Gevo’s position in both the voluntary and compliance carbon markets.

Strategic Focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the main pillar of Gevo’s long-term strategy. Through its proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology, the company converts renewable ethanol into low-carbon jet fuel, helping airlines decarbonize air travel.

Gevo plans a Final Investment Decision (FID) by mid-2026 for its upcoming ATJ-30 plant, a project designed to scale synthetic SAF production at its North Dakota site. Once completed, the plant could play a central role in meeting the aviation sector’s growing SAF demand.

SAF Market Forecast

The global SAF market is expanding rapidly. In 2025, the market was valued at about $2.25 billion but is forecasted to soar to $134.57 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of over 57 percent, according to industry estimates. This surge is driven by regulatory mandates, green aviation goals, and policies like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative.

Gevo’s integrated approach linking SAF production, ethanol output, and carbon monetization aligns perfectly with the industry’s transition toward net-zero aviation. As the company scales ethanol production to 75 million gallons annually, it expects a substantial boost in SAF output and carbon credit revenues.

Carbon Capture and Policy Incentives Drive Future Growth

The company capitalizes on the intersection of clean fuel policy, carbon markets, and technology innovation. By sequestering carbon at its ethanol facilities, the company captures and sells verified carbon credits while also producing renewable fuels that qualify for federal incentives.

With growing policy support and rising carbon prices, Gevo is positioned to benefit from both market-based carbon trading and tax credit monetization. The Section 45Z clean fuel credits, in particular, provide strong financial incentives that enhance the company’s margins and encourage further expansion.

As governments tighten emission standards and airlines commit to net-zero targets by 2050, the demand for SAF and durable carbon credits will continue to rise. Gevo’s technology and operations are built to meet this challenge while maintaining commercial viability.

Investor Confidence and Stock Performance

Following its strong Q3 2025 results, Gevo’s stock rose over 4 percent in after-hours trading, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s growth trajectory. The stock trades around $2.12 per share with a market capitalization of about $513 million.

Investors are increasingly viewing Gevo as a clean-energy growth stock, citing:

Consistent revenue growth and improving EBITDA margins

Clear strategic direction toward SAF and carbon capture

Effective monetization of clean fuel tax credits and carbon offsets

The company’s solid balance sheet, strong policy tailwinds, and successful operational execution position it favorably within the renewable hydrocarbon fuels market.

Gevo’s Role in the Green Aviation Future

The aviation sector targets a 65% reduction in emissions through SAF by 2050. And companies like Gevo will play a critical role in meeting that goal. Its ATJ technology, carbon sequestration systems, and integration with carbon markets make it one of the few clean fuel developers with a fully circular carbon strategy.

Significantly, its North Dakota operations serve as a blueprint for carbon-negative fuel production, proving that decarbonization and profitability can coexist. With expansion plans for 2026 and beyond, the company is well-positioned to scale both its fuel and carbon businesses.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2304894779.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 16:07:57.779000

As in past summits, the negotiations are starting on the back foot: countries already aren't meeting their goals to cut heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels.

The world has barely budged in its efforts to combat climate change compared to one year ago, according to a new report from the United Nations. If countries stay on that track, the planet will warm by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, compared to the pre-industrial temperatures of the mid-1800s. That's slightly better than projections made last year, which showed 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming – but much of that progress could soon be cancelled out by the U.S.

The Trump Administration is not sending any high-level officials to the COP30 talks, according to a statement from the White House. On President Trump's first day in office, he announced he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, the landmark deal made in 2015 among the world's nations to combat climate change. The U.S. had been instrumental in negotiating that agreement, which seeks to limit warming by 2100 to a key threshold: 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

Beyond that level of warming, scientific research shows climate change impacts become dramatically more damaging. Storms will produce more extreme rainfall, causing more dangerous flooding. Hurricanes get more intense. Heat waves reach more dangerous temperatures. Vulnerable ecosystems, like coral reefs, stand little chance at surviving.

The world is very likely to hit 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next decade, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. To stop the planet from getting even hotter by the end of the century, emissions would need to fall 55% by 2035, compared to 2019 levels. If countries follow through on their current pledges to cut emissions, they'd only fall 12% by 2035.

In the U.S., emissions from burning fossil fuels have declined recently, as aging coal power plants have closed and more solar and wind power has been installed. Renewable power projects are now cheaper than new fossil fuel power plants.

President Trump has called climate change a hoax. His administration now seeks to boost fossil fuels, rolling back tax credits for solar energy and cancelling offshore wind power projects. One study found that such measures will slow U.S. emissions cuts, which were expected to fall 38-56% by 2035, but now may only decline by 26-35%.

""I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders at the United National General Assembly in September.

Worldwide, renewable energy is growing rapidly, with China leading on production and manufacturing of renewable energy technology. More than 90% of new energy projects installed globally in 2024 were renewable. Energy experts say those economic forces will continue the expansion of clean energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But without stronger moves by governments to reduce fossil fuel use, those declines may still not be fast enough.

End in Sight for Government Shutdown

Outlook for Tax Legislation

Notice 2025-62: Transition Penalty Relief for Reporting on Tips and Overtime under OBBBA

Treasury Report on Direct File

End in Sight for Government Shutdown

On the evening of Monday, November 10, the Senate voted 60-40 to pass a funding bill after a group of mostly moderate Democrats struck a deal with Republicans. Eight Democrats (including one Independent who caucuses with Democrats), none of whom is running for re-election in 2026, and all but one Republican, voted in favor. The shutdown is the longest in American history. The Senate bill amends the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) that would have funded the government through November 21 bill to fund three of the 12 appropriations categories for the remainder of the current fiscal year, ending on September 20, 2026, veterans affairs/military construction, agriculture and legislative. The Senate bill would also fund the rest of the government under a CR running through January 30, 2026. The bill would provide back pay for government workers, reverse reductions in force undertaken by the Executive Branch since the shutdown started and prohibit such reductions through the length of the CR. After prior shutdowns, government workers received back pay regardless of whether they had been furloughed, but the Trump administration had stated they were considering not doing so this time.

The Senate Democrats who voted in favor of the bill are: Catherine Cortez Masto (D – NV), Dick Durbin (D – IL), John Fetterman (D – PA), Maggie Hassan (D – NH), Tim Kaine (D – VA), Angus King (I – ME), Jacky Rosen (D – NV), and Jeanne Shaheen (D – NH). On Sunday November 9, the same Senators approved a procedural motion to take up the House bill, which enabled Monday’s vote.

The House appears very likely to pass the Senate-passed bill on Wednesday, but this is not guaranteed. Speaker Johnson will swear in Rep-elect Adelita Grijalva, which will bring the House to a 219-214 advantage. Although House Republicans will likely vote overwhelmingly for the bill, at least a handful of Democrat votes may be needed because of a few Republicans voting against the bill. House Democratic leadership criticized the deal and it appears House Democrats will vote overwhelmingly against the bill.

The Senate bill does not address the increased tax credit for health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enacted in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act that expire at the end of 2025. Democrats opposed the House-passed CR over the refusal of Republicans to extend or make permanent those credits or reverse health care policy enacted in the OBBBA. However, as part of the agreement reached on Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Thune (R-SD) promised Democrats a Senate vote on legislation addressing the tax credits. It remains to be seen how that legislation develops. One possibility is a bill making the increased tax credits permanent, which has little chance of being taken up by the House where Speaker Johnson (R-LA) has strongly opposed the tax credits. A bill temporarily extending the tax credits and including some changes, such as income limits, is more likely to be taken up by the House.

Assuming the funding bill is enacted, Congress will likely hold discussions on the ACA tax credits and health policy more generally. There are a wide variety of views in Congress and in the Trump administration on these issues, including various existing and proposed tax incentives for health care. For example, President Trump stated that the government should provide payments to Americans through tax-advantaged health care accounts, rather than provide subsidies through payments to insurance companies under current law.

Some Democrats have held open the possibility of refusing to agree to another funding bill after the new CR (assuming it is enacted) expires on January 30 unless agreement is reached regarding the ACA tax credits.

As in most appropriations bills, the bill contains a variety of very specific items, including increasing Treasury’s $350,000 allowance for “official reception and representation expenses” to $1,350,000.

Tax Legislation Outlook

The prolonged government shutdown has dampened prospects of a tax package coming together at the end of the year. But several possible avenues for tax legislation remain open.

A partisan reconciliation bill some Republicans have floated to address health policy issues might include tax provisions on health care, or also other tax provisions. Although Senate Budget Committee Chairman Graham (R-SC) has held several meetings to develop such legislation, such a bill now appears less than likely.

A partisan reconciliation bill some Republicans have floated to address health policy issues might include tax provisions on health care, or also other tax provisions.

If Congress chooses to address the ACA insurance premium tax credits, other tax provisions on health care or even other tax policies could be included.

There are a wide variety of tax policy items being considered by Congress, including digital assets, that are potential candidates for inclusion in a bipartisan tax bill.

On October 30, Sens. John Curtis (R-UT) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) introduced the Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act, S. 3088. The legislation would expand eligibility for the Tax Code section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit, which incentivizes the production of clean energy components, to include fusion energy components. Under the bill, covered fusion energy components would include superconducting magnets, capacitors, fusion chambers, blanket systems, high-energy lasers, and other essential materials. The bill is identical to companion legislation H.R. 5441, which was introduced in the House on September 17 by Reps. Carol Miller (R-WV), Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), and Don Beyer (D-VA).

The section 45X credit, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, encourages the domestic production of eligible clean energy components by providing per-unit tax incentives for U.S.-based manufacturers. The components covered by the credit include solar panels, wind turbines, battery modules, inverters, and critical minerals, but currently, not fusion components. Though the OBBBA terminated the section 45X credit for wind energy components produced and sold after 2027, the credit still applies to other categories of eligible components through at least 2029.

Notice 2025-62: Transition Penalty Relief for Reporting on Tips and Overtime under OBBBA

On November 5, Treasury and the IRS issued Notice 2025-62, providing penalty relief for the 2025 tax year in connection with new reporting obligations under the OBBBA for qualified tips and overtime compensation. Sections 70201 and 70202 of the OBBBA included new deductions for qualified tips (Tax Code Section 224) and qualified overtime compensation (Tax Code Section 225), and corresponding information reporting rules for employers, payors, and third-party settlement organizations under Tax Code Sections 6041, 6041A, 6050W, and 6051. These changes are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025. Failure to meet such reporting requirements is generally subject to penalties under Tax Code Sections 6721 and 6722. However, because Forms W-2 and 1099 will not be updated to reflect these changes for 2025, the IRS is treating the year as a transition period for reporting purposes.

The notice provides relief from penalties under Sections 6721 and 6722 for failing to include the new required data (including separate reporting of cash tips, overtime, and occupation codes) on required information returns and payee statements for taxable-year 2025. Relief applies to filings under Tax Code Sections 6041, 6041A, 6050W, and 6051, provided the filer otherwise submits a complete and correct return.

While optional for 2025, the notice encourages employers and payors to provide employees and payees with occupation code, overtime, and cash tip data to help them determine whether they qualify for the deductions. The IRS suggested employers may furnish this information via online portals or supplemental statements.

The notice states that additional taxpayer guidance on claiming these new deductions will be forthcoming.

Treasury Files Report to Congress on Replacement of Direct File

In Section 70607 of the OBBBA, Congress directed the Department of the Treasury to submit a report on the Direct File program. Treasury sent the report to Congress on October 2. In the report, Treasury stated that it has instructed the IRS to suspend Direct File and strengthen its public-private partnerships with tax preparation companies.

Direct File was introduced in March 2024 as an option for eligible taxpayers to file their federal individual income tax returns online directly with the IRS at no cost to the taxpayer. However, according to the report, Direct File experienced low overall participation and imposed relatively high costs and administrative burdens on the federal government compared with other free filing options. For tax year 2024, returns submitted using Direct File accounted for less than 0.5% of the approximately 146 million returns filed. Direct File had a cost to the federal budget of at least $41 million for tax year 2024 returns—an average of $138 per return accepted through the system.

The report highlights and recommends other successful, longstanding programs, such as Free File, moving forward.

In the report, the Treasury and IRS announced they will: (1) conduct an updated taxpayer survey on preferences over different filing options that addresses methodological and other challenges present in earlier surveys; (2) convene a Free Filing Modernization Summit; (3) create a common understanding of a “free return” across all filing options available to taxpayers; (4) collect more robust usage data from software providers; and (5) provide a supplemental report to Congress, including updates based on these action items.",https://www.sullcrom.com/SullivanCromwell/_Assets/images/sc-logo-2D_1200x630.png,N,,2025-11-11 14:05:50.728896

Northwest Indiana has 12 Superfund sites – eight in Lake County, one in Porter County and three in LaPorte County – but that’s far from a comprehensive list of brownfields.
Of the 620 parcels, 83 were identified as having potential environmental concerns.","With all of Northwest Indiana’s heavy industry, it’s no wonder that brownfields abound here. But even a strip mall can become a brownfield.

A brownfield could also be an empty field or a house that people are dumping in, said Kathy Luther, the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission’s director of environmental programs.

“We need READI times 10 to do the amount of work to make these brownfields ready for redevelopment,” Luther said.

It would take hundreds of millions of dollars to eliminate all the brownfield sites in Northwest Indiana, along with a champion for redevelopment funding. That could be the new land development entity.

A brownfield is real estate that is abandoned or inactive or may not be operated at its appropriate use, she told NIRPC’s Environment Committee. Indiana further defines it as making expansion or redevelopment complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, a contaminant, petroleum or a petroleum product.

“There has to be a risk that the property is creating or helping to create that might be a problem,” Luther said.

“Most people might not think a strip mall could be a brownfield, but it could be,” she said. An underground storage tank could be nearby. A car repair facility, factory or empty field? “All of these are brownfields. Sometimes you can tell, and sometimes you can’t.”

Brownfields have been in the news lately because the Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority decided to create a land development entity that would address the proliferation of brownfields in getting land ready for redevelopment.

Northwest Indiana has 12 Superfund sites – eight in Lake County, one in Porter County and three in LaPorte County – but that’s far from a comprehensive list of brownfields.

Luther zipped through a list of brownfields that have been addressed for redevelopment.

Lost Marsh Golf Course and Recreation Area in Hammond is one of the most well-known examples. That development, opened in 2003, sprawls across 322 acres. The total investment was $55 million.

Removing contaminated soil for Lost Marsh Estates in Hammond cost $80,000, clearing the way for 14 paired patio homes and five single-family homes. “That was one of the first new housing developments in Hammond in 20 years,” Luther said.

The Banc, which turned the former Bank Calumet building in downtown Hammond into a residential building, is another success story. “Yes, we found some contamination, but more on the alley side,” she said.

“I’m excited about this one, because it’s a housing project right near the new train station,” Luther said. “If we hadn’t done it, I’m not sure if the housing project would have gone on,” but the brownfield cleanup provides environmental certainty to residents.

A new subdivision is going in near the Wolf Lake pavilion, where the old Clark High School athletic field stood.

In East Chicago, a new dialysis clinic replaced a former auto parts store

At 4400 Homerlee in East Chicago, the property was purchased at a tax sale without due diligence, Luther said. “There were literally squatters doing business in their building that they weren’t aware of.”

“Mystery barrels” were found in the building. “There was actually solvent coming out of that facility and under the street,” she said. The city addressed that when it tore up the street for another project.

Lakeshore Manor in East Chicago hit the trifecta of previous troubled uses for a property. It was a former dry cleaner, gas station and lumber yard where they treated lumber as the site went through various iterations. It’s now a housing facility.

“There’s actually a limit to how many roll-off rental carts you can get,” Luther learned. A lot of money was spent on testing to reduce the amount of soil that had to be removed. “It was very expensive to do all that – $650,000. A lot of that was due to testing,” she said.

The former Sheraton Hotel in downtown Gary, right by City Hall, was a see-through building for years. It was finally razed, allowing the land under it to be tested for contaminants. “They put a green garden under there,” she pointed out.

Clearing the way for the South Shore Line’s new Miller station took considerable effort. There were 620 parcels screened, just by looking at the paperwork, for potential contamination. At $80 each, that added up. But compare it to $3,500 per parcel to test the soil at each, and it was a bargain.

Of the 620 parcels, 83 were identified as having potential environmental concerns. Only one came back clean.

“The state wanted this to be just the cost of doing business as part of due diligence,” Luther said.

For developers, it can be tempting to build without considering potential contamination of the site. That’s the “if I go to the doctor for this cold, they’re going to find eight other things that’s wrong with me, so I don’t want to go,” mentality, Luther explained. “The question is, what you don’t know can hurt you.”

When the RDA drafted its new strategic plan for the next 10 years – the final version is still being polished although its contents have already been explained – President and CEO Sherri Ziller said the RDA plans to create the local development entity as a nonprofit to work with communities across Lake and Porter counties to assemble parcels and deal with potential barriers to redevelopment, including environmental cleanup.

At the Northwest Indiana Business Roundtable’s economic outlook program Oct. 31 at Ivy Tech Community College in Valparaiso, Ziller said preparing “challenging” properties for productive use will help boost transit-oriented development in the areas surrounding South Shore Line stations, but the efforts won’t be limited to the transit development districts.

The RDA is providing $5 million in seed money for the new local development entity, along with $500,000 from the brownfields revolving loan fund the RDA oversees. Ziller expects the new nonprofit will seek a plethora of grants.

“A lot of the pre-work that has to be done to make these properties suitable for development comes from grants,” Luther said. As federal support for brownfield cleanups changes on a political whim at the federal level, the region needs to be more resilient in how to make this happen, she said.

As in past summits, the negotiations are starting on the back foot: countries already aren't meeting their goals to cut heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels.

The world has barely budged in its efforts to combat climate change compared to one year ago, according to a new report from the United Nations. If countries stay on that track, the planet will warm by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, compared to the pre-industrial temperatures of the mid-1800s. That's slightly better than projections made last year, which showed 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming – but much of that progress could soon be cancelled out by the U.S.

The Trump Administration is not sending any high-level officials to the COP30 talks, according to a statement from the White House. On President Trump's first day in office, he announced he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, the landmark deal made in 2015 among the world's nations to combat climate change. The U.S. had been instrumental in negotiating that agreement, which seeks to limit warming by 2100 to a key threshold: 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

Beyond that level of warming, scientific research shows climate change impacts become dramatically more damaging. Storms will produce more extreme rainfall, causing more dangerous flooding. Hurricanes get more intense. Heat waves reach more dangerous temperatures. Vulnerable ecosystems, like coral reefs, stand little chance at surviving.

The world is very likely to hit 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next decade, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. To stop the planet from getting even hotter by the end of the century, emissions would need to fall 55% by 2035, compared to 2019 levels. If countries follow through on their current pledges to cut emissions, they'd only fall 12% by 2035.

In the U.S., emissions from burning fossil fuels have declined recently, as aging coal power plants have closed and more solar and wind power has been installed. Renewable power projects are now cheaper than new fossil fuel power plants.

President Trump has called climate change a hoax. His administration now seeks to boost fossil fuels, rolling back tax credits for solar energy and cancelling offshore wind power projects. One study found that such measures will slow U.S. emissions cuts, which were expected to fall 38-56% by 2035, but now may only decline by 26-35%.

""I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders at the United National General Assembly in September.

Worldwide, renewable energy is growing rapidly, with China leading on production and manufacturing of renewable energy technology. More than 90% of new energy projects installed globally in 2024 were renewable. Energy experts say those economic forces will continue the expansion of clean energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But without stronger moves by governments to reduce fossil fuel use, those declines may still not be fast enough.

COP30 offers progressive leaders a chance to prove that climate action is a driver of growth and prosperity in democratic societies, not a drag on them.","After three consecutive years of climate negotiations hosted by authoritarian regimes, the return of the COP summit to a democracy could not come at a more decisive moment. When world leaders gather in Belém for COP30 this week, they will enter a country that has defied both authoritarianism and environmental collapse, a reminder that democracy delivers where despotism destroys.

Just a few years ago, Brazil was at the brink. Under far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro, the Amazon burned at record pace while democratic institutions buckled under relentless attacks. Bolsonaro gutted environmental agencies, defunded enforcement programs and mocked climate science. By 2021, deforestation in the Amazon had surged to the highest annual level in a decade, and the world feared the rainforest might cross an irreversible tipping point.

Then, Brazilians voted for a different future. President Lula da Silva returned to office, on a promise to restore both the environment and democracy. Within a year, deforestation in the Amazon dropped sharply as environmental programs and control regulations were restored. Brazil’s Supreme Federal Court later convicted Bolsonaro for plotting to cling to power after losing the 2022 election, a rare and powerful reminder that climate integrity and democratic integrity indeed rise and fall together.

Now, as Brazil hosts COP30, it is leading by example. Lula’s government is centering three priorities that embody progressive values: strengthening multilateral cooperation; linking climate goals to social and economic transitions; and accelerating implementation of the Paris Agreement. These are not just diplomatic talking points, but a reminder that democracies can still deliver and lead the green transition.

Progressive leaders arriving in Belém will do so under the shadow of a dangerous global backdrop. Around the world, autocrats and far-right populists are waging a coordinated attack on both climate ambition and democratic norms by exploiting legitimate economic anxieties and turning them against climate action. They cast climate policy as an elite project that kills jobs, raises prices, and weakens national sovereignty, while defending the fossil fuel status quo that profits the few and punishes the many. The goal isn’t just to block climate policy — it’s to corrode faith in democracy itself.

From Washington, D.C. to Buenos Aires to Budapest, this narrative has taken hold. In the United States, Trump has undone key climate initiatives while promising to “drill, baby, drill.” In Europe, far-right parties are rising on pledges to roll back green standards, claiming they protect ordinary people from climate regulations. Even leaders who know better are softening their climate agendas, afraid of losing working-class voters to populist backlash.

The result is a race to the bottom — one that risks undoing the fragile progress made since the Paris Agreement. The far right’s message is deceptively simple: climate policy costs too much.

But it’s false. Clean energy is now the cheapest energy in history. Renewables are insulating households from fossil fuel price shocks. Diversifying energy resources can improve grid reliability and help consumers save money during extreme periods of heat and cold. And every delay in the transition makes inflation and instability worse, not better.

The good news is that people still believe in progress. Polling from Global Progress Action and Datapraxis shows strong demand for bold, risk-taking leadership that can deliver real change in their daily lives. In addition, people continue to believe in democracy and are pushing back on strong-man politics without accountability. People want policies that lower their bills, secure their jobs, and strengthen their communities — and climate action can do those things plus guarantee a future for our children and their children. That’s a progressive mandate waiting to be seized.

COP30 offers progressive leaders a chance to prove that climate action is a driver of growth and prosperity in democratic societies, not a drag on them. The evidence is on their side. In Spain, electricity prices have dropped by 50% since 2018 thanks to solar and wind growth.

Globally, jobs in clean energy grew by 3.8% in 2023, far outpacing the rest of the economy. Renewable energy systems make communities more resilient in the face of extreme heat, storms, and geopolitical shocks.

Like Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said at the 2025 Global Progress Action Summit, progressives need to fight far-right narratives with facts, but also with the vision to show that the path to lower costs and greater security is through climate action, not away from it. At Belem, progressives must show that climate leadership is national strength — that it delivers cheaper energy, more jobs, and safer communities, while upholding the values autocrats fear most: transparency, accountability, and solidarity.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/74B7G5477BGF5EG5ZRWJVJ4FTA.jpg?auth=7288635c91bfc22b58f900d6a59536956b93c2abb80be95490e4ab651ffe599d&width=1200,N,,2025-11-11 17:05:35.070956

Since Donald Trump took office, electricity rates have risen 11% nationally – and he is making the affordability crisis worse by taking energy projects offline

Washington, DC – Today, the Charlotte Observer reported that Pine Gate Renewables is laying off more than 78% of its workforce, impacting 223 workers, with the closure of their Asheville facility. This news comes on the heels of the company filing for bankruptcy, directly citing the passage of the Republican budget bill as a contributing factor. Pine Gate has 107 clean energy projects nationwide, which could power over 2.3 million homes. Its subsidiary, Blue Ridge Power, closed in October, laying off 517 workers. This closure was the state’s second-largest layoff in 2025.

It’s not just North Carolina. Donald Trump’s war on clean energy continues to shutter facilities across the country – laying off workers and taking critical energy off the grid as electricity costs skyrocket. Climate Power’s October Energy Crisis Snapshot report shows over 158,000 jobs have already been lost or stalled in the clean energy sector, and gas and electric utilities have raised or sought to increase bills by at least $89.9 billion since Trump took office. Meanwhile, soaring energy costs dominated the political conversation in last Tuesday’s elections, offering Democrats a roadmap for the 2026 midterms.

Climate Power Senior Advisor Jesse Lee issued the following statement:

“Thom Tillis was right, Trump and his lackey Michael Whatley were wrong. Trump and Republican policies are shuttering energy projects across the country, leaving Americans out of work while their utility costs skyrocket. And as we saw last week, voters have had enough. Republicans running for office in North Carolina should see flashing warning signs – Americans are sick of the GOP energy crisis that is leaving them without work and with higher and higher utility costs each month.”

Trump’s reckless energy policies are leaving a trail of shuttered projects across the country, including in North Carolina:

Yesterday, QCells, a solar manufacturing plant in Georgia, announced that it would be furloughing 1,000 workers and permanently laying off an additional 300.

In just two months, six clean energy projects were closed in Michigan, including most recently, two electric vehicle battery plants that laid off 324 workers.

Last month, General Motors laid off 1,200 workers at its electric vehicle plant in Detroit, along with hundreds of additional permanent and temporary layoffs at battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

In October, Topsoe cited the repeal of clean energy tax credits as a reason for canceling 150 jobs and a $400 million investment in their Richmond, Virginia facility.

Earlier last month, Fox 2 Detroit reported that over 100 employees at Dana Incorporated, an electric vehicle battery component manufacturer in Auburn Hills, Michigan, had been laid off.

General Motors canceled a $55 million factory that would have created 300 jobs, citing “decisions of the DOE”.

Fortescue blamed U.S. “policy settings” and the elimination of “critical tax credits” in Trump and Republicans’ budget bill for the cancellation of their $210 million Detroit EV battery factory.

Trump is using the government shutdown as an opportunity to sow even more chaos and uncertainty for American workers by cancelling $8 billion in investments in states that did not vote for him. The Trump administration has put $24 billion for energy projects on the chopping block since May.

Trump’s federal energy policies contributed to battery startup, Natron Energy, shutting down and canceling its planned $1.4 billion factory in Eastern North Carolina, which would have created 1,000 jobs.",https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Meta-Image_Climate-Power.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 15:07:51.434844

The trade body said 16 projects are now fully operational across seven countries, up from 245MW a year ago, with total installed capacity set to increase nearly tenfold to 2.5GW by 2030.

Norway leads with 100MW across three projects, followed by the UK with 78MW and China with 40MW. A further 93MW of capacity is under construction globally, including two projects in France and two in China.

The report found 221GW of floating wind at all stages of development worldwide across 324 projects. By 2030, China and the UK are expected to dominate the sector with 45% and 41% of global capacity respectively, while markets such as France, Norway and Japan are set to accelerate in the 2030s.

Europe accounts for 60% of global floating capacity – about 134GW – with the UK representing 14% of that total, or 31GW across 39 projects. Of this, 84% is located in Scottish waters.

Five UK projects totalling 458MW are eligible to compete in the upcoming Contracts for Difference Allocation Round 7, though RenewableUK said the current budget may only secure two or three new developments.

Solar Power & The Energy Storage Angle As indicated by the new EIA report, the solar power outlook over the next 12 months is fairly reasonable.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

In the topsy-turvy world of US energy policy, solar power has been pushed aside while other renewables — namely hydropower, biomass, and geothermal — have earned the support of President Donald Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” program. That’s just plain weird. After all, electricity demand in the US is going through the roof and solar is the most abundant, accessible, and economical domestic energy resource available today. The US Energy Information Agency has the latest word on that topic, in a new report issued on November 10.

32 More Gigawatts Are Coming To The US

The new EIA report does not make much room for biomass, hydropower, geothermal, or any other domestic energy resource to compete against the US solar industry. “Solar power is the fastest-growing source of new electric generating capacity in the United States, driven by large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) projects built by electric utilities and independent power producers,” the agency reminds everyone.

“In our most recent monthly inventory of power plants, developers reported plans to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online in the next 12 months (October 2025 through September 2026),” EIA reported.

The new report also notes that 5 gigawatts out of the 32 are holdovers from projects that would have been included in earlier reports, had they not encountered delays of various sorts. In other words, delayed projects accounted for a fairly large proportion of the new 12-month total.

That seems to indicate that delays are a substantial problem in the solar industry. However, EIA noted that delays tend to be minimal. “Much of the reported delayed capacity occurs at projects that are in the late construction or testing phases just before they come online. These delays are typically only for a month or two,” EIA explained.

In addition, EIA reported that the proportion of delayed projects has declined in recent months, compared to a similar period last year. “In the third quarter of 2025, solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay, a decrease from 25% in the same period in 2024,” EIA stated.

That could be just a blip, or it could indicate a permanent trend as solar developers continue to adopt more efficient construction and testing systems.

Nothing Can Stop The Solar Revolution Now (Except The Usual Suspects)

The latest EIA report also emphasizes that last year’s large proportion of project delays did not prevent the US solar industry from breaking its own yearly record for installed capacity. “Despite the relatively high number of projects reporting delays in 2024, that year was a record year for U.S. solar capacity additions,” EIA reported. “Power plant developers added 31 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale solar PV generating capacity in 2024, which increased total U.S. utility-scale solar capacity by 34%.

EIA further noted that historically, less than 1% of planned solar capacity is cancelled outright on a month-to-month basis.

Of course, the 800-pound elephant in the room is the political weight of the fossil energy industry. In a new report, the Solar Energy Industries Association takes the gloves off, accusing the Trump administration in all but name of mounting politically motivated roadblocks that could bring more than 500 solar and energy storage projects spread among 44 states to a screeching halt through 2030.

The threatened projects identified by SEIA include 73 gigawatts of solar power and 43 gigawatts of storage that have federal, state and local permits pending. Combined, they total almost 116 gigawatts. “That is more than half of all new power planned to be built in the United States through 2030,” SEIA notes.

“At a time when electricity demand is skyrocketing to meet the needs of AI, data centers, and manufacturing, the Administration is using every tool at its disposal to slow down solar and storage projects,” SEIA emphasizes.

“This blockade is undermining American energy security, driving up costs for families and businesses, and exacerbating the ‘energy emergency’ that the Trump administration itself declared earlier this year,” the organization emphasizes again for good measure.

What Is Your Emergency?

Yes, what about that emergency? Going by US President Donald Trump’s rising habit of literally sleeping through public events, the emergency — such as it was — has come and gone. After all, once the Commander-in-Chief begins to sleep through an emergency of his own calling, perhaps it should be called something else.

Be that as it may, both wind and solar power drew the short end of the stick when Trump launched his “American Energy Dominance” plan upon taking office in January. After all, the plan was to enlist all hands on deck to meet the alleged emergency, but both wind and solar power are conspicuously absent.

Instead, the plan supports four other forms of renewable energy that have a limited capacity to expand in the US, at least over the near term: biomass, hydropower, geothermal, and marine energy.

Biomass power plants, for example, face siting limitations related to the economics of transporting biomass fuel, among other factors including land use and food systems concerns. As with any other new power plant proposal, community opposition and legal roadblocks can also spark long delays and outright cancellations.

Growth in the US hydropower industry is also location-strained, with water resources, geographical constraints, and transmission bottlenecks among the limiting factors in the way of new hydropower dams and new pumped hydropower projects, too. Accordingly, in recent years the industry has shifted focus from building expensive new Hoover-style hydropower dams to retrofitting non-powered dams with turbines. However, feasibility constraints will limit the total potential to just 12 gigawatts, according to a recent study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. That can help some communities, but it’s not nearly enough to satisfy the demands of a national energy emergency, such as it is.

The US geothermal industry is an interesting case because it is beginning to overcome longstanding technology hurdles that have limited geothermal power plants to just a few scattered locations in the the western US. However, collectively the next generation of advanced geothermal systems has yet to gain a foothold in the nation’s power grid. Widespread adoption is a long term solution, not a response to an energy emergency.

As for marine energy, athough President Trump did not check that box when he declared his energy emergency, the US Department of Energy is continuing to support innovation in the nation’s emerging marine energy industry. Marine energy devices collect the kinetic energy of waves, tides, and currents, and convert it to an electrical current. As with advanced geothermal energy, though, the marine energy field has barely reached the beginning phases of commercial viability.

Solar Power & The Energy Storage Angle

As indicated by the new EIA report, the solar power outlook over the next 12 months is fairly reasonable. It’s also worth noting that the Energy Department is continuing to fund new innovation in the energy storage field. The agency’s previous energy storage funding programs are also beginning to bear fruit, helping to support solar industry growth at some future date when the national brain fart finally runs its course.

What happens after the next 12 months is up to the voting public, with the all-important mid-term elections coming up in November 2026. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet, find your representatives in Congress and let them know what you think.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-power-nrel.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 13:02:41.869437

Earlier this year, Rep. Ryan Mackenzie signed a letter urging the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to protect clean energy tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act. He praised the tax credits for lowering utility costs, boosting innovation, and creating good-paying jobs here in America. In his own words, they were helping “increase domestic manufacturing, promote energy innovation, and keep utility costs down.”

But when it came time to vote on those very credits, Mackenzie turned his back on Pennsylvanians.

On July 3, Mackenzie voted for a bill pushed by Trump and his Republican cronies that would gut those same clean energy credits he claimed to support. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is a billionaire handout that undercuts working families and jeopardizes clean energy jobs across Pennsylvania.

You can’t claim to stand with working families in a letter and then vote to raise their energy bills the next day.

I have spent nearly a decade working on energy issues at PPL Electric Utilities, right here in the Lehigh Valley. I have seen firsthand how smart investments in clean energy reduce costs for families and create reliable jobs across our community. I have also seen how politicians like Mackenzie say one thing in public, and then do the opposite when Washington Republicans come calling.

That’s why I’m running for Congress, because this district deserves a representative who is consistent, honest, and willing to fight for affordable energy. This district deserves better – not someone who caves to Trump’s agenda while hoping voters aren’t paying attention.

Let’s be clear: Ryan Mackenzie is one of 21 Republicans who publicly supported clean energy tax credits and then voted to rip them away. Now he’s trying to have it both ways by telling voters he supports lower utility bills while voting to eliminate the very programs that deliver them. Unfortunately, Ryan, you can’t advocate for something, then vote it down, and think we’re not going to see through your empty “letters.”

Pennsylvanians, you face a choice. You can continue with leaders who vote for cuts that hurt families, or you can vote for me, someone who spent over a decade fighting for affordable and sustainable energy. Someone who keeps the promises they make.

The report, which models energy trends through 2060, highlights a temporary setback for renewables but anticipates strong growth for wind and solar power from the mid-2030s onwards.

According to DNV, new policy changes have extended fossil fuel dominance in the North American energy mix. Fossil fuels, which currently make up around 80% of primary energy, are now expected to provide half of total energy demand by 2050—five percentage points higher than forecast in the previous edition. Natural gas will remain the most significant fossil fuel, supplying around one-third of electricity by 2035 and 40% of manufacturing energy by 2060.

Despite this prolonged reliance, renewables are set for a substantial rebound. DNV predicts that wind and solar will grow from 19% of electricity generation today to 55% by 2040. After an initial slowdown when the Inflation Reduction Act incentives expire, installations are expected to regain momentum as renewable generation increasingly replaces gas-fired power from 2034. The report also notes that both solar and onshore wind remain the cheapest sources of electricity, with their levelised cost of energy significantly below that of gas-fired turbines.

Battery storage capacity will play a key role in integrating renewables. By 2040, North America is forecast to have 1.8 TWh of grid-connected batteries—25 times more than in 2024—with almost 60% co-located with solar generation. Behind-the-meter systems in commercial buildings will also expand, encouraged by long interconnection delays, increasing the share of self-generated electricity to 10% by 2040.

However, the shift to low-carbon energy will take longer than previously expected. DNV now forecasts that near-complete decarbonisation of the power mix will not be reached until 2058, eight years later than in last year’s outlook. Cumulative energy-related emissions between 2024 and 2050 are projected to be 19 billion tonnes higher due to the delayed transition.

Electricity prices are expected to rise by around 22% over the next decade, driven mainly by grid investments and continued reliance on gas in tight power markets.",https://www.windtech-international.com/images/logo/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-11 14:05:57.046305

Building a single 100-megawatt AI-enabled data center—a power requirement on par with a mid-sized American city like Dayton, Ohio—has massive physical requirements.","On October 20, 2025, a glitch at an Amazon Web Services (AWS) data center in northern Virginia triggered more than 6.5 million website outages, disrupting banking, logistics, and government operations. What appeared to be a software fault was, in fact, a warning about the material fragility of American power. Behind every “cloud” lies a mountain of hardware: transformers, copper cabling, rare earth magnets, and fiber optics. These materials anchor the digital infrastructure of the United States. When the supply chains for data centers and industry falter, compute slows, translating into degraded command-and-control capabilities for the US military.

In an era of strategic competition, digital reliability is deterrence. A single outage in a hyperscale facility can ripple across intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) networks, disrupting real-time operational efficiency. Data centers power the digital age and the associated server farms underpin everything from economic productivity to military decision-making and intelligence operations. Current data center infrastructure is composed of thousands of acres of servers, transformers, and cooling towers scattered across North America. However, these private-sector behemoths remain perilously exposed. In the digital era, failure to treat data and data centers as national defense assets is a strategic blind spot.

The dynamics of deterrence have evolved in the 21st century. Previously, power projection relied on fuel and steel; currently, it relies on megawatts and computational throughput. The physical foundations of the cloud, including transformers, rare earth elements, and copper, are as essential to national security capabilities as shipyards and automobile assembly lines previously were.

The same materials that make fighter jets, missiles, and satellites are what make artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, cyber warfare, and command and control possible. When supply chains for these materials falter, such as through Chinese export controls on certain minerals and rare earths, or when power grid bottlenecks delay new facilities, the US military’s ability to process and act on information stalls. A targeted mineral embargo against the United States could undermine the infrastructure that supports military networks for collection and dissemination of ISR information.

For policymakers, the issue is that data centers are dual use. The Pentagon’s Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) and Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) networks utilize the same commercial power and server backbones that serve industry. A disruption in copper, transformer steel, or photonic components slows both sectors simultaneously. The boundary between civilian compute and military command has effectively vanished; resilience in one now requires resilience in the other.

Cloud outages have a major impact on the economy, critical infrastructure, and military operations, meaning the security and the functioning of these data centers are a major national security issue. This article traces the hidden linkage between data centers, component materials, and military readiness. It quantifies the physical footprint of compute infrastructure and examines the emerging vulnerabilities in supply chains and construction timelines before outlining concrete policy steps to harden the ability of US digital computing power.

The Mathematics of Data Centers: Power, Materials, and Build Cycles

Compute power may seem infinite, but its physical limits are constrained by materials and infrastructure. Building a single 100-megawatt AI-enabled data center—a power requirement on par with a mid-sized American city like Dayton, Ohio—has massive physical requirements. Each site needs about 2,700 tons of copper for cabling and busbars, 150 to 200 tons of transformer-grade steel, and more than 50,000 tons of concrete and structural steel for the shell. Even the smallest components carry strategic weight: rare-earth magnets inside hard-disk drives, gold in server connectors, and indium phosphide in optical transceivers. These materials form America’s compute base (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Material Intensity in a 100 MW AI Data Center (estimates)

The estimates for material tonnage are a synthesis of data from multiple sources, including the International Copper Association (2022) for copper requirements, the Department of Energy (2024) for transformer steel, and Arup (2022) for other embodied materials. Figures for rare earth elements and gold are based on component-level mineral data from the USGS (2024).

Every new data center build amplifies these demands. Their construction has already become one of the world’s fastest-growing industrial sectors for copper, aluminum, and specialized steels. Yet production of critical raw materials remains concentrated in a handful of unstable and/or authoritarian countries. The mathematics are unforgiving: Small shortages in transformer steel or copper can delay data center completion by years, with cascading effects on compute availability across both the civilian economy and defense networks.

This situation reflects the limitations that previously characterized naval logistics and fuel supply chains in the 20th century. In this context, computation has become a new form of logistics: Instead of moving oil to the front, it moves information to the decision-maker. And like oil, its flow depends on extraction, refining, and transport chains that are slow, exposed, and politically entangled.

Power requirements amplify the problem. Each megawatt of data center load also requires an investment in grid capacity through substations, high-voltage lines, and cooling systems, which depend on the same constrained material inputs.

Meanwhile, China’s 2024 National Computing Network Initiative plans over 300 new dual-use data centers that explicitly combine commercial and defense functions. Conversely, the expansion of computing in the United States is constrained by transformer shortages, permitting delays, and utility congestion. The inequality lies in hardware: Those who govern material throughput dictate digital speed. This disparity poses a sustained threat to information supremacy.

The American economy and military are racing to deploy AI, advanced analytics, and global sensor networks, yet current bottlenecks reside in the alloys. Each layer of digital acceleration adds an industrial burden that compounds over time. Rather than pursuing an endless build-up of capacity, the United States must also innovate its way out of material dependence. Advances in chip architecture, photonics integration, and compute efficiency, like domain-specific accelerators and co-packaged optics, can reduce the physical footprint of compute. Investing in efficiency at the transistor and algorithm level can stretch limited materials far further than adding another data hall.

Emerging Vulnerabilities: Grid, Transformers, and Mineral Bottlenecks

The most advanced command-and-control systems in the world still depend on transformers, specialized metals, and high-purity optics that each have globalized supply chains with slow replacement cycles. What once seemed like a commercial challenge is now a question of national security. A grid failure or material shortage that halts data center construction can lead to delays in the flow of intelligence and targeting data to combatant commands.

Transformer availability sits at the center of this risk. Rising demand, aging manufacturing equipment, and global concentration of electrical-steel supply have extended delivery schedules from under a year to more than four (see Figure 2). The same pattern holds for high-voltage substation components and electrical steel, where China, India, and Japan dominate supply. This creates an invisible drag on digital expansion. Even if America builds new compute clusters, the energy infrastructure that powers them cannot keep pace.

Figure 2. Lead-Time Ladder for Critical Compute Infrastructure

The estimates for lead times are derived from an aggregation of data from the US Department of Energy (DOE) reports in 2023 and 2024, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) in 2024, and private-sector analyses, including those from EPRI, the Uptime Institute, and McKinsey in 2023. The figures represent median durations and are subject to variation based on capacity and permitting jurisdiction.

These constraints spill directly into defense readiness. The recent US Department of Energy Grid Supply Chain Review cautions that the transformer backlog, extending for many years, is causing systemic delays in both commercial and defense programs. The 2021 Texas power crisis illustrated how grid instability can lead to widespread digital blackouts. Should such a disruption coincide with cyber or kinetic attacks, command-and-control systems dependent on commercial clouds may fail during crucial mobilization phases. In contrast, China’s State Grid Corporation manages dual-purpose “computing and command” corridors that ensure uninterrupted power supply for military intelligence fusion centers. The disparity is stark: US computing relies on market logistics, but China’s computing is regarded as national defense infrastructure.

Equally concerning is the geopolitical geography of these critical materials. China produces over 70 percent of the world’s transformer steel, refines most rare-earth elements, and dominates the wafer-level photonics used in optical transceivers. Any export restriction or embargo could throttle global build-out of hyperscale compute, giving Beijing a lever over both economic and military networks. Even friendly bottlenecks matter: The United States has only two domestic transformer plants capable of producing the large units needed for defense-critical data centers. The combination of long industrial lead times and concentrated supply creates a slow-burn crisis. Power, not processing speed, may determine who holds the advantage in digital-age warfare.

From Compute to Combat Power: Why the Cloud Is a Warfighting Enabler

Modern warfighting runs on compute. Every mission, from satellite intelligence and maritime surveillance to predictive maintenance and AI-enabled targeting, depends on data flowing through vast server farms and secure fiber links. These networks form to support military and intelligence actions across Joint All Domain Operations (JADO). When that data flow slows, the tempo of sensing, deciding, and acting slows with it. Compute latency means combat latency.

Decision cycles that previously depended on human analysis increasingly rely on distributed computing infrastructures. The more rapidly a nation can receive, communicate, and integrate sensor data, the more credible its deterrent stance becomes. Throughout the conflict in Ukraine, distributed cloud architectures were pivotal. When Russian missile strikes targeted Ukraine’s command infrastructure, Kyiv rapidly migrated intelligence and targeting data to cloud-based systems. That shift allowed operations to continue with minimal disruption, preserving pace and decision speed even under attack. Compute resilience enabled continuity of operations.

Compute is the new logistics for 21st-century warfare. It moves information instead of fuel, but its vulnerabilities are strikingly similar: limited surge capacity, globalized dependencies, and long resupply timelines. The United States once maintained strategic stockpiles of oil and munitions to ensure freedom of action in crisis. Today it must think the same way about the transformers, rare-earth magnets, and photonic wafers that are needed for a data server farm. Each is a “just-in-time” component that underwrites digital-age war.

Faster kill chains require the compute power hidden in the algorithms and AI at physical server farms, which depend on uninterrupted access to power, bandwidth, and data. An adversary that can choke these inputs, either through cyber-attack, export control, or sabotage, can slow US decision-making without firing a shot. Hence, protecting compute infrastructure is a strategic imperative that can hinder or enable US military operations in crisis or conflict.

Ultimately, superiority in warfighting increasingly depends on data that can be processed, transmitted, and acted upon faster than the enemy. Compute is combat power, and the materials that sustain it are the new munitions. Securing this edge means the United States must defend and sustain the factories, foundries, and substations that make data centers function.

Six Steps to Improve US Compute Power and Resilience

We highlight six steps needed to align industrial tools and defense planning approaches to preserve the US economy and military warfighting abilities.

First, Washington must designate and protect National Compute Nodes, data center clusters whose function is critical to both economic stability and military readiness. These facilities should receive priority access to transformers, fiber routes, and electrical power, along with hardened redundancy and physical defenses comparable to strategic ports and air bases. Compute should be viewed as a form of infrastructure sovereignty and defended accordingly. Regional diversification of data centers would ensure resilience, so that no single natural disaster, cyber-attack, or grid failure can paralyze national decision-making.

Second, the United States must accelerate grid and transformer capacity. Transformer lead times now exceed two years, delaying both commercial and defense projects. The Department of Energy should coordinate with industry to co-fund new electrical-steel and transformer manufacturing plants, establish a strategic reserve of key grid components, and expedite permitting for defense-critical substations. Every week of delay in electrical power delivery translates into slower compute growth, meaning slower economic growth and military command and control.

Third, policymakers must secure materials and photonics supply chains. Copper, transformer steel, rare-earth magnets, and indium-phosphide wafers underpin the entire data center ecosystem. Yet these midstream refining and finishing processes are concentrated in China. Extending Defense Production Act authorities, allied sourcing partnerships, and industrial incentives to these materials will reduce foreign dependency. Recycling and circular-economy programs can supplement domestic supply, but they cannot substitute for new refining and alloy capacity on US soil.

Fourth, Washington needs to deploy targeted industrial tools to rebuild the “missing middle” of manufacturing that connects raw materials to finished components. CHIPS Act styled incentives should expand to include magnet alloys, capacitor powders, optical connectors, and power electronics. These investments are modest compared to the strategic cost of supply-chain ruptures in wartime; plus, they yield long-term dividends in jobs, technology, and resilience across the defense industrial base.

Fifth, compute resilience must become an element of defense planning. Combatant commands should wargame scenarios in which data centers or regional grids are degraded or disrupted. Exercises should test backup compute, power rerouting, and data prioritization under contested conditions, just as logistics drills stress munitions and fuel. Deterrence depends on speed of response, and the assurance that speed can be sustained when data systems are strained or attacked.

Finally, the United States must align its electrical power grid with national security. Data center reliability depends on uninterrupted energy. This can mean small modular reactors, advanced geothermal plants, or contracted renewables backed by large-scale storage. The Pentagon should treat megawatts as munitions: finite, strategic, and vital to operations. Hardening that power base completes the loop between energy, compute, and combat power. It ensures the US military can sense, decide, and act faster than an adversary.

Emerging sensor technologies will amplify these compute demands. Quantum magnetometers, gravimeters, and other precision sensors will generate unprecedented data volumes, collapsing the decision window in future conflicts. Quantum sensing may make the invisible visible, but only if backed by resilient compute infrastructure capable of processing those signals in real time. Without secure power and stable data centers, quantum advantages are lost to immense noise these systems will generate.

By locking power, materials, and manufacturing into a single resilience plan, the United States can preserve its edge economically and militarily. Securing transformers, materials, and megawatts is as vital as maintaining aircraft or missiles. Washington must invest in the industrial base of intelligence—the physical architecture of cognition that turns information into strategy and compute into combat power.

American competitiveness will be built from silicon and electricity. Future success depends on every algorithm, satellite, soldier, and weapon system operating with an uninterrupted cloud. The chemistry of modern war has changed: It now runs on materials, minerals, and megawatts.

This year’s seismic shift in federal energy policy has spelled bad news for the US solar industry. However, it’s a big world out there, and domestic solar innovators can help push the renewable energy transition elsewhere around the world. One emerging example is the global gas station solar power trend, where the leading California-based tech firm Enphase aims to play a key role.

The Gas Station Solar Power Trend Is Coming For Your…Gas?

At first glance, solar power at gas stations is an oxymoron. However, with their large, sprawling roofs and parking lots that provide a buffer from shade obstructions, gas stations are among the low hanging fruits of the booming commercial rooftop solar industry.

Besides, gas stations have to pay their electricity bills just like any other ratepayer. Rooftop solar presents an economical alternative to the grid mix. Combined with on-site energy storage, solar panels can also keep the lights on in case of a grid outage, and they can help gas stations take advantage of low off-peak electricity rates.

The rising interest of the retail gas business in solar power is not a particularly new phenomenon, but there is still plenty of room for enterprising solar industry stakeholders to stake out more turf, and that’s where Enphase comes in.

Last week, the company reminded everyone that its IQ8™ microinverters are a perfect fit for solar arrays at gas stations. Microinverters convert the DC current from a solar array into a usable AC current on a panel-by-panel basis. Though generally more expensive than conventional inverters, microinverters can offset lifetime costs by optimizing the output from each panel.

Enphase also drew attention to the safety requirements of gas stations. “Enphase microinverters are uniquely suited to gas station installations thanks to their AC-based system architecture, which eliminates the risk of dangerous high-voltage DC wiring and potential arc-fault fires,” the company announced on November 6.

“Built-in Rapid Shutdown capabilities ensure automatic system shutdown in emergencies, while a NEMA 6 rating allows for reliable performance in harsh weather conditions,” Enphase added, referring to a standard scale established by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.

To date, much of Enphase-related gas station activity has been occurring overseas, particularly in Southeast Asia. “In Southeast Asia, Enphase microinverters are powering hundreds of gas stations. Super Central Gas has installed Enphase systems across 105 Shell stations, while multiple installers – Super Central Gas, TNS Network Solution, and MRO Engineering – have equipped PTT franchise sites,” Enphase notes.

Enphase is also seeking to ramp up its gas station footprint in the US. As the company points out, most of its microinverters are manufactured domestically, potentially qualifying US sites for commercial tax credits. The company draws attention to a Tri Gaz 5 gas station in Texas, where its microinverters are featured in a 49 kilowatt array installed by the firm Dynamic EcoHome (formerly Dynamic SLR). Though modest in size, the the project will enable solar power to offset 17% of the the facility’s electricity use while delivering a lifetime savings that tops $150,000.

As Enphase points out, safety is a key issue helping to push the pace of the gas station solar power trend. Wartime grid interruptions are also becoming a concern, for example in Ukraine, where a retail gas stationed owned by Galnaftogaz is getting retrofitted with a rooftop solar array and energy storage system as a pilot project. “This setup will ensure uninterrupted operation, even during power outages or emergencies,” notes the firm PVKnowHow. A conventional generator will also come into play if needed.

The system is designed to work autonomously for up to two days. If the pilot project works out, Galnaftogaz reportedly plans to expand it throughout Ukraine.

Yet another factor, of course, is the vehicle electrification movement. On-site solar power with energy storage slots neatly into the EV sustainability profile. For gas stations, the payoff is attracting more drivers among the zero emission set.

Balcony Solar Power, Coming Soon To The US

Circling back around to Enphase, the company has also been staking out a claim in the emerging global balcony solar power field. Balcony solar refers to plug-and-play solar panels designed for ease of use. In contrast to rooftop solar arrays, which are permanent fixtures installed by professionals, balcony solar systems are temporary. They can be hung from balconies or elsewhere around a building. Homeowners and tenants can simply remove them and bring them along whenever they move.

Germany has become known as a balcony solar hotspot, and Enphase has been quick to jump on the trend. In May, the company launched its new “Enphase® IQ® Balcony Solar System” in Germany. “Designed for plug-and-play installation, the new system empowers apartment dwellers and homeowners with limited roof space to generate their own clean energy from balconies, patios, and small outdoor areas,” Enphase enthused.

Enphase also took note of the role of government subsidies in pushing the balcony solar trend. “According to SolarPower Europe, Germany registered 435,000 new balcony systems in 2024, compared to 276,000 in 2023,” the company noted. “There are now 780,000 total balcony solar installations across the country, driven by significant regional subsidies.”

The balcony solar trend has yet to materialize in the US in force, but the floodgates began to burst open earlier this year when the state of Utah put new legislation in motion that permits ratepayers to use small, plug-in solar devices without having to go through their local utility.

The US balcony solar power movement still has a long way to go but momentum has been accelerating, with the San Francisco nonprofit Bright Saver among those pushing the envelope.

In a profile of the organization last week, The Sierra Club credits Utah with providing a model for other states to follow. Currently, balcony solar bills have been filed in New York and Pennsylvania. Legislators in Vermont and New Hampshire are also expected to introduce bills in January, and Bright Saver co-founder Kevin Chou expects two others to announce legislation before the end of this year.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Dynamic-Eco-Home-gas-station-solar-power-.png,N,,2025-11-11 22:05:38.992866

“Everyone is saying prices are going up,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. ""Nobody is saying prices are coming down.""

Wolfe said rising costs for electricity and natural gas will make home heating more expensive for most families this winter. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association projects average home heating costs will rise 7.6%, from $907 last winter to about $976 this season. Families using electric heat will see the biggest jump — up 10.2% to about $1,205 — while natural gas costs are expected to rise from $639 to $693.

The organization, which represents state directors of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, said electricity and natural gas prices have been climbing at more than twice the rate of inflation, driven by higher gas prices, growing demand from data centers and grid maintenance.

“Electric utilities are rebuilding the grid, and that’s pushing up prices,” Wolfe said. “Data centers are also placing new demands on the grid, which is driving up costs even more.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2025–26 Winter Fuels Outlook, the majority of Americans heat their homes with natural gas or electric heat, with 46% using natural gas and 43% using electricity. The EIA’s outlook is less bullish, forecasting the average electricity bill will rise about 4% from November through March 2026, to a national average of about $1,130.

For households not powered by electricity or natural gas, heating costs are expected to drop or remain steady this winter. The EIA expects heating oil and propane costs to fall by just under 10%, while NEADA predicts savings closer to 5%.

Wolfe encourages families to take small, consistent steps to manage heating costs before winter peaks.

“Every one degree you turn your thermostat down can save about 2% on your bill,” Wolfe said. “Turn it down gradually — one degree a week — so you stay comfortable.”",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/CCT/images/bc4a27be-180e-4669-acdf-523c3abcc992/20251111T161005/bc4a27be-180e-4669-acdf-523c3abcc992_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 12:09:18.952459

“They represent the heart of America’s energy future and are critical to meeting soaring demand and keeping prices affordable,” claims the solar trade body in a new report.

According to the association, developers that have already secured zoning approvals, completed environmental studies, and worked with local communities are now unable to move forward as they need to consult with federal agencies before beginning construction.

It has also increased scrutiny for such projects by the Department of the Interior, while terminating funding for clean energy (see Elevated US Federal Scrutiny For Wind & Solar Energy Projects).

Many projects are stuck in limbo under Washington’s new energy permitting system, including solar and storage projects on private land now caught up in multiple federal reviews, says the association.

It adds, “This federal overreach erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host.”

“If these projects can’t move forward, customers will be forced to compete for a shrinking supply of electricity. That means higher prices and a destabilized grid,” warns the association.

Going electric, though, is a critical way for consumers to lower their carbon footprints. Polluting gases from gas-powered machines — be they cars, yard tools, or stoves — trap heat in the atmosphere.

It causes a whole slew of environmental issues, such as extreme weather events, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.

Extreme weather events leave people and animals in disarray amid climate-driven wildfires, floods, and droughts.

Pollutants in the air also cause respiratory issues, including asthma attacks in children.

EVs, on the other hand, release no fumes, and the pollution from lithium battery mining does not compare to that from gas-operated appliances.

EVs also save consumers money. The cost to charge an electric vehicle is significantly lower than the cost to fuel a gas vehicle, and maintenance costs are also lower, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.

A combination of an at-home charging station and solar panels can further reduce charging costs, bringing the price close to zero. EnergySage offers solar quotes to those interested.

Going electric is worth it, but something must be done about charging cable vandalism.

Once considered niche, it now sits at the heart of high-growth sectors, from batteries and semiconductors to hydrogen, and could contribute over £170bn to the UK economy by 2035.

But realising this potential depends on whether we treat laser manufacturing as a national priority or continue to let global competitors outpace us.

A technology already delivering impact

Laser-enabled manufacturing isn’t waiting in the wings, it’s already delivering impact, especially in clean energy. In battery production, laser welding is one of the few viable methods for joining internal connectors to external terminals, a process critical to the performance and reliability of electric vehicles and energy storage systems. In hydrogen technologies, lasers are used to manufacture fuel cells and pressure vessels with the precision needed for safe, efficient energy delivery.

MORE FROM OPINION

Beyond clean energy, lasers also make several strategic technologies viable. In semiconductor manufacturing, for example, they enable wafer cutting, micro-hole drilling, and advanced packaging-processes essential to the UK’s ambitions in AI, quantum computing, and next-generation electronics. These aren’t emerging technologies – they’re active, scaling, and central to the UK’s industrial strategy and net zero ambitions.

Unlocking the laser advantage

Laser processing combines precision, energy efficiency, and digital control – a rare mix making it ideally suited to modern manufacturing. It integrates seamlessly with automated systems and data-driven production environments, enabling manufacturers to scale output without compromising quality. Over the past decade, the cost of laser power has dropped significantly, while energy efficiency has improved, making the technology more accessible and commercially viable across sectors.

The UK has a strong laser manufacturing foundation: world-class research institutions, a vibrant SME ecosystem, and established strengths in aerospace, defence, and automotive. But despite these assets, adoption remains uneven, and the UK risks falling behind.

Barriers to laser adoption

Other countries are moving faster in turning laser research into real-world manufacturing. Germany, China, and the US have invested heavily in training, automation, and local supply chains, making it easier for their industries to adopt laser technologies at scale. In the UK, progress has been slower, and manufacturers continue to face persistent hurdles.

Skills shortages remain a significant challenge across the UK’s manufacturing landscape. Many firms struggle to recruit engineers and technicians with hands-on laser expertise – a gap that slows adoption and innovation. While some postgraduate programmes exist, there are currently no dedicated apprenticeship standards for laser processing. MTC Training offers a general laser processing course for industry, and institutions such as The Welding Institute, Warwick Manufacturing Group, and Cranfield University include laser-related modules within broader programmes like welding and advanced manufacturing. However, few courses focus specifically on lasers.

Cost is another significant hurdle. SMEs – which account for 90 per cent of UK manufacturers – often lack the financial headroom to try or scale laser technologies. Even as equipment costs decline, the necessary upfront investment can still be prohibitive.

Many of the benefits of laser processing are unlocked through automation, so when barriers to automation exist, they can significantly hinder wider laser adoption. Many manufacturers operate with complex production requirements that exceed the capabilities of standard, off-the-shelf integrated systems. Without in-house integration expertise or access to customised solutions, scaling laser technologies can be difficult, even when the commercial case is clear.

Supply chain limitations compound the challenge. The UK has relatively few domestic laser system integrators and service providers, resulting in higher costs, longer lead times, and increased dependence on international suppliers, a vulnerability exposed by recent geopolitical disruptions.

These barriers are not new, but they’re becoming more acute.

What the sector needs now

To unlock the full potential of laser processing, we need targeted action across four fronts:

· Skills investment: Grow the number of engineers and technicians with hands-on laser expertise. That means expanding vocational training, modular learning, and apprenticeships – building on existing programmes and making them more widely available.

· Support for SMEs: Help smaller manufacturers explore and adopt laser technologies by adapting funding schemes to cover early-stage trials, equipment investment, and process validation. Innovation grants should clearly include laser-based solutions.

· Industry-academic collaboration: Speed up the journey from research to real-world impact by investing in shared facilities, joint R&D projects, and regional innovation hubs.

· Awareness and confidence building: Showcase successful examples, especially from SMEs, to build trust in the technology and highlight the long-term return on investment.

A strategic enabler for UK manufacturing

Laser processing isn’t just a technical upgrade – it’s a key enabler for clean energy innovation, industrial resilience, and global competitiveness. From EV batteries to hydrogen systems and fuel cells, lasers deliver the precision, efficiency, and scalability these technologies demand. If realised, this capability can support net zero goals, strengthen domestic supply chains, and create high-value jobs.

The UK has the expertise. Now it needs the commitment. Let’s make laser manufacturing a cornerstone of our industrial future.",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/d5jldal5/mtc-laser-processing-image.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 13:02:32.466629
,IRA Tax Credits,2025-11-11 15:35:20+00:00,Unión Rayo EN,"Confirmed - US government offers up to $2,000 to those who replace their water heater ...",Laura M,,,,,https://unionrayo.com/en/water-heater-credit/,"It has now launched a $2,000 tax credit for those who replace their traditional water heater with a more modern one (the kind that comes with a heat pump because they are more sustainable).
Why change the water heater?
In other words, if you install a heat pump water heater that costs $4,700, you could get back $1,400 when you file your tax return.
Is it worth switching to a heat pump water heater?
Beyond the savings “We switched to a heat-pump water heater last year and honestly, it’s been amazing.","Renew or die, and the government prefers the first option. It has now launched a $2,000 tax credit for those who replace their traditional water heater with a more modern one (the kind that comes with a heat pump because they are more sustainable). So, if you still have an old water heater and have been thinking about changing it, you have until December 31 to receive $2,000 and make the replacement less expensive.

Why change the water heater?

First, because they offer you $2,000 just for changing it, and second, because old heaters account for almost 12% of the energy consumption of an average home. So, switching to a newer and more efficient one will help you save quite a bit of money each year.

How does the credit work?

Basically, the program refunds 30% of what it costs you to buy and install it, with a maximum amount of $2,000 per year.

In other words, if you install a heat pump water heater that costs $4,700, you could get back $1,400 when you file your tax return.

Lower-income households can qualify for an extra rebate of up to $1,750 through the Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate Program.

This will be available until September 2031, or until the funds run out (so it’s better not to wait too long).

Is it worth switching to a heat pump water heater?

Yes, in fact, they are much more efficient, cleaner, and cheaper to maintain. It is estimated that they use two to three times less energy.

According to Energy Star, a family of four can save up to $550 a year just by making this change, and you also help reduce pollution because you don’t need gas or fossil fuels.

A user on social media mentioned that their 270-liter LG model barely consumes 750 kWh per year compared to 4,000 kWh from a regular electric water heater. Not bad.

The credit expires soon

This was created under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) approved three years ago, in 2022, but it has an expiration date and ends this December 31, 2025. That means you have less than two months to buy and install it if you want to include it in your 2025 tax return.

How to apply

Claim the credit when filing your federal tax return using the corresponding IRS form.

If you also want to access the additional rebate, check your household’s eligibility through Energy Star.

Beyond the savings

“We switched to a heat-pump water heater last year and honestly, it’s been amazing. Our electric bill dropped by about 30%, and it’s so quiet you barely notice it running. The upfront cost was a bit scary, but the tax credit made it manageable. I wish we’d done it sooner” said an user

What the government wants is to reduce carbon emissions, and it is estimated that if 10% of Americans made the switch, more than 20 million tons of CO2 would be reduced per year.

Thus, the demand for clean technologies is growing, and users’ wallets are not feeling it as much (I emphasize “as much” because changing the water heater is quite expensive, hence the credit).

But this is an opportunity that will soon say goodbye, and anything that helps save a bit is always welcome. Especially if it’s something you will have to replace eventually, better to do it now while you still get a refund!",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Water-heater-installation-dos-and-donts.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 12:08:52.157353

Mexico has the same chance, perhaps an even bigger one given its geographic position and manufacturing scale.
If it succeeds, it could add up to 1.5% to annual GDP growth and generate thousands of highly skilled jobs, with positions in energy engineering, green logistics, supply chain analytics, and sustainable manufacturing.
The question is whether Mexico will move with enough vision and speed to lead — not follow — this shift.
It will belong to the countries that produce with the cleanest energy, the smartest logistics, and the courage to reinvent themselves.","There are moments when the global economy quietly shifts, long before most people notice what is happening. Today, we are experiencing one of those turning points. The next transformation of supply chains will not be fueled by efficiency or cost optimization, but by something far more decisive: access to clean, reliable energy. That shift is opening a door that countries are only beginning to see.

For years, the conversation revolved around offshoring, reshoring, and nearshoring. But a new model is emerging: powershoring, or the relocation of industry to regions capable of powering manufacturing and logistics with clean, competitive energy. It is not simply about producing closer to the market, but about producing cleaner, smarter, and with long-term resilience. Nearshoring put many regions back on the map. Powershoring will define who stays there.

Energy represents nearly 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. For multinational companies with net-zero commitments and ESG accountability, shifting production is no longer a business strategy, it’s a climate mandate. The race is no longer for the lowest labor cost, but for the most competitive carbon footprint.

This is where Mexico enters the picture, with both a unique advantage and a pressing challenge. A country with one of the strongest manufacturing ecosystems in the Western Hemisphere, positioned next to the US consumer market, now holds a strategic asset the world is beginning to value differently: the potential to power industrial corridors with renewable energy. More than 30% of Mexico’s electricity generation already comes from renewables, and its geography offers a rare combination: solar capacity in the north, wind corridors in the south, and access to hydropower and geothermal sources.

“If we limit ourselves to cost and geography, we will win a decade. If we lead on energy, we will win a century.” [1]

Countries like Portugal and South Korea are already moving in this direction. Portugal is transforming its ports and industrial zones into green-energy-based trade hubs, while South Korea integrates renewables into smart manufacturing clusters to maintain competitiveness against China. Both understood that the next industrial advantage would not be labor or land, it would be energy.

Mexico has the same chance, perhaps an even bigger one given its geographic position and manufacturing scale. But seizing it requires intent. The opportunity is not automatic. Industrial occupancy in regions like Bajío, Monterrey, and Tijuana is above 97%, proof of nearshoring’s momentum, but powering this growth sustainably is the next test. The country must decide if it wants to be seen as a low-cost assembly base, or as the clean-energy gateway of North America.

“Powershoring is not a theory, it’s the new competitive frontier where sustainability, logistics, and industrial strategy converge.”[2]

To unlock this future, Mexico will need to accelerate renewable investment and transmission capacity, create public-private alliances to build “green manufacturing belts,” and provide regulatory clarity that attracts long-term energy and logistics capital. If it succeeds, it could add up to 1.5% to annual GDP growth and generate thousands of highly skilled jobs, with positions in energy engineering, green logistics, supply chain analytics, and sustainable manufacturing.

This is a window of opportunity, but like all windows, it will not remain open forever. The world is already moving. The question is whether Mexico will move with enough vision and speed to lead — not follow — this shift.

The next era of global competitiveness will not belong to the countries that produce the most. It will belong to the countries that produce with the cleanest energy, the smartest logistics, and the courage to reinvent themselves.

As a Mexican supply chain leader, I believe this is our moment to redesign how we compete. Not by imitating global models, but by building one rooted in sustainability, talent, and regional strength.

This constitutes over half of all new electricity generation planned for construction in the United States through 2030.

This obstruction is occurring just as electricity demand is surging to power artificial intelligence, data centers, and manufacturing, and the administration is using every tool at its disposal to slow-walk solar and storage projects.

This blockade is undermining U.S. energy security, raising costs for families and businesses, and exacerbating the “energy emergency” declared by the Trump Administration earlier this year. Meanwhile, China installed more renewable capacity in the first half of 2025 than the United States and the rest of the world combined.

A new SEIA analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data shows that 73 GW of solar and 43 GW of storage projects, which have not yet received all necessary federal, state, and local permits, are at risk of being targeted. These projects, spread across 44 states, could provide enough electricity to power 16 million homes. They represent the core of America’s energy future and are essential for meeting soaring demand and keeping prices affordable.

Yet, under a new energy permitting bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., projects large and small are getting stuck. This extends far beyond projects on public lands. Many solar and storage projects sited partially or entirely on private property are now being entangled in countless federal reviews.

Developers who have already secured local zoning approval, completed environmental studies, and worked hand-in-hand with nearby communities are suddenly unable to move forward because their projects must still consult with federal agencies before construction can begin.

This federal overreach erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host. It sends a chilling message to landowners, farmers, ranchers, and private investors that even if you follow the rules, the federal government can still stop you. This federal red tape also undermines the energy security and policy certainty businesses need to plan for the future.

Delays are spreading nationwide. Over 50% of planned electric capacity in 18 states is at risk of being blocked. Many of these states, including Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and Nevada, are projected to lead the nation in energy-intensive data center growth. If these projects cannot advance, customers will be forced to compete for a shrinking supply of electricity. That means higher prices and an unstable grid.

Three of the top five states most affected by these threats voted for President Trump in the 2024 election, including Texas, which alone accounts for nearly 40% of the at-risk projects.

Despite declaring an “energy emergency,” this administration is threatening to block half of the planned electricity destined for the grid. America’s solar and storage industries are ready to build, save customers money, and strengthen the grid. We just need Washington to get out of the way.",https://www.solarbeglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/6.png,N,,2025-11-11 11:10:59.930755
,Detroit and Evs,2025-11-11 15:14:12+00:00,Charged EVs,Chargeway EV routing app now includes charge-station pricing,John Voelcker,,,,,https://chargedevs.com/newswire/chargeway-ev-routing-app-now-includes-charge-station-pricing/,"You can find local gas prices on your phone or in the dash for every station; now one EV app has added real-time charging prices.
EV charging prices?
The Chargeway EV charging and routing app—which we’ve called the best electric-car idea you’ve never heard of—has now added real-time prices for more than half the charging stations in the US.
EV drivers for whom charge pricing is a major consideration can simply tap one site after another to compare their cost-to-charge totals at that moment.
It’s also now the only independently owned EV charging/routing app.","You can find local gas prices on your phone or in the dash for every station; now one EV app has added real-time charging prices.

Some drivers go to absurd lengths, driving miles out of their way, to get the cheapest possible gasoline prices. They have access to that data online for most stations, wrapped into routing apps both in their phones and the onscreen navigation in some new vehicles.

EV charging prices? Not so much. At least, not until now. The Chargeway EV charging and routing app—which we’ve called the best electric-car idea you’ve never heard of—has now added real-time prices for more than half the charging stations in the US.

Available info includes not just the daily price per kilowatt-hour, but also variable pricing when it’s been implemented. Tesla was a pioneer in that practice, largely to alleviate congestion at its most popular charging sites, but the practice is becoming more frequent among charging networks, both to balance load from EV drivers who have the ability to decide when to charge and to offset electric-utility demand fees at times of highest usage.

Subscribers to the app’s Chargeway Plus tier see charge prices per kWh next to the station pin, along with an option to have the app calculate an estimated total cost to charge. That will vary, of course, with time of day, the charge limit they set in the app, and their car’s current state of battery charge, which they can enter before looking at pricing.

EV drivers for whom charge pricing is a major consideration can simply tap one site after another to compare their cost-to-charge totals at that moment. The app compensates for changes in time zones as users travel laterally across the US.

Massive data integration

Real-time pricing was a big project that took a long time to implement, said Teske, who spoke to Charged before the update’s official launch at the Electrify Expo event outside New York City in mid-October. And it’s the latest addition and next step for the Chargeway app, following the launch of its 2.0 version two years ago, which added real-time charging station status.

The company uses “multiple data sources,” Teske said, including “catalog research”—what a company says it charges in each state—and a certain amount of actual site testing.

The price shown is the price at the time the user clicks on it; the app doesn’t presently compensate for changes between “now” and when an EV may arrive. Chargeway found most test users looked at charging alternatives only within a 5- to 10-mile radius, meaning it would be the unlucky user who covered that distance only to find pricing had changed.

While the new feature is now available for more than half of US charging sites, Teske says it should hit 70 percent by the end of the year.

Not as well-known or as widely distributed as Plugshare or A Better Route Planner (ABRP), in our view, Chargeway is among the most graphically intuitive and best-attuned to EV drivers’ needs. It has more than 100,000 users, of whom a small percentage are presently Chargeway Plus subscribers. It’s also now the only independently owned EV charging/routing app. Rivian bought ABRP in June 2023, and charging network EVgo has owned Plugshare since July 2021.

Pricing; the next frontier

An increasing number of EV makers now offer some semblance of Tesla-style routing and charging software inside their dashboard navigation systems. More of them now differentiate among DC fast-charging and slower Level 2 sites, though the graphic presentation and resulting comprehensibility of that data varies considerably. A few have real-time availability data for some stations. The next frontier: What do I have to pay?

As Chargeway founder and CEO Matt Teske notes, “With one tap, drivers can easily see what we in the industry know the public must learn: Can I connect my car here? How long will charging take? How many chargers are available? And how much will my session cost?”

At least, that is, unless or until EV charging prices become truly dynamic, rising slightly with each new vehicle after a threshold is crossed, to ensure open slots for drivers willing to pay almost any rate to charge there.

Several analyses show that all-electric buildings are more affordable than those with both electricity and gas or other fossil fuels.","New York looks to be waffling on its commitment to ditch fossil fuels in new buildings.

In July, the state became the first in the nation to require all-electric appliances for most new construction. The rules, set to take effect on Dec. 31, would help New York reach its climate goals while slashing energy and health costs for its residents, according to several analyses. Modeling by the state’s grid operator shows that the grid can handle the added demand from electrifying new buildings.

But last week, 19 state assemblymembers — all Democrats — sent a letter to Gov. Kathy Hochul arguing that the all-electric building standard threatens affordability and the grid isn’t ready.

“While I share the long-term goal of decarbonizing our state, I believe the imminent requirement to mandate all-electric new buildings must be paused pending thorough reassessment of grid reliability, cost impacts, and risk mitigation,” wrote Assemblymember William Conrad, who led the petition.

Delaying implementation would buck a timeline set by the 2023 All-Electric Buildings Act, the law that required the state to put together rules for zero-emissions construction.

Cost of living takes center stage

Hochul, a Democrat, said at a recent press event that she would seriously consider the assemblymembers’ request. ​“I’m going to look at this with a very realistic approach and do what I can because my No. 1 focus is affordability right now, because New Yorkers are suffering too much.”

“This is purely a political maneuver,” said Michael Hernandez, New York policy director at electrification advocacy nonprofit Rewiring America. ​“These Democrats” — many in districts considered flippable — ​“are working with fossil-fuel interests and building developers to try to delay the All-Electric Buildings Act, … a state law that was enacted through the democratic process.”

For instance, National Fuel, which supplies gas to about 500,000 households in western New York, has funded a lobbying campaign against bans on the fuel.

For her part, Hochul has a ​“troubling track record on climate,” said Elizabeth Moran, New York policy advocate at nonprofit Earthjustice. The governor has paused or indefinitely delayed initiatives she once championed, from congestion pricing and electric school buses to the signature policy to implement the state’s 2019 climate law: an emissions-pricing program known as cap-and-invest.

“We are seeing tremendous misinformation from the fossil-fuel industry,” Moran said. ​“The governor should not cave to the fearmongering of an industry that is only interested in its own profits.”

Last month, a judge found the state violated the law when it slammed the brakes on the cap-and-invest program — a case that could serve as a template should Hochul issue an executive order to delay implementing the All-Electric Buildings Act.

Hernandez pointed out that the all-electric law proceeds in a phased way, initially affecting new structures up to seven stories tall and, for commercial and industrial buildings, up to 100,000 square feet. Bigger buildings won’t be subject to the requirement until 2029.

Moreover, the law exempts projects if the grid can’t accommodate them within a reasonable window of time. The Department of Public Service has proposed that builders can use fossil-fuel systems if utility upgrades for all-electric construction would tack on 18 months or more to the development process, compared with a mixed-fuel project.

Several analyses show that all-electric buildings are more affordable than those with both electricity and gas or other fossil fuels. Building all-electric homes in New York may cost more up-front, but a 2024 state report shows the payback period is 10 years or less, thanks to the benefits of superefficient electric appliances, like heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters. Over 30 years, households will save on average about $5,000, the report finds.

A 2025 study by climate-policy think tank Switchbox that considers mortgage payments, gas hookup costs, and fuel costs, as well as the loss of federal electrification incentives, found even bigger savings: an average of $12,050 over 15 years for households living in newly built, all-electric single-family homes instead of ones heated with gas or propane.

“The Building Code Council, by law, can only update the building code if it’s cost-effective,” Hernandez said.

Can the grid support lots of new electric homes?

In their letter, the assemblymembers expressed concern about the grid’s ability to handle electrification of new buildings, citing reliability assessments from the state’s grid operator, the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO).

However, that fear is ​“based on a limited methodology that is not designed to identify blackout risks … and is based on a variety of extreme assumptions for which NYISO does not present factual support,” said Michael Lenoff, senior attorney at Earthjustice. NYISO’s projections ​“don’t justify delaying the All-Electric Buildings Act.”

NYISO uses two approaches to determine if it will be able to procure enough power for the grid in the coming years, Lenoff explained. One approach ignores common strategies to balance supply and demand, like utilizing backup systems called operating reserves, recruiting customers to voluntarily use less energy, and tapping emergency assistance from neighboring states. The method also assumes delays in major transmission projects, like the Champlain Hudson Power Express, even though NYISO reports that the transmission line ​“is nearing completion” and is scheduled to enter service in May of 2026.

As one might expect, this first approach paints a pessimistic picture, spurring NYISO to call for procuring more resources to supply power.

Under NYISO’s second approach — the industry standard to determine adequate power supply — the operator in fact finds that it will have plenty of planned generation resources to meet demand through 2034, even if the All-Electric Buildings Act is fully implemented. The blackout risk generally considered acceptable, striking a balance between greater security and higher costs to customers, is one event in 10 years. NYISO estimates that its risk in 2034 will be about one blackout in 20 years — twice as protective as the norm, Lenoff said. It’s even more protective in the years leading up to that.

“Procuring resources when industry-standard reliability metrics indicate the system is already overprotected risks gold-plating the system at consumers’ expense,” Lenoff said.

In its 2025 Power Trends report, which the letter directly references, NYISO also determined that building electrification is not a concern in the short term; rather, energy-hungry customers — namely hyperscalers and cryptocurrency miners — are.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Building-a-home-in-Niskayuna-NY.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=82e892ad3a47add1e86ad9e69d97bac1,N,,2025-11-11 12:08:23.848811

Three U.S. regions produce volumes comparable to many producing states and directly influence price formation. Appalachia stabilizes around 33 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), a dry-gas profile supported by sustained productivity and evacuation links that are decisive for pricing. The Permian has lifted associated gas from about 21 Bcf/d in 2023 to nearly 25 Bcf/d in the first half of 2025, a mechanical effect of oil drilling. Haynesville remains in a 14–15 Bcf/d range, with operational proximity to Gulf terminals that shortens transit times and secures feed to liquefaction units.

Market parameters and flow hierarchy

Total U.S. production rose from about 104 Bcf/d in 2023 to 106 Bcf/d on average in the first half of 2025, consolidating the role of balancing supply. Regional differentials reflect infrastructure constraints, with recurring negative basis around the Waha hub when gathering, processing or transport saturates. Appalachia aligns its pricing with the availability of outbound capacity, which determines the spread to the Henry Hub reference point. Haynesville cushions shocks through proximity to terminals, securing feedgas for ramping trains.

Industrial schedules drive international spreads. The phased commissioning of liquefaction units increases absorption of domestic surpluses and narrows basis volatility. Any schedule slippage temporarily strengthens local pressure in associated-gas zones and widens geographic spreads. Maintenance planning and lifting windows determine the smoothness of nominations between producing basins and loading points.

LNG arbitrage and export corridors

Cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are arbitraged between the Title Transfer Facility (TTF, “Dutch hub”) and the Japan Korea Marker (JKM, “Northeast Asia index”), which guides shipping priorities. The ramp-up of Golden Pass around 18 million tonnes per year and the authorized expansion of Plaquemines reinforce near- and mid-term export capacity. TTF/JKM spreads steer marginal destination, while feedgas availability conditions loading rates. Operators adjust contractual alignments to preserve flexibility between the Atlantic and Asia.

The pipeline corridor to Mexico peaked near 7.5 Bcf/d in May 2025, serving as a structural relief valve when liquefaction demand slows. This pipe-based elasticity limits regional build-ups and eases pressure on Henry Hub. Interconnections and compression at border points become operational levers to arbitrate in real time between domestic and external markets. Balances readjust as liquefaction ramp-ups reshape the hierarchy of outlets.

Compliance and regulation across the chain

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC, “Bureau de contrôle des avoirs étrangers”) expanded in January 2025 the determinations targeting activities linked to the energy sector of the Russian Federation, including production, liquefaction, services and transport. Traders, charterers, insurers and banks strengthen due diligence on counterparties, transport documents and technical services. Terminal operators harmonize traceability procedures and contractual clauses to secure acceptance and trade finance. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC, “Commission fédérale de régulation de l’énergie”) oversees authorizations for expansions of critical infrastructure.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA, “Agence américaine d’information sur l’énergie”) provides production, export and consumption trajectories used to calibrate drilling, nominations and maintenance policies. Midstream operators prioritize debottlenecking in gathering, processing and compression in faster-growing areas. Producers arbitrate between dry-gas wells and oil-driven campaigns based on regional basis signals and downstream access. Buyers integrate these constraints into lifting windows and seasonal procurement strategies.

Buyer exposure and contractual engineering

Portfolios with redirection options between the Atlantic and Asia preserve value amid weather and industrial demand variations. Henry Hub–indexed contracts with volume tolerances and ramp-up clauses reduce the impact of delays or planned outages. Loading windows align with feedgas availability and train maintenance sequences. Mexican counterparties consolidate a pipeline-based demand base, limiting exposure to international spot signals during tight episodes.

Operational parameters to track combine actual commissioning curves, interconnection fluidity and the evolution of compliance requirements. Basis around Waha serves as a leading indicator of Permian congestion. TTF/JKM spreads signal marginal flow direction and inter-basin arbitrage. The current hierarchy—dry-gas backbone in Appalachia, associated gas in the Permian, flexibility reservoir in Haynesville—continues to shape molecule allocation and price formation.

Referring to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), SEIA says 73 GW of solar and 43 GW of storage projects, spread across 44 states, are yet to receive the requisite permits.

It has also increased scrutiny for such projects by the Department of the Interior, while terminating funding for clean energy (see Elevated US Federal Scrutiny For Wind & Solar Energy Projects).","Over 500 solar and storage projects totaling 116 GW capacity or more than half of all new power capacity planned to be built in the US through 2030, are under threat, due to growing political attacks on renewable energy in the country, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

Referring to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), SEIA says 73 GW of solar and 43 GW of storage projects, spread across 44 states, are yet to receive the requisite permits. These are at risk of being ‘targeted’ by the administration. Their loss could mean 18 states could lose half of all their planned capacity, including Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and Nevada. Texas alone accounts for nearly 40% of the at-risk projects.

“They represent the heart of America’s energy future and are critical to meeting soaring demand and keeping prices affordable,” claims the solar trade body in a new report.

According to the association, developers that have already secured zoning approvals, completed environmental studies, and worked with local communities are now unable to move forward as they need to consult with federal agencies before beginning construction.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the Trump administration has tightened permitting and tax credits for wind and solar energy in the country. It has also increased scrutiny for such projects by the Department of the Interior, while terminating funding for clean energy (see Elevated US Federal Scrutiny For Wind & Solar Energy Projects).

Many projects are stuck in limbo under Washington’s new energy permitting system, including solar and storage projects on private land now caught up in multiple federal reviews, says the association.

It adds, “This federal overreach erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host.”

“If these projects can’t move forward, customers will be forced to compete for a shrinking supply of electricity. That means higher prices and a destabilized grid,” warns the association.

However, the EIA recently said that in Q3 2025, solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay, a decrease from 25% in Q3 2024, and that delays in bringing these projects into operation have been trending downward in recent months.

Ernie Galito, business development and sustainability director at Atkins Kroll, told The Post in August that Toyota and Lexus would ship EV models from Japan using other shipping lines.
Matson's original suspension in July came after the company cited growing concerns about lithium-ion battery fires during ocean transport.
Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, for example, are considered more stable and less prone to thermal runaway than other lithium-ion types.
Thermal runaway occurs when a battery cell overheats and triggers a chain reaction, potentially leading to fire or explosion.","Matson has lifted its blanket ban on electric vehicle shipments to Guam, but only for certain new models with battery types deemed safer for ocean transport.

The shipping company announced the partial resumption of service on Oct. 28, more than three months after suspending all EV and plug-in hybrid shipments due to fire safety concerns tied to lithium-ion battery thermal runaway.

""There is wide variation in lithium-ion battery chemistry, and we recognize certain types of lithium-ion batteries present a significantly lower risk of thermal runaway, such as lithium-ion phosphate batteries, and others that have been engineered by individual manufacturers to specifically reduce risk of thermal runaway,"" Matson stated in its customer advisory.

The policy change comes as the broader U.S. auto market faces challenges. Motor vehicle sales dropped in October as federal EV tax credits expired, according to Reuters, adding pressure to an already uncertain market for electric vehicles.

Matson's updated policy applies only to newly manufactured vehicles. The company continues to ban used EVs and plug-in hybrids, citing increased thermal runaway risk from potential battery damage during everyday use.

Keoni Wagner, Matson's vice president of corporate communications, said the company is working directly with manufacturers to evaluate and approve specific models on a case-by-case basis.

""After we have received detailed information, engaged in dialogue with the manufacturers, and conducted an internal assessment, it is possible additional makes and models will be deemed acceptable (safe enough) for lengthy ocean transport,"" Wagner told The Guam Daily Post.

The approval process varies by manufacturer. Wagner said Matson requests specific safety information from automakers and expects them to notify their dealer networks once models are approved.

For some local dealers, Matson's policy shift won't change their operations.

""We actually don't use Matson to ship our EVs, so Matson's resumption doesn't change anything for us,"" said Arnel Bonto, Nissan Guam president and CEO. ""We continue to receive our EVs from Japan using a different carrier.""

James Rosenberg II, general manager of Triple J Technologies and FlowEV, said the approval process depends on manufacturers submitting required documentation to Matson.

""As for Matson, essentially it comes down to OEMs to update Matson case by case on what battery types are in the cars and only the most 'dangerous' ones as of now are not allowed,"" Rosenberg told The Post.

He noted that many brands, including several Triple J brands except Volvo, have not yet submitted required documents to Matson. The currently approved models are mostly due to work manufacturers completed in Hawaii.

""I do not see any supply issues expected from Triple J or others with the battery tech most of our cars use,"" Rosenberg said.

The July suspension forced local dealers to scramble for alternative shipping methods. In a previous interview with The Guam Daily Post in July, Bonto said Nissan Guam had already switched to a Japanese carrier for EV shipments before Matson's ban took effect.

Ernie Galito, business development and sustainability director at Atkins Kroll, told The Post in August that Toyota and Lexus would ship EV models from Japan using other shipping lines.

""Additionally, we understand that APL hasn't imposed any restrictions on the shipping of EV vehicles. However, they sail from the West Coast to Japan and then to Guam. It takes longer to sail from the Port of Los Angeles to Guam, but they will get here,"" Galito said at the time.

Matson's original suspension in July came after the company cited growing concerns about lithium-ion battery fires during ocean transport. The decision affected shipments across its Pacific routes, including Hawaii and Guam.

The company's new approach recognizes advances in battery technology and variations in safety profiles among different lithium-ion chemistries. Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, for example, are considered more stable and less prone to thermal runaway than other lithium-ion types.

Thermal runaway occurs when a battery cell overheats and triggers a chain reaction, potentially leading to fire or explosion. The risk increases during long ocean voyages, where environmental conditions and vehicle movement can stress battery systems.

Matson’s new policy shows they’re getting a better grasp on EV battery tech, but it’s still unclear for dealers and buyers which models can actually be shipped right now or when more approvals will happen.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postguam.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/a7/1a78fdb0-a508-477c-ad7b-9ce6df41d06e/69098c5881f71.image.jpg?crop=1500%2C788%2C0%2C106&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-11 15:07:39.832697

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines hazardous air pollutants as “pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects.” While hazardous air pollutants can come from many sources, most originate from human activity.

Seventy years ago, Congress passed the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955, the first piece of federal legislation to address air pollution. Over the following decades, Congress greatly expanded federal regulation of air pollutants by passing landmark legislation. These efforts have played an important role in protecting public health, shaping environmental standards, and reducing emissions across the United States.

Background

The Industrial Revolution marked a period of rapid growth and innovation in the United States, beginning in the late 1800s and continuing into the early 1900s. The introduction of new machinery and tools, assembly lines, and mass production led to a surge in industrial output and, consequently, increases in emissions and pollution. Another cause of increased pollution was the rise of gasoline-powered automobiles, which further accelerated the deterioration of air quality by releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

From 1890 to 1920, annual carbon dioxide emissions in the United States more than quadrupled (from 426 million metric tons to 1,840 million metric tons). By 1945, the figure had risen to 2.49 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, prompting growing concern among conservationists and the public.

A number of events brought national attention to air pollution. In 1948, a smog event in Donora, Pennsylvania, caused by sulfur dioxide emissions from a steel and wire plant, led to the deaths of 20 people and the illness of more than 5,900–43% of the town’s population. The incident prompted the first U.S. conference on air pollution, which occurred in Washington, D.C. in May 1950. In 1953, severe smog in New York City was linked to as many as 260 deaths in only a ten-day period. During his 1995 State of the Union Address, President Dwight D. Eisenhower highlighted air pollution as a national issue and called for new measures to combat the problem.

Early Congressional Measures

In July 1955, just six months after Eisenhower’s State of the Union Address, Congress passed the first federal law to address air pollution. The Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 allocated funding for research into air pollution but left regulation and enforcement to individual states, with no direct federal control.

Despite this step, air pollution continued to rise. By 1963, carbon dioxide pollution reached 3.39 billion metric tons. That same year, Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1963, which allocated $95 million for pollution research and abatement efforts. Additionally, the act marked the first time that the federal government was given express authority to regulate air pollution in the United States, particularly in cases where state action was insufficient or pollution crossed state lines.

In 1970, under President Richard Nixon, Congress established the EPA to coordinate environmental efforts and enforce national pollution standards. The agency was founded as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, which significantly expanded the federal government’s regulatory powers. Before the 1970 amendments, air quality was managed primarily by states, leading to inconsistent enforcement, but the legislation required states to develop plans that met national standards. This strengthened federal oversight while maintaining local implementation.

Further amendments to the Clean Air Act followed:

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, required areas that met air quality standards to maintain them and introduced stricter controls for new pollution sources. Another key requirement was that new coal-fired power plants adopt advanced pollution control technologies to lower sulfur dioxide emissions, which are a major cause of acid rain.

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, aimed to tackle significant air quality issues — including toxic pollutants, smog, and acid rain — by setting forth a market-based system that allowed companies to trade sulfur dioxide emission allowances.

Congress’s Modern Role

Since 1990, growing scientific evidence has shown that air pollutants contribute not only to health problems but also to climate change. As a result, national attention has increasingly focused on regulating greenhouse gases. Partisan disagreements persist: a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted in October 2024 revealed that Democrats generally support broad federal policies aimed at addressing climate change, while Republicans tend to prioritize economic and energy considerations.

Environmental policy bills awaiting a House floor vote in the current 119th Congress include:

H.R. 3898 — PERMIT Act:

Sponsored by Representative Mike Collins (R-GA-10), this bill would reduce the scope of governmental regulation under the Clean Water Act by redefining “navigable waters” to exclude certain bodies of water that were previously protected.

H.R. 4117 — Fuel Emissions Freedom Act:

Sponsored by Representative Roger Williams (R-TX-25), this bill would repeal the Clean Air Act’s vehicle emissions and fuel standards and delegate more regulatory powers to the states.

Both bills have drawn national attention but have not yet been voted on in the House of Representatives.

Both proposals have sparked national debate but have yet to reach a vote in the House of Representatives.

Conclusion

Over time, Congress’s role in regulating air pollutants expanded as scientific understanding of industrial pollution, greenhouse gases, and other threats to the natural environment and human health evolved. Today, the EPA administers federal pollution control programs under the direction of Congress, which sets the overall policy framework through legislation. Each year, lawmakers introduce major climate- and air-quality-related bills. While some draw bipartisan cooperation, others generate significant debate. Public engagement, including communicating with representatives about pending legislation, continues to shape how the United States tackles its most pressing environmental concerns.",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*nPVuo-6zFow99HhostrMdg.png,N,,2025-11-11 13:02:48.507961

“It’s practical, it’s inclusive and it’s grounded in shared goals.”","Gov. Gavin Newsom still insists he hasn’t decided to run for president in 2028. But after persuading California’s voters to gerrymander the state’s congressional districts to grab more Democratic seats, he embarked on a flurry of appearances that had the distinct aroma of a political campaign.

He did an interview on CNN, jetted off to Texas to crow about California’s passage of the Proposition 50 gerrymander at a rally of Democrats — some chanted about a 2028 candidacy — and then headed to Brazil as the self-appointed U.S. delegate to a climate change conference boycotted by President Donald Trump.

Oh yes, and Penguin Random House announced that in February, it will release Newsom’s memoir of growing up in San Francisco, founding a business and segueing into politics, titled “Young Man in a Hurry: A Memoir of Discovery.” It will cost just $30.

No presidential campaign is complete without an autobiography describing how the candidate overcame barriers of birth and circumstance to become a dedicated public servant.

As Newsom surfaced in Brazil on Monday, Politico journalist Camille von Kaenel filed this analysis of the governor’s purpose:

“The California governor’s task at United Nations climate talks in Belém, Brazil, this week isn’t to negotiate sweeping policy changes or break into closed-door talks reserved for nations. It’s to put on a show: proving his state is still cutting emissions despite President Donald Trump’s rollbacks, nudging governments and businesses to do the same, and reminding the world that the U.S. might one day pick the climate agenda back up — perhaps under a President Newsom.”

There is, however, a subtext to Newsom’s claim to be a climate change warrior. In recent months, he’s tiptoed away from the aggressive decarbonization programs he had championed earlier, clearly trying to minimize impacts — particularly costs — on consumers. Living costs loomed large in last year’s presidential campaign.

One example is Newsom’s effort to stop the planned decommission of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant and several gas-fired generators in Southern California, when it became evident that taking them off-line could lead to shortages in electrical power and potential blackouts.

Another is this year’s 180-degree flip on the petroleum industry. Newsom had spent months demonizing refiners for price-gouging, but when two refineries announced plans to shut down, raising the possibility of sharp gasoline price hikes, Newsom shifted to maintaining fuel supplies and encouraging oil production to stave off imports.

“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one’s naive about that,” Newsom said. “So it’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.”

Still another example is what happened just a few days ago in Southern California. After years of squabbling over carbon emissions from ships and equipment at the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the logistics industry and the regional air quality board appointed by Newsom reached a compromise.

The ports are a major source of emissions in the smog-sensitive region and the South Coast Air Quality Management District had been pressing them to shift from gasoline- and diesel-powered equipment to electricity. Cargo handlers complained that expensive retrofits could make the ports uncompetitive in global trade, potentially threatening thousands of jobs.

The agreement requires a three-phase, multi-year transition to zero-emission machinery, which disturbs environmental advocates and even some board members. Opponents who wanted immediate action chanted their displeasure and were removed from the meeting before the vote.

“The give-and-take of ideas and compromises in this process — it mirrors exactly what a real-world transition to zero emissions looks like,” said William Bartelson, an executive at the Pacific Maritime Association. “It’s practical, it’s inclusive and it’s grounded in shared goals.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111025-Newsom-Houston-JF-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-11 10:02:50.727783

Supernova PowerRing: Wallbox’s new modular fast-charging system, delivering up to 400 kW per outlet and scalable to 720 kW per site.

At its core, Supernova PowerRing is a connected system of multiple Supernova chargers, Wallbox’s family of fast DC chargers designed for public and semi-public use, that share energy intelligently between them. By pooling unused power across units, PowerRing aims to ensure that every outlet delivers optimal performance based on real-time demand. This architecture allows operators to make the most of their installed capacity while reducing idle energy and infrastructure costs.

Designed for real-world usage patterns, PowerRing dynamically distributes power across multiple charging points to optimize uptime, efficiency, and driver experience. Each setup can connect up to three Supernova units and six outlets, offering scalable installed capacities of 240, 480, or 720 kW to match the site’s specific needs.

“Operators need charging systems that make economic sense today while being ready for the future,” said Eduard Castañeda, Chief Product & Technology Officer at Wallbox. “Supernova PowerRing was designed to do exactly that, delivering flexibility, performance, and reliability, all within a remarkably compact footprint.”

The first phase of Supernova PowerRing introduces power sharing between units, allowing to dynamically allocate unused power where it’s needed most. This capability ensures greater uptime, reduces power limitations during peak demand, and maximizes the energy delivered across the site, all while simplifying infrastructure planning and installation.

In the following phases, PowerRing’s capabilities will continue to expand. The next evolution will allow power sharing even when one connector is already in use, offering greater flexibility for drivers and operators. At a later date, it will add intelligent power-sharing algorithms distributing energy across sites, optimizing performance, efficiency, and user experience.

Thanks to its compact design and scalable configuration, PowerRing can be installed in a wide range of environments, from urban retail centers and petrol stations to commercial parking sites. Its streamlined installation process also helps operators reduce deployment costs and accelerate time to market.

“Supernova PowerRing is designed to redefine how charging infrastructure can scale efficiently,” added Castañeda. “It allows operators to serve more drivers with less space, less cost, and less complexity, while maintaining a focus on charging speed and user experience.”

Supernova PowerRing is expected to begin rollout in phases as early as Q1 2026, beginning with Southern Europe, Benelux, and the UK/Ireland. Subsequent phases will expand into additional markets, including the United States, as Wallbox continues its global rollout of the platform.

Germany’s August 2025 auction was the first one in Germany to receive no bids, after interest had already waned in earlier rounds.
The auction marked the first time that investors paid for the right to build offshore wind parks in Germany.","Energy and wind power industry associations have urged changes to Germany’s 2026 auctions for offshore wind energy to overcome the sector’s stagnation. In a joint appeal, energy industry group BDEW, offshore wind power association BWO, engineering association VDMA and grid operators proposed to move the next auction from June 2026 to the end of next year. The delay would give bidders time to optimise their projects and prepare legal changes regarding investment conditions and spatial planning in Germany’s territorial waters.

“Fast action is needed to successfully continue offshore wind power expansion,” BDEW head Kerstin Andreae said. Germany’s August 2025 auction was the first one in Germany to receive no bids, after interest had already waned in earlier rounds. Andreae pointed at “increased power market risks and project financing costs” as reasons for the bidders’ restraint, and warned that “the results from 2025 must not be repeated.”

Stefan Thimm, head of offshore wind power group BWO, said “clear rules and fair investment conditions” were necessary, which could be achieved through a reformed auction design that includes contracts for difference (CfDs) and power purchase agreements (PPAs). Moreover, the BWO called for extending the operating license for offshore wind farms to 35 years and a gradual application of fees for delayed operation launches rather than the current sweeping cancellation of awards in case of delays.

In Summer 2023, oil majors BP and TotalEnergies pledged to pay a combined 12.6 billion in a German auction for the right to build offshore wind farms in the North and Baltic seas. The auction marked the first time that investors paid for the right to build offshore wind parks in Germany. In contrast, the latest auction received no bids, with industry saying that plans would put wind turbines in too close proximity of each other, so that the output would be significantly reduced due to shadowing effects. Other reasons included increased costs due to geopolitical tensions and supply chain bottlenecks, as well as volatile electricity markets.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-11-11 12:08:30.315362

As is common with many raw material contracts concluded in advance, both sides had agreed on a pricing mechanism based on current market prices.
Novonix had signed a supply agreement with VW’s battery subsidiary PowerCo at virtually the same time as Stellantis.
“Collectively, our offtake agreements with Stellantis, SK On, and Hiller Carbon supported our ongoing debt syndication,” explained Terence Cryan, Executive Chairman of Westwater Resources.
This is primarily due to challenging nickel market conditions and associated project financing constraints,” the statement said.","These involve agreements with Novonix and Westwater Resources for anode graphite and Alliance Nickel for nickel and cobalt. In the case of Alliance Nickel (formerly GME Resources), the deal dates back to a non-binding agreement from 2022, before a binding supply deal for a total of 170,000 tonnes of nickel sulphate and 12,000 tonnes of cobalt sulphate was signed in April 2023. The agreement with Novonix for 86,250 to 115,000 tonnes from the beginning of 2026, on the other hand, was signed just over a year ago.

On 4 November, however, Novonix announced that the supply contract with FCA US LLC (the US subsidiary of Stellantis) had been terminated by the customer ‘with immediate effect’. ‘Novonix and Stellantis were unable to agree on the specific specifications of the battery cell product and the milestones for mass production qualification,’ Novonix continued. As is common with many raw material contracts concluded in advance, both sides had agreed on a pricing mechanism based on current market prices.

Novonix also confirms that deliveries from the plant in Riverside near Chattanooga, Tennessee, were scheduled to begin on 1 January 2026, so the cancellation comes at fairly short notice. “While NOVONIX is disappointed with this decision, it remains focused on its deliveries for Panasonic and PowerCo and continuing to provide samples to 15 current and potential customers for battery and industrial applications,” the statement said. Novonix had signed a supply agreement with VW’s battery subsidiary PowerCo at virtually the same time as Stellantis.

Westwater speaks of ‘unexpected’ termination

On 7 November, Westwater Resources announced that FCA US LLC had “unexpectedly terminated its Binding Offtake Agreement with the Company dated July 17, 2024” on 3 November. Stellantis was one of three major customers with existing contracts, alongside Hiller Carbon and SK On. “Collectively, our offtake agreements with Stellantis, SK On, and Hiller Carbon supported our ongoing debt syndication,” explained Terence Cryan, Executive Chairman of Westwater Resources. “However, due to Stellantis’s unexpected termination, the debt syndication is now paused, although our engagement with EXIM and other government agencies regarding financing opportunities is ongoing. In response to these developments, we are focused on optimizing the Kellyton Plant to meet our current offtake commitments, which should reduce the total capital needed to complete Phase I.”

Westwater wanted to supply Stellantis from the Kellyton plant. According to Cryan, the processing capacity in the first phase will now be adjusted to the existing purchase agreements and available financial resources. In other words, the plant will be slightly smaller and the investment requirements will be reduced. “The Company expects to complete this optimization evaluation by the end of the year and plans to provide an update to the market in early 2026,” Westwater wrote. The contracts with SK On and Hiller Carbon remain valid. FCA has also signalled “they are open to reconsidering a new arrangement with the Company, any future agreement would be based on current market conditions.”

Also on 7 November, Australia’s Alliance Nickel announced that its contract with Stellantis (this time not FCA US LLC) had been terminated with effect from 3 December 2025. Assuming a one-month notice period, the termination is likely to have been announced on 3 November. However, prices or demand are not cited as the reason here; rather, the Australian company is likely to have failed to meet agreed milestones. “The termination arises from certain contractual milestone dates not being met rendering the existing agreement inoperative. This is primarily due to challenging nickel market conditions and associated project financing constraints,” the statement said.

Although it also states that Stellantis remains interested in the raw materials from Alliance Nickel’s NiWest project, the terms are to be renegotiated to ‘better reflect the revised project development schedule and market conditions,’ according to the Australians. In other words, deliveries will start later, and volumes and prices are likely to be lower.

“We understand the rationale for the Stellantis decision, and at the same time we recognise that this presents a good opportunity for both sides to negotiate on a new agreement which is more reflective of the revised project development timeline and forward strategy,” said Paul Kopejtka, Managing Director of the Alliance. “I firmly believe that the long-term outlook for nickel and cobalt remains positive.”

The fact is that Stellantis is planning to produce fewer electric cars globally than it did a few years ago and therefore needs fewer battery raw materials in the short term. Much of the specific data for the switch to a pure electric car portfolio for Stellantis brands has been watered down or scrapped, with combustion engines and hybrids set to remain on offer for longer. In the US market in particular, the mood has changed significantly from the BEV-friendly course under President Joe Biden (with subsidies for products and the establishment of US battery supply chains), and many subsidy projects are currently being halted under his successor, Donald Trump.

Her report highlighted progress across key areas, including circular economy, biodiversity, climate change mitigation, and sustainable urban development.

A central achievement was the creation of the Integrated Waste Management Agency (AGIR), designed to coordinate waste separation, collection, and utilization across the city. Álvarez said the agency will implement a new waste collection system starting in January 2026, as part of a broader effort to transition toward a circular economy. Programs such as Reciclatron and Mercado del Trueque were also reinforced, with Reciclatron collecting more than 280t of electronic and battery waste through 31 citywide events involving 17,000 participants and 528 institutions.

The city invested in green infrastructure and biodiversity, allocating MX$35 million to rehabilitate urban forests. Through the Green Blocks strategy, 821 neighborhoods with limited access to green spaces will benefit from restoration projects. In coordination with the Ministry of Works and Services (SOBSE), the city replaced diseased palm trees and planted 64 new native trees across several boroughs, with an additional MX$20 million designated for tree care and replacement.

Álvarez reported that residents recorded over 655,000 biodiversity observations through iNaturalist, including the discovery of a new firefly species in Chapultepec Forest, named through a public vote honoring María Sabina. The finding resulted from collaboration between SEDEMA and UNAM under the “BioBlitz” initiative.

To address the climate crisis, the ministry launched the Environmental Information System, a geointelligence platform for environmental data management. The Rain Harvest Program equipped 7,000 households in Coyoacan and Tlalpan with rainwater collection systems, solar heaters, and urban gardens to promote water security and energy savings.

Mexico City’s air quality improved with a 20% reduction in carbon monoxide, 13% in PM10, and 8% in nitrogen dioxide, leading to 22% more clean-air days in the Metropolitan Area. The city also exceeded its emission reduction goals, cutting 2.3Mt of CO₂e. The Ravines and Rivers Recovery Plan restored 14 ravines, removing more than 3,000t of solid waste with the help of 1,165 volunteers known as Guardians of the Ravines.

In sustainable development, SEDEMA processed over 600 environmental impact statements and 4,700 performance reports through a more efficient digital platform. The city also strengthened environmental regulation and updated key standards.

Mexico City maintained its international environmental leadership, participating in 64 global events and forming partnerships with governments and organizations from the Americas, Europe, and Asia.

Efforts to protect the city’s conservation land included recovering 201ha, protecting 479, and halting 215 illegal activities. As part of the Forest of Water strategy, 10 million native plants were distributed to restore watersheds.

However, genuine sustainability must start with each individual’s mindset and daily actions, from planting trees and flowers to embracing broader goals such as green transformation and green economy.","Hanoi (VNA) – The draft documents of the 14th National Party Congress emphasise environmental protection, effective climate change adaptation, and the promotion of a green and circular economy as central tasks alongside socio-economic development, reflecting the Party’s deep commitment to sustainable growth built on the three interlinked pillars of economy, society, and environment.

A key highlight of the draft is the elevation of environmental protection to a central mission alongside economic and social progress, signalling a new and comprehensive understanding of sustainability in the current context.

Harmonising economic growth with environmental protection, or safeguarding the environment to ensure sustainable economic development, is considered the cornerstone of lasting prosperity. From this perspective, the Party affirms that environmental protection is a central and inseparable task closely tied to economic and social development.

Vietnam’s policies and international commitments make clear that the transition toward a green, circular, and low-carbon economy is the pathway to sustainable development. It is essential to abandon short-term, profit-driven approaches that neglect environmental responsibilities and to remain steadfast in the principle of not sacrificing the environment for economic gain.

Commenting on the draft, Dr. Truong Ba kien, Deputy Director of the Centre for Meteorology and Climatology under the Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Climate Change at Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, emphasised that the inclusion of environmental protection and climate adaptation is both timely and necessary, aligning with Vietnam’s real-world challenges. He noted that proactive and effective adaptation to climate change is a trend that Vietnam must continue to pursue in the years ahead.

To enhance resilience to extreme weather and climate-related disasters, relevant agencies need to comprehensively upgrade real-time forecasting and early warning systems, integrating meteorological, hydrological, radar, and reservoir data. The use of AI, Big Data, and ensemble modelling will help detect hazardous weather patterns early. Multi-channel public alerts, regular drills, and inter-regional coordination mechanisms should also be strengthened.

In parallel, Vietnam should standardise and expand inter-reservoir operations, improve dam safety monitoring, and promote reforestation. Developing flood and landslide risk maps using satellite data and LiDAR technology will support evidence-based planning. Building green infrastructure such as water-absorbent urban systems, maintaining natural floodways, and ensuring data sharing across regions are also crucial to balancing development with watershed safety.

Localities are urged to integrate climate adaptation into regional and provincial planning, establish AI- and IoT-based early warning systems, and enhance climate risk management capacity for local authorities. Promoting nature-based and green development models and nurturing a culture of preparedness will help build safer, more resilient communities.

According to Dr. Mai Van Khiem, Director of the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, Vietnam must continue modernising its observation technologies, expanding monitoring networks, and applying artificial intelligence to improve forecasting accuracy, particularly for extreme weather events. He also underlined the need for clear, concise, and accessible communication to ensure early warnings reach vulnerable communities.

Strengthened coordination between meteorological agencies, local governments, disaster response units, and media outlets is vital to translating forecasts into effective action. Public education and training in disaster preparedness should be expanded, with climate and environmental awareness integrated into school curricula.

Le Thi Dinh, Secretary of Xuan Non hamlet Party Cell in Hanoi' Thu Lam commune, noted that recognising environmental protection as a core development pillar provides a new benchmark for all socio-economic policies. However, genuine sustainability must start with each individual’s mindset and daily actions, from planting trees and flowers to embracing broader goals such as green transformation and green economy. She also stressed the importance of environmental education at all levels to foster a “green living” consciousness among citizens, laying the groundwork for a sustainable and resilient future./.

The latest investment, from the Scottish National Investment Bank, Centrica, Goldman Sachs, KIRKBI and Mosaic Capital, brings total funding for Highview’s long-duration energy storage rollout to more than £500m.

The Hunterston phase one asset will deliver grid inertia, short circuit and voltage support services independently of the site’s storage system, helping alleviate grid stability issues and reduce wind curtailment in Scotland.

The stability island marks the start of Highview’s Millennium Series, which includes further 3.2GWh hybrid storage facilities planned across the UK. The next project in the series, a 300MWh liquid air energy storage facility at Carrington in Manchester, is already under construction.

Highview chief executive Richard Butland said: “This capital raise is an important milestone for Highview, enabling us to build out the first phase of our long duration energy facility at Hunterston. By delivering much-needed grid services in this location, our stability island asset will prevent costly curtailment and maximise the renewable energy that we generate in the UK.”

He added that the project “supports future Highview projects, as well as the UK’s wider green economy, driving skills development, job creation, and economic growth across the country.”

The Hunterston facility, located on the Peel Ports site in North Ayrshire, is expected to support 1,000 onsite jobs during construction and 650 in the wider supply chain. The stability island is scheduled to be operational by January 2028, with the full facility expected by 2030.

Scottish National Investment Bank chief investment officer Mark Munro said: “As Scotland scales its renewable energy production, it’s critical that grid resilience is fortified so that more of it can be used. Working in partnership with Highview, our investment in the development of this exciting project will deliver vital infrastructure to help ensure a more stable, clean energy future.”

Centrica group chief executive Chris O’Shea said: “Low carbon storage is an essential part of the solution for how we manage the energy system of the future, and Highview’s LDES system is the kind of innovative facility that is needed as the UK transitions to a more intermittent energy mix from renewables.”",https://renews.biz/media/35481/image-2048x1316.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-11-11 10:02:01.626655

At two solar farms in Texas, veterans are suiting up – not in their military uniforms, but in protective gear for beekeeping.

They’re tending hives as part of a partnership between solar developer Enel North America and Hives for Heroes. The nonprofit, founded by Steve Jimenez, helps veterans find healing and new purpose.

Jimenez: “Getting out of the Marine Corps … I felt like I came home very incomplete.”

But when he opened a beehive for the first time, everything changed.

Jimenez: “I felt like the weight of the world come off because I was focused on just one thing, which was these incredible little bees.”

Since 2018, his group has helped thousands of veterans get into beekeeping as a way to connect with one another, cope with anxiety and post-traumatic stress, and learn new skills.

Some vets become hobbyists, while others manage hives at businesses and other locations.

At the Texas solar farms, they tend hives near rows of solar panels. The bees pollinate wildflowers and other plants that grow under and around the panels and produce honey that the beekeepers harvest.

So the veterans are helping transform these solar farms into thriving landscapes – and finding meaning and purpose beyond the battlefield.

The package of three fiscal 2026 bills, which cleared the Senate Monday, contains both Democratic and Republican priorities and rejects most of the steep funding cuts sought by the Trump administration and House GOP lawmakers.

The bills are the product of months of negotiations, and neither side got everything it wanted. There are wins for conservatives, such as cuts to Department of Agriculture climate hubs, and wins for Democrats, including full funding for the Government Accountability Office.

Passage could set the tone for the rest of the fiscal 2026 spending cycle and create a pathway for more bipartisan spending bills — especially with both sides appearing eager to avoid another costly shutdown.

A promising sign emerged Monday, when Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), one of the loudest voices calling for funding reductions, said he was leaning in favor of the package.

It will be paired with a bill to reopen the government through Jan. 30 and a promise of a Senate vote on a Democratic bill to extend expiring health care subsidies.

Harris, chair of both the House Freedom Caucus and the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, told Fox News that despite the absence of sweeping cuts, he “would probably be a ‘yes’ vote” on the package assuming that the Senate passes it as is.

Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray (D-Wash.) touted the Democratic wins in the spending bills, even as she voted against proceeding to the package because of the lack of guaranteed health care reforms.

The three bills in the package, known as a “minibus,” are Agriculture-FDA, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said he was encouraging members to return to Washington immediately in anticipation of Senate passage.

Here are five takeaways from the bipartisan minibus that could head to President Donald Trump’s desk as soon as Wednesday.

Climate hub cuts

The negotiated Agriculture-FDA bill would slash funding for the USDA’s 10 climate hubs, which produce regional research and data on extreme weather, natural disasters and droughts to help farmers make informed decisions.

The office of Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced the cuts, but the scope of the reduction is unclear. The climate hubs are funded through an array of federal grant programs.

The cuts, endorsed by House Republicans, could hit regional climate hubs in the home states or districts of key members of Congress focused on agricultural issues.

One of the 10 hubs, for example, is in New Hampshire, home to Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan — two of the lead negotiators of the deal to end the shutdown.

Shaheen is also the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, meaning she signed off on the cuts. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.

Another one of the USDA climate hubs is located in the district of Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), a former chair of the House Agriculture Committee.

Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.), chair of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, represents a district with another climate hub.

So does Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), who co-chairs caucuses focused on disaster recovery and wildfire management. The district of Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa) also hosts a climate hub.

Appropriations leaders likely kept the House’s proposed climate hub cuts in the compromise Agriculture-FDA bill as a sweetener to help maintain Republican support for the full package. They similarly kept the GOP’s proposed reductions to programs focused on urban agriculture.

Support for water, conservation

The Agriculture-FDA bill supports a range of federal water and conservation programs.

Republicans have previously pushed to reduce some USDA conservation assistance for farmers. The Trump administration proposed cutting conservation funds by hundreds of millions of dollars.

The legislation contains about $1.4 billion to support the “revitalization of aging water and wastewater infrastructure,” according to a summary.

USDA’s Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations budget would get $50 million under the negotiated proposal. An additional $3 million would be set aside “for the rehabilitation of aging dam infrastructure to ensure safety and water access to rural communities,” the summary states.

About $10 million would go toward irrigation modernization to “alleviate challenges faced primarily in Western states.” That could include drought, fish and wildlife projects, and certain renewable energy production efforts, according to the bill report.

Many of those projects are funded through congressionally directed spending, more commonly known as earmarks.

Murray’s office said in a bill summary that the legislation “rejects President Trump’s senseless proposal to eliminate all discretionary funding” for conservation technical assistance grants, which are “a vital tool for farmers and ranchers.”

Appropriators included language in the bill report directing the Natural Resources Conservation Service to brief lawmakers “on how producers can utilize NRCS programs to exclude wildlife from farmland.”

Win for energy resilience

The Military Construction-Veterans Affairs bill would provide $730 million to a Pentagon resilience program that supports investments often targeted by Republican lawmakers.

The funds would go to the Energy Resilience Conservation Investment Program, which funnels federal dollars toward projects on military installations that “improve energy resilience, contribute to mission assurance, save energy, and reduce [the Department of Defense’s] energy costs,” according to DOD.

The Pentagon’s fiscal 2026 guidance for the program lists microgrids, battery storage and “renewable and/or clean energy generation systems” as possible targets, as well as nuclear and geothermal energy.

However, it’s unclear whether the agency will continue to direct the funds toward those priorities. The program guidance references Biden-era executive orders directing emissions reductions across the federal government. Trump repealed those orders when he took office.

Environmental cleanups

The minibus contains hundreds of millions of dollars for environmental remediation to counteract pollution from harmful “forever chemicals” and a major fuel spill.

Negotiators included House-passed language providing $50 million for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, cleanups above the level the Trump administration requested for fiscal 2026. In all, PFAS remediation efforts would get more than $100 million.

Appropriators are also providing $53.7 billion in fiscal 2026 funding for the Toxic Exposures Fund, which supports veterans sickened by exposure to burn pits. That is more than double the amount provided in fiscal 2025, according to a bill summary.

In a statement, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the House’s top Democratic appropriator, lamented that the bill does not include advance funding for the exposure fund for fiscal 2027. She objected to the release of the spending legislation Sunday absent a broader funding deal with Republicans.

CR details

The continuing resolution attached to the minibus would fund the rest of the government until the end of January, reopening federal agencies and jumpstarting programs that have been partially shuttered for more than a month.

Appropriators included language that would reverse the layoffs the Trump administration implemented during the ongoing shutdown, requiring agencies to rehire affected employees and pay them for the time they would have worked. It would bar the administration from dismissing more workers through the duration of the CR.

The stopgap contains extensions for a host of programs that lapsed Sept. 30, including the Defense Production Act and the National Flood Insurance Program. A bipartisan duo in the House introduced a bill, H.R. 5848, that would backdate the authorization for the NFIP to Sept. 30 and extend its authorization through the end of 2026.

The CR also has a number of funding provisions requested by the White House to ensure certain federal programs do not lapse or run out of funds for the duration of the funding patch.

That includes an extension of funding for wildfire management and an extension of up to $54 million in funding under EPA’s state and tribal assistance grants to maintain certain infrastructure projects.

Lawmakers added language to increase by $2.6 million the statutory funding ceiling on the Bureau of Reclamation’s Calfed Bay-Delta program, which supports ecosystem restoration, water supply management and levee integrity.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/91/43/62f1b8b54787a35f3c034067fa46/unlimiteduse-11-10-2025-capitol-hill-alex-kent-0017.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 08:59:28.945927

This expands the company’s activities beyond its existing campus in Nevada. According to Redwood, the facility will initially process approximately 20,000 tons of materials, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, from used lithium-ion batteries each year. The goal is to reduce dependency on imports and utilize secondary raw materials from domestic waste, equipment, and electric vehicles.

The new facility is an initial step in the development of the planned “Battery Materials Campus” in South Carolina. Redwood plans to build one of the world’s largest centers for the recovery, refinement, and manufacture of battery materials there. Over the next ten years, Redwood aims to further expand in South Carolina and create over 1,500 new jobs.

Redwood already operates one of the largest lithium-ion battery recycling facilities in North America, located in Nevada. According to the company’s figures, it processed over 60,000 tons of materials at the Nevada facility last year. This means that approximately 90 percent of the batteries processed in North America pass through Redwood’s facilities.

The project is in response to the United States’ heavy dependence on imports of critical raw materials. These materials often come from geopolitically unstable regions or countries with tense relations with the United States. The company aims to build a national reserve of raw materials and secure the domestic supply by recovering materials from existing products, such as electric vehicles. It is estimated that U.S. electric vehicles currently contain approximately 2.25 million tons of these metals.",https://battery-news.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2000x0.webp,N,,2025-11-11 10:03:07.145469

One reason that electricity bills were going up, they said, was because President Donald Trump was squelching efforts to expand renewable energy in the Garden State.

A little farther south, Jared Littmann won his race by taking a very different tack on climate and energy politics. The next mayor of Annapolis, Maryland, leaned into the existential crisis of global warming and highlighted its immediate dangers — such as how sea-level rise is contributing to frequent floods of his waterfront city.

“What I had been told is to de-emphasize it a little bit or not come out as my top priority,” Littmann said of climate change. “But it’s hard in Annapolis to not be focused on those issues.”

That approach sets Littmann apart from much of his party as Democrats look to build on their electoral successes of last week.

Increasingly, Democratic lawmakers and consultants are urging either a retreat from climate politics or a recasting of its message — even if that means risking a rift with the party faithful.

Caution about climate messaging appears to have informed the winning campaigns of Tuesday’s disparate field of Democratic victors, which included a democratic socialist in New York, a former CIA officer in Virginia and a Navy helicopter pilot in New Jersey.

Gone was former President Joe Biden’s talk of climate change as an “existential crisis.” One thing that united New York’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, Virginia’s Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and New Jersey’s Sherrill was a reluctance to mention climate change. Instead, they largely spoke of clean energy as a pocketbook issue.

These Democrats and others won their elections Tuesday “with a message of affordability — and I think that’s a pathway for us,” said Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, one of Congress’ fiercest climate hawks. “Regular people don’t like that crisis message.”

Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) took a similar view. It’s a winning strategy, he said, to talk about how clean energy investments can lower utility bills.

“I’m not sure having an overall conversation on climate change gets us there,” he added. “But if you could align the investments with the outcomes, I think you’d have a very good argument.”

That perspective is echoed by reports released recently by two centrist Democratic groups.

The reports argue that Democrats have lost elections in recent years because of the party’s hyperfocus on climate change. A voter who is struggling to pay bills, they say, doesn’t have the luxury to care about climate change.

The party’s focus on climate change has helped create a wedge between rich Democrats and working class voters who have drifted away from the party in recent elections, argues one report released last month by the centrist Democratic group WelcomePAC.

“Highly educated Democratic voters and affluent Democratic voters care more than the average American about issues like climate change, democracy, abortion, and identity and cultural issues—and less than the average American about issues like the cost of living, gas prices, border security, and crime,” the group concludes.

That echoes the claims of another centrist group, Searchlight Institute, which released a report in September that showed that even though almost 9 in 10 Democrats view climate change as a very serious problem, the vast majority of voters rank it way below affordability as their primary concern.

Climate messaging contributed to the notion that the party was disconnected from many voters, the report said.

“If the Democratic Party is going to shake the perception that they are focused on issues perceived as out-of-touch to most Americans,” the group concluded, “they’ll need a significant reset beyond just adding talk about lowering costs to climate messaging.”

Challenge for Democrats: Trump’s rhetoric

Not everyone on the left agrees, however, that a retreat from climate politics is the right approach. Some progressives maintain it’s still a potent issue and that last week’s election results proved the electorate was ready for more clean energy.

Among those making that case is Climate Power, an advocacy group co-founded by longtime Democratic insider John Podesta. It backed the idea that Trump’s attacks on renewable energy creates an opening for Democrats going into the 2026 midterm elections.

“To win in the midterms, Democratic candidates can proactively and relentlessly make the strong case that Trump and Republicans are raising electricity bills by gutting cheaper, reliable clean energy options,” the memo notes. “Democrats are fighting for more, less expensive electricity, while Republicans are taking power off the grid and raising costs on American families.”

While moderate Democrats have pointed to climate policy as one cause of past electoral losses, others say the real reason is because Trump and other Republicans frequently attack Democrats with misleading claims.

“Our opponents (Trump and the GOP) talk about climate change all the time—always using relentless disinformation to make Democrats look bad. You HAVE to have a plan for that or else you’re going to lose,” Genevieve Guenther, author of “The Language of Climate Politics,” wrote last week on BlueSky.

While in the White House, Biden signed into law one of the biggest climate laws in U.S. history — the Inflation Reduction Act with its $370 billion in clean energy spending. But he barely mentioned it in the final stretch of his 2024 campaign before he dropped out of the race. And he wasn’t alone; former Vice President Kamala Harris all but ignored climate and clean energy in her 107-day campaign.

But politics abhors a vacuum. As top Democrats backed away from speaking about climate policy, Republicans leaned into it.

During the 2024 campaign, Trump attacked Harris and Biden’s plans to increase clean energy at virtually every rally, frequently calling it the “Green New Scam” and falsely claiming they slowed oil and gas production, when it in fact reached record levels of production in the administration.

As Harris and Biden dialed back discussion of climate policy, Trump framed it as a cost driver, a key piece of the price spikes that occurred throughout the economy during the Biden administration as the world recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic.

“To further defeat inflation, my plan will terminate the Green New Deal, which I call the Green New Scam,” Trump said last September in the closing weeks of the presidential race.

“It actually sets us back, as opposed to moves us forward,” he added.

Trump’s efforts to paint climate policy as a burden were backed by conservative media. Fox News, whose commenters routinely distort climate science and typically align with Trump on the issue, ran more news segments on climate change than any other network except CNN in 2024, according to researchers at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

CNN ran 1,078 segments on climate change, while Fox — the nation’s top-watched news station — ran 332. In fact, Fox covered climate more than all of the other stations, including CBS, ABC, NBC, PBS and MSNBC combined, which altogether ran a total of 326 segments on climate in 2024, the researchers found.

Several Democrats said they don’t want to cede the issue to Republican misinformation and argued that ignoring climate change won’t win back voters.

Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old Democratic House candidate in Illinois, said she’s not backing away from climate policy. Abughazaleh is running in a crowded race in the 9th District, which includes Chicago’s northern suburbs, though some polling shows her near the top of the pack.

Her campaign strategy has centered around issues that motivate young voters, particularly those with concerns around the Trump’s administration’s immigration crackdown.

She said voters of her generation want to hear candidates address climate change and argued that politicians who avoid the topic are “doing a disservice to the people they want to represent.”

“Climate change is an existential issue,” she said. “I’m part of the generation where, when we’re asked what we want to do when we grow up, we have to think about climate change, where we’re going to live, what we want to do, how it’s going to impact us.”

For other Democrats, such as Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, climate change has already helped them win multiple elections. Other blue-state Democrats, including Schatz and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, have won victories by centering their message on climate.

Casten said Democrats should continue talking about the consequences of fossil fuel consumption and that the new focus on affordability creates a political opportunity. He said it can help voters understand that it is possible to reduce utility costs by building a stronger and more resilient grid with clean energy that’s not subject to the volatility of oil and gas prices.

At the same time, he said lawmakers have a duty to lead on climate policy — and not just follow the polls.

“If something is hugely important and it doesn’t poll well, and so you don’t talk about it, you’re implicitly saying that you’re not really cut out for leadership,” Casten said. “How this polls is the least important question.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/50/cb/f372a0e04b5cbc7899c64189f556/election-2025-governor-new-jersey-66441.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 08:59:32.563219

Recently, I received an email from Linda, who read one of my recent energy op-eds. “Dr. McNees,” she wrote, “my electric bill jumped 30% this year. Can you explain what’s happening? I’m on a fixed income and genuinely scared about next winter.” Her question captures what millions of Americans are asking as they open their utility bills.

The answer isn’t simple, but it’s not a mystery either. Your electricity bill is caught in a perfect storm of surging demand, rising fuel costs and infrastructure failures that utilities pass directly to consumers. The good news? There are real solutions, some you can implement today, others that require smarter policy choices.

The AI revolution needs your electricity

Let’s start with demand. Data centers powering artificial intelligence are devouring electricity at unprecedented rates. The Electric Power Research Institute estimates data centers could consume up to 9% of US electricity by 2030, double today’s consumption.

When ChatGPT answers your question, it’s using electricity. When your company adopts AI tools, they’re competing with your home for the same power grid.

Electric vehicles and heat pumps add to the squeeze. Every EV charging in a garage, every home swapping gas furnaces for electric heat pumps, they’re all pulling from the same strained system.

This isn’t bad, it’s progress. But progress without adequate planning means higher bills.

Natural gas isn’t cheap anymore

Your bill’s biggest killer might be what you can’t see: the fuel that generates your electricity. Natural gas prices are expected to rise significantly between 2024 and 2026 as American producers ship more overseas.

When Europe needed alternatives to Russian gas, U.S. liquefied natural gas exports surged. Great for geopolitics and American producers, brutal for your monthly budget.

Natural gas generates roughly 40% of America’s electricity. When fuel costs spike, utilities don’t absorb the difference; they forward the invoice to you.

Your grid Is falling apart

Infrastructure costs are the silent tax on your electric bill. Seventy percent of transmission lines are over 25 years old and approaching the end of their typical 50 to 80 year lifecycle, reports the Department of Energy. The average age of all installed infrastructure is about 40 years old.

Wildfires, hurricanes and ice storms each reveal infrastructure vulnerabilities that cost money to repair and more money to prevent next time. Every dollar eventually appears on customer bills, whether you live in disaster zones or not.

The renewable solution nobody talks about loud enough

Here’s what the energy industry doesn’t want you to understand: renewable energy plus storage is now dramatically cheaper than fossil fuels. In 2024, solar photovoltaics were on average 41% cheaper than the lowest cost fossil fuel alternatives, while onshore wind projects were 53% cheaper, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

But renewable energy alone won’t cut your bill. You need storage. Solar panels generate power during the day when demand is lower. Batteries store cheap daytime electricity for evening peaks when prices spike.

States building renewable energy plus storage today are positioning themselves for lower electricity costs tomorrow.

What you can do right now

You can’t control fuel prices or utility decisions, but you’re not helpless. Here’s your practical winter survival guide.

Seal the leaks. Air leaks waste 20% to 30% of energy used for heating, according to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.

Weatherstripping costs under $20 and takes minutes to install.

Program your thermostat. Every degree you lower heating saves 1% on bills. A programmable thermostat automatically reduces temperature when you’re sleeping or away, potentially saving up to 10% annually, according to the Department of Energy.

LED bulbs everywhere. If you haven’t switched every bulb to LED, you’re donating money to your utility. LEDs use 75% less energy than incandescent bulbs and last 25 times longer. The upfront cost pays back in months.

Chargers, cable boxes, printers and devices draw power even when “off.” Smart power strips cut phantom load automatically. The average home wastes 5% to 10% annually powering devices nobody’s using.

Check time of use rates. Many utilities offer lower rates during off-peak hours. Running dishwashers, washing machines and EV chargers overnight could cut costs by 5% to 10%.

Insulation pays back. Attics lose the most heat in winter. Adding insulation typically costs one to four dollars per square foot and cuts heating costs 15 to 20%. Some utilities may offer rebates that cover part of the expense.

Community solar programs. Can’t install rooftop panels? Community solar lets you buy into larger installations and receive credits on your bill. No installation costs, no roof required, just lower monthly payments.

The policy fight that actually matters

Individual action helps, but real relief requires policy changes. Congress eliminated renewable energy tax credits while electricity demand explodes; it’s like canceling road construction during a traffic jam.

Smart policy would restore tax credits for renewable energy and storage projects; streamline permits for all energy infrastructure, including solar, wind, nuclear and natural gas; upgrade transmission lines to move cheap power from where it’s generated to where it’s needed and support utilities shifting to fixed infrastructure charges instead of volatile fuel-based pricing.

Your next winter bill depends on choices made today

Electricity bills are rising because we’re asking a 40-year-old system to handle 21st-century demand using fuel with rollercoaster pricing. The solution isn’t returning to the past; it’s building the infrastructure that makes energy abundant and affordable.

Renewable energy plus storage delivers cheaper electricity. It’s not ideology, it’s math. States embracing this transition will see lower bills. States clinging to fossil fuel dependence will watch costs climb as global markets set prices.

This winter, weatherstrip your doors, program your thermostat and check time-of-use rates. But don’t stop there. Tell your representatives that energy policy should prioritize what lowers bills, not what sounds good in a campaign ad.

Your neighbor’s 40% increase isn’t the new normal unless we accept it. The technology exists to generate abundant, affordable electricity. The only question is whether we’ll deploy it fast enough to prevent next winter’s bill from being even worse.

Technology Overview and Environmental Impact

The assessment, conducted in November 2025, evaluated Anaphite’s dry coating platform against conventional wet coating processes used in battery electrode manufacturing. Traditional wet coating requires substantial energy for drying electrodes and relies on chemical-intensive processes that contribute significantly to the carbon footprint of lithium-ion cell production.

Anaphite’s patented technology platform combines all key ingredients of a battery electrode into a single, engineered dry powder that eliminates wet processing lines. This approach removes the energy-intensive drying stage entirely while reducing chemical usage throughout the manufacturing process.

Market Context and Scaling Requirements

Global battery demand is projected to double by 2030, driven primarily by electric vehicle adoption. With EV market growth accelerating, manufacturers face mounting pressure to decarbonize production processes while scaling capacity rapidly.

Key market drivers include:

Regulatory compliance: EU Battery Regulation requires mandatory carbon footprint disclosure from 2027 via ISO-compliant Life Cycle Assessment

Production efficiency: Wet coating creates bottlenecks due to enormous ovens required for drying electrodes at scale

Market access: Battery makers producing cells exceeding CO₂ thresholds may face market restrictions and fines in key regions

Manufacturing Process Advantages

The dry coating process delivers carbon savings by eliminating the most energy-intensive stage of electrode production. When wet coating is completely replaced by Anaphite’s technology for every cell made in 2025, the analysis indicates potential savings exceeding 7 million tonnes of CO₂-eq.

This approach directly addresses the infrastructure limitations of traditional wet coating, which requires massive industrial drying equipment that constrains production scalability and drives operational costs.

Last week’s elections were a setback, but not a devastating one:

New Jersey is still a blue state, and while Virginia went red four years ago, it’s been trending Democratic for more than a decade.

Republicans also fared poorly in Pennsylvania, however, an all-important presidential battleground. Democrats even made inroads deep into the South, taking two state senate seats in Mississippi—ending a GOP supermajority—and picking up city council spots in South Carolina and Florida.

With results like these, the Republicans’ razor-thin majority in Congress won’t survive the midterm elections a year from now.

And that means the Trump administration, which came roaring back to power in January, will face implacable legislative opposition in its final two years. Decisions the president makes now will determine not only the Republican Congress’s fate and how his own last years in office play out, but also whether the GOP goes into 2028 prepared to hold onto the White House.

With the stakes the highest they will ever be, Trump has to focus on voters’ most basic measure of happiness: the state of the economy. Is 3 percent annual inflation satisfactory, or does that make Americans feel like Joe Biden never left?

Beef prices are well above the inflation rate, and while home prices are rising more slowly than inflation, the elevated interest rates needed to keep inflation under control make taking on the debt to buy a house more burdensome. To address the latter, the administration has floated the idea of creating 50-year mortgages, as if what Americans really want is to spend an extra two decades paying off a home with lower payments month by month.

A half-century mortgage would turn homebuyers into something closer to renters, with their banks as their landlords—only maintenance and home repairs won’t be the landlord’s responsibility, they’ll be the mortgagor’s.

That’s not the American dream. That’s 21st-century serfdom: laboring for a lifetime without owning property of your own free and clear.

The president wants the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates even at the risk of sparking more inflation, in the hopes a growth boom fueled by easy credit will generate real prosperity that outstrips the rise in prices.

He’s even promising to send Americans $2,000 stimulus checks as “dividends” from tariff revenue. That, too, would give an impetus to inflation.

Yet the administration is making some wise moves, including opening parts of the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for resource development. With China aggressively using its rare-earth metals as leverage in trade negotiations, the need for America to develop its own natural resources is urgent.

Even the Barack Obama administration reaped the benefits of expanding domestic energy production during the fracking boom. Escalating electricity bills, which voters associate with the rush to build new AI data centers, are one source of Americans’ present discontents, and that’s all the more reason for the administration to prioritize energy and natural resources.

Paring back regulation is one step in that direction—but extracting and refining rare-earth metals and other valuable commodities is a messy business. The answer is to make research and development of cleaner processing methods a priority alongside cutting red tape.

Can the artificial intelligence industry that contributes to the problem of higher energy costs also bring about breakthroughs that provide a solution? That’s a question the administration should be asking Big Tech.

America supplies the conditions that AI needs to flourish—and AI has to start reciprocating, providing the nation with new means to prosper, sooner rather than later.

Trump’s tariffs have given American companies powerful incentives for developing industry at home—and they’ve given foreign nations reason to invest here to secure better trade terms with the administration.

The next step is to build up advanced industrial capacity in the sectors we need most, starting with energy and environmental protection to be achieved through technology that aids development, rather than regulatory bureaucracy that holds it back. Not only will well-paid new jobs spring up quickly, as they did when fracking techniques first matured, but more energy will make possible more economic activity of all kinds, a virtuous cycle of growth and technological improvement.

That approach promises to generate real-world returns that will not only overcome the ill effects of inflation but also lower prices for everything, as production methods become more efficient and are made cheaper by abundant energy.

“Drill, baby, drill” were some of Trump’s favorite words on the campaign trail last year.

But they also imply “learn, baby, learn” and “build, baby, build,” with science supporting energy, energy supporting industry, and industry turning science into applications.

Financial finagling, whether in the form of 50-year mortgages or tariff stimulus checks, isn’t the answer—a rebirth of industry, enabled by American energy, is what the nation needs.

This commercial achievement has yet to translate into soft power for China.
America has historically served as the crucible for automotive brands.
Consumer reviews of BYD vehicles are mixed: praise for features and price, criticism for quality issues and service.
Germany and Japan built automotive soft power without negative national reputations weighing them down.","In the first few decades of automotive history, the motor car was arguably the most visible, most visceral expression of national character a country could export. A car conferred more soft power on its country of origin than any other consumer product.

In the early 20th century, the ability to mass-produce cars was shorthand for national modernity and industrial prowess. Henry Ford’s assembly line didn’t just democratize transportation — it announced America’s arrival as an economic superpower. When Model Ts rolled off production lines in Detroit, they carried with them a narrative of American ingenuity, efficiency, and the promise of mobility for the masses. Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Chrysler reinforced this message. To drive an American car was to participate in the American century.

As the industry matured, soft power shifted from the mere capacity to build cars to the ability to build exceptional ones. German manufacturers transformed automotive engineering into a form of national expression. Mercedes-Benz didn’t just make reliable vehicles; it made vehicles that embodied precision, quality, and meticulous attention to detail — qualities that became synonymous with German manufacturing. BMW promised driving pleasure engineered to exacting standards. Even the advertising was instructive: Audi’s “Vorsprung durch Technik” tagline worked because it tapped into established perceptions.

Italy contributed its own narrative through Ferrari and Lamborghini — cars that weren’t merely fast but beautiful — transforming automotive design into an art form.

More recently, Japan and South Korea have demonstrated that relative newcomers can still leverage automobiles for soft power. Toyota and Honda overcame initial skepticism about Japanese quality to become global standards for reliability, before Lexus and Acura showed the country could create genuine luxury, too. Hyundai and Kia followed a similar trajectory, moving from budget alternatives to credible competitors. These brands didn’t just succeed commercially — they reshaped perceptions of their countries’ capabilities, showcasing prowess in both mass production and quality engineering.

Going by these historical patterns, China should be harvesting enormous soft power from the success of BYDiBYDBYD Auto is a Chinese carmaker that became the world’s leading EV manufacturer in 2023, competing with Tesla for market share and global attention.READ MORE.

Early this year, BYD overtook Tesla to become the world’s leading manufacturer of electric vehicles. Its cars now populate streets from Bangkok to São Paulo. Their popularity isn’t confined to the global south: In September, BYD sold 11,271 vehicles in the U.K. — an astonishing 880% surge over the previous year, making the country its largest market outside China. These are the numbers of a genuine automotive giant.

This commercial achievement has yet to translate into soft power for China.

BYD’s vehicles may be everywhere, but the brand lacks Tesla’s cultural cachet — even though Elon Musk’s political adventures have been eroding it. The overall impression is that people buy BYD because it offers compelling value, not because the brand is cool and aspirational.

Can BYD eventually attain that status? Will it do for China what Ford did for the U.S., Mercedes for Germany, and Ferrari for Italy?

Color me skeptical, and for several reasons.

Start with the most fundamental: the ability to manufacture automobiles is no longer a rare or impressive feat. In Henry Ford’s day, mass-producing cars signaled membership to an elite club of industrialized nations. Today, that club includes dozens of countries across multiple continents. Turkey makes cars. India makes cars. Morocco makes cars. The achievement that once conferred prestige has become commonplace. Simply building vehicles — even building them well and building them cheaply — carries little reputational advantage.

Electrification does not provide the differentiating factor it might have a decade ago. As EVs have moved from novelty to ubiquity, they’ve shed their mystique. They’re becoming just cars — with different power trains, yes, but cars nonetheless. The technology has been demystified. BYD has demonstrated genuine innovation in battery technology, particularly with its Blade batteries, which deserve recognition. But battery chemistry, however sophisticated, doesn’t capture imaginations the way a beautifully designed vehicle would.

Then there’s the problem of being untested in the automobile’s ultimate proving ground: BYD is effectively barred from the American market by Trump’s 100% tariffs. This matters far beyond the lost sales volume. America has historically served as the crucible for automotive brands. Japanese manufacturers earned their reputations by competing directly with Ford and Chevrolet in Detroit’s backyard.

Honda and Toyota proved they could satisfy America’s demanding consumers; that validation conferred global legitimacy. Korean brands followed the same path. Success in America signals that a brand can succeed anywhere. BYD has no access to this test. While it can point to impressive sales from Mexico City to Munich, it cannot claim validation in the market that still defines automotive prestige. There’s very little the company can do to change this situation, but the absence creates a permanent asterisk next to its achievements.

Perhaps most importantly, BYD carries the considerable baggage of China’s negative reputation. This manifests in two distinct ways. First, there’s the quality perception. Despite China’s evolution into a sophisticated manufacturing hub, “Made in China” still suggests affordability rather than excellence. The 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer found that global trust in Chinese brands stands at just 30%, down from 33% a decade earlier. Compare that with 62% for German brands or 64% for Canadian ones.

Consumer reviews of BYD vehicles are mixed: praise for features and price, criticism for quality issues and service. The slow app upgrade in January — which left thousands of Chinese drivers stranded during the morning rush hour — didn’t help. The company announced the recall of 115,000 cars last month, citing design and battery-safety issues.

Second, there are the political associations. Germany and Japan built automotive soft power without negative national reputations weighing them down. When Japanese cars arrived in America in the 1970s, consumers didn’t associate Japan with aggressive territorial expansion or geopolitical menace. China faces a fundamentally different environment. Concerns about human rights in Xinjiang, the crackdown in Hong Kong, and bellicose diplomatic posturing create powerful headwinds that BYD must navigate. Fair or not, these associations affect consumer perceptions.

Other Chinese brands demonstrate the challenge. Huawei dominates telecommunications. Lenovo controls the PC market, after purchasing IBM’s share. Alibaba and Tencent are technology giants. TikTok has captured a generation of users. Yet with the possible exception of TikTok among teenagers, none of these brands have achieved aspirational status. They’re ubiquitous without being cool. Notably, TikTok systematically underplays its Chinese origins — a telling strategy that suggests even its creators understand the reputational challenge.

Clearly, product success alone cannot generate soft power for China. Japanese and Korean automakers overcame initial quality skepticism through decades of consistent excellence, transforming perceptions in the process. But they operated in a more favorable environment, without the political complications that shadow Chinese brands today. The trust deficit isn’t primarily about product quality — it’s about the country behind the product.

BYD has genuine technological achievements and formidable scale. With revenue surpassing $107 billion in 2024, it has demonstrated impressive capabilities. But achievement doesn’t automatically confer soft power. That requires making people want what you represent, not merely what you sell. It requires brands people aspire to own, not just ones they can afford to buy. It requires proving excellence in markets that matter most. And it requires that the country behind the brand doesn’t repel the consumers it hopes to attract.

The road from commercial success to cultural influence runs longer than sales charts suggest. BYD is driving fast. But until it transforms from a practical choice to a desirable one, from affordable to aspirational, from successful to admired, its impressive figures won’t translate into the soft power that shapes global perceptions of China.",https://restofworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2154481266-scaled-e1762522886342-1600x900.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 11:10:29.447887

President Trump has called climate change a hoax.
Worldwide, renewable energy is growing rapidly, with China leading on production and manufacturing of renewable energy technology.","Countries are gathering in Brazil at the COP30 summit to take stock of climate change. As in past summits, the negotiations are starting on the back foot: countries already aren't meeting their goals to cut heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels.

The world has barely budged in its efforts to combat climate change compared to one year ago, according to a new report from the United Nations. If countries stay on that track, the planet will warm by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, compared to the pre-industrial temperatures of the mid-1800s. That's slightly better than projections made last year, which showed 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming – but much of that progress could soon be cancelled out by the U.S.

The Trump Administration is not sending any high-level officials to the COP30 talks, according to a statement from the White House. On President Trump's first day in office, he announced he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, the landmark deal made in 2015 among the world's nations to combat climate change. The U.S. had been instrumental in negotiating that agreement, which seeks to limit warming by 2100 to a key threshold: 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

Beyond that level of warming, scientific research shows climate change impacts become dramatically more damaging. Storms will produce more extreme rainfall, causing more dangerous flooding. Hurricanes get more intense. Heat waves reach more dangerous temperatures. Vulnerable ecosystems, like coral reefs, stand little chance at surviving.

The world is very likely to hit 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next decade, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. To stop the planet from getting even hotter by the end of the century, emissions would need to fall 55% by 2035, compared to 2019 levels. If countries follow through on their current pledges to cut emissions, they'd only fall 12% by 2035.

In the U.S., emissions from burning fossil fuels have declined recently, as aging coal power plants have closed and more solar and wind power has been installed. Renewable power projects are now cheaper than new fossil fuel power plants.

President Trump has called climate change a hoax. His administration now seeks to boost fossil fuels, rolling back tax credits for solar energy and cancelling offshore wind power projects. One study found that such measures will slow U.S. emissions cuts, which were expected to fall 38-56% by 2035, but now may only decline by 26-35%.

""I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders at the United National General Assembly in September.

Worldwide, renewable energy is growing rapidly, with China leading on production and manufacturing of renewable energy technology. More than 90% of new energy projects installed globally in 2024 were renewable. Energy experts say those economic forces will continue the expansion of clean energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But without stronger moves by governments to reduce fossil fuel use, those declines may still not be fast enough.

Thanks to the agreement with Glenfarne, Baker Hughes will supply the main refrigerant compressors for the Alaska LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the North Slope gas treatment plant. The tech company has also committed to a strategic investment to support the LNG project.

“Baker Hughes is pleased to support Alaska LNG with our gas technology solutions,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman & CEO of Baker Hughes. “Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market.”

The agreements were announced at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., with Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan in attendance.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in American history. He sees the investment announcement as an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the country’s energy security.

“American LNG is not just an energy source, it’s a strategic asset that powers our economy, strengthens our alliances, and secures our nation’s future,” stated Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “By forging this strategic alliance and investment in the Alaska LNG Project, we’re strengthening our nation’s energy security while advancing a bold vision for U.S. energy independence and global competitiveness.“

The Alaska LNG project is being developed in two phases to accelerate project execution. Phase One comprises an 807-mile pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope. Worley is expected to complete final engineering and cost analysis for the pipeline in December, leading to a final investment decision (FID) on this phase of the project.

After that, Phase Two of the project will see the addition of the LNG terminal and related infrastructure to enable 20 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG export capability. FID for this stage is expected in late 2026.

Since becoming the lead developer of Alaska LNG in March, Glenfarne has secured offtake agreements with JERA, POSCO, CPC, PTT, and most recently, Tokyo Gas.

Before founding AFPI, Rollins led the Texas Public Policy Foundation, another powerful political organization group that, among other conservative initiatives, has funded efforts to block wind and solar development.
Even McPherson-Smith, who provided opening remarks at the summit, briefly served as executive director of Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council and deputy assistant to the president.","Dozens of people packed into a ballroom at the glitzy Waldorf Astoria in Washington in mid-October for a “who’s who” of the conservative energy world.

For those in attendance, the America First Policy Institute’s (AFPI) Global Energy Summit simultaneously served as a victory rally for the group’s successes, a homecoming for some of its main stars and a warning cry of the threat it believes environmentalists pose to basic liberties.

That dual sense of triumphalism and foreboding danger was on display from the onset of the event.

“Around the world, governments are abusing an increasingly thin patina of environmentalism to push policies that further and further encroach on the freedoms of everyday citizens,” said Oliver McPherson-Smith, AFPI’s vice chair of energy and environment, in opening remarks.

McPherson-Smith’s dire language is nothing new for the conservative think tank, founded in 2021 in the wake of President Donald Trump’s election loss to Joe Biden.

AFPI has previously derided what it describes as “apocalyptic rhetoric” about the climate, which it says the Biden administration used as “justification for its sweeping radical agenda and massive government expansion.”

But to attendees at last month’s gathering, Trump’s return to office has brought nothing short of salvation.

“AFPI is proud of the many America-First policies advanced by the administration and cabinet officials,” Ellis said, “including policies to reverse the prior administration’s reliability-destroying subsidies for solar and wind energy and the America-last ban on U.S. LNG exports.”

Examples of that agenda were on full display as a star-studded roster of speakers, including Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, detailed the administration’s fight against what it sees as anti-energy, anti-prosperity policies.

The two officials highlighted a mid-October effort to tank what would have been the first global carbon tax. A United Nations body, the International Maritime Organization, was on the precipice of approving rules that would have created a net-zero framework and a cap on greenhouse gas emissions from shipping vessels. Ships exceeding those limits would need to purchase carbon credits or be subjected to additional fees.

“‘It’s a foregone conclusion,’” Wright recalled hearing from one foreign energy minister whose country planned to vote for the measure.

A draft of the framework was overwhelmingly approved in April, with 63 countries voting in favor and only 16 voting against, alongside 24 abstentions—despite the U.S. abandoning negotiations.

But months of pressure from Trump led to a drastic swing in countries’ support for the measure. According to reporting by climate newsroom Grist, the administration threatened countries with tariffs, visa restrictions, sanctions and additional port fees unless they opted to abandon the deal.

Those efforts paid off in October. With the support of the U.S. and other nations, Saudi Arabia successfully introduced a proposal to postpone adoption of the net-zero framework until October 2026—this time with 57 countries voting in favor of postponement and 49 countries voting against it, with 21 abstentions.

“I will tell you that the ‘it’s going to happen’ crowd were very disappointed,” Wright said at AFPI’s summit. “That’s because of your support, your belief, your commitment to this stuff … and helping to elect President Trump and the cabinet he picked.”

For AFPI’s supporters, the Trump administration’s aggressive action on energy and the environment is no accident, but rather the culmination of meticulous preparation for the president’s second term.

In its 2022 policy book, dubbed “The America First Agenda,” AFPI rejected the “false premise that environmental progress and prosperity are antithetical goals.”

Yet it also argued that many bedrock environmental laws may need “modernization” to spur greater economic growth—including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act.

AFPI has also called for an end to “outsized subsidies” of renewable energies, suggested that the Inflation Reduction Act is a threat to national security and pushed for increased fossil fuel production.

Just 10 months into his second term in office, Trump is already delivering on many of those goals.

Trump secured what critics describe as a giveaway for the fossil fuel industry in his signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act, mandating lease sales for oil and gas drilling while slashing incentives for wind and solar development.

The administration is also aiming to reverse the EPA’s key finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health, which serves as the basis for its ability to regulate emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations.

And companies have merely needed to email the EPA to request exemptions from Clean Air Act regulations that limit toxic emissions from facilities like coal-fired power plants.

In May, AFPI said that the Trump administration had enacted or advanced over 86 percent of the organization’s agenda in its first 100 days.

A spokesperson for AFPI declined to answer questions asking what the group attributes its success to in achieving so many of its goals. But the answer appears to stem, in part, from AFPI’s deep ties within Trump’s inner circle.

The group was known last year as Trump’s administration-in-waiting, with the New York Times writing shortly before the election that the group was poised to be even more influential than the Heritage Foundation’s infamous Project 2025.

A year later, those predictions appear to have come true.

Rollins, who appeared at last month’s summit alongside Wright, is the co-founder and former president and CEO of AFPI. Rollins now serves on Trump’s cabinet as the agriculture secretary, despite having no substantial professional experience with agricultural policy.

Before founding AFPI, Rollins led the Texas Public Policy Foundation, another powerful political organization group that, among other conservative initiatives, has funded efforts to block wind and solar development.

Scores of other key administration officials have ties to AFPI, ranging from EPA administrator Lee Zeldin, who chaired the group’s China Policy Initiative and led its “Pathway to 2025” voter drive, to Kevin Hassett, a former AFPI board member now serving as National Economic Council Director.

Even McPherson-Smith, who provided opening remarks at the summit, briefly served as executive director of Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council and deputy assistant to the president. He previously worked as a senior fellow at AFPI, and then as the director of its Center for Energy & Environment, according to his LinkedIn profile.

According to reporting by the New York Times, AFPI’s ties to the fossil fuel industry stretch back to its inception. Rollins, along with Linda McMahon—who would go on to chair Trump’s transition team and serve as education secretary—sought the help of Tim Dunn, a billionaire and Texas oil tycoon, to found the organization in preparation for a second Trump term.

Now, five years later, they—and the fossil fuel industry—are reaping the fruits of their labor.

“We’re living in a moment in history that will be written about, remembered, and talked about for 500, maybe a thousand more years,” Wright said. “There is no doubt in my mind. And we are all part of that moment.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2243832560-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 07:01:40.636953

Most of the group’s reefs, Lightbody said, are about 400 feet long and contain 200 tons of oyster shells.
The site attracts student tour groups and other visitors, making it an ideal place to educate the public about coastal restoration.
“Too often, you see a lot of these coastal projects that happen totally off somewhere in the distance,” Parfait said.
Small-scale coastal restoration projects, such as the oyster reef, are one piece of a statewide effort that has led to the investment of billions of dollars into safeguarding Louisiana’s coastline.","Along a stretch of marsh at the edge of the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana, Cajun boatmen ferried 200 tons of oyster shells to where the wetlands meet the gulf. Members of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana and volunteers stood on hills of oyster shells, loading the shells into buckets before packing them into wirework containers called gabions. They then lowered the gabions into the water to form an artificial reef.

The shells had quite a journey before returning to the salty ocean from which they came: They were recycled from restaurants in Louisiana’s two largest cities, New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Today, that oyster reef sits in the waters off Cocodrie, a 300-person fishing community whose name comes from the Cajun French word for alligator.

CRCL’s reef is just one example of Louisiana’s extensive coastal restoration efforts, which are necessary acts of stewardship in a landscape disappearing faster than almost anywhere in the world. On some parts of the coastline, land is receding so rapidly that the equivalent of a football field is lost every 100 minutes. With the recent cancellation of two extensive restoration projects that were funded mostly with Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement money, small-scale efforts are perhaps more important than ever.

Fiona Lightbody, who coordinates the oyster recycling program at CRCL, stood on a dock overlooking Terrebonne Bay as she explained the twofold benefit of the oyster reef: It will replenish the marsh’s ecosystem while also slowing down land loss.

“The reef is there to grow oysters, but also to prevent the wave energy from hitting the marsh edge and eating away at the soil, which would then disrupt the roots and cause the plants to float away,” she said. “By slowing that wave energy, the reef creates a nice little safe zone for invertebrates and other creatures to thrive, and it slows the erosion.”

In addition to planting cypress forests and other native plants to revitalize coastal ecosystems, CRCL has built eight oyster reefs since the shell recycling program was founded in 2014. Most of the group’s reefs, Lightbody said, are about 400 feet long and contain 200 tons of oyster shells.

The organization built this particular reef at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, or LUMCON, a research facility at one of the southernmost points in the state. The site attracts student tour groups and other visitors, making it an ideal place to educate the public about coastal restoration.

To build the oyster reef, CRCL collaborated with the Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw, a conglomerate of Native American tribes who have dwelled along the Gulf Coast for millennia. The idea behind the oyster reef came from an age-old process: Putting oyster shells back into the environment from which they came is something that Indigenous Americans and oystermen have practiced throughout history.

“If you're an oysterman, you probably do this automatically. You know if you put your shell back into the water, baby oysters are going to grow on it,” James Karst, the communications director of CRCL, said.

For Devon Parfait, chief of the Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw, fighting land loss is tied to the survival of his community. That is part of why his tribe worked with CRCL to build the oyster reef.

“Historically, when colonization was happening, these Native communities were pushed as far down south as they could possibly go,” he said. “They used to be able to ride a horse and buggy out to the barrier islands. These days, they’re just sparse little islands that people are arguing about protecting.”

Parfait, who is trained as a geological scientist, emphasized the importance of combining Indigenous knowledge of the land with data-based approaches. He used both types of understanding to determine if the build site could support oysters.

“I did my own testing for salinity, which is basically sticking your finger in the water and seeing how salty it is,” he said. “To me, it’s about combining these two different wealths of knowledge—the on-the-ground, lived, generational experience and the institutional expertise—because you need both. If you look at the world with just one, you’re really viewing the world with one eye closed.”

The salinity testing ruled out the original location for the oyster reef—a less salty marsh that lies over an ancient Indigenous burial mound. But the LUMCON site offers advantages of its own. “Too often, you see a lot of these coastal projects that happen totally off somewhere in the distance,” Parfait said. “Our idea was to have a living shoreline that people can come and see and interact with.”

The manmade oyster reef is just one example of nature-based solutions to land loss, which have become more common over the past 20 years.

“In the past, when it came to trying to protect land, everything was about putting in a solid structure or building a wall that keeps things intact, but then you’ve disconnected those wetlands from the estuary next to it, and you don't have the natural processes taking place,” said Brian Roberts, the chief scientist at LUMCON. “With these projects, we’re trying to figure out, ‘What is nature doing well on its own, and how do we take advantage of that?’”

What’s novel about CRCL’s approach to erosion control is its source. Recycling shells from restaurants is “a way of connecting with the culture of South Louisiana, connecting with our restaurants,” Karst said. “Everybody eats food, everybody loves our food and our seafood, and so we're bringing people who like to eat oysters into coastal restoration.” The shell recycling program shows no signs of slowing down: Not only did CRCL join forces with the National Football League to build a reef earlier this year, it also plans to build its next oyster reef in April 2026 in collaboration with the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana. This one will include 300 tons of oyster shells.

Small-scale coastal restoration projects, such as the oyster reef, are one piece of a statewide effort that has led to the investment of billions of dollars into safeguarding Louisiana’s coastline. For nearly two decades, coastal rebuilding in Louisiana has been guided by a comprehensive Coastal Master Plan. The plan, now in its fifth iteration, was initially spurred on by the immensely destructive Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.

“After Katrina and Rita, we said, ‘Here in Louisiana, we have to change the way we do business,’” said Simone Maloz, the campaign director for the Restore the Mississippi River Delta coalition. “What we want for Louisiana’s future has to be rooted in science, and it has to involve and engage all the communities that we're trying to restore and protect.”

The Coastal Master Plan made Louisiana a leader not just in coastal restoration but also in disaster relief. What sets it apart, Maloz said, is the fact that the projects detailed in the plan often originate from Louisiana residents, not state or federal administrators. “We ask community members to submit projects, and we have meetings with them all along the way,” she said. “It's nice to be a leader in that area, and now other states are also trying to use that same kind of method so that they can leverage their own resources.”

In addition to community-level projects, the Coastal Master Plan includes large-scale projects, such as the diversion of sediment from the Mississippi River to restore degrading wetlands, which the river once helped create. Two such projects, the Mid-Barataria and Mid-Breton sediment diversions, started in 2023 after a yearslong process of planning and permitting.

However, a change in state administration shook things up: Louisiana elected Jeff Landry, a Republican, as governor in 2024. He paused the sediment diversions shortly after he assumed office and fully canceled them in the summer of 2025. “To spend over $700 million on two projects in over 10 years, and to stop them in their tracks, is definitely something that we are going to have to deal with the consequences of,” Maloz said.

The cancellations have raised concerns about whether Louisiana can maintain its restoration momentum, and what scale of intervention is possible without the sediment diversions.

“We're always trying to plug into the Coastal Master Plan,” Franziska Trautmann said. She operates Glass Half Full, a nonprofit that restores the coastline using recycled glass turned to sand. “Our projects are smaller—we’re not diverting a river. We plug in the holes where the bigger master plan can’t really focus. But now that big projects like this are being canceled, who’s gonna fill that gap? Because it can’t be us.”

For now, volunteers are stepping up to try to fill that gap and are involved in every step of the process. The people helping to build the CRCL reef pick restaurant refuse from oyster-shell piles six feet high. They shovel shells into buckets, load the buckets onto boats, and ride the boats to the build site, dumping shells by the bucketful into the gabions.

To Parfait, community is the strongest force left against coastal erosion. “Fear doesn’t bring action in people as much as love and community does,” he said. “When something happens, everybody shows up and helps each other out, no matter who you are, what you identify as. That’s how Native Americans were able to survive down here in Louisiana—we created a sense of community that extended far beyond any of our own personal identities.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-11 07:03:25.391170

A clean energy nonprofit based in Kansas City has received a $250,000 grant to support planning efforts for potential energy-saving projects in Douglas County.

Metropolitan Energy Center was awarded the grant by the Coalition for Green Capital, according to a news release from Douglas County. The grant is called a “Market Building Grant,” and it will be used to explore “financial strategies that attract both private and public investors” for energy-saving projects in the county, the release said.

As for what types of projects these strategies would be used to attract, the release said they could include upgrades to community centers, nonprofit buildings and multifamily rental housing.

“Our goal is to design a plan that brings clean energy and energy-efficiency upgrades to community facilities and housing where it’s most needed,” Douglas County sustainability impact analyst Jamie Hofling said in the release. “This is about lowering utility bills, creating healthier spaces and making our county more resilient in the future.”

Douglas County is one of 49 communities in the U.S. chosen to participate in this round of grants, the release said, based on the potential impact of local projects and their attractiveness to future funders and investors. The grant period runs through April 1, 2026.

“Metropolitan Energy Center is proud to partner with Douglas County on this planning effort,” Kelly Gilbert, executive director of Metropolitan Energy Center, said in the release. “We know that the cost of energy is rising, and efficiency and renewable energy solutions are more important than ever.

“Now without the EPA’s watching, this increased possibility [of being cited for violating environmental laws] is no longer there,” he said.
In part, these employees supervise the many environmental enforcement activities delegated to individual states.
As a result, the Justice Department’s environmental enforcement arm has shrunk by about half.
Once the EPA identifies environmental violations, the Justice Department pursues cases against polluters and enters into legal settlements with them.","It’s day 42 of the U.S. government shutdown, but an end is finally in sight. On Sunday night, the Senate voted to move forward with funding for the federal government through January 30. That vote, in which eight Democrats joined the vast majority of Senate Republicans, is expected to be followed by approval from the Republican majority in the House of Representatives and President Donald Trump. With many Democratic officials condemning the capitulation of their Senate colleagues, a revival of the shutdown is a distinct possibility after funding expires again next year.

One of the many adverse effects of the current shutdown is that, for weeks now, the nation’s top environmental cop has been off duty. While it’s too early to know the exact consequences of the dysfunction, analogous situations in the recent past indicate that polluters often increase their emissions during periods of relaxed enforcement. With such periods becoming regular features of the U.S. political process, the cumulative environmental fallout could be significant.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement division is responsible for making sure the country’s cornerstone environmental laws — the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and hazardous waste laws among them — are followed. From Washington, D.C., and 10 regional offices across the country, these staffers police some of the nation’s biggest polluters. They conduct surprise inspections at refineries, power plants, and factories. They review data and reports to check compliance. And, when they find violations, they issue fines and work with the Justice Department to take offenders to court until they course correct.

But since the shutdown began on October 1, the EPA has gradually furloughed most of its civil enforcement staff. At first, only a handful of employees were sent home at the start of the month, and the agency kept most workers on using unspent funds from previous budget years. As that funding ran out, however, the agency furloughed most of its workforce. Since only essential staff that protect the public from imminent threats are retained during furloughs, the vast majority of enforcement staffers had been ordered to stay home by the end of the month.

“The inspection and enforcement arm of the agency has largely been shuttered,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, the union that represents agency employees. “The large majority of inspectors and enforcement officers, along with attorneys who work with them to conduct the settlements and other legal actions against regulated entities, are all furloughed right now.” Chen himself was furloughed on October 20.

Previous pauses in enforcement indicate that a lack of federal oversight can embolden polluters. Researchers at Pennsylvania State University examined emissions data from 204 coal-fired power plants from across the country during the last major federal shutdown at the end of 2018. They found that the coal plants released 15 to 20 percent more particulate matter during the 35 days when the government was shut down and EPA enforcement officers were furloughed. When the shutdown ended and the inspectors returned to their jobs, emissions returned to pre-shutdown levels. The findings were robust even though the researchers controlled for changes in weather, use of more polluting coal varieties, and other factors. That suggests that the plants were less likely to operate their pollution controls when they knew they were unlikely to get caught.

“The only possibility is a temporary change of the end-of-pipe pollution abatement device,” said Ruohao Zhang, a professor at Penn State and lead author of the study, which was published last month. Zhang and his colleagues relied on data reported by the coal plant operators to the EPA as well as satellite data from NASA. They examined particulate matter levels in a 1.8-mile radius around the coal plants.

While Zhang was not able to comment on the legality of such moves on the operators’ part, he said that it indicated there was a higher possibility of a violation. The current shutdown creates similar incentives as the last time around, he said. “Now without the EPA’s watching, this increased possibility [of being cited for violating environmental laws] is no longer there,” he said.

Researchers found a similar trend in the spring and summer of 2020 during the COVID-19 shutdown. At the time, the EPA announced that facilities that weren’t able to monitor and report their emissions would be excused from compliance. Companies took the EPA up on the offer. Self-reported data from polluting facilities showed that companies conducted 40 percent fewer emission tests at smokestacks in March and April of 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. American University researchers also found that counties with six or more polluting facilities reporting to the EPA saw a 14 percent increase in particulate matter pollution after the EPA announced its enforcement policy in 2020.

Shutdowns ultimately send the message that nobody is watching, said Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit founded by former EPA enforcement staffers.

“It means that communities may be more exposed to pollution,” she said, “if companies do break the laws, and there’s no one from EPA working to be able to respond.”

The EPA’s regional offices each have about 18 staffers dedicated to handling each of the three main enforcement areas: air, water, and hazardous waste and toxics. Chen estimated that roughly 600 EPA employees were responsible for enforcement at the regional level. In part, these employees supervise the many environmental enforcement activities delegated to individual states. Additionally, the EPA has also assigned staff to enforce environmental laws in consultation with tribes, since many federally recognized tribes haven’t been granted authority to implement environmental laws.

The near-complete halt of inspections and case processing activities is likely to have significant implications for the EPA’s enforcement work. For one, any administrative settlements the agency might want to enter into with a polluter are contingent on utilizing evidence not more than a year old, unless the agency secures a waiver from the Justice Department. As a result, staff tend to front-load the work at the beginning of the fiscal year, which starts October 1, Chen said. But given that they’ve been furloughed for the past several weeks, it “makes it very difficult timing-wise to do some sort of administrative settlements to get a quick resolution on certain things,” Chen said.

The furloughs are the latest setback to hit EPA staff. The Trump administration has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs and offered buyouts to workers this year. While it’s unclear exactly how many EPA enforcement staffers were let go or resigned, the EPA is in the process of reducing its headcount by nearly 25 percent. The Department of Justice, or DOJ, has also lost at least 4,500 workers to layoffs and buyouts. As a result, the Justice Department’s environmental enforcement arm has shrunk by about half.

Once the EPA identifies environmental violations, the Justice Department pursues cases against polluters and enters into legal settlements with them. According to an analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project first reported by the Washington Post, the DOJ has brought just nine major civil cases against polluters in the first eight months of the Trump administration. That’s a major decrease compared to Trump’s first term, when the DOJ brought 53 cases during the same time period.

An EPA spokesperson told the Post that the number of civil cases did not reflect relaxed enforcement on the Trump administration’s part, citing other metrics in which she claimed Trump had outperformed the Biden administration, but Duggan, the Environmental Integrity Project’s executive director, disagreed.

“That’s a significant slowdown of the enforcement process,” she said. “If you are cutting the staff that are doing that job, you know that’s going to have an impact.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2245219147-e1762813265453.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-11 10:02:47.039778

COP30 is taking place from November 6-21 in Brazil as leaders debate how to prevent runaway global warming, protect communities from climate impacts, and leverage creative solutions to the climate crisis.

Do Lago added that both countries have embraced climate action ""in a very clear way"" and are driving down the cost of clean technologies worldwide; and have ""embraced this agenda in an extraordinary way"" by combining scale, technology, and affordability, the three crucial ingredients that have accelerated the world's progress towards cleaner energy systems.

“China has very advanced technology and scale that can only be compared to India. India, too, has brilliant engineers and companies moving in the same direction,” he said.

Do Lago credited China’s leadership in electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, wind energy, and battery manufacturing for sharply lowering the global cost of clean technologies.

“If solar panels now cost 90% less than a few years ago, it’s thanks to this scale. It allows developing nations to access clean power more easily,” he said.

The COP30 summit, marking 10 years since the Paris Agreement, is being held amid geopolitical tensions, wars, and economic uncertainties, including trade measures by the US. Many developed nations are reconsidering their climate commitments, making this year’s talks crucial to rebuilding trust in global cooperation.

Countries are also expected to present their new climate action targets (NDCs) for 2031–2035, underlining how they plan to cut emissions and adapt to climate change.

With global temperatures already up 1.3°C since pre-industrial times, the latest UN Emissions Gap Report warns that current policies could lead to 2.8°C of warming by 2100.

At the COP30 Leaders’ Summit, Dinesh Bhatia, Indian Ambassador to Brazil, reaffirmed India’s commitment to the Paris Agreement and multilateralism.

In Framingham, Massachusetts, that unlikely team has created something pretty cool: a neighborhood heating and cooling system powered by the Earth itself.

As PBS NewsHour reported, it's a first-in-the-nation project that delivers cleaner comfort and even saves folks money.

The magic is networked geothermal. Forget drilling a pricey well for every single house. This setup uses a one-mile loop of underground pipes connecting about three dozen homes and town buildings to shared boreholes, according to PBS NewsHour.

These pipes tap into the ground's super-stable temperature — always around 55 degrees Fahrenheit, year-round, at the depths used.

So, how does that heat your house in winter? The International Renewable Energy Agency explained that geothermal simply extracts heat from below ground. Fluid circulates in those shared pipes, soaking up the Earth's warmth when it's cold out or dumping excess heat when it's hot.

This fluid then feeds into electric heat pumps in each building. Heat pumps are already smart movers of heat. Tying them into that steady 55-degree network means they work way less hard than battling freezing or scorching outside air, saving a bunch of electricity.

Just ask Carol Canova, a retired teacher in the pilot program.

""I'd never been in a house that every place in the house was the same temperature,"" she told PBS NewsHour.

She worried about electric bills but found ""it's overall cheaper"" than gas. Getting the system installed for free felt incredible.

""When Eversource offered it, I thought, you know what, this is like winning the lottery,"" Canova said.

This whole idea actually bubbled up from the activists. PBS NewsHour detailed how the nonprofit Home Energy Efficiency Team was initially focused on fixing ancient, leaky gas pipes. Then came the light bulb moment: Why not swap leaky gas lines for pipes filled with Earth-warmed water?

HEET director Zeybeb Magavi pitched the concept of gas companies becoming ""thermal utilities"" to the local provider, Eversource. Facing state climate goals, the utility agreed to the pilot.

It's a smart way to use a reliable, clean energy source. IRENA noted geothermal's low cost and 24/7 reliability — a big plus compared to sun or wind power. Because nothing's burning, it avoids air pollution that harms our health. This networked idea isn't the only geothermal innovation happening.

Companies like Sage Geosystems are cleverly using old oil wells and drilling tech for clean power, even exploring energy storage for the Pentagon at Fort Bliss in Texas.

Another company, Rodatherm, is testing a closed-loop system in Utah that skips fracking and groundwater use altogether.

In Framingham, the project is working so well that PBS NewsHour reported plans are set to double its size next year.

""The Rondo Heat Battery is now proven at industrial scale,"" said CEO Eric Trusiewicz, per Electrek.","A California oil facility just hit a major clean-energy milestone, and it could reshape how factories, refineries, and other heavy industries stay powered.

Rondo Energy has switched on what it says is the world's largest industrial heat battery, proving that solar power can now deliver the extremely high heat required to run industrial operations around the clock.

According to Electrek, it is located at a Holmes Western Oil facility in California, and the 100-megawatt-hour system is charged entirely by an onsite solar array.

During the day, the Rondo Heat Battery stores energy in ultra-durable bricks; at night, it releases that heat to produce constant, high-pressure steam.

After 10 weeks of daily operation, the system has already surpassed expectations, hitting over 97% efficiency and delivering temperatures above 1,000°C (1,832°F). That's the heat equivalent of about 10,000 home heating systems.

Because the heat battery plugs into the facility's existing infrastructure, it can supply steam through the same pipes used by gas-fired boilers, meaning no costly retrofits.

By replacing natural gas with solar energy, the technology could help facilities avoid volatile fuel prices and slash climate-warming pollution.

Industrial heat drives more than 25% of global energy use, so this breakthrough has enormous potential. Methane, a byproduct of dirty fuel extraction and burning, is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide at heating the planet, so reducing its release can slow the rate of rising global temperatures.

""The Rondo Heat Battery is now proven at industrial scale,"" said CEO Eric Trusiewicz, per Electrek. ""Our customers are improving their competitiveness and slashing their carbon emissions at the same time.""

This development mirrors other game-changing innovations, such as tech enabling cleaner power plants and revolutionary fuel research that boosts energy resilience.

Together, they signal a trend: cleaner tech isn't just for homes and EVs anymore — it's rapidly transforming big industry, too.

For everyday people, smaller-scale solutions offer similar benefits, from community solar savings to energy-efficient upgrades at home.

Installing solar panels is one of the ultimate home energy hacks — in many cases, it can bring your energy bill down to near $0.

EnergySage provides a free service that lets you compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar.

Going solar also makes running other energy-efficient appliances, like heat pumps, even cheaper.

New data centers capable of delivering AI compute services use large amounts of electricity.

Existing infrastructure is struggling to keep pace with accelerating data center demand.

Microgrids can ease demand on the grid and provide new data centers with a reliable source of electricity.

Data center developers can use microgrids and partnerships with experts to address the demand for power and related challenges.

For the first time in decades, electricity demand is set to increase (Figure 1). Data centers play a big role in this new demand and bring some novel strains to power providers and transmission businesses.

New power demand is cropping up in unexpected places — exurban areas with good telecom fiber and affordable land in the US mid-Atlantic states and sparsely populated West Texas, where crypto miners have set up to take advantage of remote, abundant renewable power from wind turbines — where utilities and administrators have not planned to add infrastructure. Traditional power generation, transmission and delivery models are not well-suited to respond to power demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

The impact of this mismatch goes beyond delayed projects and server shortages. Electricity bills for customers in the regional grid known as the PJM Interconnection territory were projected to climb 20% as utilities grapple with data centers getting built faster than power plants. PJM covers 13 US states from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland to Illinois and Tennessee. It is the largest US power grid and home to a huge and growing concentration of data centers.

Figure 1. Demand for power forecast to increase

Source: US Energy Information Administration Short Term Energy Outlook

Whether it’s AI or other uses such as cryptocurrency mining, demand from future data centers will be spiky and sporadic. Aligning the long planning cycle for building new conventional power generation and transmission with the quick hype cycle of technology is challenging. Utilities have reasons to be skeptical that today’s forecasted AI demand will actually develop into tomorrow’s steady ratepayers.

Data centers demand high reliability and uninterrupted power. Their developers should find ways to bring their own energy sources. Intelligent microgrids, developed in concert with new data centers, offer localized generation, backup power, and energy optimization. According to Bloom Energy, about 30% of new data center sites are expected to incorporate microgrids or similar onsite power solutions into their designs by 2030. This marks a greater than twofold increase from just seven months prior. What’s more, microgrid systems also support peak shaving — reducing electricity usage in periods of high demand to lower costs — and load management, which will curb demand and manage prices downward, they argue. Further, AI tools can be used to forecast demand and even accelerate planning for new generation sources and interconnections.

The shape and benefits of microgrids

A microgrid is a localized energy system capable of operating independently or in coordination with the main utility grid. It typically includes a combination of distributed energy resources such as solar photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, energy storage systems (such as batteries), and conventional energy resources. These components are integrated with control systems that manage energy generation, storage, and distribution.

Developers can design microgrids to enhance power stability, energy resilience, and sustainability. One of their key advantages is the ability to “island”— that is, to disconnect from the main grid and continue operating autonomously during grid outages or disturbances. This makes them particularly valuable in areas prone to natural disasters or where grid reliability is a concern.

Progress to mainstream

Microgrids have advanced from pilot projects and niche solutions into a mainstream solution for energy resilience, sustainability and decentralization.

By integrating renewable energy generation sources, microgrids reduce dependency on centralized fossil-fuel-based power generation. They also support energy independence, allowing communities or facilities to manage their own energy needs more efficiently. Initiatives are operating in the New England state of Vermont and on an island in American Samoa.

Because microgrids are designed to operate connected to and independently from the main grid, they require more advanced control systems. Advanced control systems enable real-time monitoring, load balancing, and predictive maintenance. These systems often use AI or ML for predictive control, digital twins for simulation, and edge computing for fast local decisions. The dual operating structure of microgrids requires these capabilities, but they also deliver optimized performance and cost savings.

Traditional grids are evolving to incorporate advanced control systems, especially as they become smarter and more decentralized. But the deployment is less uniform and often slower due to legacy infrastructure and regulatory constraints.

In contrast, modern microgrids are gaining momentum thanks to the development of high-grade controllers. These controllers go beyond basic automation and enable real-time decision-making based on live data, optimization around multiple variables, predictive analytics, adaptive control and the capability to integrate a mix of assets, including traditional power sources, renewable energy and long-term power storage batteries (Figure 2).

Microgrids offer benefits in both urban and rural settings. In urban areas, they support grid modernization and decarbonization goals. In remote or underserved regions such as islands in the South Pacific, they provide access to reliable electricity where traditional grid infrastructure is lacking or economically unfeasible. With the rise of smart grid technologies and digital energy management software platforms such as Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS) and Distributed Energy Resources Management System (DERMS), microgrids are becoming more intelligent and adaptive.

In Northern California, the Blue Lake Rancheria Native American tribe partnered with the Schatz Energy Research Center and engineering group Siemens to develop a microgrid using solar photovoltaic panels and battery backups. The system helps the Blue Lake Rancheria reduce energy costs and serves as an emergency source of power for the remote community, some 300 miles north of San Francisco Bay.

Regional drivers

On a regional basis, a variety of triggers have compelled further microgrid development around the globe (Figure 3).

In Asia, microgrid development is driven by electrification needs in remote villages as well as in new industrial parks and newly developing cities. India, China, Indonesia and the Philippines lead the way.

In North America, energy resilience is a primary driver and has been implemented at hospitals, military bases, college campuses, and data centers. The case for resilience has been particularly compelling in California and Texas. Even with rollbacks of government incentives, locations rich in distributed renewable energy generation continue to pursue microgrid development.

Europe’s decarbonization goals and national interests in energy independence are driving renewable-powered microgrid development. European microgrids are frequently used for urban energy sharing and electric vehicle charging hubs. Germany, the Netherlands and the Nordic nations are leaders in microgrids.

In Africa, energy access and rural electrification drive microgrid development. This is often backed by non-governmental organizations, development agencies and national governments to put solar-powered microgrids to work in previously off-grid communities.

In Latin America, microgrid demand is driven by the need to increase resilience and recovery and to supply electricity in remote regions. Hybrid microgrids that use solar and diesel have been deployed in islands and mountainous areas. Brazil, Chile and Caribbean nations lead the way.

What microgrids deliver for data centers

A microgrid tailored for a data center can enhance reliability, uptime, and resilience, by switching into island mode when the main power source endures an outage.. It also can address demand and sustainability challenges that are growing in response to rapid data center expansion.

Microgrids can help data center operators manage their power profile, or what and where they source energy for the data center. This requires smart integration with distributed energy resources and coordination with the regional grid. Then, microgrid operators can engage in use-specific monitoring, management, and automation of grid and data center activities.

Infosys and partners have developed a microgrid on Singapore’s Jurong Island that uses a cloud-based energy management system to monitor and manage electricity usage there. The system monitors power demand and helps manage electric load for the island with the support of long-term energy storage batteries.

This is particularly relevant when one considers the nature of compute demands in the data centers of tomorrow. AI-driven demand in future data centers will come in sudden spikes, often driven by automated digital processes.

An integrated microgrid like the one on Jurong Island can profile power loads and forecast future demand. This is one way a microgrid can optimize energy costs and reduce grid strain. Further, an integrated microgrid with monitoring and management can itself be automated to keep pace with the dynamic power demands of data centers. In markets with competitive power pricing, energy management systems can be deployed to automatically switch between grid, solar, and battery.

Integration and coordination will be a site-to-site consideration, depending on the variety of distributed energy resources, (solar, wind, battery storage, and even electric vehicles) and adjacent regional grid or demand.

In developing microgrids with major utilities, Infosys has developed a method to integrate electric vehicles as occasional or last-resort power sources for grid and data center. To be sure, this sort of vehicle-to-grid technology is not yet widely deployed and is dependent on policy development and standards. But once those factors mature, the reference architecture is ready to go, with cybersecurity and governance requirements already in place.

In our experience, the best approach to optimizing energy costs in a microgrid involves economic modeling, robust digital integration, and smart operational practices. By coordinating energy resources with the grid, a configurable cloud-based energy monitoring platform optimizes the cost of energy.

Infosys and BP have in partnership developed an energy-as-a-service (EaaS) solution that is being used by a leading German airport to support energy efficiency. The platform has the potential to implement use cases like demand response in microgrids.

Microgrids at macro scale

In the future, imagine a collection of digitally integrated and configurable microgrids, operating adjacent to each other and linked via an interoperable infrastructure. This is reflected in the digital energy grid concept articulated by Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani. In India, this concept could soon earn governmental support, driven by a desire to reduce power costs and increase reliability.

Taken to its full extent, a digital energy grid composed of multiple microgrids, along with other generation, transmission, and distribution assets, could turn every home with solar panels or another distributed power generation source into an energy market participant. In theory, this would reduce costs and increase reliability.

Digital interoperability and automation, driven by AI, can then manage and optimize microgrid energy resources by forecasting demand, scheduling distribution, and balancing supply and demand dynamically in real time. Here, microgrids at a macro scale would improve resilience and efficiency.

As articulated by Nilekani and the Foundation for Interoperability in a Digital Economy, digitizing and decentralizing the grid aims to reduce energy generation, transmission, and distribution costs significantly (up to 25%), encouraging more microgrid deployments and local energy entrepreneurship.

Development resilience, consider cost options

Data center developers can use renewables and battery storage in a microgrid to address demand for power and related challenges. This enhances resilience, improves quality and load balancing, reduces costs, and lowers the carbon footprint.

Cost considerations for the development of a data center microgrid should be viewed through a pair of familiar spending lenses: capital expenditures versus operational expenditures. The CapEx front includes installation, interconnection with grid, permitting and financing. The OpEx side focuses on ongoing costs including operations, monitoring, maintenance and repairs, and software and technology costs.

With that view established, data center developers can consider different ownership or partnership models. An EaaS model would shift some critical upfront CapEx to the OpEx side.

They can also consider a middle path for development: Own the microgrid, but cede operational control to expert partners. Such partnerships make it easier to participate in power markets and potentially save further on costs.

For example, the government of Montgomery County, Maryland, partnered with utility provider Duke Energy to build a microgrid system designed to enhance resilience and reduce carbon footprint. The project uses an EaaS model and was built with no upfront cost to the county.

Microgrids coupled with renewable energy generation sources enable data center developers to reduce dependence on centralized fossil fuel-based power generation, increase resilience, and head off emerging community concerns of data centers’ thirst for power.

""The United States have not pulled out of Paris.
""[Trump] often talks and makes a lot of noise, but he cannot stop us moving forward,"" said Inslee.
Through their participation at COP, McCarthy told attendees in Rio that local leaders were looking to build partnerships and inform negotiations in Belem.","Washington will not be sending a top-level team to this year's COP climate summit in Belem, Brazil.

The global community expected as much from a president who has pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement for the second time, slashed funding for renewable energy, championed fossil fuel projects and told world leaders at the UN in September that climate change is the ""greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.""

But delegates from Washington state, along with governors, mayors and other representatives from states and cities across the US, are determined to pick up the slack. Together, they represent about two-thirds of the US population and produce nearly three-quarters of the country's economic output.

""It's a long way to come from Seattle to Rio, but I made the trip, and others made the trip, because it's important for the rest of the world not to give up on the United States,"" said Jay Inslee, the former Democratic governor of Washington. Inslee was speaking to DW from Rio de Janeiro, where he was taking part in pre-COP events last week ahead of the main climate talks.

""The United States have not pulled out of Paris. One part of the United States has, and that's the federal government,"" said Inslee, a founding member of the US Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of governors that includes 23 states and one territory. The group was spurred into action during the first Trump presidency in 2017.

""It's very important that we not allow a misperception to exist that somehow progress has stopped because we have a bloviating, anti-wind turbine, climate-denying narcissist in the White House. That's a very important message, I think, for the world to give them confidence to move forward.""

Will Trump's tariff diplomacy derail COP?

While Trump's team is not expected in Belem, some observers are concerned the president could disrupt the negotiations from afar.

""The Trump administration is exerting pressure on the talks through the impact of its tariff policy,"" said Maha Rafi Atal, an associate professor in political economy at the University of Glasgow. She told DW in an email how the president has tried to encourage the European Union to exempt US companies from the EU's carbon border tax, in exchange for concessions on tariffs.

""The signal sent to countries around the world is that the US may penalize in trade terms countries that take stronger climate action,"" said Atal. She added that Trump's hostility to climate action could see other countries ""less willing to prioritize emissions reductions over economic growth"" and funding the energy transition.

""Yes, the [US] federal government may continue to be disruptive,"" said Gina McCarthy, co-chair of America Is All In (AIAI), a climate action coalition, in an email. ""Our delegation is focused on what we know for sure: local leaders and businesses across the United States are pressing forward on clean energy and are eager to collaborate with international partners to strengthen the Paris Agreement.""

Local efforts add up

More than 100 subnational leaders from the US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors and AIAI — representing state and city officials as well as tribal nations, businesses, schools and other institutions — are taking part in the high-stakes negotiations in the Amazon, which run from November 10 to 21.

While many of the decisions at COP shape how nations tackle climate change at the federal level, the local leaders believe the US, the world's second-biggest polluter after China, can still meet the goals of the 2015 Paris accord and reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. Even with Trump boosting oil and gas projects, which contribute significantly to global warming.

""[Trump] often talks and makes a lot of noise, but he cannot stop us moving forward,"" said Inslee. ""Yes, he has reduced some of our federal efforts, but we retain the ability to control our own destiny in these states and cities.""

In fact, an analysis released by AIAI last month shows that expanded climate action on the local level, along with renewed support from Washington after 2028 — when Trump is due to leave office — could see the US reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 56% below 2005 levels by 2035. Under the Biden administration, the US 2035 pledge was to cut net emissions by up to 66%.

Many of those reductions in the coming years would come from local policy changes in three key areas: electricity, transportation and reducing methane emissions from leaky gas infrastructure and organic waste.

""Our findings show that innovative local policies and market-driven clean technology investments can keep the US on a path toward significant emissions reductions, even in challenging times,"" said Nate Hultman, director at the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, which led the study.

'Change happens from the bottom up'

Speaking at the COP30 Local Leaders Forum last week, McCarthy — a climate adviser for the Biden administration and former head of the Environmental Protection Agency — told attendees that ""change happens from the bottom up.""

She said local efforts were ""leading the charge on clean energy,"" pointing out that the 24 states in the US Climate Alliance had already managed to collectively reduce greenhouse gas emission by 24% below 2005 levels, while increasing their GDP by 34%.

""They're supported by the majority of Americans that want their leaders to lower energy costs, protect public health and create jobs,"" McCarthy told DW.

Inslee, whose policies on clean energy, energy-efficient building and low-emission transportation as governor of Washington from 2013 to 2025 helped shape Joe Biden's approach to climate change, said job creation and economic growth could go hand-in-hand with reducing emissions.

Even in states like Texas, which is not a part of the US Climate Alliance, renewable energy is taking off because, as Inslee put it, Americans ""want cheaper sources of energy."" Texas, where voters backed Trump in the last three elections, leads the US when it comes to the development of renewable energy generation and battery capacity. Average electricity prices in the southern state are among the lowest in the country, according to August data from the US Energy Information Administration, a government agency.

Through their participation at COP, McCarthy told attendees in Rio that local leaders were looking to build partnerships and inform negotiations in Belem.

""We have power, we have agency, we have authority, and damn it, we are going to use it!"" she said to applause.

The United States has stepped back from global climate commitments, Europe is tied down by slow growth and political hesitation, and yet many fast-growing economies are accelerating their shift to clean energy. The momentum is coming from countries that once argued they were too poor to transition quickly. They are now adopting renewable energy at a pace that few expected, the New York Times reported.

How cheap Chinese technology is driving the shift

China has rapidly expanded production of solar panels, wind turbines and electric-vehicle batteries, to the point where its domestic market no longer absorbs everything it makes. The result is a flood of low-cost equipment flowing to countries hungry for energy security. From Vietnam and Brazil to Nigeria and Nepal, Chinese factories and exports are enabling governments to add clean power at prices they could not match before. This is turning China into the key industrial force behind the world’s renewable rollout.

Why emerging economies are seizing the moment

Many developing countries now see renewables as the fastest way to cut their dependence on imported fossil fuels. Nations like Ethiopia and Nepal are leapfrogging straight into electric mobility by slashing taxes on battery-powered vehicles and restricting petrol-car imports. Brazil is using tariffs to force Chinese carmakers to build electric-vehicle plants locally. Morocco has carved out a role as a battery-manufacturing hub for Europe. These shifts reflect both economic urgency and a new confidence in cleaner technologies.

India’s role in this changing landscape

India arrived at COP30 pointing to major progress. Half of its electricity demand can now be met by wind, solar and hydropower, and it reached its Paris Agreement targets years ahead of schedule. Even though India is cautious about relying on Chinese imports, it is adopting elements of China’s industrial strategy by offering incentives for domestic solar manufacturing and large-scale renewable expansion. This combination of economic self-interest and climate ambition has strengthened India’s influence at the summit.

Why this is not the full solution

Despite the rapid rise in clean energy, these countries still depend heavily on coal, oil and gas. India and China continue to build coal plants, Indonesia remains a major coal exporter and Brazil plans to expand offshore oil production. The new renewable capacity does not erase these realities. Instead, it shows how complex the transition will be: a blend of fossil fuels that still anchor many economies and renewables that are now growing too fast to ignore.

How China’s dominance is unsettling the West

With Chinese exports of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries hitting record levels, the United States and Europe worry about being outcompeted in industries they hoped to lead. Yet at COP30, many emerging nations show little interest in this geopolitical rivalry. For them,

cheaper green technology means faster development and lower energy bills. They see China less as a threat and more as the supplier that finally made renewables affordable.

Why the world’s climate strategy now looks different

A decade ago, rich nations urged developing countries to curb emissions, promising financial help that never fully arrived. Today, the economics have flipped. Clean energy is no longer held back by high prices or limited supply. For many governments, it is now the cheapest growth path available. That shift is changing who drives progress, who sets the pace and where climate leadership might emerge next.

The bottom line

China’s industrial surge has unexpectedly empowered emerging economies to expand renewable energy faster than ever before. While it has not solved the climate crisis, it has altered the global map of influence. At COP30, the countries once seen as obstacles to climate action are increasingly shaping the world’s transition, on their own terms and with their own priorities.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2022/07/industrial-investment.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 12:08:10.470416

A key highlight of the draft is the elevation of environmental protection to a central mission alongside economic and social progress, signalling a new and comprehensive understanding of sustainability in the current context.

Harmonising economic growth with environmental protection, or safeguarding the environment to ensure sustainable economic development, is considered the cornerstone of lasting prosperity. From this perspective, the Party affirms that environmental protection is a central and inseparable task closely tied to economic and social development.

Vietnam’s policies and international commitments make clear that the transition toward a green, circular, and low-carbon economy is the pathway to sustainable development. It is essential to abandon short-term, profit-driven approaches that neglect environmental responsibilities and to remain steadfast in the principle of not sacrificing the environment for economic gain.

Commenting on the draft, Dr. Truong Ba kien, Deputy Director of the Centre for Meteorology and Climatology under the Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Climate Change at Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, emphasised that the inclusion of environmental protection and climate adaptation is both timely and necessary, aligning with Vietnam’s real-world challenges. He noted that proactive and effective adaptation to climate change is a trend that Vietnam must continue to pursue in the years ahead.

To enhance resilience to extreme weather and climate-related disasters, relevant agencies need to comprehensively upgrade real-time forecasting and early warning systems, integrating meteorological, hydrological, radar, and reservoir data. The use of AI, Big Data, and ensemble modelling will help detect hazardous weather patterns early. Multi-channel public alerts, regular drills, and inter-regional coordination mechanisms should also be strengthened.

In parallel, Vietnam should standardise and expand inter-reservoir operations, improve dam safety monitoring, and promote reforestation. Developing flood and landslide risk maps using satellite data and LiDAR technology will support evidence-based planning. Building green infrastructure such as water-absorbent urban systems, maintaining natural floodways, and ensuring data sharing across regions are also crucial to balancing development with watershed safety.

Localities are urged to integrate climate adaptation into regional and provincial planning, establish AI- and IoT-based early warning systems, and enhance climate risk management capacity for local authorities. Promoting nature-based and green development models and nurturing a culture of preparedness will help build safer, more resilient communities.

According to Dr. Mai Van Khiem, Director of the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, Vietnam must continue modernising its observation technologies, expanding monitoring networks, and applying artificial intelligence to improve forecasting accuracy, particularly for extreme weather events. He also underlined the need for clear, concise, and accessible communication to ensure early warnings reach vulnerable communities.

Strengthened coordination between meteorological agencies, local governments, disaster response units, and media outlets is vital to translating forecasts into effective action. Public education and training in disaster preparedness should be expanded, with climate and environmental awareness integrated into school curricula.

Le Thi Dinh, Secretary of Xuan Non hamlet Party Cell in Hanoi' Thu Lam commune, noted that recognising environmental protection as a core development pillar provides a new benchmark for all socio-economic policies. However, genuine sustainability must start with each individual’s mindset and daily actions, from planting trees and flowers to embracing broader goals such as green transformation and green economy. She also stressed the importance of environmental education at all levels to foster a “green living” consciousness among citizens, laying the groundwork for a sustainable and resilient future./.",https://mediaen.vietnamplus.vn/images/f579a678cf9e90879541752073c26005bbdf424920f6f51bdadd19a62ab9b8e6ba30af0c1e85f530b954163111f7924330116700e000fe3ddc5f5058dbf64d4c/0603-khi-hau.jpg.webp,N,,2025-11-11 03:59:46.246248

A singular narrative of the energy transition fails to capture its real complexity. What we are witnessing is not one transition, but many – each shaped by local context, political priorities, industrial base, and societal expectations.

Some countries are doubling down on electrification and renewables, while others are charting different but equally valid paths. For instance, Brazil has made significant progress by leveraging its long-standing investment in biofuels and hydropower, which now account for a large share of its energy mix, with renewables meeting almost 45% of primary energy demand. In just four years, initiatives in India, such as bulb exchange programs and large-scale procurement tenders, helped increase its LED lighting market share from 10-15% to 75%. China is investing heavily in innovation and industrial scale. In recent years, the country has allocated between $4bn and $6bn annually to clean energy research and development, helping build a solar industry that not only leads the world in installed capacity but sets the pace in technological advancement.

These examples highlight that clean energy strategies should align with each country’s natural resource endowment, development stage, and economic priorities. In some cases, distributed solutions are more appropriate than centralized systems. In others, decarbonizing heavy industry or transport may take precedence over power generation. The paths are diverse, but the ambition is shared: to build energy systems that are cleaner, fairer, more secure, and aligned with long-term economic growth. Recognizing and supporting this diversity is key to achieving meaningful global progress.

As the above examples indicate, energy has become a strategic variable that influences everything from investor confidence to supply chain viability. The companies and countries that act rapidly on it will define the next generation of economic leadership. They will turn volatility into resilience, fragmentation into collaboration, and policy uncertainty into strategic clarity. For emerging economies, this is a moment of opportunity – one that, if seized, can redefine their role in the global economy for decades to come.

Emerging markets: catalysts for the future of energy

Despite capital constraints, several emerging markets are establishing themselves as leaders in energy innovation and showcasing unique energy transition pathways. They are not only expanding renewable capacity but investing in next-generation infrastructure, clean industrial solutions, and competitive technology ecosystems.

Brazil: Innovating with biofuels and green digital infrastructure

Brazil has long been a pioneer in bioenergy, and it’s aiming to take the lead in next-generation biofuels. It has launched the world’s largest cellulosic ethanol facility and is advancing biofuel technologies that can fully substitute fossil diesel. Rio de Janeiro recently launched “AI City”, a 1.5GW data hub that employs waterless cooling and offsets its power use with Brazil’s robust hydropower supply – offering a new model for sustainable digital infrastructure.

China: Scaling with speed and resilience

Clean energy accounted for over 10% of China’s gross domestic product in 2024, surpassing real estate and agriculture. Despite rising trade barriers in Europe and North America, China’s EV manufacturers pivoted quickly to markets like Mexico, Brazil, and the UAE. Government subsidies, intense domestic competition, and surging internal demand enabled EV production to grow by a third last year, with EVs making up 41% of new vehicle sales. Innovation remains relentless. For example, BYD’s new battery offers a 400km range on a five-minute charge.

India: Advancing an inclusive and resilient transition

India is growing its renewable capacity faster than several other major economies. Wind and solar installations have nearly doubled in five years. To meet its 2070 net-zero target, the country is accelerating battery energy storage, building industrial green hydrogen clusters, and upgrading transmission infrastructure. It’s also focusing on inclusive growth by extending grid access, improving energy efficiency, and stabilizing its coal-dominated electricity mix as demand rises by an expected 35% by 2030.

Southeast Asia: Turning resources into regional strength

The region is home to vast renewable potential and key mineral reserves like nickel, copper, and rare earth elements. With supportive regulation and investment, Southeast Asia could meet two-thirds of its electricity needs from renewables by 2050. Regional energy integration is advancing: ASEAN has revived the ASEAN Power Grid project, with Malaysia and Indonesia restarting a long-stalled cross-border interconnection initiative.

Nigeria: Powering up with renewables and reform

Nigeria is making tangible strides toward becoming a clean-energy hub, rising from 109th place in 2016 to 61st in this year’s ETI. Driven by major advances in investment capacity, infrastructure development, and regulatory reform, the country is gaining increasing attention on the global stage. In 2024, it added between 63.5 MW and 73 MW of new solar capacity – bringing its cumulative installed solar power to around 385.7 MW – and ranking it among Africa’s top installers.

Four ways to unlock strategic business advantage

Companies and investors must bear in mind that the energy transition goes beyond procurement or compliance – it is a source of long-term strategic advantage. Unlocking that advantage depends on recognizing the scale of transformation underway and aligning business action with the emerging realities of varied transitions, evolving technologies, and complex market dynamics. Here are four actions business leaders can take:

1. Reframe growth markets

Emerging economies are driving innovation in energy, pioneering policy reforms, and shaping industrial strategies. Markets like China, India, Brazil, and parts of Southeast Asia are leading in clean energy deployment, digital grid reform, and sector-specific solutions such as green hydrogen and biofuels.

These economies are shaping the technology pathways of the future and will increasingly influence global standards, supply chains, and capital flows. This presents an opportunity for businesses to update their models of risk and value: growth markets are not just where demand will come from – they are where a significant part of the future is being built.

2. Close the capital gap

There is a $2.2tn annual investment shortfall in clean energy standing between emerging economies and a viable energy transition. This is more than just a funding need – it’s a significant commercial opportunity.

Southeast Asia alone could generate $300bn in green revenue over the next five years, with the potential for 5.8 million new jobs by 2050. Findings from the Energy Transition Index 2025 highlight other regions that are showing encouraging signs of momentum and emerging investment potential. For example, Mozambique’s resurgence as an emerging energy player underscores what is possible when regulatory reform, infrastructure development, and strategic capital allocation align effectively. China leads in innovation and investment, having made substantial progress. It remains the world’s largest clean energy investor, contributing over $818bn to global investment in 2024. With the highest renewable capacity additions and the majority of new nuclear projects, China is also scaling energy infrastructure at an unmatched pace.

De-risking tools, blended finance, sovereign green bonds, and public-private investment platforms should become standard parts of corporate and investor toolkits. Companies that step into this space early can shape markets, secure strategic footholds, and unlock new value pools.

3. Build local capacity and leadership

The energy transition hinges on people, institutions, and localized solutions. Advancing this transition could benefit from prioritizing investments in workforce development and institutional partnerships. Partnerships – whether between companies and universities, public agencies, or local governments – play a critical role in piloting new models, advancing R&D, and building trust with communities. Forward-looking businesses are also collaborating with government stakeholders to modernize permitting processes, standardize clean energy procurement, and de-risk low-carbon investments. These partnerships help ensure that solutions are scalable, socially grounded, and locally relevant.

Additionally, workforce development is critical to bridging the skills gap in clean energy industries. The Energy Transition Index report finds that top-performing countries like Finland, Germany, and China are expanding vocational training and technical education aligned with cleantech industries. India has a program that is preparing a new generation of grid technicians and energy entrepreneurs, building capacity and inclusive access to clean energy jobs. These examples highlight a vital point: human capital is transition capital.

4. Navigate risk with flexibility

Emerging markets are complex and not uniform, but they are where the greatest upside lies. From permitting challenges to policy shifts, the risk landscape is real. But businesses that bring agility and a long-term mindset can draw lasting advantage.

The lesson from leaders across regions is that success depends on adaptive strategies anchored in local reality. This includes understanding sub-national opportunities, responding to regional industrial strengths, and working across public-private lines.

For example, India demonstrates how regional alignment with industrial and labor strengths can accelerate the transition. It has prioritized vocational training and regional workforce development programs that support clean energy deployment. Initiatives such as the Suryamitra Skill Development Program, implemented across solar-rich states, help build local talent pipelines that align with solar manufacturing and deployment clusters.

Likewise, the UAE has adopted a multi-level engagement approach, working across federal and emirate levels to align long-term clean energy goals with regional development. Initiatives such as Masdar City and the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 reflect how targeted local planning and public-private collaboration are central to the country’s energy ambitions. The goal is not to avoid risk, but to manage it deliberately, recognizing not only that different players have different risk tolerances, but that opportunities vary accordingly.

Unlocking the next phase of global competitiveness

The 2025 Energy Transition Index confirms what many forward-looking companies already sense. The momentum of the energy transition is shifting, geographically and strategically. Countries like China, India, Brazil, and Latvia are shaping the frameworks of innovation, equity, and infrastructure that will define global competitiveness in the years ahead.

Emerging economies are establishing their own approaches, not adapting to models set elsewhere, while learning from the successes and challenges faced by others. They are proving that energy transition is not a single path, but many – each shaped by national strengths, industrial priorities, and context. These local models are sources of strategic insight and practical direction for how progress can be achieved across different contexts.

The companies and investors best positioned for the future will align with this momentum by moving capital, talent, and technology into the systems that are already transforming. Building for this future calls for humility, collaboration, and a willingness to learn from the diversity of global experience.

The most successful transitions – whether in emerging or advanced economies – share certain features: clear national targets, stable and supportive policy frameworks, deep public-private collaboration, and innovative financing that de-risks investment and accelerates delivery. These competitive assets enable countries to attract capital, retain talent, and anchor industrial value chains for the long term.

For global companies, this presents a strategic opportunity. Where operating across multiple geographies used to be about scale, it’s now a chance to create synergy between diverse energy systems, to drive cross-border investment, and to help shape the new energy economy from the ground up.

The future of energy is decentralized, digitalized, and deeply strategic. We are witnessing a profound transformation of economic and industrial systems. In this rapidly evolving landscape, resilience will come not from holding on to legacy systems, but from having the agility to navigate complex transitions and the vision to lead them. This transformation is no longer optional – it is the foundation of future growth, industrial leadership, and national relevance.",https://www.imd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/New-China-darmau-b3e_3ZBgz68-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 10:02:24.540261
,Clean Energy ,2025-11-11 08:08:42+00:00,ericsson.com,Ericsson insights: AI and digitalization for energy efficiency,Daniel Paska,,,,,https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2025/11/smarter-energy-with-ai-path-to-decarbonization-digitalization,"It is important to show fact-based numbers on energy consumption, which is why Ericsson has done extensive research on the electricity consumption of the ICT sector, AI, and data centers.
As digitalization accelerates exponentially, the ICT sector, particularly telecommunication networks and data centers, is expected to consume even more electricity.
However, while the energy demand from AI is significant, concerns surrounding exponential increases in usage are mitigated by AI’s advancements toward energy efficiency.
Regarding energy consumption, there is a considerable difference between generative AI—large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini—and dedicated AI services.
Only through connectivity and digitalization can we achieve a decarbonized energy system powered by efficient data centers, responsible electricity consumption of AI, and large-scale renewable deployment.","Digitalization is one of the most powerful enablers of the global shift toward cleaner, smarter, and more resilient energy systems. Yet today’s electricity grids were not built for renewable energy. They were built for fewer, centralized sources such as coal-fired plants. Renewable energy is also often distributed across regions, and the power output fluctuates over time, making predictability a challenge.

To decarbonize and phase out fossil fuels, we must electrify heavy industries and the transport sector. We also need more electricity generated from clean sources such as renewables and to eliminate power produced from fossil fuels.

This is why digitalizing electrical grids and the whole electricity sector is vital to create control mechanisms and to optimize grid management that will support these greener energy goals. If we also digitalize all end users and increase data sharing between users, distributors and electricity producers, we can create a true digital energy ecosystem.

In many ways, this is what we already do within the telecommunications sector when we predict network traffic to optimize network management. The same digitalization principles are needed for electrical grids, for which data is key. And collecting the right and necessary amount of data from electrical grids will require advanced connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI).

In recent years, however, many have feared that the information and communications technology (ICT) sector will require large amounts of electricity from the total consumption due to the rapid adoption of AI and the related expansion of data centers. It is important to show fact-based numbers on energy consumption, which is why Ericsson has done extensive research on the electricity consumption of the ICT sector, AI, and data centers.

As global leaders meet in Brazil for the latest COP U.N. climate talks, the transition and decarbonization of energy, manufacturing and transport sectors – as well as the role of renewable energy deployment – will be key priorities. Countries will present their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which are climate action plans reaching from 2025 until 2035 to achieve the Paris agenda. These will set the pace for the climate transition for the coming years.

Will digitalization further increase energy consumption?

Understanding the true energy impact of digitalization is essential for informed policymaking and investment. As digitalization accelerates exponentially, the ICT sector, particularly telecommunication networks and data centers, is expected to consume even more electricity. Yet this rise will likely be far smaller than many reports suggest. What remains uncertain is how fast AI services and technologies will evolve.

Looking back, most ICT studies have greatly overestimated future electricity usage because they assumed that larger data volumes would proportionally require more electricity to transmit and process the data. However, Ericsson’s own research reveals that while total data traffic has increased by about 80 times between 2007 and 2023, the ICT sector used only 1.4 times more electricity. This means that data transmission and electricity usage are clearly not directly proportionate.

Ericsson has also calculated the estimated electricity usage and potential carbon footprint for the ICT sector, up until 2030. It is expected that overall electricity consumption will continue to increase to approximately 1,245 terawatt-hours (TWh), from about 1,070 TWh in 2024. In recent years, data centers have been identified as the major contributors to the ICT sector’s growing energy consumption, whereas networks have contributed to this growth less.

How much electricity does AI consume?

AI’s overall energy demand is a frequent concern. Current systems use substantial electricity for training purposes and require increasingly powerful hardware. It remains difficult to predict how AI services and technologies will evolve or how energy efficient they will become.

However, while the energy demand from AI is significant, concerns surrounding exponential increases in usage are mitigated by AI’s advancements toward energy efficiency. Ericsson estimates that up to 12 million AI graphics processing units (GPUs) have been in operation at the end of 2023, consuming approximately 21 TWh. This corresponded to approximately 8 percent of the total energy needed for all data centers, and less than 1 percent of the whole ICT sector. By 2028, it is estimated that AI alone will account for approximately 25 percent of the total data center electricity usage. This highlights the urgent need to prioritize energy efficiency in data centers.

Despite the ongoing and predicted rise, AI hardware supply limitations will prevent an exponential increase in energy usage. Additionally, AI chips and other energy-related equipment are becoming more efficient, while new-generation network system standards are gradually incorporating measures related to AI and energy efficiency. Furthermore, deploying new generations of more energy-efficient networks and server systems will allow companies to phase out older and wasteful technologies.

Finally, we need to assess how reliable AI electricity forecasts are. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), AI-related chips have doubled their efficiency every three years, and recent models use 99 percent less power to perform the same calculations as a similar chip from 2008. In addition, the IEA predicts that both servers and AI GPUs will advance with more efficient processors entering the market before 2030.

Regarding energy consumption, there is a considerable difference between generative AI—large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini—and dedicated AI services. Generative AI is trained on large data sets, requiring huge amounts of energy, while more dedicated models with a specific purpose only need smaller data sets for training, meaning a smaller energy footprint and, consequently, a more energy-efficient version of AI.

Let’s look at the European energy sector as an example. Utilities need dedicated and energy-lean AI solutions for grid management and control that could run either through edge computing or in local data centers without relying on the large computing power required for generative AI. Similar solutions and machine learning algorithms are used for network control in telecommunication systems, consuming much less electricity than LLMs.

Why 5G Standalone matters

Decisions on digitalization-related investments and future regulatory policies depend on accurate information and assumptions. The ICT sector’s electricity consumption is an aspect that needs to be considered by utility companies and governments alike, which is why reliable predictions are an important basis for decision-making. These choices are crucial to the successful digital transformation of the energy sector.

As mentioned above, data is key to obtaining the information needed to optimize energy systems and provide functionalities such as AI for grid control and management. Energy-related data needs to flow between end users, distributors, and producers to provide, for example, forecasting, grid management, and flexibility solutions.

Connectivity is critical to obtain this data—and this is where 5G Standalone (SA) becomes so important. In non-standalone 5G, the radio components, such as the base stations, use 5G, while the core relies on legacy 4G technologies. Although this leads to higher speeds and larger bandwidth than 4G, the main advantages of 5G cannot be fully realized

In contrast, 5G SA utilizes 5G base stations and a full 5G core to increase speed and bandwidth. This way, it can support advanced services crucial for the energy sector’s digital transformation and the creation of a future-proof digital ecosystem, including but not limited to network slicing, edge computing, 5G voice, RedCap devices, time-critical communication (TCC), network exposure, and enhanced fixed wireless access (FWA).

In this sense, 5G SA is not just a connectivity upgrade but a foundational technology for the global energy transition.

Conclusion

With COP30, many people now realize that energy and AI should be top of mind. In fact, the host country of COP30, Brazil, decided to present its largely renewable-based energy sector as an opportunity for tech giants looking to establish data centers in the country. This underscores the critical role of connectivity and digital solutions in supporting the green transition of utilities, power grids, transport systems, buildings, and industries. Digital infrastructure needs to be prioritized to help phase out fossil-fuel-based energy sources and decarbonize our societies.

Stable and long-term policy frameworks are crucial for enabling these technologies to reach their full potential, providing the certainty necessary for large-scale investment and innovation. Additionally, the technology sector must continue to develop increasingly energy-efficient data centers, AI solutions, and network architectures, as well as uphold their Net Zero commitments across the entire value chain to keep emissions down.

Digital and connectivity solutions must be seen as equal pillars alongside clean technologies, grids, and renewables. Only through connectivity and digitalization can we achieve a decarbonized energy system powered by efficient data centers, responsible electricity consumption of AI, and large-scale renewable deployment. In short, digitalization is not a byproduct of the energy transition but its backbone.

The post, shared to the r/solar community, described a 7.3-kilowatt system installed on a home in North Carolina. The original poster explained that while their electric company doesn't offer full one-to-one credit for energy buyback, the panels have still made a massive difference.

""We spent about $12,578 after the federal tax rebate and saved $750 this year,"" they wrote. ""I love being able to crank the heat in our home office during a sunny winter day without any guilt.""

The OP also noted that replacing their old gas-powered furnace and water heater with efficient electric appliances has maximized their savings, with their electricity use dropping by over 600 kilowatt-hours compared to the year prior.

For anyone considering making the switch, going solar is definitely one of the best ways to cut your monthly energy bills and help the planet in the process. Sites like EnergySage can help with free tools that make it a cinch to compare quotes from local installers and see estimated costs in just minutes.

With solar tax credits set to begin expiring at the end of the year, homeowners could save thousands by locking in their installation soon.

And those savings can really add up — with EnergySage's help, the average person can save up to $10,000 on solar panel purchases and installations. Its free mapping tool even breaks down the average costs and available incentives by state, helping you secure the best deal possible.

Buying panels outright may not be in everyone's budget, but leasing them can also help you lock in low, predictable energy rates. Palmetto's LightReach program installs panels on your home for no money down, and pairing your panels with efficient electric appliances like the OP really amplifies the savings. Companies like Mitsubishi make it easy to find the right heat pump and installer for your needs.

Speaking of the OP, commenters on the thread were quick to celebrate their savings.

DeMarco notes that those two projects could double-dip by accessing the Canada Growth Fund while also earning investment tax credits without reducing the amount of emissions they claimed.","As Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government moves to spend billions more on tax credits to support clean energy incentives and carbon capture and storage projects, Canada’s environment commissioner says the money already earmarked has not been spent effectively.

A new audit report released last Thursday by Jerry DeMarco said government investments in projects to reduce emissions have been implemented slowly, with far less uptake than predicted.

The report looked at nine measures from Canada’s 2030 Emissions Reductions Plan. Five were investment tax credits and one was a corporate tax break for zero-emission technology manufacturers. The others include the Canada Growth Fund and green bonds.

Collectively, they account for $123 billion in projected costs to taxpayers. The federal budget released Tuesday proposes expanding the availability and extending the lifespan of the carbon capture investment tax credit, projected to cost another $3 billion between 2031 and 2035.

DeMarco said there’s no data to show the impact those investments have had on lowering Canada’s emissions.

“It’s disappointing to see that there isn’t a strong emphasis by the government on estimating the expecting emissions from each tax credit, and as well estimating the value for money for Canadians in these large-scale subsidies,” DeMarco told The Canadian Press.

“We don’t have adequate information from the departments as to the actual expected emissions from each measure. And that’s a theme, not only today, but also our previous audits on the net-zero accelerator (fund) and the emissions reduction plan—two other significant subsidies.”

DeMarco’s report says there was low initial uptake of the tax measures, compared to Finance Canada’s projections.

“For example, fewer than 30 corporations had claimed the corporate tax cut for manufacturers and producers of zero emission technologies since 2022, which was 25% of the projected uptake of $61 million,” the report says.

“For the five Clean Economy investment tax credits that we assessed, the Department of Finance Canada had initially projected that $5.2 billion would be claimed by the end of March 2025. The department’s most recent projections, published in March 2025, forecasted that $9.2 billion is expected to be claimed by the end of 2025.

“However, we found that, as of July 2025, only the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit had claims to be paid out, and those claims totalled only $22 million.”

The report did say taxpayers can still submit claims until the end of the year for the previous three years—so the uptake numbers could change.

“They’re not even pretending to want to meet the 2030 climate target in Ottawa anymore,” said Patrick Bonin, the Bloc Québécois’s climate critic.

“The Liberals prefer wilful blindness, shining the spotlight on 2050 to sweep the dust under the rug. The government must pull itself together and realize that the climate emergency remains.”

DeMarco’s report also says government investment incentives for the oil and gas sector were risky, given the uncertain future of Ottawa’s industrial carbon pricing plan.

“To be effective, investment incentives in both carbon capture, utilization, and storage and low-carbon hydrogen depend on other important climate change policies, such as the industrial carbon pricing system and the Clean Fuel Regulations,” the report says.

“As such, uncertainty in the future of the industrial carbon pricing systems and federal regulations creates risk to the financial viability of private investment in those technologies.”

The federal budget promised to strengthen Ottawa’s industrial carbon pricing system but offered no details on how the government plans to do that.

DeMarco’s report also says that of the $2.7 billion already committed from the Canada Growth Fund—which is meant to support technologies like carbon capture and storage and low-carbon hydrogen—$1.7 billion was allocated to two projects in the oil and gas sector.

DeMarco notes that those two projects could double-dip by accessing the Canada Growth Fund while also earning investment tax credits without reducing the amount of emissions they claimed. DeMarco said it was impossible to say whether that was actually happening.

“This is the only Clean Economy investment tax credit where applicants are not required to reduce their amount claimed when combining with other federal assistance,” the report says.

“We found that the two projects funded by the Canada Growth Fund planned to also claim the investment tax credit, resulting in the federal government covering most of the capital cost of these projects.”

DeMarco also called out the government for not publishing a complete list of its fossil fuel subsidies, which had been expected by December 2024, and for not completing the peer review study it announced in 2018.

As The Canadian Press reported in June, Canada’s progress on the study stalled in 2023 after its partner country Argentina ceased participation, following the election of a right wing populist leader who has referred to climate change as “a socialist lie.”

“A peer review would increase the transparency of the government’s assessment of financial measures directed at the oil and gas sector,” DeMarco’s report said.

Meanwhile, environmental groups blasted the push to keep the power plant open.","Gov. Jared Polis has spent most of his time in office pushing to accelerate Colorado’s transition away from fossil fuels in favor of more climate-friendly ways of generating electricity.

His administration, however, is now intervening to keep a coal-fired power plant running in Pueblo.

On Monday, Xcel Energy joined the Colorado Energy Office and Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate to file a petition asking state utility regulators to extend the lifespan of Comanche 2, a 50-year-old power plant currently scheduled to cease operations by Dec. 31. The coalition instead wants the facility to shutter by the end of 2026.

The request comes as the newer, larger Comanche 3 plant next door remains offline. Xcel Energy has acknowledged the troubled unit hasn’t supplied power since mid-August and isn’t expected to return to service until next June.

“We came to the conclusion that it would be prudent to make Comanche 2 available during that time period,” said Will Toor, the executive director of the Colorado Energy Office.

Coal-fired power plants have closed across the country as power companies shift to cheaper renewables and natural gas. President Trump is now attempting to reverse the decline. Since he returned to office, the U.S. Department of Energy has offered $625 million in investments to reinvigorate the industry and intervened to stop utilities from closing coal plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Some have called for a similar action to save Pueblo's coal-fired power plants. On Oct. 31, Republican Rep. Jeff Hurd, who represents the city, asked the Trump administration to use emergency powers to keep Comanche 2 open indefinitely, saying Colorado might face an “energy emergency” if the plant was shuttered.

Toor insists Colorado doesn’t face an energy emergency, justifying federal action. He also added the state found no reason for Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association to delay its plans to close a coal-fired generating unit in Craig, Colo., at the end of the year.

At the same time, Toor said losing both Comanche 2 and 3 simultaneously could force Xcel to purchase high-cost natural gas over the winter, which could result in a sudden spike in energy bills.

Unlike Hurd’s request to the Department of Energy, the joint petition to regulators would delay Comanche 2’s closing date rather than potentially eliminating it altogether.

Hurd, who’s reviewing the filing, said it’s “consistent” with his request to “protect good jobs, keep energy affordable for families and businesses, and ensure Colorado's grid remains reliable.”

“We must keep this plant operating until dependable power is truly in place in Pueblo,” he added.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Xcel Energy said it joined the petition due to a spike in electricity demand, the outage at Comanche 3 and “supply chain challenges.” The company added that they remain committed to the state’s clean energy goals.

Meanwhile, environmental groups blasted the push to keep the power plant open. In a written statement, Erin Overturf, the clean energy director at Western Resource Advocates, said ratepayers shouldn’t be forced to pay for the poor economics and maintenance issues at aging coal-fired power plants.

“Comanche 3 has been an albatross around the neck of Xcel ratepayers for more than a decade. This request to delay the long-planned retirement of Comanche 2 will lead to increased costs for utility customers at a time when people are already economically struggling,” Overturf said.

It’s not immediately clear who will shoulder the costs of keeping the plant open past its closing date. Joseph Pereira, deputy director of the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, which advocates on behalf of utility customers, said in a statement that Comanche 2 is smaller and less expensive to operate than Comanche 3.

But he added that any costs incurred from Comanche’s 3 outages would still need to be approved by state utility regulators at Colorado’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC).

“It is the responsibility of [Xcel] to ensure their plants are reliable and cost-effective,” he said. “Any deviation from that responsibility should be shouldered by shareholders and not ratepayers.”

Rebecca White, director of the PUC, said that commissioners may issue a decision to keep the plant open in around three to four weeks. The process will also allow regulators to weigh in on longer-term solutions on replacing the electricity generation from the station.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/200107-PUEBLO-EXCEL-COMMANCHE-PO.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 03:59:29.792491

Solar power is the fastest-growing source of new electric generating capacity in the United States, driven by large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) projects built by electric utilities and independent power producers. Delays in bringing these solar projects into operation have been trending down in recent months.

Despite the relatively high number of projects reporting delays in 2024, that year was a record year for U.S. solar capacity additions. Power plant developers added 31 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale solar PV generating capacity in 2024, which increased total U.S. utility-scale solar capacity by 34 per cent. Delays in solar project schedules tend to be relatively short in duration, and reports of delays are more common than cancellations: less than 1 per cent of planned solar capacity is entirely cancelled in a typical month.

Developers of new power-generating capacity report their project’s initial planned operational date on our Annual Electric Generator Report (EIA-860) survey. Beginning 12 months before a project’s planned online date, we ask developers to provide updates on the status and schedule of the project in our monthly update to that annual survey, the Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory.

Because survey respondents may not anticipate the occurrence or duration of delays, ultimate capacity additions tend to be less than the expected amount that developers report to us at the beginning of the year. In January 2024, developers reported plans to bring more than 36 GW of solar capacity online through December 2024, or 5 GW more than the ultimate 31 GW installed.

Along with updates to timelines, we request that developers also categorize the stage of development: planning, permitting, construction, and testing. Much of the reported delayed capacity occurs at projects that are in the late construction or testing phases just before they come online. These delays are typically only for a month or two.

In our most recent monthly inventory of power plants, developers reported plans to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online in the next 12 months (October 2025 through September 2026). About 5 GW of that capacity is from solar projects that delayed their expected online date compared with what they had previously reported.

Under the agreement, Baker Hughes will supply main refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the gas treatment plant. The energy technology firm has also committed to make a strategic investment in support of the project.

Glenfarne is developing Alaska LNG in two financially independent phases. Phase One covers an 807-mile (1,299 km), 42-inch pipeline to transport natural gas from the North Slope to meet Alaska’s domestic energy needs. Worley is expected to complete final engineering and cost analysis in December, ahead of a final investment decision (FID) on this phase.

Phase Two will include the LNG terminal and export infrastructure, enabling 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG capacity, with an FID expected in late 2026.

“Baker Hughes is pleased to support Alaska LNG with our gas technology solutions. Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman and CEO of Baker Hughes.

Since taking over as lead developer in March, Glenfarne has secured preliminary commercial commitments with buyers in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand for about 11 MTPA of LNG, representing over 60% of the volume required to reach FID. These include recent deals with Tokyo Gas, JERA Co., and POSCO International Corporation.

In a press release, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey announced that her administration is teaming up with the University of Massachusetts Lowell to develop ""Advanced Nuclear and Fusion Energy Roadmaps.""

The four-month program aims to map out concise actions within the state by supporting further research, manufacturing, and deployment of advanced nuclear and fusion energy. The end goal of the program will be to ""help affordably, reliably, and sustainably meet increasing electricity demand in New England.""

According to Governor Healey, this roadmap could impact energy production well beyond the state. ""Massachusetts has the ingredients to be a world-class leader in advanced nuclear and fusion energy – technologies that provide affordable power, good jobs, and significant economic development,"" said Healey, per the press release. ""There is nationwide interest in the potential of advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies. Our partnership with UMass Lowell will help us leverage our strengths to lower costs and grow these industries in Massachusetts.""

This advancement includes backing the research efforts of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a recent study published in Nature Communications, MIT researchers developed a new prediction model that combines physics and machine learning to forecast and avoid damaging disruptions in tokamak fusion reactors. This development could be a crucial step toward improving the reliability of fusion power plants.

Allen Wang, lead author of the study and a member of the Disruption Group at MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center, noted the importance of the research. ""For fusion to be a useful energy source it's going to have to be reliable,"" Wang told MIT News. ""To be reliable, we need to get good at managing our plasmas.""

According to a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average price of electricity for New England customers was 27.91 cents per kilowatt hour in July 2025. That was more than 10 cents higher than the national average.

Once built, nuclear plants often have low fuel and operating costs. This allows them to produce power at a lower price, especially compared to energy plants powered by fossil fuels. Not only can nuclear power make energy bills more affordable for residents, but it can also help reduce our reliance on planet-heating fossil fuels.

However, nuclear energy can cause significant environmental concerns with the production of radioactive waste, which can remain dangerous for thousands of years.

But he didn’t. For all his rhetoric about “clean” and “beautiful” coal, US demand fell more than 20% during his first term. As the 47th President, he’s making similar promises. But assuming he’ll fail again would be a mistake. Sure, Trump won’t resurrect the dirtiest fossil-fuel source to its glory days of two decades ago. But he’s likely to arrest its decline, freezing demand at around current levels — and the biggest beneficiary may be China.

First, the data. On current trends, US coal demand will rise this year to about 465 million short tons, driven by higher electricity generation. From one perspective, that’s still down 60% from 2007’s record high and the third-lowest annual consumption in half a century. From another, the year-on-year increase of roughly 55 million tons would be the largest annual jump in 40 years.

Regular readers know I’m a glass half-empty kind of person, so that’s where my pessimistic focus lies. Whichever lens one looks through, US coal consumption has interrupted its decline. In part, that’s due to Trump’s policies, including using emergency laws to keep some coal-fired power stations open.

Once fully operational, Lohum’s REE plant is expected to meet up to 20 per cent of India’s magnet demand by 2027, supporting EV, renewable energy and defence manufacturing.

Lohum, which already operates nine facilities across India, produces a diverse range of sustainable critical materials, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, aluminium, and graphite, and serves over 200 global customers.

BURNEY, CA, UNITED STATES, November 10, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- On October 15, 2025, West Biofuels, a leader in renewable bioenergy solutions, celebrated the official ribbon cutting for Hat Creek Bioenergy, a biomass-to-energy facility which the company constructed and is operating. This flagship facility represents years of collaboration with local, regional and statewide partners and converts forest biomass into renewable power, supporting forest stewardship and providing clean energy directly to the local electrical grid.

The plant is a landmark achievement in sustainable forest management, providing a critical destination for forest biomass, which aids in wildfire mitigation efforts in the community. The project is also a significant driver of local economic opportunity, supporting a team of 15 skilled plant operators, most of whom are from the Burney community. The plant’s construction phase also provided over 60 short-term jobs to the region.

The facility supports the sustainable management of about five square miles a year of forested area by local licensed timber operators and their staff. The residuals from this forest management are delivered to the facility and converted into renewable electricity and carbon sequestering biochar. During the life of the facility, over a hundred square miles of forest area around the Burney community can be made and kept fire-safe, dramatically reducing the risk of a local catastrophic fire.

""This is a proud and exciting moment for our team, our partners, and this community,"" said Matt Summers, Chief Operating Officer of West Biofuels. ""This facility represents years of hard work and a shared vision where clean energy, forest stewardship, and economic opportunity go hand-in-hand. This is an ideal local solution for fire risk reduction"".

The project was made possible through a coalition of dedicated partners and investors. The company extended its deep gratitude to primary investors, Peter Paul and Mieko Willoughby, for their unwavering commitment.

Key grant support was instrumental in the plant's development. The California Energy Commission (CEC), in partnership with the Fall River Resource Conservation District, provided the foundational grant for the facility. Early support also came from the US Forest Service and the USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). Continued support from CalFire, including a Biomass Transportation Subsidy, will be vital for managing local feedstock transportation.

The ceremony featured a lineup of distinguished speakers, including:

• Justin Britton, Wood Products & Bioenergy, CalFire

• Angie Gould, Deputy Director in R&D, California Energy Commission (CEC)

• Gabrielle Stevenson, Assistant Deputy Director, Energy & Climate, GO-Biz

• Bruce Ross, Press Secretary, Office of Senator Megan Dahle

Assemblywoman Heather Hadwick was also in attendance to support the launch.

The West Biofuels team is incredibly proud of this achievement and thanks the local Burney community and state officials for their contributions in making Hat Creek Bioenergy a reality. Future projects will rely on continued support from key stakeholders in order to bring clean energy and healthy forest management practices to rural communities throughout California and the West. The Hat Creek Bioenergy facility is a model that can be replicated in other forest communities with the same vision and effort.

The United Nations annual climate summit, called COP30, begins Monday and is expected to last about two weeks.

This year, the U.S. will not play an active role in the talks. According to a White House statement to NPR, no high-level officials will attend COP30 — breaking a long-standing tradition.

During the previous Trump administration, U.S. delegates participated in the talks. Now, the administration has taken a stronger anti-climate stance, calling efforts to limit global warming a ""hoax.""

""President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,"" says White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

President Trump began to de-prioritize climate in January, when he withdrew the U.S. from the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. In that accord, countries agreed to try to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally less than 1.5 C (2.7 F). The planet is currently on track to warm roughly 2.8 C (5 F) over preindustrial levels by 2100, according to a recent U.N. climate report.

Since the Paris Agreement, the U.S. developed policies to cut climate pollution in ways that would lower future warming. But the Trump administration's sweeping rollbacks to climate policy are affecting those efforts, as well as communities' ability to cope with climate risks, like lengthening extreme heat seasons and increasingly destructive wildfires or floods. Climate experts worry that because the U.S. is setting an example, other countries might pull back on climate goals, too.

If all U.S. climate efforts were discontinued, the U.N. report estimates, the planet could warm by an extra 0.1 C — a small fraction of the total change to the planet, but a chunk that could still have significant real-life impacts.

""Each fraction of a degree matters for communities facing floods, drought, and heat extremes,"" says Ko Barrett, deputy secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization.

Here are six major shifts in U.S. climate policy initiated by the Trump administration.

Rolling back longstanding policies to target climate pollution

In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the ""most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.""

One key component of the administration's efforts focuses on attempting to reverse the ""endangerment finding,"" a legal basis for many of the country's climate policies.

In 2009, the EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a danger to public health and welfare. But legal challenges from fossil fuel interests and their allies delayed the finalization of rules to rein in greenhouse gas pollution. Now, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that 2009 endangerment finding, which could make it easier to roll back other climate regulations.

In July, Trump's EPA argued that the country's climate pollution is not harming people and doesn't need to be regulated in the way courts and previous administrations have chosen to do it.

Reconsidering limits on climate pollution from power plants

In June, the Trump administration announced plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants from the nation's fossil fuel-fired power plants. If the proposal survives expected legal challenges and is finalized, it would eliminate controls on the second-largest source of climate pollution in the U.S., behind transportation.

The administration argues U.S. coal and gas-fired power plants are responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gases that are heating the planet. It says that number is declining — it was 5.5% in 2005. So, the administration argues, reducing it further would provide little benefit to public health. That ignores that the U.S. is responsible for nearly a quarter of the climate pollution in the atmosphere today–more than any other nation, historically.

Withdrawing support for renewable energy technologies

The Trump administration is taking steps to open up more areas of U.S. land and ocean to increased oil and gas exploration. At the same time, it has been dismantling federal support for wind and solar industries, which it falsely labels as risky and unreliable.

The new GOP spending law ends federal tax incentives for wind and solar, throwing into limbo thousands of projects. The Trump administration has also canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects and tried to halt offshore wind projects already under construction. Energy experts say it's too early to know the full impact of these policies, but in the first half of 2025, U.S. renewable investment fell by 36%, according to data from BloombergNEF.

The Trump administration is also targeting subsidies for consumers to buy climate solutions like rooftop solar, efficient heat pumps, and electric vehicles. And it ended a $7 billion grant program for local solar projects. Federal incentives for rooftop solar, heat pumps, and insulation go away Dec. 31. Tax credits for electric vehicles ended Sept. 30.

Cutting climate-preparedness grants nationwide

The Trump administration has also cancelled grants for climate and environmental initiatives around the country. Grant recipients, contractors and activists say the moves have thrown into doubt the government's standing as a reliable partner.

Funding cuts have targeted a range of energy projects, as well, from transmission lines to research on capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the moves would set back American innovation and competitiveness.

Democratic lawmakers warn that cancelling Energy Department funding risks driving up utility bills and slowing economic growth at a time when new data centers and factories are expected to increase electricity demand for the first time in decades.

Slashing federal support for climate science and removing climate data

The Trump administration has systematically removed climate science and climate scientists from the federal government. One of the administration's targets was the National Climate Assessment, which is the most influential and widely-used source of information about how climate change affects the United States. In April, the Trump administration dismissed those who were working on the next edition of the report. In July, the federal website that hosted the most recent edition went dark.

The administration also slashed funding for climate science research at agencies like NOAA, NASA, and even USDA. The cuts have affected long-standing data collection efforts and datasets, like NOAA's Billion Dollar Disaster analysis, which keeps track of the ballooning costs of climate-worsened disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, hailstorms, and floods. The database was discontinued in May.

Lowering federal support for disaster relief and preparedness

As wildfires, hurricanes and storms get more intense, disasters that exceed more than a billion dollars in damage are on the rise. Many communities rely on federal support to prepare, including building flood protection projects, improving evacuation planning and fortifying hospitals and other vital infrastructure. The Trump administration has cancelled more than $4 billion in grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, leaving many communities scrambling to replace that funding and prevent damage from worsening hazards. The Trump administration has said it wants states to take over disaster preparation.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/d37cc13e06039c5dc718ca5d60afe7e1?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-11-11 11:10:11.976983

While lithium dominates headlines, every EV battery contains far more graphite by weight, up to 70 kilograms per vehicle. With China controlling over 90% of the processed graphite supply, Western nations are urgently seeking secure alternatives. That shift is creating a strategic opening for Australian graphite producers, many of which remain undervalued despite strong long-term demand. For investors looking beyond the lithium hype, graphite may offer a more grounded, geopolitically aligned battery play.

What are the Best Graphite stocks to invest in right now?

Why Graphite Matters More Than Investors Think

Graphite plays a key role in lithium-ion batteries. It makes up 10–28% of the battery’s weight and acts as the main anode material, helping lithium ions move during charging and discharging. Without high-quality graphite, batteries can’t work properly.

What’s important for investors is the growing gap between supply and demand. Battery-grade graphite demand is forecast to grow 8–10x by 2030, driven by EV and energy storage adoption. Natural graphite mine output has grown modestly since 2018, but not fast enough to meet projected battery demand. That means producers may struggle to keep up.

For growth investors, this supply crunch could drive prices higher. For value investors, many graphite stocks are still trading well below lithium peers, despite strong long-term demand.

ASX Graphite Stocks Positioned to Benefit

As demand for electric vehicles grows, graphite is emerging as a key material, and these ASX-listed companies offer different ways to invest in the trend.

Syrah Resources (ASX: SYR) – Vertically Integrated with US Support

Syrah is one of the few companies outside China actively producing natural graphite. It produced 26,000 tonnes of natural graphite at Balama in Q3 2025, according to company reports.

– What sets Syrah apart is its vertical integration; it processes graphite at its Vidalia plant in Louisiana, supplying battery-grade anode material directly to US customers.

– Recent US tariffs on Chinese graphite (totalling ~105%) have boosted Syrah’s competitiveness.

– The company’s cash position improved from US$43M to US$87M in Q3 2025, although US$60M remains restricted.

– Key risk: Balama faced a full production halt earlier in 2025 due to civil unrest. Political instability in Mozambique remains a concern for future supply.

Renascor Resources (ASX: RNU) – Australia’s Largest Reserve

– Renascor owns the Siviour project in South Australia, which holds the largest reported graphite reserve outside Africa.

– Strong project economics and low operating costs support long-term growth.

– Renascor is also building a downstream plant to produce purified spherical graphite, a higher-value battery material.

– A key milestone is the Q4 2025 commissioning of its demonstration plant, which will test its HF-free purification process and could unlock better margins.

International Graphite (ASX: IG6) – Modular, Low-Cost Strategy

– International Graphite is taking a staged approach to production, starting with a micronising plant in Collie, WA.

– Stage 1 will produce 4,000 tonnes per year, aiming for early cash flow from industrial-grade graphite.

– The company has already made initial sales from its ISO-certified R&D facility, showing market acceptance.

– International Graphite estimates AU$14.1M–AU$28M in annual revenue potential across its staged Collie operations.

– While smaller in scale than its peers, its capital-light model reduces risk and speeds up time to market.

Novonix (ASX: NVX) – Tech-Driven Synthetic Graphite

– Novonix focuses on synthetic graphite, using proprietary technology to cut costs and emissions.

– Its induction furnaces use 30% less energy and eliminate chemical reagents, making the process cleaner and more efficient.

– The company’s dry, zero-waste method reduces capital costs by ~30% and operating costs by ~50%.

– With US tariffs making Chinese graphite less competitive, Novonix’s domestic production is well-positioned to gain market share.

– Challenge: Synthetic graphite production can cost up to 10x more than natural graphite, though Novonix’s innovations aim to reduce this gap.

The Investor’s Takeaway

Graphite offers a quieter but promising alternative to lithium, with several ASX-listed companies well placed to benefit from rising demand and supply chain shifts.

– Syrah delivers near-term production and US market access, though Mozambique risks remain.

– Renascor holds Australia’s largest resource with government backing, but execution will be key.

– International Graphite offers a lower-risk, early-stage entry with modest scale.

– Novonix brings a tech-driven approach to synthetic graphite with cost and emissions advantages.

For investors looking at battery materials, graphite deserves serious consideration. Its higher usage per battery, supply constraints, and Western support for non-Chinese sources create strong long-term potential. Conservative investors may prefer to wait for production milestones and offtake deals before committing.",https://stocksdownunder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Graphite-Stocks.png,N,,2025-11-11 00:58:27.783428

“This legislation is about making Illinois stronger,” said Vella.
“By investing in clean energy and modern infrastructure, we’re not only reducing bills, we’re creating thousands of new jobs.”","ROCKFORD, Ill. – Working to provide more relief to Illinoisans facing rising energy costs, state Rep. Dave Vella, D-Rockford, passed comprehensive legislation Wednesday evening that seeks to bring down home energy bills both immediately and in the long term for residents, while holding large utility corporations accountable.

“Every Illinoisan deserves affordable, reliable energy,” said Vella. “Families for too long have been paying the price for decisions made by big utility companies. This bill finally lowers the costs of utility bills while increasing accountability.”

Many Illinois residents have seen home energy costs skyrocket. Increased power demands from new high-tech businesses and Washington’s massive tax bill threaten to raise costs even further—resulting in $9.5 billion in increased state energy costs. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (Senate Bill 25) puts Illinois on better footing to counteract rising energy prices by tapping into:

● Capturing clean energy: By capturing and redistributing energy already being produced, including from home solar panels, Ameren and ComEd customers can see immediate relief on monthly costs.

● Increasing battery storage: By building out our grid to increase the state’s battery storage, power systems will become more reliable and affordable to power millions of Illinois homes.

● Investing in energy efficiency programs: Senate Bill 25 directly expands energy efficiency programs for residents, lowering electricity prices by reducing overall demand, and improves equity in programs by allocating a minimum amount of funds to support

low-income customers.

The measure will additionally create up to 115,000 jobs, counteracting job insecurity and layoffs caused by the federal budget bill— including over 50,000 lost manufacturing jobs in Illinois. As utility demands increase during the fall and winter months, Senate Bill 25 will play a significant role in meeting the state’s energy needs, strengthening reliability and helping manage untenable costs for customers for both short- and long-term relief.

“This legislation is about making Illinois stronger,” said Vella. “By investing in clean energy and modern infrastructure, we’re not only reducing bills, we’re creating thousands of new jobs.”",,N,,2025-11-10 23:57:51.375888

Train travel in North America will soon get a lot faster

Choosing electric rail travel over a direct flight can cut emissions by around 86% (though, as The New York Times reported, much of the rail network in America still runs on highly polluting diesel). But while Japan's Shinkansen ""Bullet Trains"" debuted high-speed rail in 1964 and France's TGV marked a global high-speed train revolution once it began rolling in the early 1980s, North American rail travel has languished on the wrong side of the tracks.

But railfans, rejoice! Amtrak partnered with Alstom to deliver its next-generation premium Acela trainsets along 457 miles of track in the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor (NEC) in August 2025. Amtrak's trains can operate at top speeds of 160 mph versus today's fleet, which operates at top speeds of 150 mph, and connect Boston, New Jersey, and Washington, DC as part of a $2.45 billion investment in the NEC. Twenty-eight new trains will enter service through 2027. Elsewhere, high-speed train links operated by various bodies will soon follow between Portland and Vancouver, Las Vegas and Southern California, Miami and Tampa, Houston and Dallas, and, hopefully, San Francisco and Los Angeles-making future journeys faster and more relaxing.

By 2040, rush hour won't exist-thanks to self-driving electric vehicles

EVs and hybrid vehicles are mainstays of freeways, and mobility experts agree that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will transform travel. McKinsey's 2025 The Next Normal report ""The future of self-driving cars: Safer, smarter, and everywhere"" declares that by 2040, autonomous vehicles could be as commonplace as any household appliance-shaping how families organize their days, how cities are designed, and creating a driving experience that is smarter, safer, and all-around better. Hours spent watching the road could be used for video calling a friend, watching a movie, napping, or even working-all of which would make traveling during the daily commute and holiday period a little less painful.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are looking to a future approaching net zero

Long-haul trips account for 60% of aviation emissions and 69.3% of CO2 emissions from passenger travel. Rather than reinventing the wheel, airlines targeting IATA's ""net zero carbon by 2050"" goal are developing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to power existing aircraft engines.

In 2022, Swedish airline BRA made history as the first to operate a regional commercial aircraft with 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Supplier Neste's SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. Used neat, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel use.

Fifty airlines are investing in SAF, and over half a million flights have used SAF to some degree, but the industry is not without its critics. Some SAFs contain biofuels derived from crops, which can put pressure on global food supplies and contribute to deforestation. But the promise of ""synthetic"" or ""e-fuels"" created by artificially combining hydrogen with ambient pollutant carbon dioxide is looking to a future where the SAF lifecycle approaches net-zero.

Air Company's AIRMADE® SAF, which it markets under the dramatic tagline ""Extinction ends here,"" is a fully formulated drop-in jet fuel that can be produced at scale with access to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and clean hydrogen (H₂). AIRCO has commercial partnerships with airlines, including JetBlue and Virgin Atlantic, and has been awarded multiple government contracts, including with NASA and the United States Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Unit. If the technology holds up, it will change the conversation around fuel-based CO2 emissions for good.

Electric, hydrogen-powered, and supersonic aircraft promise to decarbonize and democratize air travel

Various technologies show promise for navigating the skies on short-, mid-, and long-haul trips. LA-based start-up Heart Aerospace's mission is to use sustainable, electrified regional aircraft to reduce emissions and make flying more accessible to more people around the world. Hydrogen-powered engines are a staple in space rockets, but challenging to apply in aviation, yet Airbus has bet big on hybrid hydrogen aircraft-its ZEROe aircraft concept is slated to launch by 2035.

And after the demise of Concorde, supersonic aviation is staging a comeback. Boom's sleek supersonic aircraft, Overture, has an aerodynamic, lightweight carbon-fiber design and new-generation supersonic engines that run entirely on SAF. In ""boomless cruise,"" the aircraft ensures there's no audible sonic boom using Mach cutoff physics, opening up overland routes. Boom has commitments from American Airlines and United Airlines, with the first aircraft due to be delivered in 2029, when passengers can fly from New York to San Francisco in four hours. In a few years, air travel time on some routes around the holidays and year-round could be halved.

Inspired by Star Trek, shuttles powered by ionic wind could enable us to boldly-and silently-go places we've gone before

Down the line, people might even take to the skies in a Star Trek-inspired, ionic wind-powered aircraft. In 2018, MIT engineers built and flew the first-ever plane with no moving parts-instead of propellers or turbines, the light aircraft is powered by an ""ionic wind,"" a silent flow of ions that generates enough thrust to sustain steady flight.

In MIT News, Steven Barrett, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, explained how the aircraft was inspired in part by the futuristic shuttlecrafts in the Star Trek TV shows and movies he watched avidly as a child. The physical principle of electroaerodynamic thrust was first identified in the 1920s, but remained the realm of hobbyists until a jetlagged Barrett did some back-of-the-napkin calculations after an uncomfortable flight. In the near term, he believes ion wind propulsion systems could be used to fly silent drones. Long-term, he says, they might be paired with more conventional combustion systems to create more fuel-efficient, hybrid large aircraft, including passenger planes.

According to Reuters, registrations for the automaker fell steeply in October, signaling that Tesla may be losing ground in regions where it once dominated.

What's happening?

After a brief rebound in September, when Model Y topped Europe's sales charts, Tesla's ride has turned bumpy again.

In Spain, where overall electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid sales jumped 119%, Tesla's numbers dropped 31%. Beyond slowing demand tied to consumer fatigue and rising competition, the company is also falling behind traditional automakers in expanding its EV offerings, and Chinese brands are gaining market share.

""Tesla no longer has the market to itself and that seems to be showing in its sales figures in Europe,"" Ginny Buckley, CEO of Electrifying.com, told Reuters.

Why is this issue important?

This isn't just about Tesla's balance sheet. If the brand that sparked the EV revolution loses traction, new buyers may be discouraged from making the switch — slowing EV adoption at a time the world needs it most.

Road transportation still accounts for roughly 12.2% of global heat-trapping gases produced by human activity, based on data from Climate Watch. To bring this figure down, EV adoption must be accelerated, not slowed.

Yet, some regions seem to be stuck in neutral. Europe, in particular, saw its electric car market flat-line at about 20% of total car sales in 2024 as subsidy cuts cooled demand, according to the Global EV Outlook 2025.

Cost also remains a crucial factor. Analysis from Atlas Public Policy showed that most EVs, including the Model Y, still cost less to own over time, saving EV owners about $8,000 over seven years compared to gasoline models.

But affordability and accessibility depend heavily on steady pricing and continued policy support — both of which are becoming less certain in Europe.

What's being done about it?

Inside Tesla, tensions are growing as sales continue to slide, and the company faces scrutiny over leadership decisions. While the board has proposed a $1 trillion pay package to keep Elon Musk as CEO, Norges Bank Investment Management — Tesla's seventh-largest shareholder — voted to reject it — a sign of investor unease.

Tesla may be navigating through a rough patch now, but its setbacks clear the lane for other EV players. Automakers, both new and established, now share the responsibility of pushing EV innovation forward.

For consumers, Tesla's latest challenges serve as a reminder that EV progress depends on broad industry innovation — every new electric model on the road helps move transportation toward a cleaner future.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Teslas-European-salesimage-recbbFUVakxeJ4UN7-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 01:58:29.485483

In this regular bulletin, DLA Piper lawyers provide concise updates on key developments in the industrials sector to help you navigate the ever-changing business, legal, and regulatory landscape.

Deadline approaches for comments on proposed changes to Chemical Risk Evaluation Process under the TSCA. Today, November 7, is the deadline to submit comments to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on a proposed rule that would change the way the agency evaluates the risks of chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). EPA states that the proposed rule, pursuant to Executive Order 14219, “Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's ‘Department Of Government Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative,” and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative, would streamline such evaluations while increasing transparency and providing a more predictable regulatory process for chemical manufacturers. The current procedural framework for evaluating the risk of chemicals is set out in a 2017 rule that was revised in 2024 to require a single, comprehensive risk determination for each chemical across all conditions of use (COUs). The proposed rule would revert to separate evaluations for each COU. Among other key changes in the proposed rule: EPA would be allowed to take into account occupational exposure controls, such as personal protective equipment, in risk determinations and chemical risk evaluations; would use the definition of “weight of scientific evidence” set out in Executive Order 14303, “Restoring Gold Standard Science”; would eliminate “overburdened communities” from the list of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations” that must be considered in evaluations; and would require less information from manufacturers submitting requests for risk evaluations. See the proposed rule here.

Troutman nomination advances. On October 29, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee advanced the nomination of Douglas Troutman to head the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, which regulates the use of pesticides and chemicals. During his confirmation hearings on October 8, Troutman stated that under his leadership the agency would seek to “provide a clean, safe environment, with an eye toward strong economic growth.” Replying to questions about reviews of new chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), he said that he would seek to expedite such reviews in keeping with President Donald Trump’s support for United States energy dominance. His intent, he stated, is for “nothing to change” regarding EPA’s “robust reviews of new and existing chemicals based on the risk-based process under TSCA.” Troutman most recently served as interim co-CEO of the American Cleaning Institute. Next, the Senate will vote on whether to confirm his nomination.

CSB to investigate Tennessee munitions plant explosion. The US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) will investigate an October 10 explosion at a Tennessee explosives factory in which 16 workers died and the factory was destroyed. The Accurate Energetic System facility in Humphreys County, Tennessee manufactures explosive products for the commercial and defense markets. Since the explosion, the site has been under the control of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), as ATF investigators study the debris field and dispose of hazardous materials, such as damaged, unexploded munitions. As it prepares for its investigation, CSB has been coordinating with ATF and requesting information from the company about the facility and its operations. CSB is the nonregulatory federal agency that investigates incidents that result, or may result, in the catastrophic release of extremely hazardous substances. It does not issue citations or fines but makes safety recommendations to companies, industry organizations, labor groups, and regulatory agencies.

$1.5 billion federal loan for development of low-carbon fertilizer plant in Indiana. On October 29, the US Department of Energy (DOE) finalized a $1.5 billion loan to Wabash Valley Resources, LLC to repurpose an idled coal gasification plant into a new low-carbon ammonia fertilizer factory – the first fertilizer plant in Indiana. This is the second loan guaranteed by the DOE under its Energy Dominance Financing (EDF) Program, created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The plant is scheduled to start production by the end of 2028. Of note: carbon emissions from the plant will be captured and injected into mile-deep underground storage wells; EPA issued permits for the wells in early 2024. The federal government has been working to expand US fertilizer production for some time. The loan process for this Indiana project, for instance, began in 2019. In 2022 and 2023, the USDA awarded grants to numerous industrial projects across the country to develop and expand fertilizer manufacturing capabilities via the $900 million Fertilizer Production Expansion Program. In early January this year, the DOE announced a loan guarantee of up to $1.26 billion to Michigan Potash Company, LLC to help finance construction of a potash solution mine and processing plant.

BIS to suspend the 50-percent ownership rule for certain entities. The White House has confirmed that, for certain entities, the Bureau of Industry and Security’s 50-percent ownership rule (known as the BIS Affiliate Rule) will be suspended for one year – a development arising from negotiations between the US and China in South Korea last week. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the BIS Affiliate Rule is being suspended “in return for the suspension on the rare earth licensing regime” by China’s Ministry of Commerce, which has agreed to issue general licenses to export rare earths until November 27, 2026.

EPA reverses course on coke emissions standards. In a reversal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has signed a final rule that reinstates the original compliance deadline for the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coke Ovens. Coke is a key component in steelmaking. The tighter standards governing emissions from coke plants were originally slated to go into effect in July 2025, but, that month, the agency extended their compliance deadline by two years, stating that the industry could not feasibly implement them. The final rule signed by Zeldin last month reinstates the original effective date. The rule establishes stricter emissions limits for emissions of such substances as mercury and requires plants that manufacture coke to install fenceline monitoring systems for releases of benzene. Also in July, EPA extended the compliance deadline for a separate rule, Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, by two years. At this writing, it is unclear whether that postponement too will be reversed.

Another PFAS added to Toxics Release Inventory. EPA has added sodium perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS-Na), a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS), to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) list. The agency advises facilities subject to reporting requirements for PFHxS-Na to begin tracking their activities involving that chemical starting January 1, 2026. Reporting forms are due to EPA by July 1, 2027. The addition of PFHxS-Na to the TRI arises from the agency’s finalization earlier this year of a toxicity value, “IRIS Toxicological Review of Perfluorohexanesulfonic Acid (PFHxS, CASRN 335-46-4) and Related Salts.”

ACEA urges European Commission to revise emissions targets for carmakers. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), which represents 16 major Europe-based vehicle manufacturers, has asked the European Commission to recalibrate its fleet average emissions targets for manufacturers of motor vehicles, arguing the 2035 zero-emission target is unrealistic given weak electric vehicle demand and gaps in the charging network. ACEA supported various proposals put forward by the Commission, including allowing manufacturers to meet their 2025–2027 emissions targets based on a three-year average (rather than annually), providing incentives such as super credits for small EVs, and recognition of plug in hybrids, range extenders, and carbon neutral fuels. The group also seeks credit from the Commission for using decarbonized materials like green steel.",https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/dlapiperukl0cbf-dlapiperba5d-devd44d-3fa6/media/project/dlapiper-tenant/dlapiper/brand-images/dla-piper-og-image-default-logo.jpg?h=1302&iar=0&w=2500,N,,2025-11-11 01:58:33.502287

Significantly, EPA’s proposal would exempt imported articles from reporting. Once the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register, it will be subject to a 45-day comment period.

Proposed Exemptions to PFAS Reporting Rule

The TSCA PFAS reporting rule, originally finalized in October 2023, requires that manufacturers of PFAS and importers of PFAS and PFAS-containing products report extensive information to EPA about the products they manufacture and import going back to January 1, 2011 (See Hunton’s prior blog post about this rule). The rule does not include any of the exemptions that are traditionally part of TSCA reporting rules, which has caused widespread concern from regulated entities about the massive regulatory burdens created by the rule, particularly for importers of finished products containing any amount of PFAS.

EPA now proposes to add key exemptions to the reporting requirements, including for:

1) PFAS imported as part of an article;

2) PFAS manufactured or imported in a mixture or article below a 0.1% de minimis concentration;

3) PFAS that are impurities;

4) PFAS that are byproducts not used for a commercial purpose or PFAS that are manufactured upon incidental exposure or end use of another substance (referring to the exemptions in EPA’s premanufacture notice (PMN) regulations at 40 C.F.R. § 720.30(h));

5) PFAS that are non-isolated intermediates; and

6) PFAS that are manufactured or imported in small quantities for research and development (R&D) purposes.

Other than the de minimis exemption, these exemptions are typical of TSCA reporting rules, including the chemical data reporting rule (CDR). EPA is also requesting feedback on whether it should consider adding a production volume threshold by which reporting on a given PFAS would not be required, similar to the exemption in the CDR for chemicals manufactured or imported under 25,000 lbs. (or 2,500 lbs. for chemicals subject to certain TSCA actions).

Proposed Extension of Submission Period

EPA is also proposing to delay the reporting submission window, which is currently from April 13, 2026 – October 13, 2026. The new reporting window will start 60 days after the effective dates of the final rule and will last for three months rather than six months. EPA did not provide an update in the proposed rule regarding the status of the development of its electronic reporting application within EPA’s Central Data Exchange (CDX). EPA has experienced numerous delays in developing this reporting tool for the PFAS reporting rule, resulting in multiple delays of the submission period.

What Aspects of the Reporting Rule Are Staying the Same?

Based on the language in the preamble, EPA intends to retain the original reporting lookback period of January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2022.

EPA is also maintaining its current definition for PFAS as including at least one of these three structures:

R-(CF2)-CF(R’)R”, where both the CF2 and CF moieties are saturated carbons;

R-CF2OCF2-R’, where R and R’ can either be F, O, or saturated carbons; and

CF3C(CF3)R’-R”, where R’ and R” can either be F or saturated carbons.

While EPA is not proposing any changes to the definition of PFAS, it is taking comment on whether it should limit reporting to only PFAS with a Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN), TSCA Accession Number, or LVE number.

The specific data required to be reported to EPA, as well as the “known to or reasonably ascertainable by” due diligence standard, remain the same.

Purpose of Proposed Revisions

According to EPA, this proposed rule is intended to make the TSCA PFAS reporting requirements more practical and implementable and to reduce unnecessary, or potentially duplicative, reporting requirements for businesses while maintaining the ability to obtain important use and safety information on PFAS. EPA’s press release includes a statement from Administrator Lee Zeldin that the current TSCA PFAS reporting rule imposes “crushing regulatory burdens and nearly $1 billion in implementation costs on American businesses,” whereas “today’s proposal is grounded in commonsense and the law, allowing [EPA] to collect the information [it needs] to help combat PFAS contamination without placing ridiculous requirements on manufacturers, especially the small businesses that drive our country’s economy.”

EPA is reassessing whether the volume of potential data collected justifies the total burden of implementing the rule and what Congress had intended when it added this requirement to TSCA Section 8. It is intended to maintain meaningful reporting on PFAS while exempting entities that are “least likely to have relevant information.”

Assessment of the environmental footprints of AI servers This study employs a state-level allocation method to evaluate the energy, water and carbon footprints of AI servers.","The accelerating deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) servers is being fuelled by the growing demand for generative AI applications, ignited by milestones such as the release of ChatGPT in 20221. Projections signal even greater impact, exemplified by the recent Blackwell platform, which analysts herald as a new Moore’s Law era2. Pronouncements from influential AI industry figures3 on both demand and supply sides are seen as transformative shifts for the entire data-centre industry. Whereas AI has been employed in various fields to advance sustainability4,5, the remarkable energy requirements of AI itself raise concerns regarding not only energy provisioning challenges6 but also water scarcity and climate change issues stemming from the energy–water–climate nexus of AI data centres1,7,8. However, the holistic energy–water–climate implications of AI computing are largely unknown, constrained by untransparent industry reports and limited data.

The climate impact of AI servers will stem primarily from their operations (Scopes 1 and 2)9 and supply-chain activities (Scope 3), including manufacturing and end-of-life treatment10,11. The Scope 2 emissions from indirect energy purchases are expected to constitute a substantial portion and indicate a high dependency on the increase of AI server energy consumption. According to the International Energy Agency12, 0.6% of global total carbon emissions comes from the data centres and data transmission networks due to their electricity consumption. The industry energy consumption could double by 2026, motivated by AI and other sectors13, threatening decarbonization targets under the Paris Agreement14,15, which include a 53% reduction in data-centre emissions by 2030 and net-zero goals for the AI sector. Further, growing AI server energy consumption implies an increasing water footprint through Scope 1 (direct cooling) and Scope 2 (indirect procurement) water use8,16. Centralized installation in water-stressed regions may perturb local water balance and threaten supply for millions17,18.

Previous research has developed bottom-up and top-down methods to assess energy–water–carbon outcomes of servers19,20,21, but these approaches face challenges with the rise of AI servers. Top-down approaches based on activity indices, such as data traffic and computing instances, fail to accurately represent AI-driven workloads22,23. Detailed bottom-up approaches suffer from limited data availability and lack of industry insight7. Assumptions valid for traditional collocation centres often fail for AI data centres, which differ in installation and operation24. Recent studies have explored computing task-based analyses to better quantify AI-related energy and resource consumption, providing insights but lacking systematic policy guidance25,26. Two notable contributions are the 2024 data-centre report by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory27 and the 2025 Energy and AI Report by the International Energy Agency28, which present scenarios estimating US and global data-centre energy use under highly uncertain AI growth. Although use of confidential commercial data may limit reproducibility, they offer important benchmarks. Our study extends this foundation by (1) developing an open-source, bottleneck-based modelling approach with comprehensive uncertainty analysis; (2) systematically assessing energy, water and carbon impacts, incorporating dynamic interactions with local energy systems; and (3) proposing actionable mitigation strategies for potential net-zero trajectories across different AI server deployment scenarios.

Here we analyse the combined energy–water–climate impact of operational AI servers in the United States between 2024 and 2030, balancing importance and future uncertainties and addressing a series of fundamental questions. (1) What are the magnitude and spatiotemporal distributions of energy consumption, water footprint and climate impact from AI server deployment? We address this using temporal projection models and regional frameworks, assuming deployment mirrors current large-scale AI data-centre patterns. (2) What are the prospects for near-term net-zero pathways? We evaluate this by analysing best- and worst-case scenarios of key drivers, including industry efficiency improvements, server location distribution and grid decarbonization. The results of these analyses are presented in the following sections.

Investment in AI servers is accelerating, as seen in projects such as the $500 billion Stargate3. While AI advancement is a key priority, our study highlights its environmental impact. To mitigate these risks, we identify that concentrating AI server deployment in Midwestern states—Texas, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota—is optimal, given their abundant renewables, low water scarcity and favourable projected unit water and carbon intensities. These states possess substantial untapped wind and solar resources, enabling robust green power portfolios and reducing competition with other sectors. Their lower water stress also helps ease public concerns and reduces the need for costly water-saving measures. However, several implementation challenges must be acknowledged. Texas, crucial to the optimal strategy, may need to support an additional 74–178 TWh of AI server demand, possibly exceeding its current total renewable generation of 139 TWh (ref. 38). This scale-up would require substantial investment in new renewable capacity and transmission infrastructure, which is already constrained by existing congestion39. Meanwhile, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota currently host minimal data-centre capacity, indicating that most of their existing internet infrastructure may support only residential or standard industrial applications. This raises potential connectivity and security concerns for high-performance AI services. Enabling AI-grade infrastructure in these regions will require broadband and security upgrades, with associated emissions and capital costs increasing the expense of the optimal strategy. These challenges underscore the complexity of sustainable siting decisions and highlight the need for strategic coordination to ensure that AI investments support both technological leadership and long-term sustainability goals.

Expanding AI servers in the suggested regions may be further obstructed by public health concerns and other impacts on local sustainable development. Operational demands and construction of supporting facilities could generate air and water pollution through fossil fuel use, substantial water consumption and large-scale construction and transportation. To address these issues while managing economic costs, we recommend that AI companies engage in public–private partnerships with local governments. Such partnerships could alleviate governmental budget pressures, create local jobs and mitigate health concerns by funding green power upgrades and monitoring systems, such as tracking PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less) levels, through combined AI investment and regulation. For the governments, implementing tax exemptions on a related facility could incentivize a win–win development process, and it is essential to ensure transparent accountability within public–private partnerships to prevent privatized gains at public cost. Beyond environmental benefits, these measures could stimulate local economic growth, as evidenced in Virginia40. This discussion outlines policy recommendations for both industry and legislative stakeholders that balance economic and environmental impacts. They also emphasize energy market adaptations as AI-driven hyperscale loads challenge utilities‘ ‘duty to serve’. Requirements to connect large data centres could lead to server collocation with energy generation, but as shown in this study, these choices should not crowd out renewable investments to decarbonize the economy. Finally, the effectiveness of the recommended policy may be influenced by broader political and economic factors beyond the scope of this study.

The challenges associated with the optimal spatial distribution of AI servers introduce substantial uncertainties to the projected reductions of 73% and 86% in carbon and water footprints, respectively, under best-practice scenarios. These challenges are unlikely to be offset by improvements in efficiency or decarbonization efforts beyond what has already been considered. Our best-case scenario for industry efficiency approaches the physical limits of AI data centres. Moreover, projections from the US Energy Information Administration offer limited support for additional grid decarbonization compared with the considered best case41. These constraints suggest that, without additional interventions, AI data centres are likely to generate substantial environmental impacts in the coming years. Consequently, AI companies are expected to continue investing in the offset mechanisms, including power purchase agreement, carbon removal and water restoration, reaching an unprecedented level of reliance on them to accomplish their net-zero aspirations by 2030. Nevertheless, severe concerns could be raised regarding the complexity of securing long-term contracts and providing convincing reduction credits9,42, especially bearing in mind the considerable capacity that would be needed. We argue that AI companies should shift to a more transparent approach by closely cooperating with third-party verification groups, service providers and governmental agencies. Such collaboration could reduce uncertainties through better integration of social resources and serve as a model for other electrified sectors.

Emerging high-efficiency technologies in hardware and software, exemplified by DeepSeek43, may fundamentally transform AI server supply and demand. As reflected in the study’s five scenarios, these innovations may cause deviations of up to 393 million m3 in water footprints and 20 MtCO2-equivalent in emissions between minimum and maximum impact cases, underscoring the need for tailored managements. While efficiency gains may reduce cost per computing task, they risk a rebound effect, where lower costs increase total application volume. This dynamic, as reflected by the high-application scenario, may amplify total demand and complicate AI’s environmental trajectory. To address these uncertainties, we recommend government agencies work with industry to establish real-time monitoring systems, enabling timely alerts and proactive measures before considerable environmental impacts occur. Moreover, the potential increase in total computing jobs poses both challenges and opportunities, calling for ongoing enhancements in energy and water efficiency through system optimization and adoption of strategies such as SUO and ALC to manage the added workload complexity and flexibility. Therefore, we also suggest the data-centre industry establish AI-specific benchmarks for energy, water and carbon performance, which is crucial for continuous operational efficiency gains.

The methodology framework of this study aims to achieve two goals: (1) draft the energy–water–climate impacts of AI servers in the United States from 2024 to 2030 to handle the massive concerns about AI developments, and (2) identify the best and worst practices of each influencing factor to scheme the net-zero pathways for realizing water and climate targets set for 2030. Compared with many previous climate pathway studies, which often extend predictions to 2050 for better integrating climate goals, this study focuses on the period from 2024 to 2030 due to the great uncertainties surrounding the future of AI applications and hardware development. For assessing these uncertainties, scenario-based projections are first constructed to obtain potential capacity-increasing patterns of AI servers. Technology dynamics, such as SUO and ALC adoption, are defined with best, base and worst scenarios, and a similar method is employed to capture the impact of grid decarbonization and spatial distribution. The utilized models and data required during the calculation process are illustrated in the following sections. More details on model assumptions and data generation are provided in sections 1–4 of Supplementary Information.

Data description and discussion

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the data used in this study. Historical DGX (Nvidia’s high-performance AI server line) parameters were sourced from official documentation, and future scenarios were projected on the basis of historical configurations and current industry forecasts. To attain the units of AI servers, we collected the most updated industrial report data for projecting the future manufacturing capacity of CoWoS technology, which is the bottleneck for top-tier AI server production. The data resources of the preceding process have been introduced and validated in section 1 of Supplementary Information. AI server electricity usage was assessed using recent experimental data on maximum power44,45, idle power44,46 and utilization rate46,47,48,49, derived from existing AI server systems. PUE and WUE values for AI data centres across different locations were calculated using operational data from previous studies30,50 and industrial resources51, combined with the collected average climate data for each state52. The allocation ratios of AI servers to each state were determined on the basis of configurations of existing and planned AI data centres, which are collected from reports of major AI companies in the United States, as data resources detailed in section 2 of Supplementary Information. In addition, projections for grid carbon and water factors were derived from the ReEDS model31, using its default scenario data33. All datasets employed in this study are publicly available, with most originating from well-established sources. A key uncertainty lies in estimating the number of manufactured AI server units, as official supply-chain reports remain largely opaque. To maintain transparency and ensure reproducibility, we rely on the best available industry reports rather than commercial sources such as International Data Cooperation data53, which are not granted for open access and would limit future validation despite their potential to provide better estimates. The validations of applied data are further detailed in sections 1 and 4 of Supplementary Information.

AI server power capacity projections

The energy consumption of AI servers is projected to be driven predominantly by top-tier models designed for large-scale generative AI computing6,7. This trend is attributed to their substantial power requirements and the increasing number of units being deployed. In this study, we estimate the power capacity of these high-performance AI servers by examining a critical manufacturing bottleneck: the CoWoS process54. This process, which is controlled nearly exclusively by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, serves as a key determinant of the manufacturing capacity for AI servers in recent years55. Our analysis uses forecast data and projection assumptions of the CoWoS process to estimate total production capacity. Other factors are integral to translating this capacity into the power capacity of AI servers: the CoWoS size of AI chips, which determines how many chips can be produced by each wafer; the rated power of future AI servers, which reflects the power demand per unit; and the adoption patterns of AI servers, which dictate the mix of various server types over time. The values of these factors are derived mainly from the DGX systems produced by Nvidia, which is the dominant product for the top-tier AI server markets56.

Considering the influencing factors for the total AI server capacity shipments and existing uncertainties, we generate distinct scenarios as follows:

Mid-case scenario: the CoWoS capacity is projected to slightly increase after 2026, consistent with the growth rate in 2023. Under this scenario, AI servers’ rated power is expected to have a linear relationship with the anticipated die size increase while adoption patterns remain aligned with current trajectory.

Low-demand scenario: characterized by lower CoWoS capacity growth and lower AI server rated power compared with the mid-case scenario, this reflects a scenario of lower overall demand for AI servers.

Low-power scenario: maintains the same assumptions as the mid-case scenario but with lower AI server rated power, representing efficiency gains in AI hardware and software development.

High-application scenario: assumes lower AI server rated power alongside high CoWoS capacity, capturing the potential rebound effect where efficiency gains drive increased AI workload deployment.

High-demand scenario: features higher CoWoS capacity expansion, higher AI server rated power and higher adoption of new servers compared with the mid-case scenario, reflecting a scenario of strong AI server demand.

Based on the assumptions and scenarios outlined, the annual projections for top-tier AI server shipments and their average rated power are calculated as follows:

$$\begin{array}{l}{N}_{\mathrm{AI}}=\frac{{C}_{\mathrm{CoWoS}}\times {R}_{\mathrm{Nvidia}}\times {\sum }_{i}{R}_{i}{n}_{i}}{{N}_{\mathrm{GPU}}}\\ {\bar{P}}_{\mathrm{AI}}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i}{R}_{i}{P}_{i}\end{array}$$

(1)

where \({N}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) and \({\bar{P}}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) represent the annually projected shipments and average rated power of the top-tier AI servers. \({R}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) is the ratio of CoWoS capacity allocated to top-tier AI servers and is set as 40% for 2022, 40.7% for 2023, 48.5% for 2024 and 54.3% for 2025, according to industry reports57,58. For years beyond 2025, this ratio is assumed to remain constant at the 2025 value due to a lack of further data. The sensitivity analysis regarding this value is provided in Fig. 6. \({C}_{\mathrm{CoWoS}}\) is the projected CoWoS capacity within each scenario. \({N}_{\mathrm{GPU}}\) is the number of graphic processor units (GPUs) per server and is set as 8, reflecting the configuration of most commonly used AI server systems59. In addition, \({R}_{i}\), \({n}_{i}\) and \({P}_{i}\) represent the projected adoption ratio, units yield per CoWoS wafer and rated power of the ith type of chip at each year, respectively. The details of the projections and related data resources are provided in section 1 of Supplementary Information, Supplementary Figs. 1–4 and Supplementary Table 1.

AI server electricity usage calculation

The applied AI server electricity usage model is a utilization-based approach initially derived from CPU (central processing unit)-dominant servers60 and can be written as the following:

$${P}_{\mathrm{server}}=({P}_{\max }-{P}_{\mathrm{idle}})u+{P}_{\mathrm{idle}}$$

(2)

The preceding model assumes the total server power has a linear relationship with the processor utilization rate u. While this relationship has been well validated for CPU machines, its application to GPU utilization is less established except for a few cases61. However, several recent studies have shown a strong correlation between GPU utilization and overall server power consumption when dealing with AI workloads44,46, indicating that GPUs are the dominant contributors to energy use in AI servers45. Although systematic experimental validation specific to GPUs is still limited, the consistency of findings across various case studies supports the assumption that the linear relationship applies here as well. The maximum power \({P}_{\max }\) and idle power \({P}_{\mathrm{idle}}\) are generated on the basis of the recent DGX system experimental results, and their values are set as 23% and 88% of the server rated power, respectively44,46. The sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify the uncertainty, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. Moreover, the GPU processor utilization \(u\) is calculated as the following:

$$u={u}_{\mathrm{active}}\times {r}_{\mathrm{active}}$$

(3)

where \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) and \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) represent the average processor utilization of active GPUs and the ratio of active GPUs to total GPUs, respectively. Note that the \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) and \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) commonly have higher values during training compared with inference62. Specifically, we use currently available AI traces, including Philly trace47, Helios trace46, PAI trace48 and Acme trace49, to determine the \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) for training and inference tasks. These traces provide comprehensive analyses on the relationship between GPU utilization rate and job characteristics. Based on the data provided in these works, the \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) is set as 50% and 90% for inference and training, respectively. Moreover, the \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) values are further determined on the basis of recent experimental studies44. The values are set as 50% and 80% for inference and training, respectively. Therefore, the processor utilization rates for inference and training in this work are set as 25% and 72%, respectively. Following the previous works63,64, our base estimations assume 30% of computing capacity for training and 70% for inference. A detailed sensitivity analysis on the impact of these utilization rate settings is provided in Fig. 6.

Assessment of the environmental footprints of AI servers

This study employs a state-level allocation method to evaluate the energy, water and carbon footprints of AI servers. To capture the current and future distributions of AI server capacity, we compiled data of current and in-construction large-scale data centres belonging to major purchasers of top-tier AI servers, including Google, Meta, Microsoft, AWS, XAI and Tesla. The analysis incorporates the location, building area and construction year of each data centre to calculate the state-level distribution of server capacity by annually aggregating the total building area for each state. On the basis of our calculations, no major changes in spatial distribution are projected between 2024 and 2030, even with the anticipated addition of new data centres. Therefore, we assume the current spatial distribution will remain constant from 2024 to 2030 to account for uncertainties in directly integrating the projected contributions of in-construction data centres. Further details on the methodology and spatial distribution results are provided in section 2 of Supplementary Information.

For each state, the actual energy consumption can be derived from the server electricity usage and the PUE value of AI data centres. Meanwhile, the water footprint and carbon emissions should be analysed across three scopes. Scope 1 encompasses the on-site water footprint, calculated on the basis of on-site WUE (shortened as WUE in this work) and on-site carbon emissions (typically negligible for data centres18). Scope 2 includes off-site water footprint and carbon emissions, which are contingent on the local grid power supply portfolio. Scope 3, representing embodied water footprint and carbon emissions during facility manufacturing, lies beyond the spatial scope of this study. A regional PUE and WUE model, following the idea in previous research30,50, is applied to estimate the PUE and WUE values of AI data centres in different states. This hybrid model integrates thermodynamics and statistical data to generate estimations on the basis of local climate data. Specifically, we collected the average climate data of each state between 2024 and 2030 from an existing climate model52, which is then employed in calculating the PUE and WUE values of each state. Considering that the specific cooling settings for AI data centres are unknown, the base values are calculated by averaging the worst and best cases. The model parameters are detailed in Supplementary Table 2. Subsequently, the Scope 2 water footprint and carbon emissions are calculated on the basis of the grid water and carbon factors derived from the ReEDS model31. This approach also allows us to incorporate the projected data-centre load data, which can further interact with the grid system through services such as demand response. The validation of the ReEDS model results by using current high-resolution data is presented in Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8, and the related discussion is presented in section 4 of Supplementary Information. Optimization and analytical techniques are employed to determine optimal parameters during the simulation to generate the best and worst practices concerning industrial efficiency efforts, spatial distributions and grid decarbonization. Moreover, the water scarcity and remaining renewable energy potential data of each state are computed on the basis of the calculated environmental cost and standard data from previous literature18,65. The preceding calculation process depends mainly on previously established approaches, and its integration into our framework is further discussed in sections 3 and 4 of Supplementary Information.

Uncertainties and limitations

There are substantial uncertainties inherent in projecting the evolution of AI servers. Our analysis presents a range of scenarios based on current data to evaluate the impacts of data-centre operational efficiency, spatial distribution and grid development. However, several key uncertainties remain an unmodelled field for this work. For a better understanding of our study and to outline future research directions, these uncertainties are categorized as follows:

Model and algorithm innovations: the model and algorithm breakthroughs in the AI industry could fundamentally alter computing requirements.

Supply-chain uncertainties: the complex production process of AI servers may reveal new bottlenecks beyond the current CoWoS technology, leading to varying expansion patterns.

Hardware and facility evolutions: continued improvements in AI computing hardware and data-centre efficiency may substantially affect the environmental impact of these servers.

Out-of-scope factors: there are other major contributors that are out of the scope of this study and would be critical to the process, such as market forces and geopolitical influences.

The impacts of these factors are multifaceted and challenging to model with existing data. For example, while the recent release of DeepSeek has been interpreted as reducing the energy demands of AI servers, it may also trigger a rebound effect by spurring increased AI computing activity, ultimately resulting in higher overall energy, water and carbon footprints43. However, no fresh data have become available to simulate this complex process, based on our best knowledge when drafting. To further assess the influence of unpredictable uncertainties, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on key factors, including manufacturing capacities for AI servers, US allocation ratios, server lifetimes, idle and maximum power ratios and training/inference distributions. As shown in Fig. 6, our findings suggest that the key conclusions of this study are expected to remain robust as long as the impact of future uncertainties does not notable exceed the ranges considered. Given the highly dynamic nature of AI evolution, our modelling approach allows for future revisions as more data become available on potential shifts in industry trends.

She didn’t know until 2022 that all three of her homes were right above the plume, a Superfund Site that is a remnant of the neighborhood’s historical dry cleaning and metalworking industry.
The Meeker Avenue Plume was first discovered in 2007 and was declared a national Superfund Site in 2022, meaning it gets prioritized for cleanup with federal funding.
“It makes me feel like the institutions that are supposed to watch over this are totally failing us,” Ray said.
The office of Kristen Gonzalez, a state senator representing New York’s District 59, confirmed that discussions are ongoing regarding such legislation.","Upon entering Heidi Vanderlee’s railroad apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, a visitor will hear her two cats purr from opposite ends—but will not see or smell anything unusual apart from that. The threat from pollutants wafting out of the Meeker Avenue Plume, a contaminated Superfund Site under the four-story building, is invisible.

“I’ve lived within the plume without knowing it the whole time,” said the 40-year-old entertainment publicist.

It’s Vanderlee’s third apartment in the neighborhood since moving to Greenpoint in 2008. She didn’t know until 2022 that all three of her homes were right above the plume, a Superfund Site that is a remnant of the neighborhood’s historical dry cleaning and metalworking industry. While she lives on the third floor and the vapors primarily affect the lower levels, she feels that every tenant in the building should know if they are at risk of breathing in hazardous chemical vapors seeping through foundation cracks and dirt floors. Long-term exposure to these vapors is known to cause cancer, reproductive health problems, and nervous system damage. The landlord never told Vanderlee and tenants of the other seven units because he was never required to — and that is what she and others are trying to change by pushing a new state-level right-to-know legislation that would make Superfund Site disclosure mandatory.

“My landlord wants our rent and not to be bothered,” said Vanderlee about her landlord, who owns four buildings in the plume and lives in one of them. “He won’t do stuff if he’s not legally required to do it. He doesn’t even get his own building tested.” (NYCity News Service could not independently verify this claim.)

The Meeker Avenue Plume was first discovered in 2007 and was declared a national Superfund Site in 2022, meaning it gets prioritized for cleanup with federal funding. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been in charge of investigating the full extent of the contamination from this site in the area of Brooklyn that potentially affects 1,000 buildings — and developing a cleanup plan. To determine whether a building is affected by vapor intrusion and needs mitigation vents, the EPA must take air samples inside. While this testing is free, landlords must give permission.

“That is absolutely the hardest thing,” said John Brennan, EPA’s remedial project manager. Landlords deny access for many reasons. However, most often “people don’t want to know,” or are afraid that it might negatively affect their property values, said Brennan.

Tenants have been frustrated with that tendency to ignore what could be a serious problem. The issue has come up at many community meetings—usually attended by 15 to 25 people, and sometimes as many as 50—as well as in individual conversations, said Brennan. In September 2024, the EPA estimated that 25 landlords had outright denied the agency access for testing. “The number has probably gone up slightly since that time,” Brennan added. Vanderlee, who is a member of the Meeker Community Advisory Group, which is the point of contact between the EPA and the local community, attributes the reticence of landlords in the area to “greed” that is “pretty gross,” she said.

The EPA can enforce testing in some cases, but only for very compelling reasons and on a case-by-case basis, Brennan says, for example, if the tenant is pregnant and much more at-risk for the health issues arising from the plume. The last time the EPA enforced testing was in early 2024.

Even after a building is tested, surrounding residents have a hard time getting a hold of the results because of privacy laws. Instead of releasing the individual results of the 240 tested buildings, the EPA published cluster maps, which only give a rough idea of where contamination hotspots are. Residents are pushing back against this opacity.

“If there is a contamination problem of this scale, I think the tenants should have a right to know,” said Anne Ray, 46, a fiction writer who has lived within the plume-affecter area since 2017.

She discovered the plume from an EPA flyer on her door. Worried about harming her good relationship with her landlord, Ray didn’t want to bring up testing again. She said that her landlord had previously denied her request in 2023. However, an official rule that would enforce testing would go a long way towards convincing a “law-abiding” person like him, she said, but no such rule currently exists.

“It makes me feel like the institutions that are supposed to watch over this are totally failing us,” Ray said. “And it makes me feel angry.”

The Meeker Community Advisory Group has been trying to push legislation that would require landlords to disclose potential Superfund exposure at the state level for about a year, and things seem to be moving. The office of Kristen Gonzalez, a state senator representing New York’s District 59, confirmed that discussions are ongoing regarding such legislation. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, who represents District 50, including Greenpoint and parts of Williamsburg, said in a statement that she “would absolutely support legislation that provides tenants with more transparency and agency, and I look forward to its introduction.”

Natalie Vichnevsky, 49, a member of the advisory group, noted that such a legislation would be “something to build on.”",https://cdn.nycitynewsservice.com/blogs.dir/9/files/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-10-at-8.03.18-PM-1152x759.png,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:19.014125

The funding deal also allows the company to call on an additional $6M of equity funding should the need arise, for a total investment of up to $16M.

The funds will be used to scale production of the Company’s proprietary organic flow battery electrolyte beyond the United States and demonstrate its efficacy in real-world field pilot demonstrations by pairing it with commercially available flow battery hardware.

“The close of our Series A funding round represents a key milestone for Quino Energy on our mission to establish our safe, low-cost flow batteries as the leading solution for mid- to long-duration energy storage, as well as for multi-cycle per day applications,” said Eugene Beh, Co-Founder and CEO at Quino Energy. “Because our organic electrolyte can be used in vanadium flow battery hardware with minimal modification, we will be able to scale rapidly in partnership with our friends and allies in the flow battery industry. The new electrolyte factory we are planning will enable production at a cost lower than vanadium, the incumbent flow battery electrolyte. Ultimately, we expect to come in at just one-quarter the cost of vanadium at GWh scale and bring big cost reductions to the entire flow battery industry.”

Quino Energy’s flow battery technology and electrolyte production process present numerous strategic advantages in today’s energy storage and utility markets, including a lower cost floor compared to lithium-ion systems and far below that of vanadium flow batteries. The company’s organic flow battery electrolyte is created through an innovative, zero-waste continuous-flow production process, using inexpensive and abundant feedstocks derived from coal tar. Besides being backward-compatible with mature, established vanadium flow battery hardware, Quino Energy’s mildly alkaline, chloride-free electrolyte is also broadly compatible with carbon steel tanks ubiquitous in oil storage infrastructure that could be repurposed as battery storage facilities.

""Atri, a company headquartered out of Hyderabad, India, focuses on providing 'Socially Relevant & Economically Viable' Energy Transition solutions to users at large – all driven by access to cutting-edge technologies. At Atri, we believe that the world needs reliable, sustainable yet commercially viable alternatives for LDES needs, quickly,” said S Kishore, Founder of Atri Energy Transition. “Quino Energy’s organic electrolyte can revolutionize the energy storage sector by enabling large scale deployment of commercially-viable LDES solutions. We are excited to partner with Quino and believe that this partnership will lead to penetration of flow battery technology across the world.""

Earlier this year, Quino Energy received a $10M grant from the California Energy Commission and $5M in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Critical Facility Energy Resilience (CiFER) program to support a 5 MWh flow battery deployment in Southern California. Quino Energy also secured a strategic agreement with TerraFlow Energy to advance organic electrolyte chemistries for use in large-format flow battery solutions in June 2025. The company has also previously received funding through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)’s Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office (AMMTO) to support the development of its pilot electrolyte production line in Buffalo, New York.

“These mechanical innovations collectively enhanced safety, reliability, and operational efficiency throughout the St. Lucie loading campaign,” the company said.","According to Holtec, its Global Site Services unit achieved an average pool-to-pad duration of 2.8 days per multipurpose canister, with the fastest loading completed in 56.15 hours. Each canister contained 37 pressurized water reactor fuel assemblies.

Located in Jensen Beach, Fla., St. Lucie is a 2,136-MWe PWR operated by NextEra subsidiary Florida Power and Light (FPL).

Horizontal to vertical: The dry storage campaign marks St. Lucie’s transition from its legacy horizontal spent fuel storage to Holtec’s high-capacity HI-STORM FW system. According to Holtec, the system’s vertically ventilated concrete overpack minimizes the size of the ISFSI and enables efficient cooling through natural convection.

In addition to being able to coax additional storage capacity from the existing ISFSI, the vertical cask system has reduced the site boundary dose by creating a self-shielding cask array configuration and allowed FPL to defer the need for new pad construction by many years, according to Holtec.

Innovations: Holtec added that the St. Lucie project employed several of its latest technological innovations, developed with input from its Holtec User Group. This included a “threadless” remote valve assembly device, an embedded drain line, and a “boltless” mating device.

Meanwhile, the council of governments is developing the Dallas-Fort Worth Air Quality Improvement Plan, a several hundred page document consisting of strategies to improve North Texas air quality.","North Texas has seen 44 days so far this year when the region’s air pollution reached unhealthy levels, according to the latest data.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality issued Ozone Action Day alerts for 41 of those days.

In October, the state environmental commission issued eight alerts. That was a drop from September, which saw 14 ozone alerts issued, the most of any month this year, according to data from the North Central Texas Council of Governments, the agency tasked with monitoring Fort Worth-Dallas air quality.

Such alerts are issued when smog is forecasted to exceed the federal limit of 70 parts per billion.

Ozone measured between 71 and 85 parts per billion is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups including young children, older adults, people with respiratory conditions and those active outdoors, according to the council of governments.

The alerts inform the public when weather conditions are favorable for ozone so they can adjust daily routines to minimize health risks and exposure to unhealthy air conditions. The alerts also serve businesses and industries, urging them to mitigate emissions, such as those generated by cars and power plants.

By Nov. 10 last year, 43 alerts were issued for Fort Worth-Dallas. While alerts have yet to be issued this month, the public could see additional days of high levels of air pollution as ozone season begins in March and runs through November, according to the state environmental commission.

Exposure to ozone can cause health issues such as chest pain, trouble breathing, coughing, irritation and congestion. The gas can also exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema and cancer.

Major polluters in North Texas could face annual fines of $45 million if ozone is not brought down to or below 70 parts per billion by 2027 under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Air Act.

Whether companies in violation will see those fines is uncertain as EPA officials propose changes to deregulate energy companies.

Within days of his presidency, Donald Trump vowed to roll back federal regulations. That includes revoking the scientific finding from 2009 that allows the EPA to enforce climate change-focused regulations on cars, power plants and other major sources of greenhouse gases.

In June, the EPA announced the closing of its Office of Research and Development, which analyzes health dangers stemming from toxic chemicals, climate change, smog, wildfires, indoor air contaminants and water pollutants, according to a report from National Public Radio.

The proposal to revoke the 2009 scientific finding requires a lengthy review process, including public comment, before it can be finalized next year, according to the Public Broadcasting Service.

Environmental advocacy groups are expected to challenge the ruling in court if implemented.

Meanwhile, the council of governments is developing the Dallas-Fort Worth Air Quality Improvement Plan, a several hundred page document consisting of strategies to improve North Texas air quality.

The council of governments has until Dec. 1 to submit the plan in order to be considered for federal grant funding.

Those estimates put the annual resource consumption of the AI industry in the range of the entire state of New York.
Despite the sobering forecast, You and his fellow researchers are optimistic about the possibility of addressing the issue of data centers through sound policy.
The world’s densest data center hub remains Northern Virginia’s “data center alley” outside of Washington, D.C., where the industry clustered itself over decades because of tax breaks, fiber infrastructure and proximity to federal agencies.
With utilities rushing to build new gas-fired power plants in order to support the power demands of AI projects, environmental experts have warned that data centers could upend progress toward reigning in emissions.","When Cornell University systems engineer Fengqi You started modeling the environmental footprint of data centers three years ago, the AI boom was just beginning. Even then, You and his colleagues noticed something missing from the conversation.

“When we started this, we saw that AI was growing very fast,” You said. “It was clear it would have to be aligned with power-grid planning, with water and other resource planning. There were no discussions about these topics—but we wanted to bring real numbers, rigorous analysis on AI’s physical footprints.”

You and his team’s new paper, published Monday in the journal Nature Sustainability, delivers those numbers—and they’re enormous. Depending on how fast the AI industry expands, the authors predict U.S. data centers could annually consume as much water as 10 million Americans and emit as much carbon dioxide as 10 million cars. Those estimates put the annual resource consumption of the AI industry in the range of the entire state of New York.

Despite the sobering forecast, You and his fellow researchers are optimistic about the possibility of addressing the issue of data centers through sound policy. The report highlights the necessity of decarbonizing the electrical grid, improving energy and water usage efficiency inside data centers and moving the AI industry to areas of the country better suited to its sustainable development.

“We’re still early in this growth, it’s in our hands now,” You said. “It’s not too late yet to do the planning and accounting for resource constraints that could let AI continue to grow.”

Where to Build—and Where Not To

The study highlights that from one state to the next, the environmental cost of AI looks radically different. It breaks down grid mixes and water resources state by state to show how the data center boom will affect various parts of the country differently, and outlines policy suggestions that can mitigate its impact.

The world’s densest data center hub remains Northern Virginia’s “data center alley” outside of Washington, D.C., where the industry clustered itself over decades because of tax breaks, fiber infrastructure and proximity to federal agencies. Now that the demand for data center construction is exploding, You warns that Northern Virginia “won’t have enough resources to support the growth of the AI industry in a sustainable way, there are too many constraints in terms of energy and water.”

The report projects that through 2030, Northern Virginia will continue to be the dominant location for data center construction, despite the area’s resource constraints. That’s why, You argues, policymakers need to be pushing companies now to start looking away from Northern Virginia and toward states with more sustainable prospects for the AI boom.

“The key point we’re trying to make is that for the new projects, we have a chance to decide right now,” You said. “And we need to think about somewhere else.”

The study points to Midwestern states in particular, where water availability and the potential for renewable energy infrastructure could help mitigate the strain that data center construction exerts on resources and emissions.

“States like Texas, Montana, Nebraska, for instance, they have enough water supply and have good targets for getting clean energy and sufficient power supply,” You said.

By redirecting AI infrastructure to these regions, the researchers argue, the U.S. could sharply reduce the environmental impact of the industry without a major slowdown in its growth.

A Fork in the Road for Climate

The paper’s findings arrive amid escalating alarm over AI’s growing appetite for electricity and resources. With utilities rushing to build new gas-fired power plants in order to support the power demands of AI projects, environmental experts have warned that data centers could upend progress toward reigning in emissions.

A report released last month by the Center for Biological Diversity estimated that, if current trends continue, data centers in the United States could account for nearly half of all emissions from the power sector that current national climate targets would allow.

The report warned that “because of expected fossil fuel–reliant AI data center growth, all other electricity-consuming sectors would need to increase their carbon-emissions cuts by 60%” in order to still meet the United States’ 2035 climate target.

Jean Su, one of the report’s authors, told ICN that despite the current obsession with AI, “unfettered data center growth is not an inevitability.”

“Technology optimists are saying AI is going to solve the climate emergency and cure cancer,” Su said. “But the way to actually resolve the climate emergency is to phase out fossil fuels. Scientists have already told us how to do it, we don’t need AI, we just need political will.”

But political headwinds in the U.S. are blowing in the opposite direction, with President Donald Trump gutting renewable energy projects and vocally championing the use of coal and gas. “Projections show that data centers are going to be powered by fracked gas through 2035,” Su said, “and that’s in the political interest of the president and in the interest of the fracked gas industry.”

Su stressed that the public interest needs to become part of the conversation around data center construction, with residents given the opportunity to weigh in on whether new projects in their home states will actually benefit them.

You’s study shows that the Biden administration’s 2035 climate goals—slashing greenhouse gas emissions across the economy and transitioning the U.S. power sector away from carbon pollution entirely—remain technically achievable, but only if AI infrastructure aligns with major policy changes. The authors point to the need for tighter regulation, greater transparency and AI-specific benchmarks for energy and water usage, not unlike fuel efficiency standards for vehicles.

The study adds to a growing body of reports which emphasize how the next few years will be crucial in determining how the AI boom affects climate issues in the United States. According to Su, the country must decide who this new technology will truly serve.

“We can’t let billionaire corporations dictate policy while the rest of us pay the price,” she said. “We have to ask what’s actually in the public interest.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2217198248-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:01.647787

By the same token, the region could be well-positioned to capitalize on robust reshoring incentives.

Thanks largely to Michiganders, the U.S. exports $79 billion in motor vehicles (fourth after pharmaceuticals, fossil fuels and aerospace technology). The U.S., however, imports $146 billion in motor vehicle parts, each one affecting sticker prices and, in a sense, the fortunes of businesses of every size.

Deloitte, realizing the myriad questions that changes to trade policy raise for U.S. manufacturers, recently analyzed the current landscape and offered guidance to industry leaders. The bottom line: Companies must remain agile while balancing resilience and cost.

New policies, new impacts

According to Deloitte’s report, “Enhancing Supply Chain Resilience in a New Era of Policy,” U.S. manufacturing growth has been trending positively for more than a decade. Manufacturing establishments increased from roughly 334K to 410K from 2013 to 2024, and construction spending rose by $181 billion over the same span.

However, also on the rise is supply chain volatility. U.S. manufacturers, impacted by the pandemic, geopolitical dynamics, trade tensions, rising costs and labor shortages, have reshored or nearshored their supply chains in recent years. Supply chain strategy is likely to continue to evolve as the current administration seeks to prioritize and incentivize domestic manufacturing. In fact, a recent survey by The Conference Board of over 1,700 global C-Suite executives found 71% of CEOs plan to alter their supply chains over the next three to five years.

Tax, regulatory and energy policies are also affecting supply chain decision-making. Despite this, 78.2% of respondents to a Q3 2025 National Association of Manufacturers survey cited trade uncertainties as their top business challenge.

Canada and Mexico are critical factors in supply chain decision making. Motor vehicles are the top imports from these neighbors, who along with China are the U.S.’s top three trading partners. And motor vehicle parts are the U.S.’s number-three imported manufactured product category, $82 billion of which comes from Canada and Mexico. New surcharges on imported steel and aluminum could further affect domestic auto manufacturing decisions.

Looking ahead to further manufacturing growth

Deloitte’s report offers several considerations that could help manufacturers bolster growth in this uncertain environment.

Conduct scenario planning. Assess a range of potential trade-policy effects on manufacturing costs. Map exposure based on the country of origin for parts and materials, and factor in potential for trade deals or reactions from trading partners.

Implement near-term strategies. Consider front-loading imports to secure inventory. Seek to renegotiate supplier contracts based on new trade costs. Apply for any available exemptions or exclusions. Evaluate transfer pricing strategies and assess first sale for export customs valuation structures.

Evaluate overall supply chain strategies. In addition to near-term tactics, manufacturers may need to consider reconfiguring the supply chain for long-term advantage. Key decision factors include availability of skilled labor; tax, regulatory and energy policy; proximity to key plants and customers; and geopolitical risk.

Improve the worker experience. Use digital tools to attract and retain talent and take an ecosystem approach to hiring and developing the workforce.

Monitor the landscape. Manufacturers can continuously watch for potential changes in trade policy and key economic indicators (e.g., inflation, interest rates and consumer confidence).

These actions can help companies prepare for whatever comes next, even though predicting exactly what that is can be challenging. In any case, U.S. trade policy could affect Michiganders.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/ind_man_glb_ho_2158_lo.png,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:29.904203

The agreements were announced today in a ceremony in Washington, D.C. with Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright.

“Baker Hughes is a welcome partner for Alaska LNG because of their leadership in LNG compression technology,” said Brendan Duval, CEO and founder of Glenfarne. “Their participation reflects Alaska LNG’s momentum and its ability to attract global partners to achieve national and state energy objectives.”

“Baker Hughes is pleased to support Alaska LNG with our gas technology solutions,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman & CEO of Baker Hughes. “Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market.”

“American LNG is not just an energy source, it’s a strategic asset that powers our economy, strengthens our alliances, and secures our nation’s future,” said Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “By forging this strategic alliance and investment in the Alaska LNG Project, we’re strengthening our nation’s energy security while advancing a bold vision for U.S. energy independence and global competitiveness. Together, through partnerships with industry leaders like Glenfarne and Baker Hughes, we’re building the infrastructure and partnerships that ensure U.S. leadership in reliable, responsible, and affordable energy for decades to come – starting in Alaska.”

“Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in our nation’s history,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Today’s investment announcement is an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the energy security of America and our allies. The Trump administration remains committed to unleashing Alaska’s energy potential, including by supporting Alaska LNG.”

Glenfarne is developing Alaska LNG in two financially independent phases to accelerate project execution. Phase One consists of an 807-mile, 42-inch pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to meet Alaska’s domestic energy needs. Worley is expected to complete final engineering and cost analysis for the pipeline in December leading into a final investment decision on this phase of the project.

Phase Two of the project will add the LNG terminal and related infrastructure to enable 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG export capability and is expected to declare FID in late 2026.

Glenfarne became lead developer of Alaska LNG in March. Since then, Glenfarne has secured preliminary commercial commitments with leading LNG buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand for 11 MPTA of LNG, more than 60% of the volume needed to reach FID, including recent agreements with Tokyo Gas, JERA Co. Inc. and POSCO International Corporation.

Investments in wind and solar fell 18% year-over-year (YOY) for the first half of 2025. Nonetheless, energy capacity growth in the United States remains highly focused in the renewables corner, representing more than 30 gigawatts year-to-date (YTD) as of September.

Some experts predict renewables deployment could continue to grow into 2026, in spite of supply chain pressures, uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and a shifting policy landscape. Some sections of the alternative energy market—specifically, nuclear energy and clean hydrogen—may be particularly attractive to investors, thanks to surging demand from data centers and a more supportive position from both sides of the political aisle. With that in mind, the three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) below are worth keeping an eye on heading into the new year.

URA Is a High-Flying Uranium Equities ETF

The Global X Uranium ETF NYSEARCA: URA provides a targeted play on the expected long-term resurgence in uranium demand. With estimates suggesting reactor demand could double by 2040, URA offers investors exposure to a portfolio with 50 uranium-focused equities.

The ETF is highly concentrated in two of the biggest names—Cameco Corp. NYSE: CCJ and Oklo Inc. NYSE: OKLO, representing 22% and 14% of the portfolio, respectively—but is otherwise fairly diversified.

URA also has a position in the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust Fund OTCMKTS: SRUUF, providing some exposure to physical uranium.

About two-thirds of the portfolio represents companies based in Canada or the United States, two key centers for the uranium industry.

URA has shone brightly this year, climbing by about 87% YTD. Though it is fairly expensive with an expense ratio of 0.69%, investors expecting this rally to continue may find the cost to be well worth it.

NLR Offers Broader Nuclear Exposure With Lower Fees

Investors seeking a slightly cheaper alternative to URA might turn to the VanEck Uranium+Nuclear Energy ETF NYSEARCA: NLR. NLR is also a globally-focused ETF with a broader mandate that covers companies related to all aspects of the nuclear energy industry. This means that NLR's basket includes mining firms, companies that build nuclear reactors, those that produce energy from nuclear sources, and more.

While the strategy is broad, NLR's portfolio itself is narrower than URA's.

NLR has only 27 holdings, and it is highly concentrated—more than half of its assets are invested in just 10 companies.

Nonetheless, NLR is a popular option among investors seeking wide exposure to the nuclear industry as a whole, while those favoring a uranium-focused strategy might opt for URA instead.

NLR has also posted impressive results this year, climbing by about 74% YTD. Its annual fee is 0.56%, still expensive compared with passively managed ETFs, but more competitive within the niche space of nuclear energy funds.

HYDR Bets on Hydrogen's Explosive Growth Potential

Clean hydrogen has massive growth potential, with production estimated to increase by 28 times in the next five years. The Global X Hydrogen ETF NASDAQ: HYDR is currently the only pure-play hydrogen fund available and could benefit significantly if this growth materializes.

Still, investors should keep in mind that this fund is small (it has just $81 million in managed assets and has a low one-month average trading volume of around 71,000) and therefore higher risk than some other options in the alternative energy space.

HYDR's portfolio is narrow, aligning with the relatively small corner of the market dedicated to clean hydrogen technology and production.

The fund holds just 26 positions, with the largest two representing a combined half of the invested funds. Still, investors willing to take the risk might find that HYDR's sizable returns of about 104% YTD make it quite compelling. Additionally, the fund's expense ratio is 0.50%, which is lower than the other two ETFs on this list.

Although many drivers question this practice, automakers provide information on charging times up to 80% because this area concentrates the maximum charging powerin addition to protecting the battery lifeTherefore, this disclosure presents more efficient figures that are consistent with real-world use.

From the start, the batteries achieve better performance between 20% and 80%Since they receive energy with less resistance. However, when this value is exceeded, the vehicles automatically reduce power to preserve the internal cells. In this way, the final stage becomes slower and more sensitive.

How does the reduced charging speed work?

As the industry explains, the loading process involves exothermic electrochemical reactions...which release heat throughout the charging process. Therefore, in the last 20%, the temperature naturally increases. And, for this reason, the charging rate decreases, preventing... internal damage to the lithium-ion complex.

The technical explanation from the SAE Brazil expert.

Rosolem reinforces. protection strategy widely used in the industry.

Calibration is required for some models.

Although not all vehicles prominently display this information, some models occasionally require a full recharge to calibrate the battery's internal reading. Despite this, the ideal daily charging level is up to 80%.

Key points about the procedure:

• Maximum power occurs between 20% and 80%.

• Above 80%, the car reduces the charging speed.

• Charging to 100% frequently accelerates degradation.

• Recharging up to 80% protects the lithium-ion battery pack.

• Some models require occasional full load to calibrate the system.

Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.
“There’s no stopping it,” said former U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement.
Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.
“The Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,” said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England.","BELEM, Brazil — The world has changed dramatically in the decade since leaders celebrated a historic climate agreement in Paris a decade ago, but not quite in ways they expected or wanted.

Earth’s warming climate has gotten nastier faster than society has been able to wean itself from burning the coal, oil and natural gas that emits carbon pollution that triggers global warming, several scientists and officials said.

There’s been progress — more than a degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) has been shaved off future warming projections since 2015 — but the lack of enough of it will be a big focus for the next two weeks as diplomats gather in Belem, Brazil, for annual United Nations climate negotiations.

“I think it’s important that we’re honest with the world and we declare failure,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany. He said warming’s harms are happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.

But diplomats aren’t giving up.

“We’re actually in the direction that we established in Paris at a speed that none of us could have predicted,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd that agreement, which requires countries to come up with plans to fight warming.

But the speed of humanity’s climate-fighting effort is slower than the acceleration of climate’s harms, she said, adding that means that “the gap between the progress that we see on the ground and where we ought to be, that gap is still there and widening.”

U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said that the world is “obviously falling behind.”

“We’re sort of sawing the branch on which we are sitting,” she said.

Danger signs

The planet’s annual temperature jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit) since 2015, one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. This year will be either the second or third hottest on record, Copernicus calculated. Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.

Deadly heat waves have struck not just traditional hot spots like India and the Middle East, but even in more temperate places such as the Pacific Northwest in North America and Russia’s Siberia.

Earth has been hit repeatedly with more costly, dangerous and extreme weather. The decade since 2015 has seen the most Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes and the most billion-dollar weather disasters in the United States, according to records kept by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. America has been hit by 193 disasters that cost at least $1 billion in the past 10 years for a total bill of $1.5 trillion.

Wildfires have consumed parts of Hawaii, California, Europe and Australia. Floods have devastated parts of Pakistan, China and the American South. And many of those, but not all, have had the fingerprints of human-caused climate change, scientists have calculated.

Since 2015, more than 7 trillion tons of ice in the world’s glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have disappeared, ice scientists calculate. That’s the equivalent of more than 19 million Empire State Buildings.

Sea level rise is accelerating. In the past decade, the world’s seas have gone up 40 millimeters (1.6 inches). It may not sound like much, but it’s enough water to fill 30 lakes the size of Lake Erie, according to Steve Nerem, a University of Colorado professor who researches sea level rise.

Even the Amazon, where the climate negotiations will convene, has gone from a planet-saving region that sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air to a region that, because of deforestation, at times is spewing them.

Success in bending the curve

But there’s also a lot that officials celebrate in the past 10 years.

Renewable energy is now cheaper in most places than polluting coal, oil and natural gas. Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green choices, according to two July U.N. reports. In 2015, a half-million electric vehicles were sold globally, and last year it was 17 million, the report said.

“There’s no stopping it,” said former U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement. “You cannot hold back the tides.”

In 2015, U.N. projections figured that Earth was on path for almost 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since the mid-1800s. Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.

But that’s nowhere near the goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a level that scientific reports say is more or less the danger line and which became the Paris Agreement’s overarching goal.

“Ten years ago we had a more orderly pathway for staying away from 1.5 degrees C entirely,” Rockstrom said. “Now we are 10 years later. We have failed.”

A report examining dozens of indicators of progress — such as solar and wind power installations — in transitioning from a fossil fuel economy found that none were on pace for keeping warming at or below the 1.5 degree goal.

The report by the Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Analytics, the Climate High-Level Champions, ClimateWorks Foundation and World Resources Institute found that 35 of them are at least going in the right direction, although far too slowly.

“Technologies, once hypothetical, are now becoming a reality. And the good news is that reality has outpaced many of the projections a decade ago,” said report author Kelly Levin, science and data chief at the Bezos Earth Fund. “But it’s not nearly fast enough for what’s needed.”

Pollution keeps growing

Methane levels in the atmosphere increased 5.2% from 2015 to 2024, while carbon dioxide levels jumped 5.8% in the same time, according to NOAA data.

Several developing countries, including the United States and the rest of the developed world, have reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by about 7% since 2015, but other countries have seen their emissions soar, with China’s going up 15.5% and India’s soaring 26.7%, according to data from the Global Carbon Project.

Oxfam International looked at global emissions by income level and found that the richest 0.1% of people increased their carbon emissions by 3% since 2015. Meanwhile, the poorest 10% of people reduced their emissions by 30%.

“The Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,” said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England. “Unfortunately, it is one of those half-full, half-empty situations where you can’t say it’s failed. But then nor can you say it’s dramatically succeeded.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/11/Climate-summit-2015-AP.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 20:00:33.866691

Virtual power plants gaining momentum

In its third-quarter investor presentation Thursday, Sunrun said it had more than 106,000 customers enrolled in home-to-grid virtual power plant programs. That figure is up over 400% from a year ago. Sunrun expects enrollments to continue rising in the years ahead, and estimates $2,000 in value per participating subscriber.

Sunrun already has 3.7 GWh of dispatchable battery capacity online and aims to have 10 GWh active by the end of 2028, it said. The company operates one of the United States’ largest virtual power plants, with 416 MW dispatched last year across 17 active VPP programs, CEO Mary Powell said Thursday.

As a leading U.S. installer of residential solar and energy storage systems, Sunrun is well-suited to grid flexibility programs, it says. It has more than 1 million customers, more than 217,000 of whom have solar with attached battery storage. In the second quarter, the most recent period for which it provided data, Sunrun said it accounted for 21% of residential solar installations in the U.S. and 42% of energy storage installations.

Though Sunrun also sells solar and storage systems directly to customers, it says leasing subscriptions account for more than 95% of its sales.

The subscription model — also known as leasing or third-party ownership — allows it to retain ownership of and monetize the equipment it installs through federal clean energy investment tax credits, tax equity financing and participation in VPP programs. Sunrun has 36% of the U.S. market for solar subscriptions, according to its third-quarter investor presentation.

Sunrun said Thursday its emphasis on subscriptions will also help it avoid a widely expected sales cliff when the federal tax credit for customer-owned solar systems expires at the end of next month. While analysts foresee the U.S. solar market contracting as much as 30% in 2026 and 2027, Sunrun said it expects “positive volume growth and margin expansion” next year.

Steady battery attachment growth

Powell and other Sunrun executives have repeatedly touted Sunrun’s shift to a “storage-first” posture following unfavorable changes to net metering policy for solar-only customers in key markets like California.

The strategy appears to be paying off with steady growth in Sunrun’s battery attachment rate for new customers, which rose from 60% in Q3 2024 to reach 70% in the second and third quarter of 2025.

Powell said Sunrun’s attachment rate is growing quickly in markets beyond the sunny southwestern United States. In Massachusetts, for example, attachments surged from 10% at the start of 2025 to more than 50% in the third quarter, she said. And Sunrun has circled back to attach storage for more than 2,000 solar-only customers, a market Powell said would be key for long-term value creation.

“We believe this will … produce strong expected upfront margins for Sunrun and serve as an accelerant to growth in our distributed power plant capacity,” she said.

Focus on subscriber value from solar leases

Sunrun’s subscriber value reached $52,446 in the third quarter, up 11% from a year ago. After accounting for customer acquisition costs, net subscriber value was $13,205, up 38% year over year.

Aggregate subscriber value, or the total value of all Sunrun subscribers, rose 10% year over year to reach $1.6 billion. Creation costs rose just 3% year over year to land at $1.2 billion. Sunrun attributed the increased margin to operational efficiencies, cost controls, growth in higher-value offerings like its Flex product and support from the federal clean energy investment tax credit, which extends through 2027 for third-party owned solar and battery systems. Those improvements that outpaced the added costs of attaching storage at more customer sites, Sunrun said.

At the same time, subscriber additions declined 1% year over year to just over 30,000 in the third quarter.

Powell declined an analyst’s request for guidance on installation volumes in 2026, saying Sunrun is focused on subscriber quality over quantity.

There are specific challenges that have driven overcapacity in specific markets: heavy incentive spending in China, the U.S.'s own EV incentives and the European Union's aggressive regulations.
We've seen some companies try to divert EV battery production plans to make energy storage systems instead, for instance.
One silver lining: While EV battery demand wavers, the AI frenzy is driving up demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS).
If battery companies have too many EV batteries, they could repurpose them to help balance the grid.","Capacity to build EV batteries far outstrips demand globally, a new report says.

It's worst in China, but the overcapacity issue exists in every major market and poses financial risks for battery makers.

Material and production costs are still high, which means EVs often aren't cheaper than gas cars, reducing demand.

The electric vehicle world has a new problem: too many batteries.

Capacity for building EV batteries outpaces demand for those batteries in every major market, a new report from consulting group AlixPartners claims. In North America, there is 1.9 times as much capacity as demand. In Europe, the capacity-to-demand ratio is 2.2.

And China, there is an absolutely stunning flood of capacity: 5.6 times as much battery-building capacity as there is demand for batteries. With tariffs restricting the country's EVs and components from major markets, too, it's a tenuous time to be a Chinese battery supplier. But, frankly, it's not like things are going better in the rest of the world, as AlixPartners Senior Vice President Rohit Gujarathi explained to me.

EV battery manufacturing capacity far outstrips demand for EV batteries, putting the industry under pressure.

""At the industry scale, globally, really five times the demand versus three times the demand is not really very different. No matter where you go at this moment, the capacity is still way beyond what the demand is,"" Gujarathi said in an interview. Because even if North American capacity looks better on paper, it is under-supplied in some ways. There's very little local production of lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, for instance, which offer lower costs and better durability at the expense of density.

But there's little incentive to build new capacity right now, as existing plants are already overbuilt for current demand, the report says. There are specific challenges that have driven overcapacity in specific markets: heavy incentive spending in China, the U.S.'s own EV incentives and the European Union's aggressive regulations. Overall, though, a key factor has been that consumers just have not responded to surging electric options the way automakers, experts and regulators anticipated.

The main reason they haven't, Gujarathi says, is cost.

""What consumers care about is: 'What's the price of the vehicle?'"" he said.

""Does it make economic sense to me? The point of view right now is, in most cases, no, especially as a lot of government support has been taken away,"" he added. Despite abundant supply pushing down prices, EV battery production and material costs remain high, and companies cannot sell them for less than they cost to build in the long term. Already, this instability is putting financial pressure on battery firms.

This comes as the U.S. has now removed its federal tax credit and rolled back emissions standards that pushed automakers to offer zero-emissions vehicles. The result will likely be a contraction in the EV market, but no one can quite say how big of a drop we'll see. The numbers weren't great last month, but they also reflect that many consumers pulled forward purchases to take advantage of the tax credit before it expired on September 30.

Regardless, a shrinking market won't help the capacity-to-demand ratio. AlixPartners expects it to grow to 2.4 by 2028 and stay around that level through 2030. This reflects the firm's earlier revision of North American EV penetration in 2030. Last year, it predicted that 36% of new vehicle shoppers in the U.S. would buy EVs in 2030. This year, it revised that figure down to 18%—a 50% drop in predicted demand.

The result will likely be further consolidation of existing battery plants and efforts, including deals like the one in which General Motors sold off its stake in a battery plant it once shared with LG Energy Solution. Gujarathi said he also expects to see companies launch LFP battery factories in the U.S. to address the cost problem.

This tracks, as we already know GM is putting North American LFP batteries in the new Chevy Bolt. But overall demand for these low-cost EVs remains unproven, so expect companies to stay agile. We've seen some companies try to divert EV battery production plans to make energy storage systems instead, for instance. But regardless of how exactly companies manage the excess supply, the uncertainty of today's market is certain to impact the future of affordable EVs.

One silver lining: While EV battery demand wavers, the AI frenzy is driving up demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS). If battery companies have too many EV batteries, they could repurpose them to help balance the grid.

""What this mean is holding back on some of the investments that may happen in the future,"" Gujarathi said. Companies have to prepare to swap out technologies, battery chemistries and model plans as the situation develops.

""Everybody right now is in a holding pattern, because the ground is shifting underneath them,"" he said. It may be like that for quite a while.

On Nov. 9, 2025, the Senate agreed to vote on the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2026, to end the current government shutdown and fund portions of the federal government through a continuing resolution (CR) that would expire Jan. 30, 2026. The CR keeps current federal funding levels and applies to agencies such as CDC, HRSA, SAMHSA, and EPA.

Outlook

Considering the bipartisan support for this deal to end the government shutdown, the ASTHO Government Affairs team is tentatively optimistic that the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2026, will eventually become law. However, the current political environment is volatile and if anything changes, we will issue another legislative alert. After the Senate votes on the bill, which may be delayed due to negotiations on some agriculture provisions, the House will need to approve it by a simple majority vote. If the House fails to garner enough support, then the government shutdown will continue.

Requires the return of all federal workforce levels prior to the current lapse of appropriations on Oct. 1, 2025.

Requires that funds be apportioned to agencies at a rate that would prevent the furlough of any employee during the duration of the CR.

Prevents agencies from overspending funds for grant programs during the CR period, unless funds are required to be spent for the programs during such period. It preserves the funding level for most grant programs, subject to Congress’s decision in the full-year appropriations acts.

Explicitly states that agencies should spend money in the most limited way possible during the duration of the CR.

Directs that funds provided by the CR are available to pay federal employees who were furloughed or excepted during the lapse.

Requires reimbursement to states that carried out federal programs, to prevent a reduction in service, during the lapse.

Prevents statutory PAYGO sequestration cuts to Medicare, agriculture, and other programs.

Agriculture and FDA

Specifically, Senators agreed to advance a three-bill package that includes FY26 funding for the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration (Ag-FDA) open_in_new, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Legislative Branch. The Ag-FDA bill open_in_new provides:

A hemp products ban, which prevents the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products.

$8.2 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for WIC.

$460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program to assist low-income seniors.

$37.8 billion in mandatory funding for child nutrition programs, as requested by the Administration.

$107 billion in mandatory funding for SNAP, as requested by the Administration.

Reimbursement for both the SNAP and WIC contingency reserves to account for expenditures during the government shutdown.

$7 billion (budget authority and user fees), a decrease of $70 million below FY25 enacted levels, for FDA.

$1.2 billion for the Food Safety and Inspection Service.

$4.1 billion to support rural development across the country including $1.4 billion to prioritize aging water and wastewater infrastructure.

Public Health Provisions

Other public health provisions in the bill include extending several programs through Jan. 30, 2026, including:",https://www.astho.org/globalassets/images/category-cards/astho-legislative-alert-logo.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:09.234648

This paper examines whether information about the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)'s clean energy provisions affects public support for renewable energy policies. In a pilot survey experiment I conducted, respondents were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: (1) a general description of the clean energy provisions of the IRA, (2) a jobs-focused framing, or (3) a message about the IRA's potential repeal. A control group received no information. Preliminary results suggest that respondents exposed to any treatment express lower support for expanding the IRA, particularly Republicans. Although most acknowledge that the IRA creates jobs, this does not lead them to view the policy as beneficial for their communities and decreases support for green energy policies. On the other hand, unemployed respondents and respondents who did not know about the IRA have higher preferences for expanding the IRA. I also examine a quasi-natural experiment embedded in the survey experiment comparing ""Energy Communities""-areas receiving IRA funding-with similar areas that do not. Support for the IRA, especially among Republicans, suggesting that direct material exposure may increase support. While the study is underpowered to detect small effects, if confirmed, this would support policy feedback theories, even for indirect and politically polarizing policies: tangible program benefits can shift attitudes, even when initial reactions to the policy are negative, while informational framing can shape public opinion in unexpected ways.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-11-10 21:06:54.063730

The new risk of unpredictable opposition from the federal government adds to the existing list of threats to solar projects across the country.
Delays are particularly widespread, with a recent EIA analysis finding that “solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay” in the third quarter of 2025.","The country’s largest solar trade association is warning that hundreds of solar and storage installations across the country are at risk of getting derailed by the Trump administration’s expansion of federal control.

Over 500 new projects have yet to receive all the federal, state, and local permits necessary for deployment, and are at risk of getting “trapped in limbo,” according to a new analysis by the Solar Energy Industry Association. That’s 73 gigawatts of solar and 43 GW of storage, for a total of nearly 116 GW in new capacity that could be lost or delayed at a time when the U.S. energy system is in desperate need of new generation to meet the rising demand for electricity.

This risk is the result of a U.S. Department of the Interior’s order for increased federal oversight of solar and wind projects issued in July. The order requires any project involving federal land, permits, or rights-of-way (including those on private land) to go through a lengthy review process, culminating in the direct approval of Interior Secretary Burgum himself. It has been widely perceived as an effort to hinder the buildout of renewable energy.

The threatened projects span 44 states; in 18 of those, over 50% of planned electricity capacity is at risk, according to SEIA.

Roughly 40% of the at-risk projects are in Texas. Nearly 45 GW of the solar and storage capacity planned between 2026 and 2030 in the state hasn’t emerged from the oversight process yet, which means that the federal government could still delay or condition approvals.

Other states with a large amount of at-risk capacity include Oregon, with over 7 GW, California, with nearly 6 GW, and Nevada, with 4.7 GW.

The new risk of unpredictable opposition from the federal government adds to the existing list of threats to solar projects across the country. For the past few years, renewable developers have seen a surge in opposition to local projects, and community resistance and local ordinances have been identified as the “leading causes of project delays and cancellations,” on par with grid interconnection issues.

Delays are particularly widespread, with a recent EIA analysis finding that “solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay” in the third quarter of 2025. Those delays are especially common in the late construction or testing phases, right before they come online.

However, at least when it comes to delays, things are moving in the right direction; EIA found that fewer projects reported delays in 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, at 25% of planned capacity.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-11-10T180237.461.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 19:02:16.788305

“Low risk does not mean no risk,” explains Cotality’s Chief Data and Analytics Officer John Rogers.
Still, low risk does not mean no risk.
Riskiest large counties (50K+ Homes) In these counties, environmental risk is already reshaping the housing market.
In high-risk counties, insurance premiums can double or triple in just a few years.","Homeownership has long gone hand in hand with stability. But that relationship is shifting. Insurance premiums are rising. Property taxes are climbing. In some parts of the country, escrow payments, which are made up of property taxes and homeowners insurance, now exceed the cost of principal and interest.

Much of this cost increase is due to environmental risk. Although it's not always visible on a closing contract, variations in property risk profiles are redefining the market. Choice is increasingly driven by exposure.

Proximity to wildfires, floods, and hurricanes is pushing buyers to reconsider not just what they can afford — but where. And this divide is growing, according to Cotality data*. Concerns about safety and stability are reshuffling housing markets, and in the long-term, geography will define affordability.

Hundreds of counties across the U.S. are sheltered from severe natural catastrophe risk. But sheltered does not mean immune. So, when homes in these areas aren’t built for the unexpected, the consequences can be catastrophic.

“Low risk does not mean no risk,” explains Cotality’s Chief Data and Analytics Officer John Rogers. “We need to make sure that people understand what a risk score means since it’s only valuable if it can be translated into future resilience. That means tilting the conversation on physical property risk toward cooperation between homeowners, policymakers, and developers for long-term living solutions.”

Zoning laws, building codes, and home construction influence the resilience of properties and can tip a county from simply sheltered to future resilience. The opposite is also true. Without careful consideration for the resilience of individual homes, already vulnerable communities can slide into a very risky future.

Where is it safe to live in the U.S.?

Safest large counties (50K+ Homes)

These five counties benefit from low exposure to natural perils as well as a high number of homes that are built with low-risk profiles. They’re not immune—but they’re better positioned to weather the storm.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties have the advantage of a combination of elevation, inland location, and moderate weather patterns. That means fewer insurance claims, more stable premiums, and less disruption from natural disasters. In places like Skagit and Whatcom, wildfire risk is low, and flood exposure is limited. In El Paso, hurricane risk is virtually nonexistent. Still, low risk does not mean no risk. Homes across counties face varying degrees of exposure, which is why it is crucial to understand the individual risk profiles of every property.

Safest counties overall (all sizes)

Smaller counties are also showing strong climate resilience—especially in parts of Colorado and Georgia.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties are far from coastlines, sit at higher relative elevations, are surrounded by attenuating open land, or have historically low exposure to extreme weather. That translates to fewer disruptions from weather events and more predictable housing costs. In Summit County, for example, snow is common—but wildfire, flood, and storm risk remain low.

Where is it risky to live in the U.S.?

Riskiest large counties (50K+ Homes)

In these counties, environmental risk is already reshaping the housing market. Insurance costs are rising, and rebuilding after disasters is becoming both a financial and a logistical challenge.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties face the triple threat of hurricane storm surge, flooding, and wind damage. In New Orleans and Galveston, storm surge and sea-level rise are persistent threats. In Biloxi and Pascagoula, repeated hurricane landfalls have made insurance harder to access and more expensive to maintain.

‍

Riskiest counties overall (all sizes)

Smaller coastal counties are also under pressure. Many residents are losing homes, insurance coverage, and land—literally.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties are on the front lines, seeing the consequences of a changing environment. In the Louisiana counties of Plaquemines and Cameron, land loss from erosion and sea-level rise is accelerating. In Hancock, Mississippi and Lafourche, Louisiana, repeated storm damage has made rebuilding more expensive and less sustainable. These risks are already pricing out many homeowners.

Natural disaster risk is a housing cost

The old adage that real estate is all about location has never been more true. In high-risk counties, insurance premiums can double or triple in just a few years. That adds hundreds of dollars to monthly payments and can tip the balance for buyers who are already stretched.

But where someone buys property is no longer about just building wealth. The choice is now defining long-term safety, stability, and affordability.",,N,,2025-11-10 23:04:00.203998

Under the agreement, Baker Hughes will supply the project’s main refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the North Slope gas treatment plant. The company has also made a strategic investment to support project development.

The announcement was made in Washington, D.C., with U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in attendance, underscoring the administration’s support for expanding domestic LNG infrastructure.

“Baker Hughes is a welcome partner for Alaska LNG because of their leadership in LNG compression technology,” said Brendan Duval, CEO and founder of Glenfarne. “Their participation reflects Alaska LNG’s momentum and its ability to attract global partners to achieve national and state energy objectives.”

“Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy,” added Lorenzo Simonelli, Baker Hughes chairman and CEO. “We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market.”

The Trump administration has framed the partnership as a strategic move to strengthen U.S. energy independence and international energy leadership. “By forging this alliance and investment in Alaska LNG, we’re strengthening our nation’s energy security while advancing a bold vision for U.S. energy independence,” Burgum said.

Glenfarne is developing the Alaska LNG project in two phases.

Phase One will include an 807-mile, 42-inch pipeline transporting natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to meet in-state energy needs. Engineering firm Worley is expected to complete final cost analysis in December ahead of a final investment decision.

Phase Two will add an LNG export terminal with 20 million tonnes per annum (MMtpa) of capacity, targeting a final investment decision in late 2026.

Since assuming leadership of the project earlier this year, Glenfarne has secured preliminary commercial commitments for more than 60% of planned capacity, including agreements with Tokyo Gas, JERA Co. Inc., and POSCO International Corporation.

Glenfarne’s permitted North American LNG portfolio now totals 32.8 MMtpa of capacity across projects in Alaska, Texas, and Louisiana.

Under the Advancing Renewables Program, this latest investment will support SunDrive in its collaboration with leading solar cell equipment manufacturing players Maxwell and Vistar to scale and commercialise its copper metallisation solar cell technology, from R&D at its Kurnell facility in New South Wales, to a 300 MW commercial scale production tool.

SunDrive’s copper-based process replaces silver in solar cells, aiming to cut costs and improve efficiency, supporting ARENA’s Ultra Low-Cost Solar goal. By building and testing new tools and upgrading its facility, SunDrive is working to bring this Australian innovation closer to real-world use, helping to reduce the cost of solar panels and supporting the growth of clean energy.

The funding will support SunDrive to upgrade its Kurnell facility to enable local development, deployment and refinement of production tools to further advance the technology, as well as undertake cost modelling to support the commercialisation pathway. Modules will be produced at SunDrive’s facility for in-field testing and early market acceptance.

These efforts will accelerate the adoption of copper-based solar cells and generate new licensing revenue streams for SunDrive.

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said ARENA has been a long-term supporter of SunDrive, watching them grow from humble beginnings in a Sydney garage to a leader in solar innovation.

“By tackling one of the biggest cost items in solar cell manufacturing, SunDrive is demonstrating how Australian research can drive next-generation solar innovation. Not only is copper more abundant and cheaper than silver, but SunDrive’s unique manufacturing process also results in higher cell and module efficiencies which could have huge benefits for global decarbonisation efforts,” Mr Miller said.

“We’re providing a further $25 million in funding to help scale up SunDrive’s technology which could significantly help push the boundaries of efficiency and affordability and unlock the potential of ultra low-cost solar.”

SunDrive CEO Natalie Malligan said this funding marks a major step in SunDrive’s journey, taking the leap from world-leading research to commercial reality.

“It’s a strong validation of our strategy to develop world-class solar innovation here in Australia and partner with the best in the industry to industrialise it. It shows how Australian innovation can compete globally, and how with the right support, we can take homegrown technology to the world.”

SunDrive Co-Founder Vince Allen said together with Maxwell we’ve already broken world records in cell efficiency.

“This next phase builds on that success and represents the culmination of our work to translate our copper plating technology into the industrial tools that will define the next generation of solar cell technology. With silver prices nearly tripling in three years and solar now using a third of global industrial silver, the industry urgently needs a silver-free alternative. With ARENA’s support and our partners’ expertise, this project intends to deliver a scalable mass-production solution.”

The project builds on previous ARENA funding of $14 million to demonstrate SunDrive’s copper metallisation technology. To date, ARENA has provided over $388 million to over 200 solar research and development projects.

ARENA will continue to support big ideas and back breakthroughs that power Australia’s clean energy future. Read more about our Ultra Low-Cost Solar priorities.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that executives at Ford Motor is in “active discussions” about scrapping the F-150 Lightning, quoting “people familiar with the matter”. It comes just a month after the company said it was pausing production. The unnamed sources had little else to say about these discussions except that no final decision has been made.

If true, the death of the Ford F-150 Lightning could spell trouble for electric pickup trucks, or utes, in the United States.

Ford unveiled the F-150 Lightning in May of 2021 and delivered the first model a year later. It has never been officially released in Australia although some specialist importers have brought in some models, mostly for industrial and mining clients.

At launch, the F-150 Lightning boasted driving range of 370 kilometres for the base level, and up to 480 kilometres for the extended range option. The tech-heavy Flash model with an extended-range battery delivering range of up to 515 kilometres was brought to market in late 2023.

But despite huge interest and expectations at launch and over the first few years of its lifespan, the F-150 Lightning has failed to deliver on the promise of a “smartphone that can tow 10,000 pounds” – a claim made by Ford CEO Jim Farley at the car’s launch.

Despite promises that the car would sell around the $US40,000-mark, actual prices were closer to $US50,000 for the base-level model, and up to $US90,000 for higher end models.

Demand has therefore been lacklustre, and the car has subsequently been costing Ford billions since 2023. The future is even less rosy, with sales that are already well below expectations set to suffer from the withdrawal of government support for electric vehicles.

The writing may have been on the wall last month when Ford announced that it has pausing production of the F-150 Lightning.

Announced in late October, Ford first blamed the decision on a fire at one of its aluminium suppliers’ factories but matched that explanation with a concurrent ramp up of production of its F-150 gas and hybrid models, citing “strong customer demand” and claiming that these models “are more profitable for Ford and use less aluminium”.

If Ford does in fact scrap the F-150 Lightning, it will likely take solace from reports across the industry in the US. Executives at crosstown rival General Motors (GM) have reportedly been discussing discontinuing its own electric trucks, according to more unnamed people “familiar with the matter”.

Another big-name rival, Stellantis, announced in September that it was cancelling its own plans for an electric pickup, citing the slowing of “demand for full-size battery electric trucks” in North America for its axing development of the RAM 1500.

Meanwhile, Tesla has seen sales of its Cybertruck pickup plummet in 2025.

According to numbers from Cox Automotive published last month, Tesla sold only 5,400 Cybertrucks in the third quarter, down 62.6 per cent from the same period a year earlier, bringing the total number sold so far in 2025 to only 16,000 – well behind the 250,000 a year that CEO Elon Musk once declared was possible.",https://thedriven.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/F150-with-caravan-US-pic-V2.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 22:04:03.110357

Replacing electric furnaces with heat pumps would also mainly address the grid’s winter peak, not its summer peak, though the Department of Energy maintains that heat pumps use less energy for cooling than stand-alone air conditioners.

Yet electric furnaces are notoriously inefficient and expensive to operate, and heat pumps have been around for decades.","The data center boom has catapulted Virginia into a serious energy crunch. We have more data centers here than in any other state, by far, and four times as many more are expected in the next few years. Virginia utilities don’t generate enough electricity to serve them all; fully half of our power is imported from the regional grid. But now the regional grid is also running low on reserve power thanks to all the data center growth, according to grid operator PJM.

Most proposed solutions focus on the supply side: generating more power by building new solar, wind, gas and battery storage; keeping aging power plants running that were previously scheduled for closure; and even reopening Three Mile Island, shuttered three and a half decades ago following the worst nuclear accident in US history.

More nuanced solutions involve managing the existing generation better. Research shows that the grid could handle more data centers right now if operators ratcheted back consumption at peak times, either through installing batteries or through shifting some operations to non-peak times.

All of these approaches involve generating more power for the grid, or shifting use around to relieve grid stress at peak demand times. But there is another way to make room for new data centers: remove some existing loads.

A national advocacy organization, Rewiring America, recently released an intriguing proposal to free up grid capacity by retrofitting homes with high-efficiency heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, solar panels and energy storage. The cumulative effect would be to reduce total demand in the residential sector, making capacity available to data centers sooner, while also saving the participating residential consumers thousands of dollars on their electricity bills.

Oh, and the tech companies are going to pay for it.

I am reminded of a delightful sign I once saw announcing the coming of the best dog park ever, to be paid for by cats, itself a satire of a certain president’s pledge to build a border wall paid for by Mexico. But, I notice, neither the cats nor Mexico have sent checks yet. Will Big Tech?

Rewiring America thinks so, if the policies are in place to aggregate and verify the household energy savings into a marketable package, and if buying the package means a data center can come online faster and more cheaply. Upgraded appliances and rooftop solar can be installed in a matter of weeks, compared to the many years that may be required to permit and build new generation and transmission.

Note that the proposed program would not include households that replace gas, propane or oil furnaces with heat pumps. That kind of upgrade results in greater, not less, residential electricity demand, making it counterproductive when the point is to shrink residential electricity usage.

Replacing electric furnaces with heat pumps would also mainly address the grid’s winter peak, not its summer peak, though the Department of Energy maintains that heat pumps use less energy for cooling than stand-alone air conditioners.

Researchers focused on replacing electric resistance heat with heat pumps because that one swap produces the biggest efficiency bang for the buck. An electric furnace is cheap to install but expensive to use; the reverse is true of a high-efficiency heat pump. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that the conversion would save the average family $1,170 per year on its electricity bill. NREL calculates that heat pumps are cost-effective enough to pay for themselves in under 5 years.

According to Rewiring America, “If hyperscalers paid for 50 percent of the upfront cost of installing heat pumps in homes with electric resistance heating, they could get capacity on the grid at a price of about $344/kW-year — a similar cost to building and operating a new gas power plant, which currently costs about $315/kW-year.” (By my math, it’s an extra 10%, which might be acceptable to a power-hungry tech customer as a sort of rush fee.)

The report repeats the calculations for other technologies. Ductless heat pumps would replace baseboard electric heat. Heat pump water heaters would replace conventional electric water heaters. Solar panels paired with battery storage could displace electricity the home would otherwise draw from the grid.

Further capacity could come from home batteries. The report posits, “If every single-family household in the U.S. installed a home battery, and those with a suitable roof installed a 5 kW solar system (about 11 solar panels), they could collectively generate 109 GW of increased capacity on the grid. We assume that households charge the battery off-peak, either from the grid or from rooftop solar, and they discharge the battery during peak periods to reduce the household’s contribution to peak demand.”

The researchers estimate that a mass purchasing program could squeeze costs of solar and storage down by 40%, primarily through reduced customer acquisition costs and cheaper permitting. Then the data center operators would pay 30% of this lower cost. By buying solar and storage at this now much-reduced price, households would get electricity at about a 30% discount off utility rates, while the tech companies would be able to buy capacity at a cost comparable to that of building a new gas plant.

You’ll notice the proposal assumes tech companies pay only a portion of the costs for the residential upgrades, so residents still face upfront costs – 50% of the cost of heat pumps, 70% of a hopefully-lowered price for solar and batteries. Rewiring America calculates that residents will come out ahead under all scenarios, while the data centers will pay only a little more than they would otherwise have to pay, buying capacity they might not otherwise be able to get.

Because Virginia has so many more data centers than anywhere else on earth, Rewiring America calculates that all of these investments would meet only 25% of our projected new data center demand. Other states could do much better, fully meeting projected new demand across most of the country and even exceeding it in about half the states. Virginia would presumably stand to benefit from surplus capacity in other PJM states.

Obviously, these calculations describe a best-case scenario, and I have my doubts about whether the uptake would be anywhere near what they believe is possible. Still, even capturing just a portion of the efficiency potential Rewiring America believes is there would relieve some of the pressure on the grid.

But is there really that much low-hanging efficiency fruit in Virginia? If the NREL data that the researchers use is correct, more than 300,000 single family homes in Virginia have electric furnaces. Yet electric furnaces are notoriously inefficient and expensive to operate, and heat pumps have been around for decades. Our utilities have been running energy efficiency programs for years that are supposed to help residents save energy. Can there really be that many single-family homes that have not converted to heat pumps yet?

I consulted Andrew Grigsby, a home energy efficiency expert who is currently the energy services director at Viridiant, a nonprofit focused on sustainable buildings. Grigsby shared my doubts about the accuracy of NREL’s estimate of the number of homes with electric resistance heat, saying it was at odds with his experience. He also felt that an efficiency program would save more energy at less cost by targeting improvements to the needs of each home, instead of supplying a blanket solution.

But he also refuted my assumption that most of the low-hanging fruit should have been picked by now. “Virginia has 100,000 homes (at least) where three hours work and $50 in materials would reduce heating/cooling costs by 25% — via fixing the obvious, massive duct leakage,” he said in an email.

This doesn’t mean Rewiring America’s approach wouldn’t save energy; rather, it supports the conclusion that there is a massive opportunity for energy efficiency savings that Virginia hasn’t fully tapped into.

Legislators have tried. The VCEA set efficiency targets for Dominion and APCo, and the SCC followed up with further targets. APCo has consistently met its goals, Dominion has not. A review of Dominion’s sad little list of programs available to homeowners suggests that the problem is a lack of ambition, not a lack of opportunity.

An aggressive, third-party operated efficiency program would complement the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) pilot program that Dominion is developing in accordance with legislation passed in the 2025 session. The VPP’s goal is to shift some consumption to off-peak times, while the Rewiring America proposal would reduce overall consumption.

Both seek to achieve time-shifting through incentivizing residents to invest in home batteries, their only area of overlap. But whereas the VPP legislation set only 15 MW as its baseline target for home batteries, the Rewiring America proposal could incentivize much more, along with the solar systems to charge them.

The problem remains how to get tech companies to pay for it. My contact at Rewiring America, senior director of communications Alex Amend, pointed me to approaches being undertaken in other states. Minnesota legislation requires data centers to contribute between $2 million and $5 million annually toward energy conservation programs that benefit low-income households. Georgia Power is expected to file a large load tariff that, says Amend, includes pathways for off-site, behind-the-meter solutions.

Here in Virginia, though, both APCo and Dominion, as well as some co-ops, have already submitted large-load tariff proposals to the SCC as part of their rate cases. None of the proposals include incentives for demand reductions anywhere, much less the residential sector. Indeed, given Dominion’s track record on efficiency, the SCC would have to take the initiative to meld a large load tariff for data centers with the VPP program and aggressive home efficiency investments.

The SCC has announced plans to hold a technical conference on Dec. 12 to examine data center load flexibility. Rewiring America hopes to participate to lay out its proposal in more detail.

Even Musk’s much-hyped “Optimus” robot project, which the billionaire said last week is likely to be Tesla’s biggest new business, quit in June.
Last week, Musk suggested that Tesla’s two-door Cybercab will arrive by the second quarter of 2026.
“Tesla has acted unlike any car company.
For now, Tesla’s board, with its heavy promotion of Musk’s compensation package, is betting everything on him.","Tesla shareholders just overwhelmingly backed CEO Elon Musk’s unprecedented pay package that could be worth $1 trillion over a decade, but engineers running the company’s main vehicle programs, for its top-selling Model Y, Model 3 and the controversial Cybertruck, aren’t sticking around to see how things turn out.

Emmanuel Lamacchia, an eight-year Tesla veteran and program manager for the Model Y, said late Sunday in a LinkedIn post that he was leaving the Austin-based company. His announcement came just a few hours after a similar post by Siddhant Awasthi, another eight-year veteran who ran the Model 3 and Cybertruck programs. Neither gave reasons for their decisions, though both mentioned new career steps, which they didn’t detail.

They’re just the latest high-profile engineers to leave as Musk seeks to shake up Tesla’s business, prioritizing AI-powered businesses – namely robotaxis and humanoid robots – that don’t generate revenue currently, rather than selling more electric vehicles, batteries and charging services, which do. Earlier this year, Musk fired the company’s head of manufacturing and sales in North America and Europe. In August, the director of Tesla’s battery team left the company, as did the head of its former “Dojo” supercomputer team and vice president of North American sales and service. Even Musk’s much-hyped “Optimus” robot project, which the billionaire said last week is likely to be Tesla’s biggest new business, quit in June.

“There are no new models on the horizon. There’s just a focus on cost reduction”

Aside from the fact that the poor-selling, much-derided Cybertruck ranks among the auto industry’s biggest flops, Musk’s prioritization of non-EV businesses is making the company less attractive to auto engineers, according to a former Tesla executive.

“Imagine you’re someone who's been working in the automotive industry or studying engineering at university and you go to Tesla and there are no new models on the horizon. There’s just a focus on cost reduction,” said the person, who asked not to be named. “This isn’t exciting at all. They cannot be attracting the best people in the automotive industry.”

The most recent departures didn’t ruffle shareholders. Tesla rose 3.7% to $445.23 in Nasdaq trading on Monday.

Despite a spike in deliveries in the third quarter, the result of U.S. customers rushing to buy before federal tax credits phased out after Sept. 30, Tesla’s EV sales are down about 6% so far this year. Though the company has come out with cheaper versions of Model Y and 3, its global top sellers, its lack of new products and the slower pace of EV sales in the U.S. and Europe suggest the next few quarters will see a continued drop in its auto sales.

Last week, Musk suggested that Tesla’s two-door Cybercab will arrive by the second quarter of 2026. But that car is intended to be sold without a steering wheel and standard controls, operating exclusively as a self-driving vehicle. That’s a gamble, though, given that the company continues to struggle to prove it’s equaled Alphabet’s Waymo in mastering autonomous driving.

Ross Gerber, a Tesla investor and critic of Musk’s shift in strategy, thinks it would be better to simply release Cybercab as the so-called Model 2, “just a regular EV that they could sell for about $30,000,” he told Forbes.

“The thing about how car companies work is people want new models, new features and they want new designs for their car that's not too different than the original, but is different,” said Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, which manages about $4 billion, including $80 million of Tesla shares. “Tesla has acted unlike any car company. They just refreshed the model Y and said, ‘Okay, we refreshed the car. We made it better and made the Model 3 better.’ But it's not a new model, and that’s the problem.”

Sales of the Cybertruck, which Musk once claimed would sell hundreds of thousands of units annually, are already dropping in the model’s second full year, down 38% through the third quarter to just 16,097 units. Aside from its polarizing styling, the truck has also had multiple recalls, the most recent announced last month.

Though Tesla is preparing to finally start selling its electric semi truck in 2026, according to Musk, that model is likely to only add tens of thousands of new sales to the bottom line, given how much smaller the Class-8 semi industry is compared to the broader passenger vehicle market.

Tesla claims to have the capacity to produce at least 2 million vehicles annually at plants in California, Texas, China and Germany. That’s considerably more than it needs at the moment, with annual sales likely to come in between 1.5 million and 1.6 million this year. At last week’s shareholder meeting, in which at least 75% of investors voted in favor of awarding Musk $1 trillion of stock over a decade if he hits a series of financial and strategic goals, the billionaire hinted it’s likely to absorb some of that surplus by making robots.

“We have to invent whole new terms for the key man risk involved here.”

The company is building a “million-unit production line in Fremont,” to make Optimus, Musk said. At some point, it will also add a “10 million unit per year line” at the Austin, Texas, plant that now builds Cybertrucks and Model Ys. Much like his robotaxi and Cybercab plans, however, Tesla’s ability to build and sell millions of units of Optimus depends on making the tech workable and affordable, which it has not done yet.

The departures of Lamacchia and Awasthi also underscore a continuing problem that Tesla’s board appears uninterested in solving: the lack of a strong executive team and a clear succession plan for the post-Musk era. Beyond its CFO, Tesla’s C-suite currently has no president, COO or executive vice presidents, or officials with titles higher than senior vice president.

For now, Tesla’s board, with its heavy promotion of Musk’s compensation package, is betting everything on him.

“I cannot imagine a scenario where the valuation of Tesla does not collapse following Elon Musk's departure,” said Gautam Mukunda, a professor with the Yale School of Management. “We have to invent whole new terms for the key man risk involved here. Normal key man risk doesn't even apply – and in particular doesn't apply when you're talking to someone who has, by his own admission, behaviors that are remarkably risky.”

ABTC says the project’s focus is on the safe handling and processing of damaged battery materials, and it has made “significant enhancements” to its recycling facility in Nevada in order to process these damaged battery materials.
At current market prices, the company says that if it were to process all of the battery materials from the site, the value of the recycled products generated from these materials is estimated at approximately $30 million.
“This unprecedented operation highlights the growing need for specialized battery recycling capabilities as electric vehicles, grid storage systems and consumer electronics continue proliferating,” the company says.
“The work being done on this cleanup between industry leaders and regulators is establishing safety and materials management standards for future large-scale battery facilities while demonstrating the viability of domestic recycling solutions for critical battery materials.”","ABTC says the lithium-ion battery cleanup is the “largest in U.S. history,” with $30 million in estimated project proceeds.

Battery materials recycler and refiner American Battery Technology Co. (ABTC), Reno, Nevada, has been contracted and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to recycle the end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) from what it calls the largest LIB cleanup operation in EPA history.

ABTC says the project’s focus is on the safe handling and processing of damaged battery materials, and it has made “significant enhancements” to its recycling facility in Nevada in order to process these damaged battery materials. The company notes it has been receiving large-scale shipments of this material for the past several weeks.

According to the company, the cleanup effort comes after a fire at a grid-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) facility in Northern California in January, which affected up to approximately 100,000 LIB modules that would require specialized handling, packaging, transportation and recycling in accordance with procedures overseen by the EPA. In the spring, ABTC says it underwent an audit and review process and successfully received formal EPA approval for its battery recycling facility in Nevada to receive waste material under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).

ABTC says it now is EPA-approved as one of the only battery recyclers in the Western U.S. capable of receiving batteries that have been damaged and classified as “CERCLA waste,” such as battery materials that have been involved in large-scale BESS thermal events and fires.

“This unprecedented cleanup effort highlights the critical importance of building and deploying advanced domestic critical mineral recycling infrastructure capable of addressing the growing challenges of managing damaged lithium-ion batteries in a safe and responsible manner,” ABTC CEO Ryan Melsert says. “We are proud that we have established ABTC as one of the only recyclers in the Western U.S. to be capable of receiving CERCLA materials, and that we have already been processing truckloads of CERCLA material from this project for the past several weeks.

“This effort is not just about safely recycling damaged batteries—it’s about answering President Trump’s call to action for implementing immediate measures to increase American mineral production through demonstrating how U.S.-based infrastructure can rise to return these critical minerals back to the domestic manufacturing supply chain.”

ABTC says its internally developed recycling technologies can recover valuable critical materials, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, steel and copper from damaged batteries, preventing such resources from entering landfills while supporting the establishment of a closed-loop critical mineral manufacturing supply chain in the U.S.

The EPA is overseeing the complex logistics of battery characterization, transportation and delivery to ABTC’s Nevada facility. ABTC says the damaged batteries vary in condition, from intact units to severely compromised materials requiring immediate processing to ensure safety compliance. At current market prices, the company says that if it were to process all of the battery materials from the site, the value of the recycled products generated from these materials is estimated at approximately $30 million.

That’s what Devi Glick, an energy analyst with Synapse Energy Economics, told the commission in written testimony filed late last week.

Kentucky Power originally told the PSC that investing in Mitchell was the most cost-effective option for its customers. However, it told the commission last month that the plant would require extensive repair or replacement of one of its two concrete cooling towers.

Glick testified that converting the plant from coal to natural gas would be less expensive than fixing the cooling tower and would avoid other potential environmental costs.

Kentucky Power co-owns Mitchell, in Marshall County, West Virginia, with Wheeling Power. Both are subsidiaries of American Electric Power.

In 2021, the Kentucky commission rejected Kentucky Power’s bid to keep its half of Mitchell past 2028. The West Virginia Public Service Commission then allowed Wheeling Power to pay for the entire project and recover the cost from its electricity customers.

Kentucky Power came back to the Kentucky PSC earlier this year seeking approval again, this time with the support of Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman.

Coleman’s predecessor, Daniel Cameron, recommended in 2021 that the plant be retired. Cameron is a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in 2026.

In her written testimony, Glick faulted Kentucky Power for comparing the cost of repairing Mitchell’s cooling tower with building new gas generation but not with converting the existing plant to gas.

Glick’s earlier calculations revealed the excess costs of two coal plants, one in Ohio and the other in Indiana, for Appalachian Power and Louisville Gas & Electric, and Kentucky Utilities electricity customers.

As reported by the Appalachia-Midsouth Newsroom, Appalachian Power customers paid $328 million more than necessary for electricity from the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation from 2018 to 2024.

LG&E and KU customers paid nearly $168 million more than necessary for OVEC power in those seven years.

Gross loss: $(7.7) million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $(4.1) million in the same period in 2024, indicating increased cost pressures.

Loss from operations: $(16.6) million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $(14.2) million in the same period in 2024, highlighting ongoing operational challenges.

Net loss: $(7.8) million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $(25.1) million in the same period in 2024, showing a significant reduction in net loss.

Net loss per share of common stock: $(0.50) for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $(19.00) in the same period in 2024, reflecting the impact of reverse stock splits and reduced net loss.

Business Highlights

Revenue Segments: The company reported revenue from two main segments: Vehicles and Services, Parts, and Accessories. Vehicle sales accounted for $2,073,190 in the three months ended September 30, 2025, while Services, Parts, and Accessories contributed $311,808 for the same period.

Sales Units: The company focused on the sale of existing inventory, particularly the W56 vehicle platform, which has been affected by procurement reductions and supplier payment delays.

Operational Challenges: The company faced slower than anticipated truck sales, leading to an increase in inventory reserves. Efforts are being made to convert on-hand inventory into finished goods and to sell or dispose of fully reserved inventory.

Cost-Saving Measures: Management implemented cost-saving measures, including reducing third-party consulting arrangements, lowering research and development activities, and consolidating back-office functions. These measures have continued to yield benefits through the period ended September 30, 2025.

Aero Drone Operations: The company ceased production operations of its drone design and manufacturing business, transitioning to a Drones as a Service model. This divestiture has provided an estimated monthly cost savings of approximately $0.4 million.

Future Outlook: The company plans to improve liquidity and working capital by increasing truck sales, reducing expenses, and raising capital through debt or equity securities. The successful execution of these plans is critical to addressing the company's going concern issues.

Merger and Strategic Transactions: The company entered into a Merger Agreement with Motiv Power Systems, Inc., which includes a condition for debt financing and a sale-leaseback transaction of its Union City, Indiana facility. These transactions are part of the company's strategy to improve financial stability and operational capacity.

According to a news release, Citizens Action Coalition has urged the IURC to reject the request filed by Indiana Michigan Power to build and purchase power plants for new Amazon and Google AI data centers at undisclosed locations.

Indiana Michigan Power has filed an Expedited Generation Resource plan in a move that the CAC has said could become “the most expensive proposed expansion of generation by a utility in a docketed proceeding in Indiana history.”

The CAC estimates that a minimum of 39% of EGR Plan costs will be passed on to utility customers within the next five years. The organization also expressed concern with the power company’s request for IURC to permit the introduction of a new bill tracker to the monthly electric bills.

The EGR Plan proposal does not provide enough information about the rate and likely impacts on a monthly basis, according to the CAC. Indiana Michigan Power also requested preapproval for the expansion of natural gas power plants, which CAC said would cover approximately 85% of the electricity as part of the EGR plan.

Multiple AI data centers have already been announced or are in the process of being planned throughout the Hoosier state.

Google is currently constructing a data center on 390 acres of land in Morgan County. Meanwhile, data centers have been proposed in both Hendricks and Henry counties. The largest of these proposed data centers is the Amazon data center campus coming to New Castle.

But the environmental toll of these large data centers, which suck up gigawatts of power and require vast amounts of water for cooling, has been too diffuse and difficult to quantify.

Now, Cornell researchers have used advanced data analytics – and, naturally, some AI, too – to create a state-by-state look at that environmental impact. The team found that, by 2030, the current rate of AI growth would annually put 24 to 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the emissions equivalent of adding 5 to 10 million cars to U.S. roadways. It would also drain 731 to 1,125 million cubic meters of water per year – equal to the annual household water usage of 6 to 10 million Americans. The cumulative effect would put the AI industry’s net-zero emissions targets out of reach.

On the upside, the study also outlines an actionable roadmap that would use smart siting, faster grid decarbonization and operational efficiency to cut these impacts by approximately 73% (carbon dioxide) and 86% (water) compared with worst-case scenarios.

The findings were published Nov. 10 in Nature Sustainability. The first author is doctoral student Tianqi Xiao in the Process-Energy-Environmental Systems Engineering (PEESE) lab.

“Artificial intelligence is changing every sector of society, but its rapid growth comes with a real footprint in energy, water and carbon,” said Fengqi You, the Roxanne E. and Michael J. Zak Professor in Energy Systems Engineering in Cornell Engineering, who led the project. “Our study is built to answer a simple question: Given the magnitude of the AI computing boom, what environmental trajectory will it take? And more importantly, what choices steer it toward sustainability?”

In order to quantify the environmental footprints of the nation’s AI computing infrastructure, the team began three years ago to compile “multiple dimensions” of financial, marketing and manufacturing data to understand how the industry is expanding, combined with location-specific data on power systems and resource consumption, and how they connect with changes in climate.

“There’s a lot of data, and that’s a huge effort. Sustainability information, like energy, water, climate, tend to be open and public. But industrial data is hard, because not every company is reporting everything,” You said. “And of course, eventually, we still need to be looking at multiple scenarios. There’s no way that one size fits all. Every region is different for regulations. We used AI to fill some of the data gap as well.”

But projecting the impacts wasn’t enough. The researchers also wanted to provide data-driven guidance for sustainable growth of AI infrastructure.

“There isn’t a silver bullet,” You said. “Siting, grid decarbonization and efficient operations work together – that’s how you get reductions on the order of roughly 73% for carbon and 86% for water.”

By far, one of the most important factors: location, location, location.

Many current data clusters are being constructed in water-scarce regions, such as Nevada and Arizona. And in some hubs, for example northern Virginia, rapid clustering can strain local infrastructure and water resources. Locating facilities in regions with lower water-stress and improving cooling efficiency could slash water demands by about 52%, and when combined with grid and operational best practices, total water reductions could reach 86%, the study found. The Midwest and “windbelt” states – particularly Texas, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota – would deliver the best combined carbon-and-water profile.

“New York state remains a low-carbon, climate-friendly option thanks to its clean electricity mix of nuclear, hydropower and growing renewables,” You said, “although prioritizing water-efficient cooling and additional clean power is key.”

If decarbonization does not catch up with the computing demand, emissions could rise roughly 20%.

“Even if each kilowatt-hour gets cleaner, total emissions can rise if AI demand grows faster than the grid decarbonizes,” You said. “The solution is to accelerate the clean-energy transition in the same places where AI computing is expanding.”

However, decarbonizing the grid can only do so much. Even in the ambitious high-renewables scenario, by 2030 carbon dioxide would drop roughly 15% compared to the baseline, and approximately 11 million tons of residual emissions would remain, requiring roughly 28 gigawatts of wind or 43 gigawatts of solar capacity to reach net-zero.

The researchers determined that deploying an array of energy- and water-efficient technologies, such as advanced liquid cooling and improved server utilization, could potentially remove another 7% of carbon dioxide and lower water use by 29%, for a total water reduction of 32% when combined.

As companies such as OpenAI and Google funnel more and more money into rapidly building AI data centers to keep up with demand, this is a pivotal moment for coordinated planning between industry, utilities and regulators to avoid local water scarcity and higher grid emissions, according to You.

“This is the build-out moment,” he said. “The AI infrastructure choices we make this decade will decide whether AI accelerates climate progress or becomes a new environmental burden.”

The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, has been in force for just over five years. That means a deadline of sorts is coming up. As passed by Congress in 2019, the USMCA includes a clause directing the three partner countries to “review” the agreement after six years — that is, by July 2026 — and decide whether they like it more or less as is, or want to see changes.

In principle, that’s fine. The agreement is a big human creation, with some notable innovations. As such, it has lots of features that look good to some groups but bad to others. With the “review” ahead, industry associations, pressure groups, labor unions, and agricultural commodity groups are all dutifully writing up lists of ways to improve it. But fundamentally, the agreement is working reasonably well — facilitating trade in agriculture, energy, and manufacturing, helping digital channels stay open, encouraging joint work on wildlife trafficking and ocean health, and experimenting with a novel approach to labor issues. At the same time, though, the Trump administration’s profligate tariffs and threats against Canada and Mexico are causing a series of genuine crises: usurpation of Congress’s Constitutional authority; erosion of relationships at the core of U.S. national security; and a deteriorating economic environment as tariffs raise costs for families and diminish the competitiveness of U.S. farming and manufacturing.

The “deadline,” meanwhile, is a very soft one. In fact, it requires no action at all. And in the circumstances of 2025 and 2026, the best choice is “let well enough alone.” Congress should make it clear that the USMCA does not need major changes at this point, and that policy should instead focus on ending these self-created crises. If the administration nonetheless wants to proceed, Congress should require three steps first:

Approve legislation such as Representative Linda Sanchez’s HR 2888, which would terminate the administration’s “emergency” and “national security” decrees under laws like “IEEPA,” “Section 232,” and “Section 301” and require votes on any future Presidential imposition of tariffs (or other import limits) with some carefully circumscribed exceptions.

Stabilize North American security by restoring trust, mutual respect, and common interest as the foundation of U.S. policy for America’s neighbors.

Restore Constitutionally appropriate policymaking, with Congress setting negotiating objectives for trade policy agencies and voting to approve, or not, any agreements making changes in U.S. tariff rates or trade laws.

With these done, it would be appropriate, and might be useful, to look closely at the USMCA and see whether a broad consensus exists for changes that would improve it. But not before.",https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photos-PPI-9.png,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:13.079133

If you’re ready to get rid of the jack-o’-lanterns sitting on your porch, don’t toss them in your trash can.

Every year, approximately 1 billion pounds of pumpkins end up in landfills across the country, where they release climate-warming methane that hurts the environment.

Hamilton County’s waste reduction agency is trying to combat that spooky statistic. It’s encouraging residents to give their pumpkins a sustainable second life through cooking, donating and composting them.

“Pumpkins are such an easy thing to prevent from going into the landfill because there are so many other outlets for them,” said Sam Goubeaux, program coordinator at Hamilton County ReSource.

Donate them to a farm

Some local farms are accepting pumpkins for animal feed. Bahr Farm, 969 W. North Bend Rd., is collecting unpainted pumpkins for its cows to enjoy. You can drop them off in the bin by the picnic table until Dec. 6.

Bahr Farm also has a composting operation on site.

“If your pumpkin is a little moldy, or if you're not really sure if it's appropriate for animal feed, they'll still take it, and they'll decide which ones they're able to feed to the cows and which ones that they're going to compost,” Goubeaux said.

Perch Farm, 900 Hopewell Rd., and Tewes Farm, 2801 Crescent Springs Pike, are also both taking natural pumpkin donations.

Turn your Halloween decoration into a tasty treat

If your pumpkin is still firm, you can turn your Halloween decoration into food. Goubeaux says there are endless recipes that call for pumpkin or pumpkin puree.

“Just cut the pumpkin in half, take out the insides, roast that exterior in your oven at a fairly low temperature for a few hours, and then you can puree it and use that puree in recipes,” Goubeaux said.

She suggests pumpkin pie or pumpkin cookies.

Opt to compost

Pumpkins are rich in nutrients and can make great additions to compost and soil.

Goubeaux recommends breaking up or smashing your pumpkins before adding them to a compost pile.

“Ultimately, that will help [with] decomposition,” Goubeaux said. “It'll help make everything go by a little faster, so that you're not looking at that pumpkin for quite as long.”

Then, cover the pumpkin with plenty of leaves or brown, carbon-rich material to ensure you have the right balance in your compost pile.

If you don’t have compost, a community garden or other organization may take your pumpkins. Lierer’s Market, 4170 Hamilton Ave., is collecting natural, unpainted pumpkins for composting. Use code 1031 to open the free drop-off bin outside the store.

Leave them outside for animals

If you leave your pumpkins outside, animals from racoons to deer will come feed on them. Goubeaux suggests breaking up your pumpkin and leaving it in your backyard.

“It'll attract some of those animals...by having that that fleshy interior out,” Goubeaux said.

Pumpkins without any paint or glitter on them are safer for wildlife.

Plug Power’s announcement that it is suspending work on its Department of Energy–backed green hydrogen projects marks a sobering turning point. Most companies would fight to secure a $1.66 billion loan guarantee from the federal government. Plug Power is walking away from it. That decision, combined with yet another round of cost cutting, is not a show of discipline. It is an act of triage.

The company’s new liquidity plan is described as generating $275 million through monetizing electricity rights, releasing restricted cash, and cutting maintenance costs. In practice that means selling off parts of its future in order to pay for the present. The decision to walk away from DOE-backed projects reduces the long-term strategic leverage Plug once had and underscores how much pressure its balance sheet is under. Each quarter it burns through tens of millions in cash. There are only so many assets left to monetize before the core of the company is compromised.

Monetizing electricity rights sounds like a clever financial instrument but it is closer to a short-term sale. Plug likely holds grid connection contracts and power purchase agreements in New York and other regions that could be valuable to data center developers. Selling those rights or assigning them is a one-time gain that reduces future flexibility. It is the corporate equivalent of pawning your tools to make payroll. The money may arrive faster, but the ability to generate sustained earnings disappears with it.

The same dynamic applies to maintenance cuts. Plug Power has been through multiple rounds of cost reduction. Project Quantum Leap in early 2025 targeted up to $200 million in savings through workforce reductions, facility consolidation, and lower service costs. The most recent announcement adds more “reduced maintenance expenses” to the mix. There are only so many ways to cut maintenance before it begins to affect plant reliability, regulatory compliance, and safety, and they’ve been cutting since the beginning of the year. The company is now within striking distance of those limits, and quite likely heading past them.

Plug’s hydrogen production facilities in Georgia, Tennessee, and Louisiana represent the heart of its operation. Together they can produce about 40 to 45 tons of hydrogen a day, although in practice they produce less on average due to standard maintenance and operational cycles. These are high-pressure, high-temperature industrial environments that depend on strict maintenance schedules for compressors, cryogenic systems, and leak detection. When preventive maintenance intervals are stretched, small problems can turn into failures. A leaking valve or a worn compressor seal does not just stop production. It can create an explosive or asphyxiation hazard for workers. Hydrogen ignites at low energy, spreads quickly, and is invisible when burning. Worker health and safety are the potential casualties when budgets are tightened too far.

Hydrogen leakage is not only a workplace issue. It is a climate issue. Recent atmospheric chemistry research has clarified that hydrogen has a global warming potential of roughly 33 times that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe. When hydrogen escapes into the air it slows the breakdown of methane and increases short-term warming. The same undetected leaks that endanger workers quietly increase the company’s greenhouse footprint. Each kilogram of leaked hydrogen equates to about 33 kilograms of CO2e. Even a 1% leak rate from a 40-ton-per-day system would create nearly 5,000 tons of CO2e per year. While this rules out a major hydrogen distribution system, it doesn’t preclude well-designed and operated industrial facilities. If Plug’s maintenance savings come from reduced leak monitoring or delayed seal replacements, the environmental risks will increase increase in lockstep with the safety risks.

This is not the first time Plug Power has been on the edge. Previous financial analyses I’ve done highlighted its reliance on continuous capital raises and stock dilution to cover ongoing losses. It hasn’t turned a profit once in its nearly 30 years of existence, and annual losses have been increasing, not decreasing. The company has struggled to turn technology demonstrations into stable cash flow. Hydrogen production and liquefaction are capital intensive. Margins on fuel cells and electrolyzers remain low. Service costs are high. Plug’s repeated claims of coming profitability have always been contingent on scale that never materialized. The DOE loan guarantee was supposed to provide the runway to achieve it. Walking away from that support reveals that internal forecasts have changed for the worse.

Plug Power’s offtake strategy was built around transportation and materials handling rather than industrial hydrogen demand. Its biggest customers are Walmart, Amazon, The Home Depot, and Uline, all using hydrogen to power fleets of fuel-cell forklifts and warehouse equipment. While there are a few tens of thousands of fuel-cell forklifts, millions of battery electric forklifts are sold annually. The story for materials handling is the same as every transportation segment: hydrogen can’t compete with batteries. The company signed a supply agreement with Universal Hydrogen—now defunct of course—to provide green hydrogen for aviation applications, where the competitive headwinds are different but the result is the same: no hydrogen. These relationships looked impressive when fuel-cell mobility was being promoted as the next revolution, but they tied Plug’s fortunes to a sector that was never going to achieve scale or stable margins.

A maintenance-related failure at one of Plug Power’s hydrogen plants would have immediate and severe financial consequences. The company’s three operating sites together produce roughly 40 to 45 tons of hydrogen per day, meaning that the loss of even one facility could eliminate a quarter to a third of total output. At an estimated internal cost of $6 to $8 per kilogram and limited ability to substitute supply from other plants, an extended outage could erase tens of millions in quarterly revenue while fixed costs continue to accrue. Emergency repairs would drive unplanned capex, insurance premiums would rise, and delivery contracts could trigger penalties or cancellations from large clients such as Walmart, Amazon, and The Home Depot. For a firm already operating on thin liquidity, months of lost production would accelerate cash depletion and likely force new equity or debt issuance under distressed conditions. In effect, one preventable failure could move Plug Power from restructuring risk to insolvency risk almost overnight.

Industrial offtakers such as fertilizer, methanol, or steel producers buy hydrogen in far larger volumes under long-term contracts and integrate it into core processes. Plug chose to serve high-profile logistics and mobility clients instead, where consumption is small, infrastructure costs are high, price sensitivity is acute and the battery-powered alternatives are cheaper and more reliable. The result is a portfolio of customers who cannot absorb enough hydrogen to support large production plants and who treat supply as a commodity rather than a partnership. Plug Power bet on hydrogen as a transportation fuel instead of an industrial feedstock, and that decision now defines its collapse.

I’ve updated my data set of hydrogen for transportation plays as a couple of new entrants came to my attention. One, Bramble Energy, did so in the traditional way by having its bankruptcy announced. Many of the firms on this list flew under the radar until they plowed straight into a hillside. Another, Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies, posted a breathless paean to its growth plans in Asian commercial vehicles and data centers on LinkedIn, then the CEO spent a lot of time proving that they’d never taken a public relations course in their life in responses to comments about why that’s going to be problematic. As I noted recently, heavy fuel cell vehicle sales are plummeting in China while battery electric vehicles skyrocket. China has run the market test, and just as with every other trial of hydrogen vs batteries, batteries have won handily.

As for data centers, they are an AI-inflated bubble right now, and hydrogen, while frothy, isn’t remotely a good solution for what power is required at them. Electricity is their first or second highest operational expense, competing with equipment depreciation, with public statements by analysis organizations ranging from 20% to 60% of annual expenses. Hydrogen fuel cell-generated electricity will be the most expensive option in the list, with even gray hydrogen turning into electricity that costs over $600 per MWh. Data centers were averaging $100–$180 per MWh in 2024, so aren’t going to be interested in multiplying their electricity expense by a factor of three or more.

I’ve added Bramble to my table as Defunct and Horizon as high risk as a result. I’m sure that there are more missing, just as I’m sure that many of the ones that haven’t announced failure or pivoting have quietly done one or the other.

Plug now sits squarely in the “Desperation” phase of hydrogen for transportation firms’ life cycle. The life cycle has become predictable enough to resemble a case study in technological and financial sociology. It starts with the hype phase, when visionary founders and early investors make grand claims about decarbonizing trucks, ships, or aircraft with zero-emission hydrogen. They release glossy investor decks filled with hockey-stick demand projections and “addressable market” charts showing trillions in future opportunity. These firms are buoyed by government enthusiasm and a media narrative hungry for the next Tesla, leading to inflated valuations long before a single refueling station or kilogram of hydrogen is sold at a profit.

The second phase is scale signaling. Firms begin announcing gigawatt-scale electrolyzer projects, transcontinental refueling corridors, and partnerships with brand-name logistics or automotive companies. They often describe these as “strategic collaborations” rather than binding contracts. Most of the deals are memorandums of understanding or pilot programs. Capital expenditure estimates are heroic, but the underlying unit economics are fragile. Production costs remain multiple times higher than the market can bear, and every plan assumes rapid declines in hydrogen prices that never materialize.

Then comes the financial engineering phase, when reality begins to intrude. Cash burn accelerates as projects move from press release to prototype. The company raises more capital through equity dilution, government grants, and creative accounting maneuvers like “monetizing electricity rights” or asset leasing. Executives start talking about “margin expansion” and “vertical integration,” code words for moving costs around to buy time. Stock offerings are framed as growth financing rather than survival funding.

By the desperation phase, liquidity warnings appear in quarterly filings, projects are delayed, and “operational discipline” becomes the new corporate mantra. Plants that were supposed to deliver green hydrogen at $2 per kilogram still cost $8. Maintenance budgets are cut, staff are laid off, and asset sales are rebranded as optimization. Safety incidents, production interruptions, and missed delivery contracts begin to surface. Public relations efforts shift from transformation to endurance.

The final phase is collapse or absorption. A few assets are sold to larger industrial firms that value the hardware or grid connections more than the business. Shareholders are wiped out, early believers exit quietly, and the technology itself continues on in diminished form. What started as a climate solution ends as a balance-sheet salvage operation. The core problem was never lack of engineering talent. It was the decision to build an entire company around hydrogen as a transportation fuel, a role the molecule was never suited for. The physics were wrong, the economics were worse, and the hype cycle simply postponed the reckoning.

Plug is a veteran in the sector but not immune to the same structural economics. Its liquidity measures buy time but do not change the math. Even if it manages to create the $275 million in new liquidity, Plug’s monthly burn rate and debt obligations suggest less than a year of operating runway.

The risk trajectory is clear. Financial stress leads to deferred maintenance. Deferred maintenance leads to higher safety risk. Higher safety risk leads to hydrogen leaks and downtime. Those leaks erode the climate justification for green hydrogen and damage the company’s credibility with investors and regulators. Plug’s management may see maintenance cuts as a temporary bridge, but the bridge is being built from the same materials that are supposed to hold up the plant.

There is also a moral dimension. Every technician working at a Plug site depends on those safety systems being tested, calibrated, and maintained. Each time the company reduces maintenance spending it is transferring risk from the balance sheet to the workforce and the surrounding community. That is not an accounting entry. It is a gamble with real consequences.

Plug Power’s financial collapse is more a matter of timing than anything else. When a firm is forced to sell critical assets, suspend government-backed projects, and reduce maintenance on facilities handling thousands of kilograms of hydrogen every day, the endgame is already in sight. Hydrogen still has core applications in industry as a feedstock, but transportation was never a viable path to profit. Plug’s trajectory is a warning to investors and policymakers that enthusiasm does not replace economics.

When a company is down to selling its grid connections and stretching the maintenance that keeps its plants safe, it is no longer in the innovation business. It is in survival mode. The question is not whether the cuts will expose vulnerabilities, but when. Worker safety, climate integrity, and financial solvency are now bound together by the same neglected valves and corroded fittings. If those give way, it will not just be hydrogen escaping. It will be whatever remains of trust in the promise that this industry was supposed to deliver. My only hope is that no workers will be injured in Plug Power’s end game.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChatGPT-Image-Nov-10-2025-10_23_44-AM-800x445.png,N,,2025-11-10 18:01:07.303582

But a new front has opened, pitting these copper thieves against EV owners who are already trying to find the fastest chargers on the road. A rash of copper thefts targeting the valuable-for-scrap cables on EV chargers is leaving more and more EV owners wondering what to do when there's no way to connect their electric vehicles (EVs) to the charging network because the cables have been stolen.

Fortunately, a variety of solutions are being implemented by charging system providers, in the hope that the high rate of theft of EV charging cables can be brought under control. One of these providers is ChargePoint, which is combining 'cut-resistant' charging cables with alarm systems to reduce the rate of charger cable thefts. The cable-covering material is reinforced with steel, which resists the usual tools used to cut these cables, including bolt cutters, wire cutters, and battery-powered tools. These changes make it much more difficult and time-consuming for the thief to cut through a cable. ChargePoint also plans to license the use of these reinforced cables to other charging providers.

ChargePoint has also developed security software called ""ChargePoint Protect"" that can detect cable tampering or cutting in real time. The software, sent out as an over-the-air update and compatible with most of the company's charging stations, sets off alarms intended to scare thieves away while also notifying the owners of those charging stations about potential thefts in progress.

How are other EV charger companies getting creative?

Brooklyn-based charging provider It's Electric has eliminated the problem at its source by creating the first UL-certified detachable charging cable, the Brooklyn-718. Users of It's Electric's charging stations simply unlock the cables from a secure compartment near the charger and return the cables to the same locked storage area when they have finished. This innovation removes the cables from view while also making them much less attractive to thieves, who must first break into a storage compartment to access them — a big deal if you're in one of the states with the fewest public EV chargers.

In the UK, charging provider InstaVolt has collaborated with Formula Space, an EV design specialist, to introduce its new CableGuard system. CableGuard combines an outer sheath that is much more difficult to cut through with a 'forensic liquid' that is visible under UV light. This liquid not only identifies the copper cables as stolen but also the location from which they were stolen, in a database accessible to police. This feature will aid greatly in quickly prosecuting the offenders.

InstaVolt has also added security measures, including AI-powered CCTV that will identify nefarious activity as it happens. This starts with continuous, around-the-clock monitoring and ends with ex-military operatives patrolling charging sites and authorized to detain individuals acting suspiciously, leading to arrests and prosecutions. In addition, geo-tracking technology is used to alert security personnel when cables leave a charging site, enabling them to respond quickly.

Train travel in North America will soon get a lot faster

Choosing electric rail travel over a direct flight can cut emissions by around 86% (though, as The New York Times reported, much of the rail network in America still runs on highly polluting diesel). But while Japan's Shinkansen ""Bullet Trains"" debuted high-speed rail in 1964 and France's TGV marked a global high-speed train revolution once it began rolling in the early 1980s, North American rail travel has languished on the wrong side of the tracks.

But railfans, rejoice! Amtrak partnered with Alstom to deliver its next-generation premium Acela trainsets along 457 miles of track in the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor (NEC) in August 2025. Amtrak's trains can operate at top speeds of 160 mph versus today's fleet, which operates at top speeds of 150 mph, and connect Boston, New Jersey, and Washington, DC as part of a $2.45 billion investment in the NEC. Twenty-eight new trains will enter service through 2027. Elsewhere, high-speed train links operated by various bodies will soon follow between Portland and Vancouver, Las Vegas and Southern California, Miami and Tampa, Houston and Dallas, and, hopefully, San Francisco and Los Angeles-making future journeys faster and more relaxing.

By 2040, rush hour won't exist-thanks to self-driving electric vehicles

EVs and hybrid vehicles are mainstays of freeways, and mobility experts agree that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will transform travel. McKinsey's 2025 The Next Normal report ""The future of self-driving cars: Safer, smarter, and everywhere"" declares that by 2040, autonomous vehicles could be as commonplace as any household appliance-shaping how families organize their days, how cities are designed, and creating a driving experience that is smarter, safer, and all-around better. Hours spent watching the road could be used for video calling a friend, watching a movie, napping, or even working-all of which would make traveling during the daily commute and holiday period a little less painful.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are looking to a future approaching net zero

Long-haul trips account for 60% of aviation emissions and 69.3% of CO2 emissions from passenger travel. Rather than reinventing the wheel, airlines targeting IATA's ""net zero carbon by 2050"" goal are developing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to power existing aircraft engines.

In 2022, Swedish airline BRA made history as the first to operate a regional commercial aircraft with 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Supplier Neste's SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. Used neat, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel use.

Fifty airlines are investing in SAF, and over half a million flights have used SAF to some degree, but the industry is not without its critics. Some SAFs contain biofuels derived from crops, which can put pressure on global food supplies and contribute to deforestation. But the promise of ""synthetic"" or ""e-fuels"" created by artificially combining hydrogen with ambient pollutant carbon dioxide is looking to a future where the SAF lifecycle approaches net-zero.

Air Company's AIRMADE® SAF, which it markets under the dramatic tagline ""Extinction ends here,"" is a fully formulated drop-in jet fuel that can be produced at scale with access to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and clean hydrogen (H₂). AIRCO has commercial partnerships with airlines, including JetBlue and Virgin Atlantic, and has been awarded multiple government contracts, including with NASA and the United States Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Unit. If the technology holds up, it will change the conversation around fuel-based CO2 emissions for good.

Electric, hydrogen-powered, and supersonic aircraft promise to decarbonize and democratize air travel

Various technologies show promise for navigating the skies on short-, mid-, and long-haul trips. LA-based start-up Heart Aerospace's mission is to use sustainable, electrified regional aircraft to reduce emissions and make flying more accessible to more people around the world. Hydrogen-powered engines are a staple in space rockets, but challenging to apply in aviation, yet Airbus has bet big on hybrid hydrogen aircraft-its ZEROe aircraft concept is slated to launch by 2035.

And after the demise of Concorde, supersonic aviation is staging a comeback. Boom's sleek supersonic aircraft, Overture, has an aerodynamic, lightweight carbon-fiber design and new-generation supersonic engines that run entirely on SAF. In ""boomless cruise,"" the aircraft ensures there's no audible sonic boom using Mach cutoff physics, opening up overland routes. Boom has commitments from American Airlines and United Airlines, with the first aircraft due to be delivered in 2029, when passengers can fly from New York to San Francisco in four hours. In a few years, air travel time on some routes around the holidays and year-round could be halved.

Inspired by Star Trek, shuttles powered by ionic wind could enable us to boldly-and silently-go places we've gone before

Down the line, people might even take to the skies in a Star Trek-inspired, ionic wind-powered aircraft. In 2018, MIT engineers built and flew the first-ever plane with no moving parts-instead of propellers or turbines, the light aircraft is powered by an ""ionic wind,"" a silent flow of ions that generates enough thrust to sustain steady flight.

In MIT News, Steven Barrett, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, explained how the aircraft was inspired in part by the futuristic shuttlecrafts in the Star Trek TV shows and movies he watched avidly as a child. The physical principle of electroaerodynamic thrust was first identified in the 1920s, but remained the realm of hobbyists until a jetlagged Barrett did some back-of-the-napkin calculations after an uncomfortable flight. In the near term, he believes ion wind propulsion systems could be used to fly silent drones. Long-term, he says, they might be paired with more conventional combustion systems to create more fuel-efficient, hybrid large aircraft, including passenger planes.

Over the last year, Duke Energy has also taken a more muted position on initiatives investors commonly lump together as a shorthand for responsible corporate citizenship: environmental, social, and governance, or ESG.

In 2022, the utility published a full ESG report, calling it “one of our most important annual publications” and its principles “essential to who we are.” As Daniel Walton reports, the acronym and the phrase it represents were entirely absent from company communications this year, and the 2022 report appears to have disappeared from its website.

Duke Energy, Once Outspoken on Diversity and the Environment, Now Whispers

North Carolina’s largest utility promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and promised progress on environmental issues. But in recent years, those efforts have become harder to find.

Duke is far from alone. Across both the state and corporate America, many companies have pulled back from bold social statements and shed thousands of jobs tied to diversity efforts since a peak in 2023. Many fear the wrath of the Trump administration, which recently called ESG “a Marxist march through corporate culture.”

Chief Financial Officer Patrick Taylor said up-financings tied to new hydro contracts have been oversubscribed.
“Costs continue to come down, decreasing more than 50% in the past 12 months,” he said, and that counterparties are increasingly looking to execute long-term capacity contracts.
For utilities and IPPs planning portfolios around data center hubs, that combination of hydro contracts and multi-year storage capacity is a building block for firm service levels.
“The U.S. government will order new Westinghouse nuclear reactors to be built in the United States with an aggregate investment value of at least $80 billion,” she said.","Brookfield Renewable Partners sees a clear turn toward firm power as data centers, re-industrialization and broad electrification tighten supply in key markets.

On its third-quarter earnings call last week, the company highlighted hydro contracts with major technology buyers and a U.S. government partnership that could put Westinghouse at the center of a large nuclear build.

Chief Executive Officer Connor Teskey said demand is broad and rising.

“We continue to see accelerating demand for power across nearly all the markets in which we operate,” he said, pointing to three themes: electrification, reindustrialization and the “extraordinary demand for energy from hyperscalers.”

That demand profile is changing the resource mix.

“It is becoming increasingly apparent that meeting the surging demand for electricity will require an any-and-all solution, leveraging solar, wind, hydro, gas, nuclear and other technologies to ensure sufficient load and consistent delivery of electrons,” said Teskey.

The immediate shift is in baseload contracting. Brookfield is now re-contracting a meaningful slice of its U.S. hydro fleet to digital buyers. Teskey said the company has approximately 5 terawatt hours (TWh) of generation coming up for recontracting and is finding that hyperscalers are willing to sign long tenor agreements for dependable capacity.

“We also signed a new 20-year contract with Microsoft at another one of our hydro assets in PJM as part of our renewable energy framework with that counterparty,” he said. Earlier this year, Brookfield executed a hydro framework with Google and quickly followed with two facility-level deals.

Those PPAs are funding real work at the plants and in the balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer Patrick Taylor said up-financings tied to new hydro contracts have been oversubscribed.

“We executed upfinancings at our Holtwood and Safe Harbor hydro assets recently, following the first contracts under our framework agreement with Google that we signed earlier in the year,” he said. “And we completed an innovative upfinancing at our Smoky Mountain Hydro asset.”

Taylor said the deals were “over 5x oversubscribed at the tightest spreads we have seen for these types of financings in the past 5 years.”

These long-dated baseload PPAs are enabling uprates and modernization packages at legacy hydro stations. That typically includes turbine and runner refurbishment, generator rewinds, excitation and relay upgrades, digital governors and controls, dam safety improvements and cybersecurity hardening. Brookfield did not list specific scope items on the call, but the company made clear that hydro pricing uplift plus up-financings are creating headroom to invest.

Batteries also featured in the quarter, both on cost trend and delivered projects. Teskey said storage costs are improving quickly.

“Costs continue to come down, decreasing more than 50% in the past 12 months,” he said, and that counterparties are increasingly looking to execute long-term capacity contracts.

Brookfield said it commissioned a large system in Australia that signals the scale of future tenders.

“We advanced our global battery development strategy, highlighted by the delivery of a 340-megawatt battery in Australia, which combined with the first phase of this project is now the largest operating battery solution in the country,” Teskey said.

For utilities and IPPs planning portfolios around data center hubs, that combination of hydro contracts and multi-year storage capacity is a building block for firm service levels. It also suggests steady work for balance-of-plant contractors and suppliers, including switchyard upgrades, transformers, grid-forming inverters and controls, HVAC and fire systems for battery enclosures and multi-year service agreements to match the tenor of capacity sales.

Brookfield’s nuclear interest is expanding as well. Through its ownership stake in Westinghouse, the company expects to participate across design, engineering and long-term services. Co-President and General Counsel Jennifer Mazin described a new government partnership.

“The U.S. government will order new Westinghouse nuclear reactors to be built in the United States with an aggregate investment value of at least $80 billion,” she said.

The agreement supports the government’s goal of having 10 large-scale reactors with completed designs under construction by 2030 and includes government support for arranging financing, facilitating permits and the approvals required.

Westinghouse’s near-term role remains focused on the front end of the build and then long-term support.

Mazin said the company will provide “design, engineering and procurement services for these new build reactors,” and after commissioning, “we would expect to provide fuel and maintenance services for the lives of these new nuclear facilities, which is on average between 60 and 80 years each.”

She said the partnership should also catalyze the broader supply chain, adding that “orders of this magnitude should provide both a catalyst and enhanced certainty to the sector that should enable investment in the supply chain for Westinghouse and the nuclear industry more broadly.”

Brookfield has also signed a letter of intent to evaluate completing two AP1000 units at the VC Summer site in South Carolina. Teskey said the diligence window is short and interest from partners and offtakers is real.

“We are encouraged by our initial feedback from potential partners and hyperscaler offtakers,” he said, adding that protections could include sharing cost overrun burdens with offtakers and suppliers and arranging financing “that provides incremental liquidity in the event of cost overruns.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-4-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 20:00:25.892187

The lawsuit, which names the White House budget director, Russell T. Vought, as a main defendant, claims that the Trump administration took advantage of the lapse in government funding in October to slash energy programs in states where voters have supported Democrats.

The lawsuit came as a group of Democrats in the Senate broke rank on Sunday to support a funding measure that, if adopted by the Senate and House, would end the shutdown after more than 40 days of deep financial pain and sputtering government services.

According to the lawsuit, immediately as the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the White House kicked into high gear to halt billions destined for Democratic-led states, in an apparent attempt to gain leverage as lawmakers settled into a prolonged fight over funding. It argues the decision amounted to “intentional discrimination” and “bare animus,” inflicting deliberate hardship on states that voted against Mr. Trump in the last presidential election.

In a social media post on Oct. 1, Mr. Vought announced the government would terminate close to $8 billion for climate-related projects in 16 states, all represented by senators who caucus with the Democratic Party.

As the projects were officially terminated, according to the complaint, they would be unlikely to be revived even once the shutdown ends.

The original blog is included below this update.

A few weeks ago, I tackled EV policy, the United Nations' “green shipping plan” and the fight over rare earth minerals and, more broadly, the poor policy decisions that fire up flywheels without any idea of where the train is headed.

The last two editions of the Wall Street Journal brought this timely topic to the top of the list.

The point of the blog was less about power sources and more about the government’s attempt to pick a replacement technology with what one might call “light-bulb-off” decision-making. First, the government miscalculated the market’s “true” demand and the depth of the greenie’s commitment once they had to use their own wallet.

Second was the absence of the evaluation of the challenges in manufacturing and supply, which distracted every corner of America while redirecting otherwise time, materials and energy to what will be recognized as the “scrap heap” of 2025.

The notion of holistic, cradle-to-grave type thinking apparently was stuck in park.

We’ll all be paying for that now… But as stated 3 weeks ago, there are lessons to be taught from foolishness.

Scrapping Plans Underway at Ford

In her October 7, 2025 WSJ article, “Ford Considers Scrapping Electric Version of F-150 Truck,” Sharon Terlep reported that production of the money-losing F-150 EV pickup – once hyped as significant of its earlier “Model T” — may be shut down for good.

Low demand for electric trucks at hefty price tags and 1-ton batteries — as well as a $13 billion loss for Ford – is expected to bring the U.S.’ first major EV casualty. In October, the first month since the end of the EV tax credit, Ford’s U.S. EV sales in the U.S. fell 24% year over year.

And guess what? The failing EV Ford F-Series — at risk of shutdown — is actually the top-selling large EV this year — ahead of #2 by 41%.

Jenkins: ‘Dissect the Dishonesty’

A WSJ op-ed from Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., appeared the following day on “Ford’s Electric Pickup is an EV Casualty.” While it was President Trump and the GOP Congress who removed the fines that ended the incentives, Jenkins adds that the Democrats will be in charge again. “Maybe the useful thing now,” he writes, “is to dissect the collective dishonesty of the climate crowd.

Jenkins says, tongue-in-cheek, that the government’s policy may have started with a directive to find a way to “produce electric vehicles that are worse for the climate than if no EVs were produced.”

Two types of people supported and authorized the policy, he writes. First was the “Obama figures, who wanted EVs to wave in front of greens but also to preserve the profit model of the Big Three.”

The other camp, he says, was the army of climate groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Princeton-related Repeat Group and others — and the New York Times. “All proved willing to say whatever words were necessary to convey falsely that U.S. EV policy made sense,” Jenkins writes.

He makes the point that if policy incentives were “genuinely aimed at replacing gasoline-driven miles to produce a net reduction in greenhouse emissions,” the output would not have been the “big showpieces like the Ford F-150 Lightning, the Hummer EV or the new and fabulously absurd $400,000 Cadillac Celestiq.”

He adds that “Building these cars’ batteries and keeping them charged is guaranteed to produce more emissions than they can displace in their lifetimes … These cars are net insults to the climate and lose billions — the very definition of policy perversity.”

Other Automakers in Trouble, Too

WSJ also reported the plans by Stellantis and GM to discontinue electric truck production, as well as tanking Tesla Cybertruck sales and how EV truck-maker Rivian is slashing jobs to conserve cash.

GM has lost billions on electric trucks after rolling out a string of them in recent years. It sold just 1,800 of its 3 electric pickup models in October. The automaker set aside $1.6 billion in the third quarter to account for losses, with more to be added to the pile.

Last month, GM said it was idling the Detroit factory that makes its EV Silverado truck, and also stopped making its EV cargo van.

Meanwhile, Honda booked the equivalent of $1.49 billion in one-time electric vehicle-related expenses for losses and impairment on EVs sold in the U.S. and wrote down EV development assets. This comes after the May announcement that it would cut its EV investment by $20 billion in the coming years.

We’ll Leave the Light on For You

No one revels in seeing a cash-kindled EV fire burn, but ponder the horrendous waste that has already happened and will occur for years.

Workers – At Ford alone, an estimated 730 workers were laid off by the F-150 Lightning stoppage. Terlep estimates the number of workers already put on the unemployment lines is in the thousands.

Suppliers – Our industry competes with the automakers for raw materials, components and supplies, and the waste to date is beyond comprehension. The fact that so much of these materials couldn’t be sourced domestically only added to the burning embers of the trade war because of a belief that America can only win if its automakers do, too.

Automakers – Coming to the auto companies last since they aren’t smart enough to consider how misled government regulations and propped-up incentives could be corrected by another administration. Ford alone tooled itself up with a capacity to build 150,000 Lightnings a year.

A few more observations:

When is the last time that a lack of a plan, or even a “concept of a plan,” has worked out — after the fact — when the government is calling the shots?

Just because the potential exists for advanced technology doesn’t justify subsidies or propped-up sales support. And a rush to choose one technology over another – and the wrong one at that – will delay real progress for years.

Emotional, bandwagon-jumping fanfare brought false hope and, in some cases, fear. The U.S. public was sold a bill of goods, and the bill will be paid in one form or another.

Regulations, subsidies and incentives … This is what happens when the government gets into the business of business.

The ‘Greening Up’ Numb-Skullery

Published October 21, 2025

The creation of an environmental agenda P&L — that recognizes the big picture rather than obsessions on any one piece — can keep foolhardy notions grounded where they belong

It was 31 years ago that I wrote my first business-to-business media op-ed piece. Over the years, I’ve advised our developing columnists and bloggers to always keep a few opinion-piece ideas on hand, even if half-baked. Because sometimes you gotta throw one away and start over.

Some of you, seated to my left, might say this one deserves the circular file. But hey, it comes with the territory …

Seriously, my advice to up-and-coming bloggers? Start a “stupid stuff” file folder and fill it when you see something that affects your audience’s livelihood.

My file folder, by the way, is overflowing these days…

Foolishness is a Great Teacher

In addition to the spectator sport of column-writing, reporting on foolishness does serve a purpose if we can merely learn from it. And since numb-skullery knows no bounds, a flag thrown on one poor decision can keep another from being made elsewhere.

In the Oct. 19, Wall Street Journal, I read about the U.N.’s “green shipping plan” (“Trump Backlash Delays Green Shipping Plan,” by Ed Ballard and Costas Paris) to decarbonize the ocean shipping trade. The WSJ reports that the proposal, supported by some 60 nations and intended to take effect in 2027, would require ship-owners to use lower-carbon alternatives to conventional shipping fuel or pay a fee that ratches up over time.

Lower-carbon fuels are more expensive. Shipping-services provider Clarksons noted that the plan for higher-cost “could cost the shipping industry more than $3 trillion to switch to new forms of green power.”

Thankfully, President Donald Trump quickly sank its prospects to the bottom of the ocean. Shipping accounts for 3% of global carbon emissions, but we also don’t need a cure that’s worse than the disease.

Closer to home, we have entire industries just hanging on while food prices skyrocket. Who in their right mind is asking for another propped-up “initiative” that further erodes farmers’ and manufacturers' razor-thin margins in the name of greening things up?

Few winners in endeavors like these, but plenty of losers.

How many times will we let the train leave the station without any idea where it’s going?

Rare Earths, Even Rarer Thinking

The dearth of rare earths – as well as other metals – is also story making headlines nearly daily. Rare earths are in demand for virtually every advanced technology today, including electronics, energy and defense.

Not only are rare earths controlled by China, but less-than-stellar domestic policies caused their already short supply to be compounded. As China chokes off our ability to source rare earths, our trade officers are consumed in negotiations to protect a segment not yet ready for prime time anyway.

Let’s talk EVs for a moment. President Joe Biden convinced Americans to artificially “prop up” the sales of EVs regardless of the automakers’ ability to actually manufacture the vehicles. According to Benchmark Source, the need for EV motors significantly increased rare earth demand. In 2024, rare earth demand grew 32% from the previous year. In 2025, this demand is expected to increase 16%.

We’d still have a severe rare-earth shortage, but we wouldn’t be scrapping for the minerals destined for automakers.

No, I’ve not been particularly supportive of the electric car obsession that our former president “chose” to create because it was “trendy” and without analysis, economic or otherwise.

Instead, one can argue that if and when the technology (and its infrastructure) is proven and John Q. Public believes in EVs of its own free will (and not because of a handout), those EV order books can be filled on their own.

Oh, and by the way, the Oct. 20 Wall Street Journal noted that General Motors admitted its own EV pullback would cost it $1.6 billion. Some maintain that “Old Joe” picked the wrong technology altogether for the next-generation powered vehicle.

If this were golf, nearly everyone would be shouting “Mulligan” at the same time.

An Environmental Agenda P&L

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, holistic is defined as “dealing with or treating the whole of something or someone and not just a part.” If we want to pursue things in the name of environmentalism, we need a holistic environmental P&L. That is, if carbon reductions are desired in say, autos, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to rev up the so-called “dirty power” elsewhere to create a grid that cannot be sustained. The ledger doesn’t balance.

I’ve seen it first-hand. You can attack one line item with such vigor that you can whittle it down to near nothing, but at an expense 10-fold on another line that results in little, if any, holistic impact on what was desired in the first place. Those byproducts like shock and surprise, egg on one’s face, frustrations and gnashing of teeth could have been altogether avoided.

On a lighter note, I have an analogy to make about those trains leaving the station without any plan or consideration.

Just over 20 years ago, my sisters and I pitched in and bought our dad, Frank, a season-long lawn care service after his riding mower went to its final resting place at the scrap yard.

Just a few months into it, Dad was complaining about the per-cut expense and the agronomic intellect of his “custom cutters.” So he bought his first-ever ZTR from a local equipment dealer. Not only did he purchase a contractor-grade model (a Gravely from Wisconsin’s Dan Ariens) that he’ll never put enough hours on in his suburban lot, but he also went “big” with the width of his mower deck.

Limited by his two-car garage, the footprint of the mower required a green-lighting of a new-shed construction to house his new ZTR. Then, apparently to give him more time on his new ZTR during the dry Wisconsin summers, he had an irrigation system installed. The purchases that summer easily exceed $30,000 in today’s dollars.

Perhaps to protect himself from the watchful eye my late mother (and chief financial officer), we don’t believe his accounting factors in the permits, concrete-pouring, shingling, painting and upkeep of the shed, nor the steadily increasing implement purchases, the water bills or the mobile-service to keep his trusty ZTR in tip-top shape.

“Yeah, it turned out to be an expensive mower purchase, I guess,” he says, smiling about his “investments.” And then almost always adds, “It was just going to be money I might someday give the kids.”

Frank has earned the right to have some fun on his property and toss some dollars around. Those with oversight of our hard-earned tax contributions, well, not so much.

You get the picture. As author Lewis Caroll voiced through the Cheshire Cat, “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.”

It’s time to chart the course – and known and unknown variables – before starting up the locomotives. Are we ready to take inventory and learn?

Glenfarne has selected Baker Hughes as its supplier for main refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the North Slope gas treatment plant. Baker Hughes has also committed to a strategic investment to support Alaska LNG. The agreements were announced today in a ceremony in Washington, D.C., with U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright.

“Baker Hughes is pleased to support Alaska LNG with our gas technology solutions,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman and CEO of Baker Hughes. “Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market.”

“Baker Hughes is a welcome partner for Alaska LNG because of their leadership in LNG compression technology,” said Brendan Duval, CEO and founder of Glenfarne. “Their participation reflects Alaska LNG’s momentum and its ability to attract global partners to achieve national and state energy objectives.”

""American LNG is not just an energy source – it's a strategic asset that powers our economy, strengthens our alliances, and secures our nation's future,"" said Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. ""By forging this strategic alliance and investment in the Alaska LNG Project, we're strengthening our nation's energy security while advancing a bold vision for U.S. energy independence and global competitiveness. Together, through partnerships with industry leaders like Glenfarne and Baker Hughes, we're building the infrastructure and partnerships that ensure U.S. leadership in reliable, responsible, and affordable energy for decades to come – starting in Alaska.""

“Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in our nation’s history,"" said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. ""Today’s investment announcement is an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the energy security of America and our allies. The Trump administration remains committed to unleashing Alaska’s energy potential, including by supporting Alaska LNG.”

Glenfarne is developing Alaska LNG in two financially independent phases to accelerate project execution. Phase One consists of an 807-mile, 42-inch pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to meet Alaska’s domestic energy needs. Worley is expected to complete final engineering and cost analysis for the pipeline in December leading into a final investment decision on this phase of the project.

Phase Two of the project will add the LNG terminal and related infrastructure to enable 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG export capability and is expected to declare FID in late 2026.

Glenfarne became lead developer of Alaska LNG in March. Since then, Glenfarne has secured preliminary commercial commitments with leading LNG buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand for 11 MPTA of LNG, more than 60% of the volume needed to reach FID, including recent agreements with Tokyo Gas, JERA Co. Inc. and POSCO International Corporation.

Glenfarne’s permitted North American LNG portfolio totals 32.8 MTPA of capacity across projects in Alaska, Texas, and Louisiana. The companies previously announced that Baker Hughes will supply compression equipment for Glenfarne’s Texas LNG project.

The ALPS Clean Energy ETF (ACES B) has returned 31.9% year-to-date, according to ETF Database.

The outflows come as renewables overtook coal as the biggest source of global electricity for the first time in the first half of 2025, according to CNN. Global renewable power capacity will likely double over the next five years, increasing by 4,600 gigawatts.

Inflation and higher energy costs were among the issues that helped Democrats notch larger-than-expected wins in last week’s off-year elections, particularly in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as in Georgia, where voters elected two Democrats to the state’s utility board, the first time any members of that party will serve on it in almost two decades.

In Virginia, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger made clean power, including renewables and offshore wind, central to her goal of lowering energy prices for the state’s residents. Likewise, in New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill pledged to declare a state of emergency over rising utility costs on her first day in office and freeze rate increases for residential customers. She said her administration will also “massively build out cheaper and cleaner power generation.”

Surveys consistently show that a majority of Americans favor increased use of renewable power, though earlier this year, Pew and Gallup found support for doing so had weakened considerably from past levels. Perhaps that’s because Donald Trump was elected on a promise of lowering costs for Americans, particularly energy prices, by setting aside environmental concerns to dramatically increase oil and gas production and even expand coal use. So far, that strategy has failed.

While gasoline prices are down slightly from a year ago, residential electricity rates have jumped about 10% this year, more than double the rate of overall inflation. The rapid increase in power demands from AI data centers has been a big factor in why electricity prices are rising. At the same time, the Trump administration’s elimination of federal incentives for clean power threatens to make it harder over the next few years for utilities to keep up with rapidly growing electricity demand, given that wind and solar systems, combined with battery storage, can be added faster.

And setting aside the climate benefits, clean power is now competitive with conventional natural gas, if not cheaper in many cases. “A gas-fired power plant, a simple cycle plant with a combustion turbine, is probably in the neighborhood of $2,000 a kilowatt to build,” Bob Frenzel, CEO of Minnesota-based utility Xcel Energy, told Forbes. “That's probably the same price as a wind farm, as a rule of thumb. … So you can see where if you're measuring sheer energy, wind can be competitive on a megawatt-hour basis.”

A year from now, when voters go to the polls to decide on who they want in Congress, politicians pushing cheap, clean power could have an edge.

The Big Read

Elon Musk’s $1 Trillion Pay Plan: The Case For Magical Thinking

The only thing more outlandish than Elon Musk’s demand for a $1 trillion pay package is the idea that Tesla’s shareholders would grant it. And yet that is how things played out, with everyone from massive investment funds to small, individual investors approving compensation so vast the new Pope decried it. It’s a bet that lightning will strike again for the most successful U.S. industrial entrepreneur of the 21st century — that Musk can overcome Tesla’s falling electric vehicle sales and his tarnished image by pivoting to AI-powered robotaxis and humanoid robots.

With its stock already trading near an all-time high, at over 300 times projected earnings, many investors appear to think that’s a foregone conclusion even before votes were tallied at today’s annual meeting. Over 75% of shareholders approved the package, Brandon Ehrhart, Tesla’s general counsel, told attendees.

“Tesla's current valuation only makes sense if you attribute magic powers to Elon Musk,” said Gautam Mukunda, a professor with the Yale School of Management. “If you break out the new business lines he’s talking about, there’s no particular reason to believe that Tesla is the leading company for self-driving cars. Waymo's technology is clearly better. … The only evidence that Tesla is the leader in this technology is that Elon Musk says so.”

And that’s also the crux of the proxy. “Musk’s greatest skill is his ability to convince investors that he can do the miraculous,” said Mukunda.

Hot Topic

Dandelion Energy CEO Dan Yates on its leasing program for geothermal systems to cut home heating and cooling costs

What you’re doing is different from conventional and next-generation geothermal systems that generate energy. How does Dandelion’s tech work?

We are not generating electricity or power at all. We are using a bore in the backyard effectively to exchange heat with the earth. So we're sucking heat out of the earth using a heat pump inside the house. The result of that is an ultra-high efficiency furnace and air conditioner. The vast majority of building emissions are from heating and cooling, not climate change, but climate control-related. We basically cut that in half. The big driver for our business and for the industry is that everything is getting electrified – and we've been an unexpected and happy beneficiary of some evolution in the federal regulatory landscape that’s supporting geothermal.

But again, things are getting electrified. We've seen it first and most notably with transportation and electric vehicles, but it's coming for heating now, too. In fact, for the last two years, more heat pumps have been sold than natural gas furnaces in the U.S., which is surprising to most people. That's trend one. Trend two is that there's a tremendous amount of pressure on the electric grid, and demand is going up most notably from AI data centers, but also just from the broader electrification initiatives.

Geothermal is by far the least impactful on the electric grid of any electric heating option. A homebuyer will enjoy half the energy consumption or utility bills from a geothermal system compared to a conventional air source heat pump.

How deep do you need to drill for a home system?

It's a question of the capacity or the heating demand of the house. As a general matter, it’s about 100 to 150 feet for every ton of heating. A typical new home requires maybe three tons, so that’s about 400 feet.

What's the approximate size of the hole you’re boring? And what are you installing in it?

Five-and-a-half inches. It’s a very narrow bore.

We install a ground loop, which is two pipes that are really right next to each other, and then they're connected at just the bottom with what's called a U-bend that connects the two pipes of the water. It flows down one and then comes right back up the other one. We run that down to the bottom, along with a third pipe that's called a tremie line. You end up with a fully cemented-in finished product where there's really no environmental interaction. It's locked in there, it's done.

I jokingly call our kind of geothermal “lukewarm geothermal.” A system like Fervo’s is going much deeper and looking for 500-degree heat, where they’re trying to make steam. … What we do is suck the heat out of the water that's circulating through this loop and concentrate that heat up to 110 degrees, then pump that, blowing air over it to circulate air into the house to heat the house. Then we're pumping water back down into the hole that's now almost at freezing, so we actually put antifreeze in the water. You'll have 30-degree water going back into the hole, and then that water gets heated up from the 50-degree Earth. Then we suck the heat out of that water again and push it into the house. It's a classic refrigeration cycle where you're making something hotter than the surrounding area by pushing heat into the hotter area.

The classic performance metric for a heat pump is COP, the coefficient of power, which is how many units of energy do you produce for every unit of heat that you consume from electricity? Our systems regularly have a COP around 5 or in the low 4s, and that's the full seasonal lifecycle of the system. What you'll see listed as the highest efficiency air source heat pumps will be in the 3s, but then when you get to the coldest days of the year, they drop into the 2s, and many of them drop into the 1s. So we end up having this major overperformance relative to conventional heat pumps.

You’re leasing systems to homeowners. So what does using this type of heating and cooling system cost, factoring in federal and state incentives?

We are already the happy recipient of a number of state-level incentives. We've got a lot of activity in the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast and in Colorado. All of these regions have pretty robust state-level incentives that encourage geothermal.

One detail with federal rules is the tax credit is only available to commercially-owned geothermal systems. You can't build a home with geothermal, sell it to the home buyer, and then they go and file for the credit. They're not a commercial entity. The system doesn't have to be in a commercial building. It just has to be owned by a corporation, essentially.

That's where leasing came in. [Congress] inserted language that said geothermal systems can be leased. And that allowed us to take this sizable credit. The base credit is 30%, but you get 10% extra if the system is built, predominantly, in the U.S. – and essentially all geothermal systems are. So it's effectively a 40% credit across the board.

Our leasing partners typically will structure something like 20-year leases. The punchline is that the homebuyers are paying anywhere from as little as $15 bucks a month to $60, sort of in that range. And they're saving anywhere from $600 to $1,000 a year.

Sourced from the EU Emissions Trading System, these projects will benefit from a total of €643 million to help deploy their ground-breaking decarbonisation solutions.

The projects are expected to enter into operation between 2027 and 2029 and should reduce emissions by some 88 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent over their first ten years of operation.

Located across four EU Member States, these projects represent a major boost to Europe’s manufacturing industry and the emerging battery ecosystem. Implementing innovative processes and technologies, they will support key segments of the battery value chain with advanced material production, cell manufacturing, recycling technologies and second-life applications.

Their combined impact will contribute to:

the creation of direct and indirect jobs

increased European autonomy and reduced dependence on external suppliers

By accelerating the commercialisation of next-generation EV battery innovations, the projects will play a key role in delivering on the EU’s climate and industrial objectives, while strengthening technological competitiveness and resilience.

As a key clean technology, EV batteries advance the objectives of theClean Industrial Deal and Industrial Action Plan for the European automobile sector by supporting the business case for products necessary in the clean transition and improving Europe’s competitiveness in this area. They are also in line with the objectives of the Net-Zero Industry Act and the Critical Raw Materials Act by reducing dependence on imported materials and building resilient, sustainable supply chains. Their second life and recycling applications align with the Circular Economy Action Plan, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy. Finally, the projects selected under this call are consistent with the Batteries Regulation, which promotes a competitive and sustainable European battery industry.

Background

A Grant Agreement is the formal contract between the European Commission and the project beneficiary that defines the project’s objectives, funding amount, eligible costs, rights, and obligations under the Innovation Fund.

The Innovation Fund 2024 Battery call was launched on 3 December 2024 and closed on 24 April 2025, attracting 14 applications from across Europe. In July 2025, the European Commission announced that six projects were invited to enter the grant preparation phase. One of the six invited projects decided to withdraw from grant preparation, resulting in five successfully signing their Grant Agreements with CINEA.

With an estimated revenue of €40 billion (calculated based on a carbon price of €75 per tonne of CO2) from the EU Emissions Trading System between 2020 and 2030, the Innovation Fund seeks to drive investment in cutting-edge, low-carbon and net-zero technologies, supporting Europe’s transition to climate neutrality.

Also launched in 2024, the Innovation Fund call for proposals for net-zero technologies has recently announced the 61 projects selected for grant agreement preparation along with its second renewable hydrogen auction under the European Hydrogen Bank. Grant agreements for both the call and auction are expected to be signed in the coming months.

(TSXV: SURG) (OTCQB: SRGXF) (Frankfurt: G6D2) (“Surge” or the “Company”) provides its perspective on recent policy and infrastructure developments that strengthen Canada’s critical minerals framework and investment climate. These initiatives, spanning fiscal incentives announced in the 2025 Federal Budget, the launch of the G7 Critical Minerals Alliance, and provincial investments in transmission infrastructure in British Columbia, highlight the evolving landscape for responsible development of projects such as the Company’s 100%-owned Berg copper-molybdenum project in west-central British Columbia.

Federal Budget 2025: Expanded Support for Critical Minerals

The Government of Canada’s 2025 Federal Budget introduced several measures that reinforce national competitiveness in critical minerals development. Key initiatives include:

Expansion of the Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit (CTMITC): Budget 2025 confirms the federal government’s intention to proceed with previously announced measures to expand eligibility under this 30 percent refundable tax credit (which can eliminate a company’s income tax payable in a given year and provide a cash refund for any remaining balance), including the addition of new critical minerals and support for polymetallic mining and processing activities. Once implemented, these measures could meaningfully expand access to this important fiscal incentive for projects such as Berg, where the majority of production by value is anticipated to come from copper.

Extension and expansion of the Critical Minerals Exploration Tax Credit: Budget 2025 broadens eligibility for this flow-through-share incentive to include molybdenum and other transition metals, reflecting the federal government’s recognition of their importance in high-performance steel and industrial, technological, and energy applications. Molybdenum represents a significant component of the Berg resource and a key value driver for the project.

Creation of new federal investment vehicles: Budget 2025 outlines new and expanded federally funded investment vehicles, including the Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund and the First and Last Mile Fund, aimed at providing direct equity and infrastructure support to qualifying projects.

Enhanced coordination of federal project financing initiatives: Budget 2025 introduces a new framework to align Canada’s major project financing institutions, including the Major Projects Office, Canada Infrastructure Bank, Canada Growth Fund, Export Development Canada, and the Canada Indigenous Loan Guarantee Corporation. The initiative is designed to streamline access to capital and coordinate support for “nation-building” projects that advance clean growth, economic competitiveness, and Indigenous participation. This integrated approach aims to accelerate the development of large-scale strategic projects across Canada’s resource and infrastructure sectors.

Collectively, these measures may influence the economic framework for Canadian critical minerals projects and provide potential incentives for advanced development projects such as Berg.

G7 Critical Minerals Alliance: Global Demand Alignment

Canada’s leadership role in the newly established G7 Critical Minerals Alliance underscores an international commitment to developing secure, transparent, and standards-based supply chains for materials essential to modern industrial, technological, and energy systems. Surge believes this framework will encourage long-term cooperation between allied nations and may support diversified and transparent supply chains for responsibly produced critical minerals, including copper and molybdenum concentrates.

As a potential future producer of copper and molybdenum concentrates with no offtake agreements yet in place, Berg offers flexibility to supply either domestic processors or allied markets, aligning with Canada’s goal of diversifying exports beyond the United States and strengthening trusted supply chains.

British Columbia: Enabling Infrastructure and Investment Climate

Complementing federal and international initiatives, the Government of British Columbia has advanced the North Coast Transmission Line (NCTL), a multi-phase transmission project intended to expand grid capacity in the northwest of the province to support growth in sectors such as ports, mining, and LNG. Under Bill 31 (Energy Statutes Amendment Act, 2025), the Province is fast-tracking the project by amending legislation to allow co-ownership with First Nations, streamline permitting, and adjust the electricity-allocation framework such that connection priority is given to vital growth industries (including mining and resource development) rather than the typical first-come, first-served basis. Construction is expected to begin in 2026 with phased in-service dates targeted around 2030.

While the Berg Project does not strictly depend on the NCTL for its power connection, the initiative creates important flexibility in a region where demand for industrial electricity is rapidly escalating. It reflects the government’s proactive recognition of potential infrastructure bottlenecks and its willingness to act in advance to unlock resource development.

Positioning of the Berg Project

With these converging policy developments, Berg is well aligned with current federal and provincial initiatives supporting critical minerals development. The project’s large-scale copper and molybdenum resource, favourable logistics, and low-carbon, hydro-powered design align directly with national and international priorities for responsible resource development.

“Recent policy developments, including Budget 2025 measures and federal and provincial infrastructure initiatives, highlight Canada’s efforts to strengthen its critical minerals sector,” said Leif Nilsson, CEO of Surge. “Projects such as Berg illustrate how these policy measures could create opportunities for advancing critical minerals development in Canada through coordinated efforts among industry, government, and Indigenous partners.”
