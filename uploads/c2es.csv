The bill, which is currently being considered by the Senate, would stop clean energy progress in its tracks, raise energy costs for everyday people, and exact a devastating toll on our environment. Here are the top five reasons we cannot allow this bill to become law.

1. Higher energy costs for our families and communities.

The bill passed by the House would cut clean energy and energy efficiency programs, rebates, and incentives, effectively putting an end to clean energy development across the country. At a time when we need to be producing more energy, not less, cutting clean energy programs would force communities to rely on dirty, expensive fossil fuels. This bill would exacerbate already sky-high energy prices by driving up costs by hundreds of dollars a year for families nationwide.

2. Harms public health.

This bill would eliminate pollution reduction programs that are cleaning up our schools, ports, and transportation, while at the same time cutting funding that allows communities to track harmful pollution. The loss of these programs would mean increased toxic air pollution that causes asthma, heart conditions, cancer, premature death, and more.

4. Putting billionaire polluters above the law.

The bill also establishes a system that allows oil and gas companies to avoid responsibility for the impacts of pollution they create and sidestep environmental review, community input, and judicial scrutiny simply by paying a fee. This would give polluters free reign to pollute as much as they want without regard for the impacts on communities and the environment.

5. Threats to the economy and national security.

With this bill, Republicans are poised to gut widely-supported clean energy tax credits and other investments. These public investments, paired with hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments, are crucial to supporting America’s manufacturing resurgence and have created hundreds of thousands of jobs, with more than half of those jobs in Republican-held districts. If these investments were cut, those jobs would be lost and American clean energy manufacturing would stall, tanking the economy and ceding global clean energy manufacturing leadership to China.

It’s the lowest figure AAA has seen since 2019

Americans have more electric cars to choose from than ever before. Increasingly, they don’t plan to choose them.

A new study from AAA finds just 16% of Americans consider themselves “likely” or “very likely” to buy an electric vehicle (EV) for their next car. That’s down from 18% last year and 23% the year before.

“While the automotive industry is committed to long-term electrification and providing a diverse range of models, underlying consumer hesitation remains,” says Greg Brannon, AAA’s director of automotive engineering.

Hesitant Over Costs, Range

59% cited high prices, and 62% feared high battery costs as reasons to stay away

58% worried about long-distance travel being too hard with an EV

AAA surveyed 1,128 adults “using a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the U.S. household population overall” in early March. Researchers say their study has a 4% margin of error.

Money is holding drivers back from EVs. Sixty-two percent cited the high cost of battery replacement as the biggest reason they weren’t interested. Another 59% cited the high purchase price.

The average EV sold for $59,255 last month – $10,556 more than the $48,699 price of the average car.

Range proved a concern, too, with 58% saying EVs are unsuitable for long-distance travel. EV range is improving, but many industry insiders say it won’t change drastically until manufacturers perfect next-generation solid-state batteries.

The Shift Is Well Underway Elsewhere

A recent report said 25% of all new cars sold globally could be EVs this year

America is stuck below 7%

That could leave the American auto industry uncompetitive

A recent report from the International Energy Agency found that, worldwide, about a quarter of all new cars could be electric this year.

Americans have bought more EVs so far in 2025 than they did in the first six months of 2024. But EVs made up just 6.9% of the American market last month.

Automakers worry that they’re falling behind. However, China’s automotive industry is growing quickly, with Chinese automaker BYD now the world’s largest EV builder and Chinese brands selling well worldwide.

U.S. laws currently exclude Chinese automakers from the American market, but even industry insiders don’t expect that firewall to last forever.

But it Faces New Headwinds in the U.S.

Congress could eliminate EV tax credits for Americans soon

The Trump administration has frozen funds for new chargers

America’s automakers are increasingly hobbled as they try to fight back.

A law recently passed in the House of Representatives would end a $7,500 EV tax credit. It’s not clear that the proposal will pass the Senate. It’s currently tied up in Republican infighting as President Trump and his top donor, Elon Musk, clash over the bill.

But the White House has paused funds for new chargers.

American automakers are starting to signal a retreat from EVs. Ram recently revived its Hemi V8 engine, and several automakers have delayed new electric cars amid flagging consumer interest.

That risks an American auto industry that can only build cars Americans want. Ford CEO Jim Farley, once a booster of international growth, recently called the industry “increasingly a regional business.”",https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Tesla-dealership-model-y-and-model-3.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 19:07:48.362728

Markey joined by labor leaders, workers in Dorchester at IBEW Local 103

Boston (June 6, 2025) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee, today hosted a press conference at IBEW Local 103 with labor union leaders and workers to highlight how Congressional Republicans’ proposed budget reconciliation cuts to climate and clean energy investments from the Inflation Reduction Act would hurt workers in Massachusetts.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the House-passed Republican bill would cut more than $500 billion in investments for environment, energy, and climate, which could lead to 830,000 jobs lost by 2030 and shrink the national economy by $1.1 trillion over the next decade.

“In Massachusetts, we have over 115,000 workers in the clean energy sector. Thousands of union jobs will be at risk. Trump and Republicans are selling out the livelihoods of working people and the future of our children, all to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. The Trump agenda is clear: steal from the workers to give to the wealthy. But if Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans think that union workers are going to roll over as their jobs, families, and livelihoods are threatened—they have another thing coming,” said Senator Markey. “Together, we are going to make clear how Republicans are hurting people in their own states; slow and stop this bill—defending our jobs, our future, and our way of life; and put Republicans on the record. The fight ahead of us is hard, but the harder the fight, the more important it is that we take it on. We fight until we win. For every worker. For every American. For a livable future.”

“We need more energy, and we need more jobs in Massachusetts, plain and simple. Working families shouldn’t have to purchase energy from billionaire oil tycoons and foreign governments or let them set the price of our energy bills. We can generate massive amounts of energy right here in Massachusetts and we can create thousands of union jobs for Massachusetts residents while we do it. Over the last few years, thousands of our neighbors and our friends have been put to work on electric grid upgrades, battery storage facilities, and manufacturing plants. They’re building our clean energy future and we’re all benefiting: the family that these workers support, the homes, the schools, the businesses that need a reliable supply of energy, and every one of us that will live on a cleaner, safer planet because of it.” said Chrissy Lynch, President, Massachusetts AFL-CIO.

“Repealing clean energy tax credits is a union job killer. These tax credits help level the playing field, they drive investment, and they put IBW electricians, laborers, ironworkers, and pipe fitters to work building America’s energy future. If you take those tax credits away, you’re not just pulling funding: you’re pulling paychecks from working families, you’re pulling apprentices out of training facilities, you’re pulling opportunity straight out of our communities. Every solar panel installed, every wind turbine wired, every EV charger connected, that’s a job with wages, healthcare, and a pension that stands for dignity for the American worker. You don’t kill that kind of progress: you build on it.” said Lou Antonellis, Business Manager/Financial Secretary, IBEW Local 103.

“Hundreds of thousands of lives will be affected if these tax credits are repealed. Our members are the ones out here in the freezing cold and the blazing heat; laying foundations, wiring schools, setting steel, climbing wind turbines, and putting up solar panels. I’m here today representing those skilled union workers who build the schools our kids learn in, the bridges we drive on, and because of smart, clean energy investments, the solar and wind farms that will power our future. With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we saw national investment in clean energy that wasn’t about corporate tax breaks. It was about people. It meant workers having access to construction projects that benefit communities and families and taking part in building a clean economy. But now the Republican Reconciliation package threatens to undo all of that. said Chaton Green, Business Agent, Greater Boston Building Trades Union.

“We need long-term, sustained investment in renewable energy to ensure this work continues well beyond the current round of offshore wind projects. Major solar and hydroelectric projects must also move forward to deliver clean power to our communities and meaningful, local jobs to our members. These are more than just jobs—they’re life-changing careers, especially for people who have historically been left out of economic opportunity. This is exactly the kind of progress we need to protect and expand for the future,”said Andy Benedetto, Business Representative, Local 1121 Millwrights.

» MORE: After West Texas fire, lawmakers approve ban on outdoor chemical storage facilities near homes — Travis Bubenik, Marfa Public Radio","After 140 days at the Capitol in Austin, the Texas Legislature has just wrapped up its 89th session.

This year, state lawmakers passed over 1,200 bills. Among them were several important pieces of legislation focused on energy and the environment. Barring a veto from Gov. Greg Abbott, these will soon become law in Texas.

Here’s a breakdown of some of those measures.

A push for water security and wildfire resilience

Abbott opened this year’s legislative session by naming water as one of his top priorities.

“We will make the largest investment in water in the history of Texas,” said Abbott in his State of the State address. “We will tap into new water supplies and repair pipes to save billions of gallons of water each year.”

The numbers back up the need: According to the Texas Water Development Board, groundwater availability is expected to drop by 25% by 2070. Supply will be decreasing even as demand is expected to double – possibly much sooner.

Across the Texas Plains and Panhandle, farmers rely heavily on groundwater for irrigation, putting enormous pressure on the state’s aquifers. But that’s also changing in Texas.

“Our municipal demand is steadily increasing and will surpass the irrigation,” said L’Oreal Stepney, chairwoman for the Texas Water Development Board, before lawmakers earlier in the session.

“Municipal is going to be the number one user, and it’ll be here before we know it,” she added.

A new bill, Senate Bill 7, would pump $1 billion each year into the Texas Water Fund. The money will go toward developing new water sources and shoring up old infrastructure — a lifeline for both farmers and growing cities.

Meanwhile, the Panhandle, still reeling from the state’s largest-ever wildfire last year, saw movement on another front. Lawmakers passed SB 34, aimed at strengthening rural firefighting capacity — most of which relies on volunteers. The bill boosts potential grant funding and support for those departments.

Both the water and wildfire bills are now on Gov. Abbott’s desk.

Lawmakers say no to renewable energy limits – but yes to grid investment

One of the big questions this session: would Texas put the brakes on renewable energy?

Proposals like Senate Bill 715 and Senate Bill 388 sought to limit the growth of wind and solar – or at least make them more expensive to develop. Supporters argued that would help stabilize the grid. Critics warned it would only drive up costs.

In a rare alliance, environmental, business and renewable energy groups pushed back and both bills failed. Bryn Baker, senior policy director for Texas Energy Buyers Alliance, was among those leading the opposition.

“This is about cost and reliability. Full stop. And if you’re talking about making things more expensive – you’ve got a whole bunch of folks interested and concerned,” Baker said.

Instead, lawmakers approved a major expansion of the Texas Energy Fund: $5 billion more to help build new power plants and fund grid resilience projects.

Keeping chemical storage away from homes

Texas lawmakers have approved a ban on certain types of outdoor chemical storage facilities being located close to homes, a response to an Odessa-area industrial fire nearly a year ago that allegedly filled a neighborhood with “black sludge.”

State Rep. Brooks Landgraf (R-Odessa) proposed the ban after the massive fire in July 2024 at Permian Basin Containers, a facility where a mix of oil industry-related chemicals and liquids were stored in stacked piles of large plastic tubs.

People living right next door to the facility said in a resulting lawsuit that the fire flooded their neighborhood with a mysterious sludge that seeped into homes and cars. The neighbors also reported a strong, noxious odor in the wake of the fire. Landgraf also raised concerns about the potential for groundwater contamination from the incident.

Landgraf’s legislation, House Bill 3866, was sent to the governor’s desk in the final days of the state’s 2025 legislative session. It creates a ban on “intermediate bulk container recycling” facilities being located within 2,000 feet of a private residence.

(AP) — Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a rule Friday that Biden-era fuel economy standards for gas-powered cars and trucks were illegal and moved to reverse them, paving the way for a likely reset of rules.

Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation’s use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

The moves align with the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to slash federal support for EVs. President Donald Trump has pledged to end what he has called an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to former President Joe Biden’s target for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. EVs do not use gasoline or emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell — or car buyers to purchase — EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks. He included use of EVs in calculating the rules — an inclusion the Trump administration and the auto industry have argued was illegal and raised the bar too high for automakers to meet.

The Transportation Department’s memorandum Friday said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.

“We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States,” Duffy said.

The revised rule does not itself change existing standards, but it empowers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make adjustments in coming months. Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.

Under the Biden administration, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas by 2031 — up from about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles today — in an effort to save almost 70 billion gallons (265 billion liters) of gasoline through 2050.

The rules, finalized in 2024, increased fuel economy 2% per year for passenger cars in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% each year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031.

Mileage rules — in place since the 1970s energy crisis — work alongside the EPA limits on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation’s planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.

In recent years, automakers have been manufacturing gasoline-fueled cars that are more efficient and get higher mileage.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents automakers, called Duffy’s announcement “a positive development” that adds “important clarity” to federal mileage rules.

The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department’s action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

“Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,” she said. “It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.”

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the pending budget bill Thursday that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don’t meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Five years ago, two-thirds of Republicans wanted to prioritize renewable energy production.

Today, just a third of Republicans feel the same.

And 67% of Republicans want to prioritize expanded exploration and production of oil, coal and natural gas.

Republicans seem to be with President Donald Trump and that emphasizes fossil fuel production.

Trump on Day 1 of his new term, formed a and for coal plants.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” would accelerate the expiration of clean vehicle credits enacted under President Joe Biden.

And the Trump’s bill “ends Biden’s war on American energy” and “unleashes American energy dominance by opening federal lands and waters to oil, gas, coal, geothermal, and mineral leasing.""

The Pew Research Center’s new survey found that 60% of Americans still favor expanding wind and solar energy.

But that’s down from 79% support in 2020.

Democratic support for those renewable energy options is only slightly down from five years ago, 86% compared to 91% in 2020.

Republican support over the last five years has increased for offshore drilling, fracking and coal mining.

Both Republicans and Democrats are more in favor of nuclear power now than they were five years ago.

Should energy be a partisan issue?

“No, energy policy is strictly nonpartisan. It's all about cost and benefits,” University of Houston energy economist said.

But Rice University energy economist said energy tends to get politicized, even though it doesn’t need to be that way.

“In the end, however, individuals want affordability, reliability, and environmental sensibility ... to all matter,” said Medlock, calling those factors “three legs of a stool.”

Politicians will pick a leg of the stool to focus on based on their constituency, Medlock said.

But energy policy should recognize the trade-offs that exist with various energy sources.

And he said wind, solar, oil, natural gas and coal all have a role to play in giving the country a balanced and diverse portfolio.

“Policy must find a way to successfully manage that balancing act,” he said via email.

, the Political Management program director at George Washington University, said support for renewable energy has long been tied to concerns about global warming and climate change.

“If you believe the science, then it becomes imperative to take ... action,” Belt said via email. “It’s hard to admit that the world is facing disasters and not to support a remedy. Conservatives’ faith in science has been decreasing, especially since COVID.”

Belt said Biden’s legislation promoting renewable energy made the topic more salient for Republicans.

“One way to stimulate the base of one party is through disdain for what the other party promotes,” Belt said.

Medlock said geography also matters, not just political affiliation.

“When jobs are connected to activities and infrastructure, that tends to have a larger impact than political affiliation,” he said. “There is evidence that blue districts in energy rich locations also tend to have a more favorable view of oil and gas.”

Hirs said energy decisions are driven by consumers and by regulators, and one size doesn't fit all.

The electric grid that powers people's homes and businesses isn’t a national enterprise, he said.

The grid varies from state to state.

That grid can be powered by natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind and solar.

Natural gas is the leading source now.

But Hirs said he expects solar to eventually win out, because it’s the low-cost option.

Political forces aside, he said the economics always matter most.

“There's a 1.3-gigawatt solar plant going in north of Dallas on 18,000 acres,” Hirs said. “It's going to have 12 full-time employees, and I think half of those are shepherds. For the same size nuclear power station, 1.3 gigawatts, we're talking about 500 employees. And, of course, there's a cost of fuel. The coal power plants, the natural gas power plants, obviously are somewhere in between. Plus, they have a cost of fuel. Economists will tell you that the low marginal cost supply will eventually dominate. That would mean a solar farm. But without adequate batteries and supporting backup, we’re not going to get there for five to 10 years. It's going to require a significant build-out. And this is not a partisan issue. It relates really to the way we've constructed electricity markets across the United States.”

Meanwhile, Hirs said both gas-powered cars and electric cars can make sense for different people based on the costs to operate.

Electric cars cost more to buy, so a customer might have to drive for five to seven years before they start saving money on a battery-powered vehicle.

Hirs said Americans will need more power in the coming years, and they’ll want the cheapest options they can get.

“So you do what you want to do in the Senate, House of Lords, have your fun.","WASHINGTON — Thirteen House Republicans who voted for President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" sent a letter Friday urging Senate GOP leaders to scale back some of its clean energy cuts, sparking pushback from conservative hardliners.

The unusual criticism of their own bill indicates a modicum of regret by the GOP lawmakers, whose votes were critical to the bill passing the House by a narrow margin last month.

“While we were proud to have worked to ensure that the bill did not include a full repeal of the clean energy tax credits, we remain deeply concerned by several provisions,” said the Republicans in the letter, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va.

They cited provisions that “abruptly terminate several credits just 60 days after enactment for projects that have not yet begun construction,” and “restrictions to transferability.”

“This approach jeopardizes ongoing development, discourages long-term investment, and could significantly delay or cancel energy infrastructure projects across the country,” the group of House Republicans said in criticizing the legislation they voted for, while suggesting some changes to “mitigate” the harm it could cause.

Kiggans, like most of the signatories, represents a competitive district that Democrats are targeting in the 2026 election. Other politically vulnerable members include: Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.; Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz.; Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.; Don Bacon, R-Neb.; Gabe Evans, R-Colo.; Young Kim, R-Calif.; David Valadao, R-Calif.; Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa.; and Tom Kean, R-N.J.

The remaining three, who sit comparably safer seats, are Reps. Mark Amodei, R-Nev.; Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y.; and Nick LaLota, R-N.Y.

The 13 Republicans warned that “the House-passed bill includes a phase out schedule for credits that would cause significant disruption to projects under development and stop investments needed to win the global energy race.”

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee mocked the letter and said the lawmakers will own their votes for the bill.

“These 13 Republicans promised not to support cuts to clean energy tax credits, then cast the deciding votes to raise energy costs on American families, kill tens of thousands of jobs, and undermine our nation’s energy security. They are responsible for this Big, Ugly Bill and all the harm it will cause,” DCCC spokesperson Viet Shelton said. “This toothless letter is the worst kind of political hypocrisy and voters will see it for what it is, a lie perpetrated by endangered House Republicans who caved to their D.C. party bosses at the expense of the American people.”

Kiggans' office did not immediately return a request for comment on whether she was aware of the provisions when supporting the bill, or if she'd vote for one that falls short of her new demands.

Senate Republicans are eying changes to the House bill to ease some of the negative impacts of the funding cuts.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told NBC News her version of the bill will probably relax some of the deadlines to cut off funding.

But she said Thursday that there probably won’t be massive changes to the House-passed bill.

“I imagine it’s going to track fairly similarly, but I think some of the deadlines are pretty tight in terms of when you have to have construction and those things,” Capito said. “We’ve been approached by several employers who need some of those tax.”

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he’s willing to undo some of the clean energy funding, but he wants to make sure that existing business investments aren’t harmed by the bill.

“What we’re trying to focus on is to make sure that if businesses have invested and have projects in progress, that we do everything we can to hold them harmless,” he said. “Whether or not we continue some of these programs out into the future — that’s a separate question that I’m willing to entertain.”

Meanwhile, the conservative group Club For Growth is running ads targeting Sens. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., John Curtis, R-Utah, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, for backing more modest rollbacks of the clean energy funding, which carries benefits for their states.

There's another reason changing the bill is easier said than done: The speedy cuts to clean energy funding under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act were part of an House agreement to win the votes of conservative hardliners who want to reduce the bill’s red ink.

House Republicans have a majority of 220 to 212, meaning they can only spare three “no” votes in their ranks to pass the bill when the Senate sends back their revised version.

“You backslide one inch on those IRA subsidies and I’m voting against this bill,” Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said Friday on the House floor. “So you do what you want to do in the Senate, House of Lords, have your fun. But if you mess up the Inflation Reduction Act, Green New Scam subsidies, I ain’t voting for that bill.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250606-Kiggans-Roy-2-aa-339-067377.jpg",N,,2025-06-06 18:09:45.093226

Because, of course, the big, beautiful bill doesn't cut fossil subsidies,"" said Nancy Rader with the California Wind Energy Association.

Rader says new projects, like the iconic wind farm at Altamont pass in the East Bay, have already slowed to a crawl because of diminishing support at the state level She points out that the technology fills a critical gap for other sources, like solar power, that rely on battery storage during off-hours.

""And solar and batteries can go a long way towards that. But wind generation generates energy during the evening, and night periods, and so we don't we don't need the battery backup. And so, we really need a mix of wind, solar and batteries to achieve our goals, at least cost. But wind is a critical part of that picture. And if we don't have wind, it will cost consumers more to reach our goals,"" she said.

Wind, solar and battery storage plants were expected to provide 93% of the new power coming online this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But the bill could shorten the window that consumers and manufacturers have to use federal tax credits. The potential added expense sent many clean energy stocks plummeting.

Paul Dickson, president of San Francisco-based Sunrun -- the largest domestic solar panel installer in the country -- pointed to booming job growth in the solar industry and recent efforts to onshore manufacturing back to the U.S.

""A quick and swift and abrupt change doesn't give you the runway to be able to accomplish that. And so, you know, overnight you'd probably see a quarter million jobs in the in the solar industry go away,"" Dickson said.

Many observers are hoping for changes in the Senate version of the plan. But in its current form, Nuclear Energy is the only sector to have its tax credits fully preserved. Potentially shifting America's energy economy away from one of its fastest growing sectors. Some analysts believe battery storage would be among the hardest hit industries.

The public feud between Trump and his once-allied Elon Musk fueled a litany of reactions on social media. The split has also raised other questions: Where does Tesla and the electric vehicle market stand?

What happened between Elon Musk and Donald Trump?

Despite Trump's constant praise of Musk as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, Musk announced in early May that he would be stepping back from the job.

In late May, the Tesla CEO criticized the president's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" showing hints that the breakup might not have been so amicable.

The two have now engaged in a public back-and-forth, with Musk saying that President Trump did not release the Epstein files because he was mentioned in them.

While the real reason the two no longer get along has not been revealed, and may never be, there has been speculation that the president's cutting of the EV Mandate is one reason.

What is the 'EV Mandate'?

The electric vehicle ""mandate"" isn't so much of a mandate as it is a goal set by the Biden administration to ramp up the development and purchases of electric cars to phase out vehicles that use fossil fuels eventually.

One of President Trump's first moves in office was to reverse the Biden administration's decision.

Between the reversal and other incentives like up to $7,500 worth of tax credits for electric vehicle purchases being at risk, Tesla and Musk could stand to lose from further anti-EV moves.

Associated Press

DETROIT (AP) — Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a rule Friday that Biden-era fuel economy standards for gas-powered cars and trucks are illegal and moved to reverse them, paving the way for a likely reset of rules.

Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation’s use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

The moves align with the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to slash federal support for EVs. President Donald Trump has pledged to end what he has called an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to former President Joe Biden's target for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. EVs do not use gasoline or emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell — or car buyers to purchase — EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks. He included use of EVs in calculating the rules — an inclusion the Trump administration and the auto industry have argued was illegal and raised the bar too high for automakers to meet.

The Transportation Department's memorandum Friday said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.

“We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States,"" Duffy said.

The revised rule does not itself change existing standards, but it empowers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make adjustments in coming months. Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.

Under the Biden administration, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas by 2031 — up from about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles today — in an effort to save almost 70 billion gallons (265 billion liters) of gasoline through 2050.

The rules, finalized in 2024, increased fuel economy 2% per year for passenger cars in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% each year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031.

Mileage rules — in place since the 1970s energy crisis — work alongside the EPA limits on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation’s planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.

In recent years, automakers have been manufacturing gasoline-fueled cars that are more efficient and get higher mileage.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents automakers, called Duffy's announcement “a positive development"" that adds “important clarity” to federal mileage rules.

The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department's action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

“Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,” she said. “It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.”

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the pending budget bill Thursday that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don’t meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Automakers can buy regulatory credits under a trading program if they don’t meet the standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don't rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.

The memo and bill text landed this week as Tesla owner Elon Musk and Trump engage in a public spat online, with Trump suggesting that Musk “only developed a problem” with his budget bill because it rolls back tax credits for EVs. Musk disputes that.

“Monroe is twice the size of Campbell,” State Rep. Dave Prestin (R-Cedar River) told Politico’s E&E News, saying he would be “very, very upset” if the facility, slated to fully close in 2032, were torn down.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright cited an energy “emergency” in his order to keep the Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan which was set to retire May 31, open for 90 days.

Michigan regulators and environmental advocates say the move is unnecessary and that keeping an old plant operating will mean steep costs for ratepayers while generating harmful air pollution and planet-warming emissions.

A Department of Energy memorandum from May 23, the same day the Campbell order was issued, highlights the challenges of keeping the plant open.

“Past the planned retirement date of May 31, Consumers has ended its contracts for coal procurement, coal delivery, and power plant staffing and may face challenges with addressing these issues on short notice,” the memo says.

“The order provides reasonable last-minute contract extensions for fuel and operations, if feasible.”

The memo, which is labeled as privileged and controlled unclassified information, was briefly posted publicly on the DOE website and then taken down, according to the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group that advocates for clean energy and that posted the memo on its site.

Trump’s coal order creates precedent: Sierra Club organizer

Pollution from the Campbell plant causes an estimated 44 deaths per year and the facility produces over 9 million tons of carbon emissions annually, according to the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force. This represents roughly 16% of the Michigan energy sector’s total emissions.

The group found that DTE’s Monroe plant is responsible for an estimated 38 deaths annually as well as more than 16 million tons of carbon emissions, or 29% of Michigan’s energy sector emissions.

The group uses the EPA’s CO-Benefits Risk Assessment screening model to calculate its mortality estimates.

Although the final units at DTE’s Monroe plant aren’t due to suspend operations until 2028 and 2032, Byran Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer for the Sierra Club, said the Campbell plant order creates a precedent for similar actions with other facilities. He noted President Donald Trump has expressed a general desire to keep coal plants online.

For example, the Trump administration issued executive orders in April to stop the enforcement of state climate laws, repeal regulations that “discriminate” against coal production, waive pollution restrictions for coal plants, and develop a process for using emergency powers to prevent coal plant retirements.

DTE spokesperson Cynthia Hecht said the company still plans to retire Monroe’s remaining coal units in 2028 and 2032.

Michigan regulators are looking to reduce costs for Consumers ratepayers by having the Campbell plant’s operating expenses spread across the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s territory. MISO is the regional grid operator covering most of Michigan, 14 other states, and part of Canada.

Environmental groups, regulators, and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel could also intervene to reverse the Campbell decision.

Trump’s order to keep the plant open is “unprecedented” and based on a “fabricated emergency,” Nessel said at the Mackinac Policy Conference last month, The Detroit News reported.

Department of Energy spokesperson Ben Dietderich said the administration is committed to “ensuring Americans have access to reliable, affordable, and secure energy that isn’t dependent on whether the sun shines or the wind blows.”

The planned retirements of both the Campbell and Monroe facilities were the result of negotiated settlements among the utilities, environmental groups, ratepayer advocates and other organizations, overseen by the Michigan Public Service Commission.

Shannon Fisk, director of state electric sector advocacy for the environmental legal group Earthjustice, said the Trump administration is trying to override this decision-making process and turn itself into a local energy planner.

“A lot of this is just an ideological agenda to prop up coal and is disconnected from any actual reliability and resource adequacy issues.”

How Nessel, others could challenge Trump’s emergency order

The attorney general could fight the order to keep the Campbell plant open either in her role as a consumer advocate or as a representative of the state, Fisk said.

If Nessel were to petition the Department of Energy for a rehearing of the Campbell decision, Fisk said the attorney general could do so on the grounds that no energy emergency exists, or that the federal agency interfered beyond its authority. He added that Nessel could make the case that, even if there is an energy emergency, it’s “clearly arbitrary” to use an old coal plant to address it.

The attorney general’s office did not respond to Planet Detroit’s request for comment.

In contrast to the administration’s stance around an energy shortfall, MISO indicated in an April press release that “adequate resources are available to maintain reliability” for the period from June 2025-May 2026.

Dietderich, with DOE, cited the nonprofit North American Electric Reliability’s 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment as proof that more baseload power is needed. The assessment finds MISO is at “elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand.”

Fisk said other parties to the Campbell settlement could also petition the Department of Energy, including environmental organizations and the MPSC.

When asked whether the MPSC would petition the DOE, commission spokesperson Matt Helms said: “we are still reviewing options.”

MPSC Chair Dan Scripps previously told Politico’s E&E News he would work with MISO and Consumers to comply with the DOE order. He criticized the order as unnecessary and expensive.

“I think it’s a difficult case to make that there is, in fact, this local energy need that can only be met through the extension of that plant,” he told the publication.

Who will pay to keep Campbell online?

Keeping the 63-year-old Campbell power plant open could prove expensive, with the cost potentially falling on Consumers ratepayers.

Closing the plant was projected to save these customers $600 million by 2040, according to the company. Its rushed reopening means the company will now pay market prices for coal rather than securing lower prices through contracts, according to Sierra Club’s Smigielski.

Nationally, coal has declined steeply as a power generation source over the last several decades as aging coal plants have struggled to compete with cheaper natural gas and renewable energy generation.

It’s unclear whether the cost of keeping the West Michigan coal plant alive will ultimately be spread across the region.

Helms, with the MPSC, said the commission would “pursue having costs spread across MISO.”

Consumers spokesperson Brian Wheeler told Planet Detroit: “The company is actively working to determine appropriate cost recovery consistent with applicable law and the federal order.”

To capture the expense of operating the Campbell plant this summer as well as health and environmental costs, the Sierra Club’s Smigielski said the MPSC should order a cost assessment for the facility.

“What that’s going to do is show … people spent a lot of money, a lot of extra pollution was poured into the air in the water, and there was no material gain from this,” he said, arguing this information could be used to make the case against coal.

Efforts to keep coal plants open could become even more harmful if the Environmental Protection Agency is able to successfully roll back standards for power plant emissions, which EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin pitched in March, Smigielski said.

This would mean subjecting people to “the kind of horrifically bad coal from 10 (or) 15 years ago that puts us all in even worse danger.”

The order keeping the Campbell plant open is limited to 90 days. But Fisk, with Earthjustice, said the administration could renew the order when it ends or issue a different order.

“It’s a real concern that this would become a perpetual thing.”

It’s becoming a reality, and it could be here by the end of the year. Alef Aeronautics is now building pre-production models of what it’s calling “the first true flying car,” and it’s 100% electric.

Alef prepares first “true” electric flying car for launch

San Mateo-based Alef Aeronautics has been developing flying cars for about a decade, but now it’s ready to bring them to life.

The company unveiled its first prototype, the “Model A,” in October 2022, claiming that the electric flying car can travel up to 220 miles with a 110-mile flight range.

After kicking off pre-orders the same month, the Model A secured 440 reservations by the end of the year. According to the company’s latest update, the flying car has now secured over 3,400 pre-orders, valued at around $1 billion in total.

The orders include businesses and individuals, including a car dealership in California. Alef became the first company to sell a modern aircraft through a car dealership with pre-orders.

You can reserve a spot in the “regular” queue for $150, or $1,500 for the “priority” waiting list. Alef has begun pre-production at its facility in Silicon Valley and expects to start producing customer models soon.

“If everything goes according to plan, and no major external changes, Alef plans to start production of the first vehicle by the end of 2025 or Q1 of 2026,” the company said (via KTVU), with deliveries set to follow.

Alef says the Model A is the first road-legal passenger car that can also take off and land. The company even claims that “On average, the Alef flying car uses less energy per trip than a Tesla or any other EV.”

Since the Model A is classified as “ultralight,” it doesn’t require a certification to fly on roads legally, Alef told KTVU. It does have other restrictions, however, including the ability to fly only during the day and limited flying zones. Ultralight vehicles can not fly over densely populated areas.

We got a sneak peek of the electric flying car in action for the first time earlier this year. Alef released a video of the flying car hopping over another vehicle on a public street in California.

It looked fake, but Alef promises it was the “first-ever video in history of a car driving and vertically taking off.” Other flying cars have appeared in videos with tethered flights and other gimmicks to make it seem like they’re actually in flight.

The Model A starts at $300,000, but Alef says costs “should drop down drastically,” adding “eventually below levels of Toyota Corolla or Ford Focus.”

Production and manufacturing costs are initially high due to the “hand-made in-house level,” the company explained.

The startup secured a mass manufacturing agreement with PUCARA Aero and MYC for aviation-grade parts last year, which supplies industry leaders such as Boeing and Airbus.

Alef’s flying cars underwent a “major technical update” this week, with more details to follow soon. Following the Model A, Alef is already working on its second flying car, the Model Z, which is expected to be priced closer to $35,000. However, it could be a while before we see it with an expected 2035 launch.

Zeldin appeared before Congress four times in two weeks recently to field questions from both sides of the aisle about the agency’s proposed FY 2026 budget, which would cut the EPA’s funding by 55%. The proposal radically dismantles the State Revolving Fund, grants programs, Superfund cleanups and environmental justice programs, among other initiatives, all critical programs that safeguard human health and the environment.

While Zeldin touted a “Great American Comeback” in his testimonies before Congress, in reality he is driving our decline by proposing to defund the agency with no plan to maintain the essential services that it provides. The EPA impacts every American’s daily life by safeguarding air and water, responding to environmental emergencies, cleaning up contaminated sites, protecting the public from toxic chemicals and more. Cutting our agency’s funding by 55% isn’t just about cutting costs to reduce taxes, as Zeldin has touted; it puts American lives at risk.

It is notably perplexing how Zeldin can both promote cooperative federalism in his “Great American Comeback” initiative and, at the same time, propose an 89% cut for the State Revolving Fund program, which provides low-interest loans to states and local governments for critical water infrastructure projects. Cuts to the State Revolving Fund program threaten access to safe, clean water by stripping communities of funding to repair aging water infrastructure. Even during his testimony in the Senate, Zeldin’s claim that taxpayers voted for these cuts was expressly contradicted by expressions of concern from both sides of the aisle. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) rightly called the cuts “problematic” as states do not have any alternative funding source to address costly water infrastructure needs.

Zeldin also testified that he personally reviewed each of the 781 active, obligated EPA grant agreements that have now been canceled or are slated for termination as part of his effort to cut agency funding. These are grants, both big and small, that support counties, cities, states and local community groups.

Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) asked Zeldin about one particular grant for Georgia constituents that is part of the EPA’s Environment and Climate Justice block grant program. This grant would have provided a health clinic alongside upgrades to Thomasville, Georgia’s wastewater infrastructure. In response, Zeldin only suggested that when a new administration comes in, “it is going to apply its policy priorities to how that money is going to get spent.” Given that Zeldin personally reviewed all of the cancelled grants for supposedly problematic content, Sen. Ossoff, along with all Americans, deserves adequate explanations for why programs reviewed and approved by the agency suddenly require termination.

Eliminating grants in wholesale fashion is a danger to public health; it cuts support for local programs that monitor air and water quality, clean up pollution, and protect vulnerable communities. While it seems more likely that an AI-powered purity test searching for words such as “diversity,” “women” and “climate” flagged the agreements for termination, Americans must demand that Zeldin follow through on his promise to Congress to re-review the cancelled grants.

In his testimonies, Zeldin also championed expediting the chemical approval process at the EPA to allow private companies to profit from novel chemicals, undermining the agency’s duty to protect public health and directly contradicting the Trump administration’s own commission to “Make America Healthy Again.” This deregulatory push, paired with a 55% cut to the EPA’s budget, would severely limit the agency’s ability to research, monitor and regulate harmful substances like PFAS: “forever chemicals” now found worldwide and in 98% of human blood. Linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease and reproductive issues, PFAS represent a chemical crisis demanding more scientific scrutiny and enforcement, not less. As Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) warned, Zeldin’s legacy could well be one of increased cancer rates across America if this agenda continues unchecked.

Zeldin’s proposed budget would weaken the EPA and drastically reduce support for state and community programs. Taxpayers will ultimately foot the bill for such radical departures from scientifically backed environmental policies. Americans won’t only pay higher taxes and insurance premiums, but also live with elevated rates of disease and mortality.

Zeldin’s Great American Comeback will feature a return to rivers on fire, air thick with smog, and an America where many more of our citizens died from environmental harm. The reality is we cannot do more with less. Zeldin must back down from this drastic proposed cut to our agency’s budget and live up to his oath to protect human health and the environment.

While AESC didn’t specify what those problems are, South Carolina’s Republican governor said the company is dealing with the potential loss of federal tax breaks for electric vehicle buyers and incentives for EV businesses as well as tariff uncertainties from President Donald Trump’s administration.

“What we’re doing is urging caution — let things play out because all of the these changes are taking place,” Gov. Henry McMaster said.

AESC announced the suspension in construction of its plant in Florence on Thursday,

“Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” the company’s statement said.

AESC promised to restart construction, although it didn’t say when, and vowed to meet its commitment to hire 1,600 workers and invest $1.6 billion. The company said it has already invested $1 billion in the Florence plant.

The battery maker based in Japan also has facilities in China, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. In the U.S., AESC has a plant in Tennessee and is building one in Kentucky. The statement didn’t mention any changes with other plants.

The South Carolina plant is supposed to sell battery cells to BMW, which is building its own battery assembly site near its giant auto plant in Greer. BMW said the construction pause by AESC doesn’t change its plans to open its plant in 2026.

AESC has already rolled back its South Carolina plans. They announced a second factory on the Florence site, but then said earlier this year that their first plant should be able to handle BMW’s demand. That prompted South Carolina officials to withdraw $111 million in help they planned to provide.

The company is still getting $135 million in grants from the South Carolina Department of Commerce and $121 million in bonds and the agency said a construction pause won’t prompt them to claw back that offer.

South Carolina is investing heavily in electric vehicles. Volkswagen-owned Scout Motors plans to invest more than $4 billion and hire 10,000 people for a plant to build its new electric SUVs scheduled to open in 2027.

The state has for decades made big bets on foreign manufacturers like BMW, Michelin and Samsung that have paid off with an economic boom this century, but there is uneasiness that Trump’s flirtation with high tariffs might stagger or even ruin those important partnerships.

McMaster told people to relax as state and business leaders are talking to Trump’s administration and things will work out.

“I think the goal of the president and the administration is to have robust economic growth and prosperity and there is no doubt there has to be changes made in our international trade posture and President Trump is addressing that,” McMaster told reporters Thursday.",https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/favicon-needle.png,N,,2025-06-06 18:12:15.518557

For years, Michigan Democrats have introduced “polluter pay” legislation seeking to alter the current regulations on polluter responsibilities, which lawmakers and environmentalists argue have left taxpayers holding the bag.

Michigan is home to tens of thousands of contaminated sites, many of which are “orphan sites” where the responsible party is either no longer in business, or cannot be identified.

Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), a longtime advocate for polluter pay policies, said in a statement that the bills would put liability where it belongs: with the polluters.

“It’s shocking that Michigan law doesn’t require polluters to actually clean up their mess or even report all spills,” Irwin said, noting the reintroduced package of bills aims to ensure more thorough cleanups and comprehensive spill reporting.

During the previous legislative session, Irwin, alongside Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), led the introduction of renewed polluter pay bills intended to give state regulators more tools to enforce environmental cleanups.

After the introduction of the renewed package in October 2023, the bills were subject to workgrouping with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and various industry stakeholders.

Although several of the bills in the previous package passed through the Democratic-led Michigan Senate, the efforts never came to a vote in the House, as partisan bickering and party infighting left the House’s previous Democratic leadership unable to hold session at the end of their term.

With Republicans now in control of the chamber, the reintroduced polluter pay policies will likely face an uphill battle in the House, though Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) told the Michigan Advance that it would be great to see the policies move forward in some form.

According to a statement from Irwin’s office, several of the renewed polluter pay bills have already been introduced in the Michigan House, with the rest set to be introduced next week. Additionally, Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), who chairs the Senate Energy and Environment Committee, said he intends to hold a hearing on the bills next week.

Proposals in the 2025 polluter pay bills include:

Stricter pollution reporting and cleanups requirements;

Creating an avenue for EGLE to update cleanup criteria as researchers learn more about contaminants while prioritizing the removal of contamination over implementing use restrictions;

Allowing individuals exposed to hazardous substances to sue polluters for the cost of medical monitoring;

Allowing the state to hold polluters accountable for cleanup costs and damages to the environment from contaminants not regulated before 1994, such as PFAS;

And extending the statute of limitations for individuals harmed by pollution by beginning the timeline when the pollution is discovered, in line with the federal “discovery rule.”

Democrats were unable to advance the policies while they held control of both Legislative chambers, but Nick Occhipinti, state government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, said the policies are still viable, even in a split-power Legislature.

“You do any polling on asking Michiganders if polluters should pay to have both legacy and existing sites cleaned up to protect public health, to redevelop those sites and return them to the community, return them to prosperity, they are overwhelmingly in support,” Occhipinti said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1514-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 18:11:57.104290

The LMR combo will form the cathode, one of two electrodes in a battery cell. Ions move between them through an electrolyte. Experts for most automakers and in other labs are experimenting with a variety of materials, including odd ones such as cow hair and potassium, to find a cheaper, better-performing component list.

Current GM truck and SUV packs use nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminum oxide chemistry. Others in the sector are moving forward with lithium-iron phosphate, or LFP, packs. That’s in addition to common lithium-ion ones. But GM thinks LMRs can outperform the other types in development.

“With LMR we can make EVs more affordable,” Narayanaswamy wrote. Silverado EVs cost between $55,000 and just over $91,000, for reference, according to Kelley Blue Book. The Chevy Equinox EV starts at $33,600.

Part of the breakthrough is using a rectangular “prismatic” cell design instead of a common pouch configuration.

“Prismatic cells reduce both the number of required parts and the percentage of non-active materials. More specifically, prismatic cells reduce battery module components by 75% and total pack components by 50%,” Narayanaswamy wrote.

EVs prevent thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution compared to gas-burning cars, even in regions where fossil fuels provide most of the electricity to charge them, according to Department of Energy data. Tailpipe exhaust is linked by government experts to a variety of health risks, including cancer, making the pollution reduction vital. Switching can also save you $1,500 a year in gas and maintenance costs.

When combined with a rooftop solar system, you can even provide the juice to charge the ride free from the sun, helping your bankroll and preventing even more pollution. EnergySage is a vetted resource that can help you find the right incentives and installers, and both EVs and solar panels are still eligible for robust tax breaks.

GM is also part of an alliance of eight well-known brands that plan to add 30,000 fast-charging stations around the country during the next half decade. The infrastructure will be needed to meet a growing market. Nearly 300,000 EVs were sold in the United States during the first quarter, an 11.4% jump from the same time last year, according to Cox Automotive.

Narayanaswamy said that GM already offers the longest-range truck with the Chevrolet Silverado EV Work Truck with max range. It has a government-rated 492-mile ability on a full charge.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-GM-logo-2021-300x300-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 18:12:20.651912

The House version of the “big, beautiful bill” would make drastic changes to tax cuts for low-carbon energy sources passed in the Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Climate-friendly energy projects, including wind and solar, would only be able to qualify for the credits under the House bill if they begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

This brief window would likely make many projects ineligible for the credits, and it is expected to significantly hamstring the development of new renewable power.

In a post Friday on social media, the Freedom Caucus warned the Senate against loosening that restriction or others included in the bill.

“We want to be crystal clear: if the Senate attempts to water down, strip out, or walk back the hard-fought spending reductions and IRA Green New Scam rollbacks achieved in this legislation, we will not accept it,” said the post, which was attributed to the Freedom Caucus’s board.

“The House Freedom Caucus Board will stand united holding the line. The American people didn’t send us here to cave to the swamp — they sent us here to change it,” it added.

The Senate has been widely expected to consider changes that could slow the rapid elimination of the tax credit passed under the House version of President Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”

Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Jerry Moran (Kan.) and John Curtis (Utah) released a letter warning against a “full scale” repeal of the tax credits. Senate Republicans can only afford three defections and pass their bill.

On Friday, a group of 13 House GOP moderates released a letter calling on Senate leadership “to substantively and strategically improve clean energy tax credit provisions” in the legislation.

“We believe the Senate now has a critical opportunity to restore common sense and deliver a truly pro-energy growth final bill that protects taxpayers while also unleashing the potential of U.S. energy producers, manufacturers, and workers,” the group said in the letter, which was led by Reps. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.).

Altogether, the letters illustrate what could be a tough task ahead for Republican leaders as they look to find a measure that will keep at least 50 senators on board and appease the House.

Car buyers took the bait when Colorado dangled tax credits of $5,000 on top of federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. Sales took off. EVs alone constituted 24.7% .of all new car sales in the final months of 2025. T

Even in early 2025, when Colorado’s tax incentives ramped down to $3,500, EVs were still responsible for about 21.1% of all sales.

What if federal tax credits go away as proposed in the budget reconciliation bill now before the U.S. Senate?

Repeat, (Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit), a project housed within the University of Princeton, predicts 40% fewer sales nationally by 2024. Sales will still increase, just not as fast.

Travis Madsen, who oversees the transportation program for the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, an advocacy group, said EV sales will continue to grow in Colorado. EVs save people money in lesser fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a car.

Research by the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project found that drivers in Colorado and other Southwestern states can save on the order of $10,000 over 200,000 miles by choosing an electric sedan. For battery-electric pickups, the savings can exceed $30,000.

The front-end costs can be discouraging, though.

“We will have to develop new tools to help people understand that they can save money,” said Madsen. “We will still be making progress. It just won’t be as fast.”

Will Toor, who directs the Colorado Energy Office, described the bill’s effects more broadly if the Senate were to go along with what the House passed.

“They would be, I think, ceding the future of auto manufacturing to China and essentially knee-capping American auto manufacturers from their ability to compete into the future,” he said.

“We’d started to see a bit of manufacturing renaissance in this county for clean energy supported by the Inflation Reduction Act. If this moves forward, I think it will be really negative for that clean energy manufacturing across the nation.”

The net effect of the sweeping 1,000-page bill would be to “drive up the cost of electricity, drive up the cost of vehicles and essentially drive up the costs of all the things that Coloradans depend on in their daily lives,” he added.

New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, a frequent visitor to Colorado over the years, made the same point several days later. In a column, “Trump’s Gilded Gut Instinct,” he wrote this:

“As I have been arguing since Trump came to office, his ridiculous right-wing woke obsession with destroying the U.S. electric vehicle industry that President Joe Biden was trying to build up undermines U.S. efforts to compete with China in electric batteries. Batteries are the new oil; they will power the new industrial ecosystem of A.I.-infused self-driving cars, robots, drones and clean tech.”

Friedman then introduced the thoughts of an economist, Noah Smith, who observed the consequences of the new budget bill in light of last weekend’s attack of Russian’s airplanes by Ukrainian drones. The essay is extended but entirely germane to U.S. defense but also EV adoption in Colorado.

Smith’s posting on Tuesday included this:

“Electric vehicles are crucial for battery manufacturing capacity, because in peacetime, they’re the main source of demand for batteries. Pump up the EV industry, and you pump up the battery industry too — just as the chart above shows Biden doing. Kill the EV industry and you kill the battery industry too, just as Republicans now want to do. Harming the solar industry will also harm the battery industry, because some types of batteries are used to store solar energy for when the sun isn’t shining.”

As for Colorado’s goal of having 940,000 EVs on its roads by 2030, it remains on track to get there. The incentives have jump-started sales. Another component was to ensure sufficient charging infrastructure exists.

This has several components.

To assuage worries about running out of fuel without a way to quickly charge when traveling, Colorado set out to get high-speed charging stations around the state. Some of this has been done with federal aid.

Gaps remain in Colorado, though. Most every wide spot in the road has a gas station. Fast charging EV stations are not so omnipresent. Colorado has worked to provide that reliability.

Colorado has been helped by but has not been solely dependent upon federal aid to seed the charging stations needed to make drivers comfortable when considering purchase of an EV. The state has investment programs, and utilities have invested, too.

“Unlike many other states, we haven’t been dependent just on federal investment,” said Toor.

The federal government has cut off funds for continued fast-charging through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Fund. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser joined with California and other states in a lawsuit that seeks to force the Trump administration to thaw those funds.

“They are important, and we’ve been relying on them and we need to get access to them,” said Toor. “But there’s a lot of EV charging that’s been deployed and will continue to be deployed in the state.”

EV adoption in Colorado also depends upon having ample fast-charging stations in other states, too, said Toor. Coloradans don’t always stay in Colorado, so they want assurances of being able to charge when driving across the vast expanses of Wyoming and Montana, too.

Another difference is that you can fill up a car with gas before you finish washing your windows. With an EV it can take 10 or 20 minutes. Best to find a charger coupled with a coffee shop and plan your trips accordingly. You can get charged up with caffeine while your car gets charged with electricity.

In May, after the Legislature convened, Toor, who directs the Colorado Energy Office, set out from the Front Range in his Chevy Blazer EV for a backpacking trip in Canyonlands National Park. It worked well, he reported. The car has a listed range of 285 miles. He reports that in temperate weather, he can get 330 miles. “And I’m sort of the opposite of a lead-footed driver,” he explained.

The first stop was a fast-charging station coupled with a coffee shop in Fruita. In Utah, at Monticello, they had a similar pre-scheduled stop.

“We stopped a few times in nice places,” said Toor. “The only problem was I drank too much coffee. Couldn’t sleep that night.”",https://coyotegulch.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-06-at-6.26.38 AM.png,N,,2025-06-06 19:07:52.679321

Many of these credits were extended via the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which put them under attack from Republican lawmakers opposed to the green policies. Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands.

Nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s total electricity generation comes from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which also reports Iowa is one of the top states for solar and wind energy generation. Since 2019, Iowa has generated more electricity via wind than from coal and continues to grow its solar production.

Kristina Costa, who formerly worked at the White House implementing the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy and climate policies, said the IRA established at least 10 years of tax credits to support clean energy industries, which launched new projects and expanded the industry.

“The House bill that the Republicans passed explodes that entire paradigm,” Costa said. “It functions as a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act.”

Costa, during a Thursday press conference with Climate Power, said the bill “really radically” changes how clean electricity developers can plan and develop their projects, by eliminating the ability to “lock in” a tax treatment at the start of construction.

“This is going to create a lot of uncertainty for project developers,” Costa said. “It’s going to raise financing costs for project developers pretty considerably … but it also just means that fewer projects will end up qualifying for the credits.”

How the bill impacts clean energy projects

Clean energy tax credits impact transportation, power generation, industry and construction and create incentives for projects like renewable vehicle fuels, solar, wind, nuclear power generation and more.

Per the reconciliation bill text as it passed the House May 22, the bill would terminate clean vehicle credits, residential energy efficiency credits, hydrogen fuel credits and place restrictions on credits for clean electricity production, zero-emission nuclear energy production and other sectors.

Some of the restrictions include strict construction timeline requirements, like beginning construction within 60 days of enactment, and bringing the projects online by 2028.

Costa said these timelines create an “incredibly sharp cliff” for developers to work within for projects that often take years and can face lengthy setbacks from supply chain disruptions.

The budget bill also has extensive language pertaining to and restricting projects that have any ties to foreign entities.

Costa said these restrictions are “very complicated, unworkable, Byzantine requirements” that impose “a lot of red tape” for developers and would have the “immediate effect of freezing the market.”

She said it would require companies to understand where “literally every nut, bolt, screw and wire in a project they are building comes from” and certify that it does not have any ties to China or to Russia.

Costa said gutting these policies will lead to increased energy costs for American customers. A study from Clean Energy Buyers Association analyzed the impact of removing just two clean energy tax credit programs, and found it would cause an average increase of 7% for residential electricity costs.

Part of the problem is an anticipated 2% energy demand increase nationwide, in 2025 and again in 2026, according to the EIA. Much of that energy demand is a result of battery manufacturing and data centers.

Iowa alone has roughly 100 data centers, which is one of the largest concentrations in the midwest.

“The near term additions to the grid are going to come from renewables, or they’re supposed to come from renewables under the current tax regime,” Costa said. “That is why you would see these consumer electricity price increases.”

A spokesperson for Alliant Energy, one of Iowa’s utility companies with significant investments in solar and wind energy, said the company is monitoring the bill.

A spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy declined to comment on the pending legislation.

Earlier this year, NextEra Energy proposed restarting its Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant near Palo. A representative from the company did not answer questions about the impact the Republican-sponsored bill would have on the Iowa project.

A study from The Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits in Iowa alone would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa, if left intact through 2032.

Repeal of the credits would also affect associated manufacturing companies, like those that make solar panel parts, or wind turbine blades.

Analysis from Climate Power found 400,000 jobs nationwide would be in jeopardy without the tax credits supporting the expanding industry.

Joe Zimsen, an Iowa resident with 10 years of construction experience in the wind industry, said the IRA created a “tremendous amount of hope” among his colleagues in the industry that has now “disintegrated” because of budget bill.

Zimsen formerly worked on wind projects near Grinnell, but now works for Renew Energy as a construction manager for off-shore wind projects. He and his family still live in Iowa, and he urged Iowa senators to oppose the bill as it is currently written.

“This policy of killing offshore and onshore wind and solar energy is going to have tremendous detrimental effects and set us back another 10 to 15 years behind our competitors, like China and Europe,” Zimsen said. “We can’t afford to do that.”

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday that wind energy incentives have been at risk since 2015 when he worked to extend them, and he said he senators would try to find a “compromise” on them again, Radio Iowa reported.

But, the so-called, “big beautiful bill” comprises much more than just clean energy concerns, which Grassley said means one issue can’t “stand in the way” of the rest of the bill.

While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.","WASHINGTON — Clean energy manufacturers and advocates say they’re perplexed how the repeal of tax credits in President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” will keep their domestic production lines humming across the United States, particularly in states that elected him to the Oval Office.

While some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a “green new scam,” statistics reviewed by State Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump’s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.

Trump vowed in early April to “supercharge our domestic industrial base.”

“Jobs and factories will come roaring back to our country, and you see it happening already,” he told a crowd in the White House Rose Garden while unveiling his new trade policy.

But as a way to pay for the $3.9 trillion price tag of extending and expanding the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts, U.S. House Republicans found billions of dollars in savings by slashing over a dozen clean energy tax credits enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.

Critics say the mega-bill, which passed the GOP-led House on May 22 in a 215-214 vote, would effectively strip away the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit and other incentives.

They have bolstered the production of batteries and solar components in numerous states — top among them North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, Illinois and Oklahoma, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.

U.S. senators are now negotiating the massive budget reconciliation legislation.

Kevin Doffling, CEO and founder of Project Vanguard, an organization that connects veterans to clean energy jobs, warned pulling the plug on the clean energy tax credits will stifle progress the U.S. has made against other countries, namely China.

“We're just going to see a huge pullback from investments inside of advanced manufacturing here in the U.S., and then we'll go source it from other places, instead of doing it here,” Doffling said on a May 28 press call pressing for senators to protect the tax credits.

Doffling’s organization works in several states, including Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Washington and Utah.

Moving away from fossil fuels

The suite of tax credits enacted under the IRA incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of a reduction in the effects of climate change.

For example, the IRA’s Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit is awarded per unit produced and sold, and in some cases the capacity of energy output.

Battery cell manufacturers can earn up to $35 per battery cell multiplied by potential kilowatt hours. In the case of solar, the credit offers producers 7 cents per solar module multiplied by wattage output. For mining operations extracting critical minerals, such as lithium, companies can receive a 10% tax break on the costs of production.

Most credits phase out by 2032 under the Biden-era law, except those for critical mineral mining, which continue.

A group of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam” — echoing Trump’s rhetoric — pushed to accelerate the expiration in the final version of the mega-bill, even for critical mineral mining and production. The federal government classifies critical minerals as crucial to national security.

The House-passed bill also severely tightens language around foreign components, titled “foreign entities of concern,” making the credit practically unusable as many parts of the clean energy manufacturing supply chain are global, industry professionals say.

The legislation also repeals “transferability,” which allows companies with little or no tax liability to sell the credits.

For example, a critical mineral mining company would not turn a profit during an initial phase and could sell the credits to offset the cost of operations.

Schneider Electric, a global corporation with a U.S. base in Massachusetts, has facilitated 18 transfer deals worth $1.7 billion in tax credits for U.S. companies since 2023. In a statement, Schneider said the deals “reflect growing market interest in flexible financing mechanisms that directly fund renewable projects.”

Silfab Solar, which recently built a solar cell manufacturing and module assembly plant in Fort Mill, South Carolina, announced in mid-May the sale of $110 million in Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credits to help fund its expansion. The company already runs a solar manufacturing site in Burlington, Washington.

Investment soared

Spurred by the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit, known as 45X, actual investment in clean energy manufacturing since August 2022 reached $115 billion in April, up from $21 billion over the same length of time prior to the IRA, the Clean Investment Monitor found.

Of the 380 clean technology production facilities announced since the third quarter of 2022, 161 are now operational, according to CIM data.

The credit spurred a “sea change” in U.S. clean energy manufacturing, said Mike Williams, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress and former deputy director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which advocates for the joining of labor and environmental organizations.

Despite solar technology’s roots in the U.S., the nation “didn’t even have a toe” in solar manufacturing, Williams said. Other countries, most notably Germany and then China, have dominated the industry.

“But after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, all of a sudden we see panel manufacturing, we see parts and components manufacturing, absolutely exploding. Plants have announced and started construction in Georgia, in Oklahoma,” Williams said in an interview with States Newsroom.

Active manufacturing of solar components, advanced batteries and wind turbines and vessels is concentrated in rural areas. Most are located in states that went red in the 2024 presidential election, according to the Clean Power America Association’s May 2025 State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report.

The renewable energy policy group estimated the industry supports 122,000 full-time manufacturing jobs across the U.S.

Active solar manufacturing sites and expansions are clustered in Texas, Ohio and Alabama, according to data from the association. Should major project announcements in Georgia pull through, the state would surpass Alabama for third place.

Advanced battery manufacturing spans 38 states, with the largest concentrations in California, Michigan and North Carolina.

But various parts of the battery production process stretch throughout the country — for example, battery cell production in Nevada and Tennessee and module production in Utah. Other supporting hardware is made in South Carolina, Arizona and Texas.

Lithium, a critical mineral for battery production, is currently mined in Nevada and California. And investors are eyeing other spots in the U.S., namely Alaska, to mine and produce graphite, another critical mineral.

China largely dominates the world’s critical mineral supply chain, according to U.S. Geological Survey data for 2024.

When accounting for the full suite of clean energy tax credits that were enacted in 2022 — including residential, electric vehicles and clean electricity credits — just over 312,900 new jobs are linked to the industry, the bulk in Republican-led congressional districts, according to the advocacy group Climate Power’s 2024 report on clean energy employment.

Troy Van Beek, CEO and founder of the Iowa-based solar company Ideal Energy, said his business weathered the pandemic and has been able to add jobs, but is now facing uncertainty again.

“​​We're getting our feet under us and really starting to operate. I went from 20-some jobs to over 60 jobs, and those are good-paying jobs for people and their families. So we need that stability in the industry,” said Van Beek, who spoke on the call with Doffling.

“What troubles me is the rocking of the boat to such a degree that we can't get anything done, and that's been very difficult to deal with,” he said.

Industry slowdown

The industry has seen a pullback since January and the beginning of the Trump presidency.

Six announced projects representing $6.9 billion in investment were canceled in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Clean Investment Monitor’s latest State of U.S. Clean Energy Supply Chains report. While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.

Van Beek, whose solar company provides construction and installation among others services, said recent talks to strike a deal with a solar manufacturer collapsed after threats to the tax credits.

“We had worked an entire year on putting together (a deal) with one of the leading manufacturers in the world that has U.S. manufacturing to actually have joint ventures and work with them on projects,” Van Beek said. “And when this came up, that deal came to a screeching halt.”

Van Beek did not name the company on the call and did not respond to a request for a follow-up interview.

Several companies declined States Newsroom’s requests for comment while senators negotiate the bill.

Spencer Pederson of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association said the unpredictability is interrupting how operators are planning for the coming years.

“Whether large or small, just the business certainty and the ability to plan out your business is disrupted when you have any type of tax mechanism that is abruptly halted when you're doing business planning at five- or 10-year intervals,” said Pederson, the association’s senior vice president of public affairs.

Too expensive, Republicans say

Some House Republicans, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, urged party colleagues to protect the clean energy tax credits — for example by removing the “overly prescriptive” restrictions on foreign entities of concern and keeping in place transferability of tax credits.

Kiggans wrote to House Republican tax writers in mid-May that “the last thing any of us want is to provoke an energy crisis or cause higher energy bills for working families.”

Her co-signers included Don Bacon of Nebraska, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, Dave Joyce of Ohio and Dan Newhouse of Washington, who all eventually voted for the final bill.

Far-right House members won on not only shortening the lifespan of the credits, but also on keeping the restrictive foreign entity language and on repealing a company’s ability to transfer credits.

The right-leaning National Taxpayers Union hailed the “commonsense changes” championed by the far-right House Freedom Caucus, under the leadership of Maryland Rep. Andy Harris.

The organization, which favors cutting government spending and lowering taxes, pointed to the cost. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the credits as of 2022 were valued at roughly $384.9 billion over ten years.

“The longer these subsidies remain in law, the more expensive they will become and the harder it will be for Congress to remove them. Now it’s up to the Senate to support the Green New Deal Rollbacks,” Thomas Aiello, NTU’s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the days following the House vote.

Hope in the Senate?

But representatives from multinational corporations to mid-size businesses and sizable trade associations are now looking to the U.S. Senate to restore measures that they say created a boom time for investment, production and new energy on the grid.

Jeannie Salo, chief public policy officer at Schneider Electric, said in a statement to States Newsroom that “The Senate should restore and extend the timelines for key energy and manufacturing credits and their transferability to ensure the nation continues to attract key investments and projects that will power the U.S. economy and help make energy more affordable.”

Pederson said the restrictions on foreign components and company ties are “particularly restrictive coming out of the House.”

“So we're hoping to work with the Senate Finance Committee and some of the members of the Senate who have indicated some willingness to make the foreign entity of concern language a little bit more workable,” Pederson said.

Doffling believes senators have a “longer term vision” of the nation’s energy strategy than House members who face reelection every two years.

“They see what's happening not just in their district, but in the entire state that they represent,” Doffling said.

The House bill just sets the U.S. “further behind,” he added. “This bill is all about going backwards in time and hoping for the best.”

“I wish they could look at the numbers and understand the economic impacts it's gonna have. … But somehow we're talking about the fact of hamstringing a whole entire industry itself over verbiage of the word ‘clean.’”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2025-06/solarpanelworker2025.jpg?h=8c1344d8&itok=N7WYdfUN,N,,2025-06-06 17:13:43.474150

Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands.
A study from Clean Energy Buyers Association analyzed the impact of removing just two clean energy tax credit programs, and found it would cause an average increase of 7% for residential electricity costs.

Many of these credits were extended via the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which put them under attack from Republican lawmakers opposed to the green policies. Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands.

Nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s total electricity generation comes from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which also reports Iowa is one of the top states for solar and wind energy generation. Since 2019, Iowa has generated more electricity via wind than from coal and continues to grow its solar production.

Kristina Costa, who formerly worked at the White House implementing the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy and climate policies, said the IRA established at least 10 years of tax credits to support clean energy industries, which launched new projects and expanded the industry.

“The House bill that the Republicans passed explodes that entire paradigm,” Costa said. “It functions as a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act.”

Costa, during a Thursday press conference with Climate Power, said the bill “really radically” changes how clean electricity developers can plan and develop their projects, by eliminating the ability to “lock in” a tax treatment at the start of construction.

“This is going to create a lot of uncertainty for project developers,” Costa said. “It’s going to raise financing costs for project developers pretty considerably … but it also just means that fewer projects will end up qualifying for the credits.”

How the bill impacts clean energy projects

Clean energy tax credits impact transportation, power generation, industry and construction and create incentives for projects like renewable vehicle fuels, solar, wind, nuclear power generation and more.

Per the reconciliation bill text as it passed the House May 22, the bill would terminate clean vehicle credits, residential energy efficiency credits, hydrogen fuel credits and place restrictions on credits for clean electricity production, zero-emission nuclear energy production and other sectors.

Some of the restrictions include strict construction timeline requirements, like beginning construction within 60 days of enactment, and bringing the projects online by 2028.

Costa said these timelines create an “incredibly sharp cliff” for developers to work within for projects that often take years and can face lengthy setbacks from supply chain disruptions.

The budget bill also has extensive language pertaining to and restricting projects that have any ties to foreign entities.

Costa said these restrictions are “very complicated, unworkable, Byzantine requirements” that impose “a lot of red tape” for developers and would have the “immediate effect of freezing the market.”

She said it would require companies to understand where “literally every nut, bolt, screw and wire in a project they are building comes from” and certify that it does not have any ties to China or to Russia.

Costa said gutting these policies will lead to increased energy costs for American customers. A study from Clean Energy Buyers Association analyzed the impact of removing just two clean energy tax credit programs, and found it would cause an average increase of 7% for residential electricity costs.

Part of the problem is an anticipated 2% energy demand increase nationwide, in 2025 and again in 2026, according to the EIA. Much of that energy demand is a result of battery manufacturing and data centers.

Iowa alone has roughly 100 data centers, which is one of the largest concentrations in the midwest.

“The near term additions to the grid are going to come from renewables, or they’re supposed to come from renewables under the current tax regime,” Costa said. “That is why you would see these consumer electricity price increases.”

A spokesperson for Alliant Energy, one of Iowa’s utility companies with significant investments in solar and wind energy, said the company is monitoring the bill.

A spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy declined to comment on the pending legislation.

Earlier this year, NextEra Energy proposed restarting its Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant near Palo. A representative from the company did not answer questions about the impact the Republican-sponsored bill would have on the Iowa project.

A study from The Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits in Iowa alone would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa, if left intact through 2032.

Repeal of the credits would also affect associated manufacturing companies, like those that make solar panel parts, or wind turbine blades.

Analysis from Climate Power found 400,000 jobs nationwide would be in jeopardy without the tax credits supporting the expanding industry.

Joe Zimsen, an Iowa resident with 10 years of construction experience in the wind industry, said the IRA created a “tremendous amount of hope” among his colleagues in the industry that has now “disintegrated” because of budget bill.

Zimsen formerly worked on wind projects near Grinnell, but now works for Renew Energy as a construction manager for off-shore wind projects. He and his family still live in Iowa, and he urged Iowa senators to oppose the bill as it is currently written.

“This policy of killing offshore and onshore wind and solar energy is going to have tremendous detrimental effects and set us back another 10 to 15 years behind our competitors, like China and Europe,” Zimsen said. “We can’t afford to do that.”

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday that wind energy incentives have been at risk since 2015 when he worked to extend them, and he said he senators would try to find a “compromise” on them again, Radio Iowa reported.

But, the so-called, “big beautiful bill” comprises much more than just clean energy concerns, which Grassley said means one issue can’t “stand in the way” of the rest of the bill.

But now, Congress is threatening to roll back the very policies that have made that progress possible.

The Trump Administration has a stated goal of American Energy Dominance, but the House Reconciliation Bill’s severe cuts to the energy tax credits threatens to bring energy chaos instead.

The bill passed by the House will decimate the energy manufacturing boom, increase electricity costs for families and businesses and put the nation at risk of energy shortages as we try to keep up with rapidly growing energy demand. Senator Capito and Senator Justice should not let that happen and instead support common-sense approaches to the commercial and residential energy tax credits that are benefitting West Virginians.

In West Virginia, lower-income household energy burdens are among the highest in the country and many are struggling to afford increasing utility bills. According to the Clean Energy Buyers Association, the House Reconciliation Bill will increase electricity prices over the next decade. The electric utilities trade association, the Edison Electric Institute, has also stated that maintaining the energy tax credits will help lower utility bills by $45 billion through 2032.

As scary as those cost increases are, it may be far worse for West Virginia because those don’t account for the “dramatic increases in future energy demand” forecast by PJM, the region’s wholesale electricity market, due to data center development, new manufacturing and increasing use of electricity in transportation. That rising demand coupled with slower deployment of cost-effective new energy resources, which includes solar and energy storage, will increase utility rates across the region. It is simple supply and demand — if we don’t bring on enough energy resources then costs will go up and that will be a drag on West Virginia’s economy.

Solar Holler and PosiGen are utilizing the 48E and 25D energy credits to reduce energy costs for families across West Virginia. For example, Mary West, who lives just outside of Charleston, was able to install solar on her home through a lease structure that required no credit check, income requirement and will provide immediate savings on her bills. Removing the option for families to lease, which the House bill does, will simply put energy savings out of reach for those who need it the most. Mary’s story is powerful, but not unique. It represents thousands of households across West Virginia looking for stability in an unpredictable energy market.

We are also proud of the growth in American energy manufacturing across the country, including West Virginia, due to the energy tax credits. We use domestically-manufactured equipment in every installation and we continue to see more and more of the solar supply chain come to the US because of the policies that are in place to support onshoring. This is critical not just for the economic benefits, but also for our national security.

Our residential solar projects create demand for domestically-produced solar panels, inverters and racking, including from Georgia, Texas, Florida, South Carolina, Washington, New Mexico, Ohio and Arizona, which has led to the several hundred solar manufacturing facilities that are under development or are operating today. A sudden reversal of long-term energy policies will create a policy whiplash that puts those manufacturing facilities and jobs at risk.

Businesses are investing in projects and factories across the country, many of which would be negatively impacted by the near immediate elimination of the energy tax credits. Congress should not punish businesses by pulling the rug on those investments. The economic impact is real and being felt in West Virginia with each family that we serve.

At a time when we need all energy sources to meet rising energy demand and to keep energy affordable, our Senators should take a holistic approach to Energy Dominance that includes a reasonable approach to the 25D and 48E credits that directly benefit West Virginians.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-holler.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 17:13:53.528138

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Transportation Department paved the way for looser U.S fuel economy standards on Friday by declaring that former President Joe Biden's administration exceeded its authority by assuming high uptake of electric vehicles in calculating rules.

The department made the declaration as it published a final ""Resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program"" (CAFE) rule. A future separate rule from the administration of President Donald Trump will revise the fuel economy requirements.

""We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States. The previous administration illegally used CAFE standards as an electric vehicle mandate,"" said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement.

The department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in writing its rule last year under Biden, had ""assumed significant numbers of EVs would continue to be produced regardless of the standards set by the agency, in turn increasing the level of standards that could be considered maximum feasible,"" it said Friday.

Duffy in January signed an order directing NHTSA to rescind fuel economy standards issued under Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

Late Thursday, Senate Republicans led by Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz proposed eliminating fines for failures to meet CAFE rules as part of a wide-ranging tax bill - the latest move aimed at making it easier for automakers to build gas-powered vehicles.

Last year, Chrysler-parent Stellantis paid $190.7 million in civil penalties for failing to meet U.S. fuel economy requirements for 2019 and 2020 after paying nearly $400 million for penalties from 2016 through 2019. GM previously paid $128.2 million in penalties for 2016 and 2017.

Stellantis said it supported the Senate Republican proposal ""to provide relief while DOT develops its proposal to reset the CAFE standards... The standards are out of sync with the current market reality and immediate relief is necessary to preserve affordability and freedom of choice.""

GM referred questions to a trade group representing the Detroit Three automakers, which said ""the current CAFE rules are challenging to achieve for automakers and real regulatory relief is needed,"" and praised the Senate Republican proposal.

NHTSA in June 2024 under Biden said it would hike CAFE requirements to about 50.4 miles per gallon (4.67 liters per 100 km) by 2031, from 39.1 mpg currently, for light-duty vehicles.

The agency last year said the rule for passenger cars and trucks would reduce gasoline consumption by 64 billion gallons and cut emissions by 659 million metric tons, cutting fuel costs with net benefits it estimated at $35.2 billion.

The U.S. Senate is expected to vote on President Donald Trump’s massive tax policy, known as the “big beautiful bill,” within a month. It affects a broad range of domestic policy, ranging from increased military spending to reduced Medicaid, food stamps and taxes.

A key target in the bill is repealing most tax credits for clean energy.

Analysts say this will raise energy costs in Tennessee, threaten manufacturing jobs and increase planet-warming pollution.

Trump’s tax bill could slow clean energy growth

In the bill’s current form, consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, heat pumps, solar panels and energy efficient windows will be phased out within a year. These tax credits were introduced under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

The bill also decimates tax credits for renewable energy, which has been the most common and often cheapest form of new electricity. Last year, 94% of new electricity capacity in the U.S. came from solar, wind or batteries.

At the same time, electricity demand is starting to increase after remaining flat for decades. National electricity demand surged 3% last year, largely due to a hotter summer and partially because of new data centers used for artificial intelligence. U.S. exports of fracked gas are also expected to increase, which could raise domestic prices for heating and electricity.

American households could consequently pay as much as $400 more each year on energy bills within a decade, according to analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group.

Tennessee is forecasted to have one of the highest electricity increases in the nation. One analysis found that annual electricity bills could increase by more than 10%, or roughly $200 for the average home, by next year.

The state has already faced higher monthly bills as the Tennessee Valley Authority, the utility that provides nearly all electricity to Tennessee and parts of six other states, has been rapidly expanding its fossil fuel footprint with new gas plants and pipelines. TVA raised electricity rates by 9.75% between 2023 and 2024.

Trump’s bill could impact another part of the local energy economy: Tennessee’s manufacturing boom. In the past three years, the state has seen billions of dollars in investments for factories creating clean tech like EV batteries. Some analysts say these factories and their estimated 5,000 jobs in the state could soon be at risk.

“Jobs have been created and electric bills have been lowered. We urge members of Congress to maintain these tax incentives so that the people of Appalachia can continue to reap their benefits,” Chelsea Barnes, a director with the environmental group Appalachian Voices, said in a statement. The group cited specific examples of tax credits helping communities in the state, like a money-saving rooftop solar installation at the First Presbyterian Church of Oak Ridge, in a new report.

Ultimately, as climate change accelerates, the bill could delay the transition to cleaner energy, which has been ramping up in recent years. The bill also contains goodies for the fossil fuel industry, including an end to taxing excess methane emissions and expedited approval for new oil and gas projects.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cb9136f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+109/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd9%2F27%2F279b946f4586bf73cf37a51a18ec%2Fmatthew-henry-yetqklnhsui-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 19:07:58.291732

Senators must reject this deeply unpopular legislation to avoid damaging the economy, hurting the most vulnerable, and increasing costs on families already suffering from high prices caused by the president’s tariffs.

Methodology

To estimate health insurance coverage losses by congressional district, the authors created proportional weights for each congressional district’s share of the state’s Medicaid and ACA population using KFF 2024 enrollment data. To account for states without Medicaid expansion, the authors used a weight equal to each congressional district’s proportion of the state’s total population from the Missouri Census Data Center, consistent with prior KFF analysis. Then the authors applied that weight to KFF state coverage loss estimates of the House-passed One Big, Beautiful Bill Act and changes based on the loss of enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits to estimate coverage losses by congressional district. Total estimated coverage losses were then calculated by combining estimated losses from cuts to Medicaid and from expiring ACA tax credits.

The estimate for the impact of expanded paperwork requirements on SNAP benefits come from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities’ analysis, which can be accessed here and here, of fiscal year 2022 SNAP quality control data and American Community Survey data for 2019-2023.

The number of jobs at risk if IRA clean energy tax credits are eliminated was calculated using the spreadsheets “Clean Investment Monitor 2025 Q1 Outstanding Spending by State with Jobs” and “Clean Investment Monitor 2025 Q1 Outstanding Spending by CD with Jobs” downloaded from page 10 of the Clean Investment Monitor: Q1 Update from Rhodium Group and MIT CEEPR. The total of “Outstanding Operational Jobs” and “Outstanding Construction Jobs” was 686,003.

Held at the Heinz 57 Center, the event brought together educators, workforce practitioners, community leaders, and employers for a morning of rich conversation, strategic updates, and collaborative breakout sessions.

Panel: Career Maps and Tech in Workforce Development

The morning kicked off with a panel discussion moderated by Sustainable Pittsburgh Executive Director Bhavini Patel, featuring:

Justin Aglio, Executive Director, Readiness Institute at Penn State and Associate Vice President, Penn State Outreach

Pam Dincher, Executive Director of Strategic Initiatives, Clean Energy Center at Penn College

Valerie Karplus, Associate Director, Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation and Professor of Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University

The panel explored how career maps and digital tools can improve awareness of clean energy job opportunities for students, job seekers, and communities that have often been left out of emerging workforce conversations. The speakers emphasized that these tools must be built on accurate, responsive data in order to help individuals understand what jobs are available, what they may already be qualified for, and what steps are needed to move forward.

The panel highlighted how personal experience and community context play a critical role in shaping workforce decisions. Justin Aglio spoke about how limited exposure to career options, especially in communities historically tied to industries like coal, can shape generational expectations. He and Pam Dincher emphasized the potential of career maps to introduce new opportunities for individuals with educators and counselors helping to guide them along the way. Valerie Karplus added a systems-level view, noting that high-quality data can help identify pathways for transitioning from legacy industries into emerging clean energy roles.

At the same time, the panel cautioned that if career maps are not designed thoughtfully, they risk reinforcing the very inequities they aim to address. Ensuring their value requires intentional development and strong community partnerships.

Audience members raised important questions about how apprenticeships are integrated, how employers can be more engaged, and how to ensure career maps capture the full spectrum of job opportunities. Panelists emphasized that while career maps are a valuable resource, their impact depends on strong relationships, active mentorship, and meaningful exposure to real-world work experiences.

Regional Updates from Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh

Brittany Prischak, Director of the Allegheny County Department of Sustainability, introduced the county’s upcoming Climate Action Plan and invited roundtable participants to get involved in shaping it. She noted that the plan will be developed over the next 12–18 months and emphasized opportunities to coordinate with existing community events and networks. Initial surveys and a new public engagement website are expected to launch in mid-June, with larger public events scheduled for September.

Matt Mahoney, Climate and Energy Planning Manager at the City of Pittsburgh, shared updates on the city’s PGH2050 Comprehensive Plan. With research synthesis underway and a summer of engagement planned, Mahoney invited participants to explore the city’s digital engagement hub and share feedback on how the plan can better reflect workforce and sustainability priorities. He also spotlighted the city’s PGH Lab initiative and encouraged organizations to apply for the 2026 cohort, with applications opening Fall 2025.

TrailBlaze Presentation: Defining and Promoting Clean Energy Careers

Tim Hindes, Chief Trail Officer with TrailBlaze Creative, introduced draft concepts for a marketing campaign to support the launch and adoption of the Clean Energy Career Maps, under development by Sustainable Pittsburgh with support from Julius Education. Designed to raise visibility of clean energy jobs, the campaign aims to increase public understanding of what clean energy jobs are, where they exist, and how they connect to long-term, reliable careers.

A key focus of the effort is reaching audiences that may not currently see themselves reflected in the industry, and emphasizing that these roles may require the same skills used in other industries.

During the session, participants were invited to engage with a live polling exercise that prompted responses to draft messaging and visuals around clean energy careers in southwestern Pennsylvania. Attendees shared reactions, identified missing language or ideas, and suggested refinements for tone, clarity, and resonance.

Breakout Sessions

After the presentation, attendees divided into two breakout sessions, each focused on a key initiative within the roundtable: career maps and workforce vitality.

Career Map Committee

Facilitated by Tim Hindes, this session explored how to communicate the full scope of careers reflected in the maps and how to ensure the career maps are relevant across geographic and demographic lines. Participants discussed the challenge of expanding public understanding beyond the most visible clean energy jobs, such as solar installation, to include related fields like transportation, sales, and equipment maintenance. They emphasized that language matters and that small shifts can make a big difference. For example, “skilled trades” was viewed as more approachable than “building trades,” and “reliable work” resonated more clearly with some audiences than technical industry terms like “resiliency.”

The group also emphasized the importance of regional access. Many workforce programs primarily serve Allegheny County, so the maps could be positioned to help job seekers from surrounding counties connect to training and employment opportunities. The conversation also touched on the need to showcase non-traditional pathways, such as veterans transitioning into new industries, or unskilled workers entering pre-apprenticeship tracks. Participants agreed that the success of the maps will depend not only on good design and information, but also on trusted messengers, localized outreach, and exposure to real-world experience.

Workforce Vitality Committee

Led by Coleman Rogers, a Fellow with the U.S. Department of Energy, this session focused on a draft Workforce Vitality Index. The index is being developed to help the region track where job opportunities are growing, where barriers exist, and how to align investments and policies to improve access. Participants reviewed a framework that considers factors like job growth and barriers such as transportation, childcare, and financial insecurity.

The group offered detailed feedback on how to improve the tool. Several attendees suggested clarifying the definitions used in the index and identifying data sources that reflect both industry demand and community needs. Others emphasized the need to break down barriers like transportation into more specific categories to better reflect lived experiences, such as long commute times or lack of flexible transit options.

The conversation also turned to employer practices and job quality. Participants discussed the importance of mentorship, co-op models, and engaging employers early to ensure job seekers are prepared for the realities of the workplace. The index was seen as a useful tool not only for analyzing workforce trends but also for advocating more effectively for funding and policy support.

Both sessions underscored a common goal: improving access to clean energy careers by increasing visibility, strengthening partnerships, and centering the voices of communities most affected by economic transition.

What’s Next

The Clean Energy Workforce Roundtable will reconvene on August 28, 2025, with continued focus on advancing career visibility, addressing workforce barriers, and strengthening collaboration across sectors. In the meantime, the Workforce Vitality Committee will continue to meet and refine the development of the regional Workforce Vitality Index.",https://sustainablepittsburgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/May_Roundtable-4-edited-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 18:10:47.507305

Manufacturers are under increasing pressure to reduce their environmental impact, optimize resources, and improve energy efficiency. As sustainability becomes more of a strategic priority for manufacturers, leveraging cutting-edge technology to meet sustainability goals has become essential. One such technology that is making a significant impact on manufacturing operations is the Automated Building Management System (BMS). These intelligent systems offer a range of benefits for manufacturers looking to reduce their environmental footprint, enhance energy efficiency, and achieve sustainability objectives.

What is an Automated Building Management System (BMS)?

An Automated Building Management System (BMS) is a centralized system that manages and controls various building systems and operations in a manufacturing facility. These systems typically manage areas like heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, energy consumption, security, water management, and access control. BMS integrates these functions into a cohesive platform, allowing real-time monitoring, control, and optimization.

By using sensors, automation, and data analytics, BMS helps facilities make informed decisions, improve efficiency, and monitor the overall health of building systems. In terms of sustainability, BMS acts as a vital tool for reducing resource consumption and minimizing a facility’s environmental footprint.

The backbone of sustainability

Energy usage is one of the most significant costs in manufacturing, and managing it effectively is crucial for achieving sustainability. A BMS enhances energy efficiency by automating the control of heating, cooling, and lighting systems to ensure that energy is used only when necessary.

Real-time energy monitoring and control

Through continuous monitoring of energy use, BMS systems can detect energy inefficiencies and automatically adjust operations to minimize waste. For example, lighting systems can be automatically dimmed or turned off in unoccupied areas, and HVAC systems can adjust their operations based on the real-time temperature and humidity levels within the facility. These energy-saving measures help ensure that energy consumption is minimized, especially during non-peak hours when the facility may not be fully operational.

Demand-response and peak load management

One of the key features of an advanced BMS is demand-response capabilities, which enable the system to respond dynamically to fluctuations in energy demand. By adjusting the use of HVAC, lighting, and other systems, the BMS can reduce energy consumption during peak hours when the grid is under strain. Manufacturers can use this feature to avoid high energy costs and reduce their environmental impact by using energy more efficiently during critical times.

Load shedding and optimization

BMS also helps to manage peak demand through load shedding—reducing non-essential energy consumption during periods of peak demand. This can significantly reduce the overall energy consumption of the facility while maintaining operational efficiency.

Manufacturing facilities, particularly those that rely heavily on energy-intensive processes, contribute significantly to carbon emissions. In addition to improving energy efficiency, BMS plays an integral role in helping manufacturers reduce their carbon footprint.

Renewable energy integration

Many manufacturing facilities are now incorporating renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind energy, into their operations to further reduce their carbon impact. A BMS can play a crucial role in managing the integration of these renewable energy sources. By prioritizing renewable energy usage when available and balancing it with grid electricity, the system ensures that the facility uses as much clean energy as possible, reducing reliance on non-renewable resources.

Water conservation and waste management

Water is another crucial resource that many manufacturing facilities rely on for processes such as cooling, cleaning, and production. As water conservation becomes increasingly important, a BMS helps manage water usage effectively. BMS systems track and monitor water usage in real-time, alerting facility managers to wasteful practices or water leaks. By identifying areas where water is used inefficiently, such as excess cooling or leaky connections, manufacturers can take steps to reduce consumption. Additionally, BMS can provide automated control over water-based systems, ensuring that they are used optimally throughout the day.

For facilities with on-site wastewater treatment systems, a BMS can assist in monitoring and controlling wastewater processes, ensuring they run efficiently. By optimizing water treatment, BMS systems can help ensure that water reuse is maximized, contributing to sustainability efforts and lowering operational costs.

Predictive maintenance and preventing waste and downtime

Manufacturing facilities rely heavily on machinery and equipment to keep operations running smoothly. However, poorly maintained equipment can lead to inefficiencies, increased energy consumption, and even premature failure. BMS plays a critical role in predictive maintenance, which helps avoid these issues and contributes to long-term sustainability.

Using real-time data analysis, BMS systems can identify potential issues with equipment before they become critical, enabling proactive maintenance. This minimizes unplanned downtime, reduces the need for emergency repairs, and extends the lifespan of equipment, reducing the need for replacement and cutting down on waste.

Predictive maintenance also ensures that equipment runs at peak efficiency, avoiding overuse of energy due to malfunctions or inefficiencies. This can significantly reduce energy waste and lower overall energy consumption, directly supporting sustainability efforts.

Compliance with green building standards

As sustainability regulations become more stringent, manufacturers are often required to meet specific green building certifications, such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method). A BMS helps facilities stay compliant with these standards by providing valuable data on energy consumption, water usage, and overall environmental impact.

Pathway to a sustainable future

In the quest for sustainability, manufacturers must leverage technology to optimize resource usage and minimize waste. Automated BMS are an essential tool in achieving these goals, offering real-time monitoring and control of energy, water, and equipment. By automating critical systems, BMS help manufacturers reduce their carbon footprint, lower energy costs, and improve operational efficiency.

Monitoring and managing resources efficiently through BMS gives manufacturers a competitive edge, not only by helping them meet regulatory standards but also by reducing operational costs and contributing to a more sustainable future. As we move toward a greener industrial landscape, BMS will play a pivotal role in driving sustainability efforts and ensuring that manufacturing operations are as efficient and environmentally responsible as possible.",https://www.engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/warehouse-lighting-bms.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 15:11:38.608532

U.S. energy demands are rising by 2% to 3% annually, driven by data center growth, expanding manufacturing, and electrification. Data centers alone are projected to consume up to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028, versus 4.4% in 2023. Such trends drive a supply and demand gap as generating capacity margins in the SPP footprint could decline from 24% in 2020 to just 5% in 2029 unless intervention occurs.

That intervention starts with end-to-end technical innovation, first at the point of generator interconnection. Currently, the U.S. generates 1.28 terawatts of power. The partnership draws on multiple Hitachi competencies: Method’s design services; GlobalLogic’s software engineering services; Hitachi Energy’s energy portfolio management asset modeling solutions; Hitachi R&D’s AI-based energy grid algorithm; and Hitachi Vantara’s integrated storage and compute platform Hitachi iQ, built on NVIDIA accelerated computing, networking, and AI software.

As the regional transmission organization (RTO) framing the project, SPP will guide the integration of these technical solutions and services. As a coordinator prioritizing operational and customer experience improvements, SPP’s input will also ensure the project outcomes align with requirements and regulations.

“Our nation’s demand for electricity has risen sharply in recent years following a long period of slow growth. Our industry has struggled to keep up with this sudden and significant shift,” says SPP President and CEO Lanny Nickell. “There are a lot of would-be power producers out there waiting to connect to the grid, but yesterday’s systems and technology haven’t been sufficient to enable us to bring incremental capacity online fast enough. It’s time to fix that, and SPP is proud to work with Hitachi and NVIDIA, two AI industry leaders who have the means to help realize a vision of a better energy future for our nation.”

The integrated solution is an industrial AI system differentiated by its advanced proprietary AI algorithms and high performance enabled by Hitachi iQ’s enterprise AI solution stack which sit at its core. Dynamic AI-driven technologies will be applied to various study areas, such as:

Process automation

Predictive analysis

Communication systems integration

The partnership with Hitachi and NVIDIA runs parallel to other improvements underway at SPP, including a reimagining of its transmission planning processes to align with current and future industry needs. Together, these technological and process innovations are expected to set high-water marks in the electricity industry for generator interconnection, mid- and long-term planning, long-term forecast accuracy, analysis and deployment of additional grid-enhancing technologies.

“This initiative is about reimagining the electricity production and distribution process through the lens of modern AI technology,” says Frank Antonysamy, chief growth officer, Hitachi Digital. “Real-time data access is needed to create truly realistic scenarios caused by new generator introductions. The AI solution we’re all developing will provide that data, among other advantages. SPP can then make significantly quicker, better-informed decisions that will increase overall ROI while better serving the nation’s population with accessible power.”

“Interconnection process acceleration is critical to meet the unprecedented demand on our grid,” says Marc Spieler, senior managing director of the Global Energy Industry at NVIDIA. “Using advanced NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI, Hitachi and SPP are helping speed interconnection studies to bring essential infrastructure online faster.”

The project’s phase one milestones are expected to be completed by winter 2025/26. They include initial systems acceleration, data management processes optimization, and the introduction of AI-augmented simulation modeling among other goals.

The bills—all of which were approved by the Texas state Senate, but then stalled in the House of Representatives—were backed by interests opposed to continued renewable energy development in the state, even at a time when electricity demand is soaring. One measure would have imposed specific permitting and setback requirements for new wind and solar projects, while another would have limited the state’s growth of new renewable energy capacity to that of natural gas power, which itself is currently curtailed by a global shortage of turbine components.

The bill that attracted the most criticism would have mandated expensive battery or natural gas backup power systems for all existing and future state wind and solar plants when not in operation—a requirement that business and trade groups found too costly for comfort, especially as Texas competes for energy-hungry industries such as artificial intelligence and semiconductor production.

These concerns were amplified by a study commissioned by the Texas Association of Business and released during the legislative session that forecast a 14% increase in power prices in the state, if renewable energy expansion was curtailed. In addition, the report found that the loss of new capacity from renewables would further burden the state’s largely standalone power grid that has proven vulnerable to failure during extreme weather events.

Judd Messer, Texas vice president of the Advanced Power Alliance, a renewable industry trade association, credits the bills’ eventual failure to recognition by House members that sustaining the state’s current economic boom requires every affordable megawatt available, regardless of how it’s generated.

“These legislators recognized renewable power for what it is: a vital part of the Texas economy, particularly in rural communities,” he adds.

New Projects Power Up

The past two decades have seen Texas evolve into a powerhouse of renewable energy development. Last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, wind and solar farms in Texas combined to generate more than 169,000 gigawatt hours, more than any other state.

The pace of growth continues to accelerate. Renewable market monitor Cleanview reports that in 2025, energy developers in Texas expect to add 11.5 and 2.6 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity, respectively. Texas is also a top market for battery projects, with 2.8 megawatts already on line and another 7 gigawatts to be added this year.

Among projects recently completed or underway are the 600-MW Hornet Solar in Swisher County, and the 284-MW Stillhouse Solar, being developed by Matrix Renewables and SOLVEnergy in Bell County. Later this year, developer RWE plans to begin construction on a 200-MW solar project in Bastrop County.

Hybrid projects combining renewable generation with battery storage in Texas include Clearway Energy Group’s 300-MW Pine Forest solar farm and 200-MW standalone storage facility in Hopkins County, and Enel Green Power’s Azure Sky in Throckmorton County, which will combine a 350-MW wind farm with 180 megawatt-hours of battery storage.

Despite the anticipated capacity provided by these and other projects currently in the renewables pipeline, Messer worries that political efforts to undermine the competitiveness of these resources are likely to resurface when the Texas legislature convenes again in 2027, if not sooner.

“Clean energy has become such a political flashpoint that a small band of lawmakers are willing to abandon the very principles they typically champion—protection of private property rights and free enterprise—not out of conviction, but out of political antagonism,” he says.

Unable to challenge renewables’ increasing reliability and affordability, Messer adds, “opponents have shifted the debate to peripheral concerns such as aesthetics or unfounded claims about impacts to wildlife and habitat—a trend that, unfortunately for all Texans, is likely to persist.”

That threat, combined with the prospect of an end to federal clean energy tax incentives, could cloud the state’s long-term renewable energy prospects.

“It’s not just developers paying attention to legislative activity,” Messer says. “So are financiers, offtakers and other project partners. The recent regulatory uncertainty has rattled many of them, and understandably so—we came dangerously close to seeing damaging bills become law. That uncertainty alone can chill investment and delay or derail projects, affecting not just development but also engineering and construction activity across the sector.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/06/06/credit_infrastructure_and_energy_alternatives.jpg?height=635&t=1749229957&width=1200,N,,2025-06-06 16:11:32.228685

Federal clean energy tax credits are at risk of being removed in the new budget reconciliation bill. Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senators are being urged to protect these credits, which help the state’s economy, environment, and energy future.

According to Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, removing these credits could lead to the loss of 26,000 jobs in Pennsylvania by 2030. That number may rise by 2035 if the tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act are repealed. These incentives help clean energy projects like solar, wind, and battery storage grow.

""In Pennsylvania in particular, we found that the loss of the clean energy tax credits would lead to $60 per year in higher household energy bills by 2030 growing to $80 per year by 2035,"" said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling at Energy Innovation. ""That amounts to more than $2 billion more in spending on energy for Pennsylvanians between 2025 and 2035.""

Between 2025 and 2035, this would cost Pennsylvanians over $2 billion in energy expenses. The state could also lose $5 billion in GDP by 2030 and $6 billion by 2035.

""Solar energy made up 66% of the new electricity-generating capacity added to the grid last year,"" said Aaron Nichols, a solar expert at Exact Solar. ""As people have taken advantage of these incentives, the solar industry has grown, creating thousands of good-paying jobs.""

Mike Zimmerman from EDF Action shared that over $1 billion has already been invested in Pennsylvania’s clean energy projects. These include battery and solar manufacturing and grid technology. He added that 27 gigawatts of clean energy projects are waiting to connect to the grid.

Supporters argue that cutting these tax credits could lead to more pollution and higher dependence on fossil fuels, which harms health and the environment.

The assessments, published 4 June 2025, are now open for public comment and peer review—setting the stage for sweeping regulatory consequences across supply chains.

Unreasonable risks identified for workers and ecosystems

EPA's preliminary evaluation concluded that DBP poses risks in 25 of 40 analysed conditions of use (COUs), including exposures to workers and consumers, and one to the environment. Meanwhile, DEHP was found to present unreasonable risks in 33 COUs, particularly concerning occupational exposure and multiple environmental release scenarios.

Importantly, the evaluations do not account for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), though EPA notes PPE may help mitigate some risks. No general population risks were identified under current assumptions, nor were cumulative exposure thresholds exceeded for either substance.

Phthalates under the regulatory spotlight

DBP and DEHP are part of a five-chemical phthalate group under TSCA scrutiny. Alongside these, evaluations are progressing for butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), and dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP). These substances are commonly used as plasticisers across automotive, medical, consumer, and electronics sectors.

In addition to the two draft evaluations, EPA released several cross-cutting technical support documents (TSDs), including a revised cumulative risk analysis and draft carcinogenicity assessment. These documents are intended to harmonise regulatory decision-making across the group.

Key deadlines and next steps

Public comments are due by 4 August 2025, while comments intended for consideration by the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (SACC) must be submitted by 21 July 2025 to the peer review docket (EPA-HQ-OPPT-2024-0551). A virtual peer review meeting will take place from 4–8 August 2025, where evaluations for DBP, DEHP, and DCHP, as well as cross-cutting documents, will be scrutinised.

EPA emphasised that no further peer review will be conducted for BBP and DIBP, as upcoming evaluations will incorporate SACC recommendations from the August session.

Implications across the manufacturing value chain

The findings may have significant regulatory and commercial consequences for sectors reliant on phthalate-based materials. Companies may need to revise their exposure assessments, product formulations, or supply chain transparency measures ahead of final determinations.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64412e3f91a2beff0381430e/6843126559642a7f50e94297_manufacturing-16x9.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 18:11:12.425067

The Louisiana lawsuits, seeking billions of dollars for alleged environmental harm from federally directed wartime activities, are precisely the kind of state overreach Trump’s order targets.
By threatening massive liabilities, these cases deter investment in Louisiana’s energy sector, particularly in LNG infrastructure critical to expanding export capacity.
The Louisiana lawsuits create uncertainty that could stall projects like terminal expansions and new production in the Gulf of Mexico.","The recent $745 million verdict against Chevron in Plaquemines Parish, in a case involving claims against the energy company for environmental damages, demonstrates how Louisiana’s coastal erosion lawsuits are a dangerous blend of legal overreach, political manipulation, and economic risk. Driven by trial attorneys exploiting a home court advantage, the cases jeopardize energy development and the broader economic health of Louisiana and the United States.

The Supreme Court should grant certiorari in Chevron v. Plaquemines Parish to correct the lower courts’ misapplication of the federal officer removal statute, curb the excesses of these lawsuits, and safeguard America’s energy future—especially under President Trump’s energy dominance agenda.

The pending certiorari petition asks the Supreme Court to resolve a growing split among circuit courts over the federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. §1442(a)(1), and to overturn the Fifth Circuit’s flawed decision to remand these cases to state court. Expanded by a 2011 amendment, the statute allows civil actions “for or relating to any act under color of [federal] office”—that is, actions carried out under federal direction—to be removed from state to federal court.

In this case, Chevron and other petitioners—who want to keep the case in federal court—argue that their World War II-era crude oil production was conducted under federal contracts aimed at producing high-octane aviation gasoline (avgas), a resource critical to the Allied war effort. But a divided Fifth Circuit panel ruled that Chevron’s oil production was “unrelated” to those contracts because the federal government had not explicitly directed the company’s upstream crude extraction, which caused the environmental damage at issue. That decision was upheld in a narrow 7–6 vote denying en banc review.

This ruling revives a “causal-nexus” or “contractual-direction” test that Congress eliminated in 2011 when it modified the statue by adding “relating to” to the statute’s language. Under this narrower approach, removal to federal courts was allowed only if the defendant could show a direct cause-and-effect relationship (causal nexus) by proving that it acted under explicit government instructions (contractual direction). As Judge Andrew Oldham’s dissent highlighted, crude oil is the indispensable raw material for avgas, and Chevron’s production activities were closely tied to its federal obligations.

Most appellate courts have recognized that the 2011 amendment eliminated the causal-nexus requirement, permitting removal for actions “connected or associated” with federal directives. In contrast, the Second and Eleventh Circuits still apply the outdated test, and the Fifth Circuit’s decision adds further confusion by introducing a new “contractual-direction” standard.

The Supreme Court’s intervention is essential to clarify the statute’s scope and to ensure that federal contractors, especially those acting under wartime directives, are shielded from state court bias. The phenomenon of state courts acting unfairly against out-of-state actors to the detriment of interstate commerce as a whole has been recognized as far back as Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist Papers. The Fifth Circuit’s approach undermines Congress’s intent to provide a federal forum for such disputes, potentially discouraging private-sector cooperation with federal priorities. As amici General (Ret.) Richard Myers and Admiral (Ret.) Michael Mullen argued, denying a federal forum could deter firms from responding to the government’s call in times of national need, weakening national defense and energy security.

The Louisiana coastal lawsuits are orchestrated by trial attorneys, led by John Carmouche, who have tilted the playing field through political connections and gamesmanship. Carmouche has capitalized on ties with Louisiana’s Governor Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill, both Republicans, to advance these cases. In 2016, then-Attorney General Landry signed a joint prosecution agreement with Carmouche, ceding significant control to private plaintiffs’ lawyers. This agreement, binding the state to reject any defenses raised by defendants, undermines the attorney general’s duty to impartially assess these cases.

Carmouche and his firm have also contributed at least $10,500 to Judge Michael Clement, who presided over the Plaquemines trial. Such contributions raise concerns about impartiality in a state court system already inclined to favor local interests. The plaintiffs’ strategy of filing in rural parishes like Plaquemines exploits this “home court advantage,” where juries may prioritize local concerns over national interests. As former attorney general William Barr’s recent letter to Murrill emphasized, these suits are more about enriching trial lawyers, who stand to gain massive fees from multibillion-dollar settlements, than about genuine environmental restoration.

The $745 million Plaquemines verdict is only the beginning. With interest, costs could exceed $1.1 billion. Plaquemines Parish has 20 other lawsuits pending, and 43 similar cases target oil and gas companies across Louisiana. If the Plaquemines verdict sets a precedent, settlements could reach tens of billions of dollars.

These lawsuits allege violations of Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA), claiming that oil production since the 1940s caused coastal erosion, despite SLCRMA’s grandfather clause exempting pre-1980 activities. Undermining the legal foundation for these claims, the Fifth Circuit ruled in New Orleans City v. Aspect Energy that SLCRMA does not apply retroactively to pre-1980 activities. Attorneys argue that pre-1980 operations were not “lawfully commenced” and that post-1980 unpermitted uses trigger liability for decades-old harms—a theory that contradicts the statute’s text and raises constitutional concerns about retroactivity and due process.

These lawsuits also directly undermine President Trump’s energy policy, which prioritizes American energy dominance through expanded domestic production and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. On April 9, 2025, Trump issued an executive order, “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach,” which condemns states for imposing “arbitrary or excessive fines through retroactive penalties” on energy producers. The Louisiana lawsuits, seeking billions of dollars for alleged environmental harm from federally directed wartime activities, are precisely the kind of state overreach Trump’s order targets. By threatening massive liabilities, these cases deter investment in Louisiana’s energy sector, particularly in LNG infrastructure critical to expanding export capacity.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has underscored LNG’s role in national security and meeting the electricity demands of artificial intelligence infrastructure. The Louisiana lawsuits create uncertainty that could stall projects like terminal expansions and new production in the Gulf of Mexico. The Barr letter warns that these suits could constrain funding for Gulf production, hampering Trump’s goal of positioning the U.S. as a global energy leader. Moreover, the retroactive nature of these claims risks punishing companies for lawful actions taken decades ago, contradicting Trump’s push for a stable, business-friendly regulatory environment.

The suits will drive up energy costs for consumers. Companies facing massive liabilities will pass costs onto consumers through higher fuel prices. The threat of retroactive penalties also discourages new investment, further tightening supply and inflating prices. The Pelican Institute estimated in 2019 that Louisiana’s litigation risk has reduced oil well development by between 53 and 74 wells annually, costing the state $44 million to $113 million in economic activity. Consumers will bear the burden as companies divert resources to legal defense and settlements.

Louisiana’s support for these lawsuits signals a hostile business climate that threatens its economic future. The state’s economy has long depended on oil and gas activity, which provides jobs, revenue, and energy security. But the alliance between trial lawyers and political leaders prioritizes short-term expropriation over long-term economic stability.

The Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association warned that the Plaquemines verdict “undermines Louisiana’s position as an energy leader.” Companies may relocate to states with more predictable regulatory frameworks, as Chevron did when it left California’s restrictive environment—only to face similar challenges in Louisiana. Litigation-driven instability could transform Louisiana from an energy hub into a cautionary tale for businesses.

The Supreme Court should grant certiorari to clarify the scope of the federal officer removal statute and shield federal contractors from state court bias. By allowing these cases to proceed in state courts, the Fifth Circuit has set a troubling precedent—one that threatens national energy policy and economic stability. The Court’s intervention is essential to ensure that justice, not local prejudice, prevails.",https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/chevron-v-plaquemines-parish-louisiana-coastal-erosion-lawsuits-trump-energy.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 19:09:08.033415

Meta has already stated that the PPA is not going to directly support a specific data center.

Moving Nuclear Power Forward

The Clinton Clean Energy Center, which began operations in 1987, had been facing financial challenges and had been slated for closure in 2017.

A temporary reprieve in the form of a state-funded zero-emission credit program provided temporary relief, but this support program is set to expire in 2027.

Meta's long-term commitment, with its 2027 start date for the PPA, effectively replaces the expiring state subsidies, ensuring the plant's continued operation.

The plant currently generates 1,121 MW of energy and the PPA includes plans to increase output by 30 MW, as part of the upgrade, maintenance, and development cycle for the facility.

Constellation made the news last September with the announcement that they would be working with Microsoft to restart the shut down Unit 1 at Three Mile Island, an 800 MW facility that was closed due to not being financially viable by 2019.

Joe Dominguez, president and CEO, Constellation, with the benefit of hindsight, pointed out the shortsightedness of that plant closure and the value of keeping the Clinton Clean Energy Center operational, saying:

SMR Potential at Clinton

The power from the Clinton plant will be added to the grid in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s (MISO) zone four territory, covering central and southern Illinois.

And perhaps more importantly, the long-term commitment to continued operation is encouraging Constellation to consider expanding operations on the site, with the company looking at strategies to expand the early site permit, or potentially join the next generation of power production by seeking a permit from the NRC to develop SMR [small modular reactor] or other Advanced Nuclear Reactor technologies on-site.

Clinton Mayor Helen Michelassi, who has seen the value of the plant and its jobs and tax revenue for her community, said:

Texas Legislature Moves Toward Encouraging Nuclear Power in the State

The Texas Legislature has recently approved House Bill 14, establishing a $350 million taxpayer-funded grant program to promote nuclear energy development in the state.

This initiative aims to position Texas as a leader in advanced nuclear technologies, particularly focusing on SMRs. This is, however, a very much “glass half full” result as the original pitch for the legislation suggested a $2 billion grant program.

The Governor's Office will oversee the nuclear energy fund and the grant program. This includes hiring a coordinator to assist qualifying programs in navigating federal regulations, aiming to expedite the permitting process.

SMR Nuclear a Moving Target

At this point in time, it does seem that the permitting process for next generation reactors is a bit of a moving target as there have been reports of pressure being put on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to both simplify and tighten up the permitting process.

Approximately 80% of the $350 million fund is designated to reimburse construction costs for operational nuclear reactors. The remaining funds are allocated for research and development initiatives.

The focus for all of the funding is supposed to be targeted at the development of SMR facilities within the state.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott believes that the funding would bolster Texas' nuclear manufacturing capacity, rebuild a domestic fuel cycle supply chain, and train the future nuclear workforce, going a long way to making Texas a leader in the nuclear power industry.

The Texas nuclear office is expected to be operational by the end of 2025, though results from the funding are dependent on the time scale of the SMR industry, which is still, most realistically, looking at 2030 before the first commercial power plants are operational.","https://img.datacenterfrontier.com/files/base/ebm/datacenterfrontier/image/2025/06/684078b8682fa95d21bfb05c-clinton25.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-06-06 14:16:36.654058

Several of the bills have already been introduced in the House as House Bills 4636-4640, and the remaining bills will be introduced next week.
“It’s shocking that Michigan law doesn’t require polluters to actually clean up their mess or even report all spills,” Sen. Irwin said.
“Michigan enacted pollution cleanup laws because we had all too many examples of polluters who failed to do the right thing.
“Since my time on the Kent County Commission, I’ve worked to hold polluters accountable and prevent them from transferring that financial burden onto Michiganders.","LANSING, Mich (June 6, 2025) — Democratic legislators in both chambers of the Michigan Legislature are jointly introducing legislation to hold polluters accountable by requiring more thorough cleanups, making information about sites more available, and making it easier for those harmed by pollution to seek justice. The bills’ sponsors are Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) and Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), along with Sens. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield), Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), Sue Shink (D-Northfield Twp.), Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), and Reps. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit), Noah Arbit (D-West Bloomfield), Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth), Cynthia Neeley (D-Flint), and Phil Skaggs (D-East Grand Rapids). Several of the bills have already been introduced in the House as House Bills 4636-4640, and the remaining bills will be introduced next week.

“It’s shocking that Michigan law doesn’t require polluters to actually clean up their mess or even report all spills,” Sen. Irwin said. “This package will ensure more thorough cleanups and comprehensive spill reporting. I’m grateful to the many experts and stakeholders who helped us tailor these bills so that brownfield re-developers can continue to play their key role in cleaning up polluted sites. These bills put liability where it belongs: with the polluters, not the public.”

“For too long, corporations have dumped their messes on Michigan communities and left working people to pay the bill,” Rep. Morgan said. “If you pollute our water, poison our soil, or threaten public health — you pay to clean it up. It’s time we stand up for the people of Michigan and stop protecting billionaire corporations at public expense.”

Michigan’s Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act often enables polluters to restrict access to land or groundwater in lieu of cleaning up pollution. An ever-growing list of over 4,500 sites in Michigan features such land- or water-use restrictions. Environmental advocates and legislators have been working to strengthen Michigan’s pollution cleanup laws for decades.

The current Polluter Pay package was refined through an intensive stakeholder workgroup hosted by the Michigan Dept. of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) in the summer of 2024. Five of the six bills in the package passed the Senate last fall, but the House was not able to take them up before the end of the legislative session. The bills were re-introduced in the form they passed the Senate. Sen. McCann, one of the sponsors of the legislation and chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and the Environment, plans to hold a hearing on the bills next week.

“Michigan’s biggest polluters have been able to use bureaucratic barriers to essentially block updates to the cleanup criteria that say how much contamination is acceptable in our land and water,” Sen. Chang said. “We need this legislation so EGLE can update inputs to cleanup criteria as scientists learn more about the effects and exposure risks of different pollutants.”

“Michigan laws should protect residents, and the default response to a spill should be to clean it up, not fencing it off and letting it sit,” Sen. Moss said. “We know that contamination cleanup can be difficult, but the current law doesn’t even require polluters to try. The Polluter Pay legislation prioritizes removing contamination rather than simply issuing land and water use restrictions.”

“By the time we understood PFAS risks, the legal window to hold polluters accountable had already slammed shut,” Sen. McMorrow said. “For decades, manufacturers knew that even low levels of these ‘forever chemicals’ were dangerous and covered it up. We can’t let companies get away with poisoning Michigan just because they hid the evidence long enough.”

“When you’re notified a polluter has exposed you to a hazardous substance, of course, you want to find out if your health has been affected,” Sen. Shink said. “People already have the right to sue polluters who make them sick, but it often takes a while for the ill effects of a toxic exposure to manifest in a medical diagnosis. My bill would make polluters liable for the costs of medical monitoring to detect problems in the people they put at risk.”

“You don’t always know immediately that you have been harmed by pollution,” Sen. McCann said. “By starting the clock on polluters’ liability before the problem is detected, Michigan’s statute of limitations incentivizes coverups and penalizes people for not knowing they were being poisoned. My bill would, like federal law, start the clock on liability when a person finds out about the pollution so that they have a meaningful chance to seek justice.”

“We can’t continue to rely on the honor system when it comes to pollution,” Rep. Koleszar said. “Michigan enacted pollution cleanup laws because we had all too many examples of polluters who failed to do the right thing. Yet our current law still allows a polluter to release a hazardous substance, clean it up however they see fit, and never report it to anyone. House Bill 4640 would require reporting for all releases, because people have a right to know.”

“Polluters count on the fact that it’s hard for regular people to pay out of pocket for the kinds of testing and monitoring they need to prove that pollution has made them sick,” Rep. McKinney said. “You shouldn’t have to pay to find out how much a polluter has harmed you. House Bill 4637 would make polluters liable for medical monitoring so that people don’t have to shoulder these costs after being exposed to hazardous substances.”

“It is outrageous that many corporate polluters have successfully utilized government red tape to shirk their responsibilities to clean up harmful contamination — and leaving taxpayers to foot the bill,” Rep. Arbit said. “Michigan’s cleanup criteria for chemical substances are over 10 years out-of-date. House Bill 4638 will ensure Michigan no longer lags behind in protecting our residents from toxic substances.”

“People in my district know that you can’t always tell immediately when you’ve been exposed to dangerous levels of a chemical; some hazards, like lead, are not detectable by human senses alone,” Rep. Neeley said. “But in Michigan, the clock on your right to sue a polluter starts when they dump the chemicals. By the time you find out about it, you may have no way to hold that polluter accountable. My bill would set a common-sense standard that parallels the federal law: starting the clock when someone finds out about the pollution.”

“Unless we pass House Bill 4639, forever chemicals will mean forever costs for Michigan taxpayers,” Rep. Skaggs said. “Since my time on the Kent County Commission, I’ve worked to hold polluters accountable and prevent them from transferring that financial burden onto Michiganders. The pollution is still there in our water and land, but current law allows unethical businesses to avoid responsibility for cleaning it up because industrial polluters successfully concealed the dangers of PFAS for so long. The people of Michigan deserve to be able to sue for the damage emerging contaminants have done to our land and water. We all learned a basic rule in kindergarten: clean up your own mess. That simple truth should be the law of the land here in Michigan.”

House called her ""an amazing supply chain leader at the forefront of that thinking.""","Ford CFO Sherry House discussed the impacts of tariffs and supply chain disruptions on the company's production and costs.

House stated that Ford is working to mitigate potential production disruptions caused by export controls on rare earth minerals from China.

Ford is collaborating with suppliers to explore options for moving production to the U.S. to reduce tariff exposure.

Ford Motor Co.'s chief financial officer outlined how tariffs and supply chain disruptions are expected to impact Ford's vehicle production and its costs during a wide-reaching interview with a Wall Street analyst June 4.

Ford CFO Sherry House said the Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker will provide more details on the economic impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs and other policy changes in its second-quarter earnings next month. But she cautioned there are still many unknowns being sorted out, all of which could make Ford's upcoming financials ""a bit lumpy,"" she said.

""As we move into the next couple of weeks to prepare for the quarter, if we give guidance it will be in the caveats of what we can’t define,"" House said. ""If we don’t, we’re going to give you every piece of information that we feel we can to help you, other analysts and investors to understand the business as much as possible.”

Here are the top takeaways from House's fireside chat with analyst Joe Spak at the UBS Auto and Auto Tech Conference in New York on June 4:

On getting parts from out of the country

House said Ford has seen some backlogs to getting rare earth minerals into the supply chain, so Spak asked how that could impact vehicle production.

“There are many components that rare earth minerals are in and many of those that are coming from China require you to now go through export controls, so there’s an additional layer of administrative process that has to happen,"" House said.

She said sometimes the components pass through smoothly, other times there are holdups and that's when Ford has to take action to mitigate any disruptions.

""You have to look for alternative parts or alternative ways to get things,"" House said. ""Frequently, it goes through, it just may take more time. So then you might be facing expedited shipment costs that you weren’t anticipating and it just puts stress on a system that’s highly organized with parts being ordered many weeks in advance.""

She said Ford has been managing the issue so far, but warned, ""I don’t know if at some point this is going to be a larger issue for us?""

As for Trump's latest tariff: a boost in steel and aluminum to 50%, House said the impact on Ford should be minimal because Ford buys all its aluminum from domestic suppliers and it buys 80% of steel from U.S. sources. Ford will manage any price increases in steel through ""contract pricing,"" meaning prices have already been set.

""So when all of this hits, there is a delayed impact,"" she said.

On getting reimbursed for certain tariffs

On April 29, Trump signed an executive order that set up a complicated system of federal reimbursements on certain imports of auto parts and components for the next two years used in vehicles made in the United States. The order gives Detroit's automakers some relief from what Trump earlier had ordered — 25% tariffs on all imported autos which began in April and another 25% on all imported auto parts set to begin by May 3.

Spak asked House how Ford is getting the federal reimbursements for the parts that are compliant with the United States Mexico Canada Agreement as outlined in the order Trump signed at the end of April. She said a lot of that is still being defined.

""I don’t completely know,"" House said. ""So you’re paying the tariffs now. I think it’s very possible that there will be a delay in getting those offset. I’m talking about the parts offset. It could be by a quarter, it could be by a couple of quarters. But all of you who are looking at our financials in Q2, Q3 and Q4, are going to have to know that it’s going to be a bit lumpy. You might have more expense before you actually get the money reimbursed.”

On getting suppliers outside the U.S. to move here

The good news for Ford is 80% of the parts used on its vehicles are USMCA-compliant and 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States are built here. Still, the automaker warned during its first-quarter earnings report that tariffs will add $1.5 billion in net costs this year.

For the 20% of suppliers who import parts, House said Ford is having conversations with them, seeking ways to help mitigate Ford's exposure to tariffs and lower those costs, while also meeting the business obligations of its suppliers.

“As we face the tariff situation, we face it together,"" House said of Ford's suppliers. ""The types of conversations we are having are around: Do you have additional capacity in the U.S.? Could you move to the U.S.? What types of investments might help you get there?”

But she explained that it is ""a very complex and nuanced situation"" with the supply base as to which suppliers to press for changes. Ford considers the kinds of quality, cost, technology and performance a supplier has provided in the past as to how it works with them around the tariffs, she said.

“But on an individual basis we’re decided whether or not it makes sense to make some of these changes,"" House said. ""I don’t have anything to announce with you right now, but, of course, you would look at some of your higher priced components first, items that affect more vehicles, that would be the order of operations.”

On finding partners for EV and battery production

House did not address a May 25 report in the Wall Street Journal that cited sources as saying Ford would share production space in its battery plant in Kentucky with rival Nissan. The move signals Ford's retrenchment from electric vehicle investments and it helps the Japanese automaker reduce its exposure to tariffs on imported vehicles and parts.

But House did say given the ""very competitive global landscape"" with companies having different needs and levels of technology, it makes sense to be thinking about partnerships so as to get more efficiency, especially if it is an area where Ford does not need to be No. 1. She said the automaker is ""absolutely open"" to doing more partnerships than the ones it currently has in place.

On changes inside Ford workplaces

House joined Ford about a year ago and became its CFO in recent months. When asked how she has seen the company change culturally, she listed a few ways:

First, Ford has started to put more specialists in roles as opposed to putting a really great generalist in roles. For example, when it named Liz Door as its chief supply chain officer in 2023. House called her ""an amazing supply chain leader at the forefront of that thinking.""

House said she has challenged Ford to think about ""not letting your governance define what the pace of the business is going to be.""

""What happens is big companies … you have weekly meetings on a topic, you have monthly meetings on topic, you have quarterly meetings on a topic. What happens when you set up your business that way is you are running to that governance structure and you’re only doing the work to get ready for that weekly meeting or monthly meeting,"" House said. ""But if you can step back and let the priorities define the pace versus the governance structure, the business define the pace, I think you can go a lot faster and you can make sure you’re focused on the right things.”

She said Ford also has looked to ""break boundary constraints"" in its strategy meetings.

""If you’re having meetings with just one function, a lot of times you can’t break the boundary constraints because you don’t have everybody in the room that can tell you can do something. So you feel like you can’t,"" House said. ""So having more cross functional meetings as well. These are all tactics that can make a difference.""","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/04/USNK/84037278007-20250416-t-211035-z-733222701-rc-24-zday-8-uh-8-rtrmadp-3-autoshownewyork.JPG?crop=4979,2801,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-06 18:12:42.159148

The Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act of 2025 would make the world’s largest sources of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels financially responsible for the damage caused by wildfires, droughts and other events exacerbated by the warming climate.

The idea adopts the “Superfund” model — created by Congress in 1980 to clean up the nation’s worst toxic waste sites — and applies it to greenhouse gases, aiming to hold companies financially accountable for emissions that drive climate change.

New York and Vermont have already enacted similar measures despite massive opposition from the oil and gas industry.

But the proposed California legislation has stalled since April, even as environmental groups — galvanized by the death and destruction of the January Los Angeles wildfires — have made it a top priority.

Identical versions in both legislative houses have sat idle in Assembly and Senate committees despite a full-court press by supporters framing the superfund as a solution to California’s $12 billion budget deficit. The bills passed out of their first committees but have not advanced further.

“Nobody can afford the kind of financial crisis that the climate crisis has caused,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat from San Luis Obispo, one of the authors, told CalMatters. “Oil caused the climate crisis, in large part … they lied about it as they caused the damages, and it's time for them to come to the table and create more affordability for the very people that they've harmed.”

The funds would be earmarked for paying for community disaster preparedness, such as evacuation planning and emergency housing, as well as energy efficiency, zero-emission fleets and charging, and natural resource protection, among other projects, according to the bill.

Opposition includes oil companies and major business groups. In addition, despite worsening wildfires and floods, many Californians have been increasingly voicing concern that the state’s climate policies are driving up gas and electricity costs.

Oil and gas industry lobbying has been fierce. Jim Stanley, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association, the industry’s top lobbying group in the West, said in a statement that the measures were “misguided proposals to retroactively punish companies for providing a legal product that was, and remains, critical to our state's economy.""

He said that ""at a time when Californians are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis, these bills will likely result in massive price increases for gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electricity and consumer goods.""

The climate superfund also faces resistance from a powerful ally of Big Oil: California’s State Building and Construction Trades Council, a key union that has repeatedly backed the industry’s positions, as CalMatters has previously reported.

Earlier this year, the council also opposed legislation by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, that would have allowed residents to sue oil companies for climate damages.

In April, Keith Dunn, a lobbyist for the trades union, told an Assembly committee that the climate superfund would drive up energy prices, kill middle-class jobs and act as a stealth tax on working families. “The affordability gap is widening,” Dunn told lawmakers. “It's not by chance, it's by choice.”

Both measures include “urgency” provisions, which allow them to take effect immediately if passed by a two-thirds vote and signed by the governor. That higher threshold makes them less vulnerable to certain legal challenges and exempts them from the usual legislative deadlines. (Most bills must clear their house of origin by today.)

“There was quite a bit of opposition earlier in the year so we're continuing those conversations,” Addis said. “We have time to have those conversations.”

The bill would make companies pay for emissions from “the extraction, production, refining, sale, or combustion, including by third parties, of fossil fuels or petroleum products,” which includes oil, gas and coal.

Bill targets multinational corporations

The bill applies to companies that emit more than a billion metric tons of global emissions from 1990 through 2024 — that means multinational oil and gas corporations. Within three months of the law taking effect, the agency would publish a list of companies that would pay into the fund.

There are no official estimates as to how much companies would pay. The legislation would require the California Environmental Protection Agency to estimate costs from past and projected climate damages to people, governments, ecosystems and infrastructure every five years through 2045, using peer-reviewed science.

“It is imperative that we make polluters that caused a large percentage of the climate crisis pay for the thing that they knowingly caused,” said Maya Golden-Krasner, an attorney with the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, which has sponsored the California bills. “They've known that this would cause damage since at least the 1950s, they knew that these greenhouse gases would be regulated since the 1990s and they've been gaslighting us all the way and blocking climate regulation.”

The climate superfund fight is part of a broader national movement against major oil companies that is playing out in legislatures and courtrooms across America.

California is leading efforts to hold oil companies accountable in court for climate change, recycling a legal strategy deployed during the 1990s, when states alleged that tobacco companies knew cigarettes cause cancer.

Trump-era politics have also been at issue. In April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order targeting state climate programs, specifically calling out Vermont's and New York’s polluter-pays laws and threatening legal action against California’s landmark cap-and-trade program.

Backers say the climate superfund is a fair solution to California’s budget crunch as well as a long-overdue reckoning for an industry that knowingly caused the climate crisis.

But the plan — which could cause oil and gas companies to pay billions for emissions over the last three decades — faces an uphill battle in Sacramento.

Last year, Californians voiced strong opposition to plans to overhaul one of its cornerstone climate programs, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which could push gasoline prices higher. Last week, Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Democrat from Bakersfield, called for California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, who led the board in its passage of that measure, to resign over cost concerns.

Likely to trigger a legal onslaught

If enacted, the climate superfund would almost certainly trigger a wave of legal challenges. Donald Sobelman, a San Francisco environmental attorney, told CalMatters that the bill is legally ambitious — and is almost certainly headed for a courtroom challenge if it passes.

The Trump administration, for instance, sued New York and Vermont over their climate superfund measures, arguing they are unconstitutional.

Another potential legal argument, Sobelman said, is that the measure could charge companies now for pollution emitted years or even decades ago. Another is that the measure could act like a tax, which could make it easier to challenge in California court without two-thirds approval by the Legislature.

And some judges may question whether the science linking the emissions to worsening fires and other climate events is strong enough to single out specific companies for climate damage, leading to the “classic battle of the experts,” Sobelman said.

In addition, courts could determine that consumers hold some responsibility for their actions, such as driving cars and trucks powered by fossil fuels, and that other industries around the world, such as power plants and farms, also emit a lot of greenhouse gases.

A spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom declined to tell CalMatters whether he supports the measure.

In his May budget proposal, the governor adopted “polluters pay” language to rally support for an existing California climate program, cap-and-trade, which raises money by selling pollution credits to companies.

The debate is unfolding amid a worsening budget crisis in which lawmakers are under pressure to find new revenue sources — especially ones that don’t involve tax hikes on Californians. Supporters of the Superfund Act argue that the bill offers a “polluter-pays” principle rather than new taxes.

Newsom’s budget proposal said extending cap and trade “aligns with the polluter-pays principle in which carbon emitters will fund the state’s world-class forestry and fire protection programs in the face of wildfires that have become increasingly destructive because of climate change.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/97fb8d5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1412x741+0+98/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F95%2F3b%2F4c4d12b547f0b8def957b40743dc%2Fscreenshot-2025-06-06-092513.png,N,,2025-06-06 19:09:12.269457

LEOPOLD, Ind. (AP) — On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Rule required big polluters to say how much they are emitting

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama’s administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they’ve collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

“We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press’ analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to … document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that’s an inducement to lower emissions.

“It is money for those companies. It’s costs. It’s reputation. It’s been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country’s air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

“The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know” how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group’s community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state, including members of Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life, aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

The version of the One Big Beautiful Bill that passed the House would eliminate them.
The One Big Beautiful Bill takes aim at EVs in other ways.
WGLT asked Kontou what inside the One Big Beautiful Bill would impact Rivian most.
Whether those secondary impacts actually happen depends on if the One Big Beautiful Bill actually passes.","On the surface, legislation that kills the $7,500 tax credit for new electric-vehicle purchases doesn’t look like a big deal for Rivian.

As of this year, consumers who buy a new Rivian R1T pickup or R1S SUV made in Normal aren’t getting the tax credit anyway. That’s because the price tag for a new Rivian is above the $80,000 cap to get the credit. (Business buyers could still get it.)

But the fate of the EV industry – and, indirectly, the Bloomington-Normal economy – is a lot more interconnected than that one thing. That means there’s a lot at stake for the Twin Cities in the House-passed One Big Beautiful Bill, which would cut incentives for EVs.

“Any impact on consumer demand, or the supply of vehicles, or the supply of infrastructure can have great ramifications on how fast we can transition to electric vehicles,” said Eleftheria Kontou, an assistant professor in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who has studied EV demand.

Currently, buyers can get up to $7,500 in tax credits for certain new EV purchases, and $4,000 for a used EV.

The version of the One Big Beautiful Bill that passed the House would eliminate them. They've long been a target of President Trump and other Republicans who consider them wasteful spending. They argue the market, not the government, should determine what people drive.

A Princeton study estimated that if the tax credits are repealed and federal emissions regulations are cut, as the White House has signaled it also plans to do, sales of EVs in 2030 could be 40% lower than they would have been. Kontou tends to agree.

“There’s of course still market momentum, because consumers understand the electric vehicles are cheaper to operate. They’re much more energy efficient. And there are other performance benefits. If you drive an EV, you know how easy they accelerate. It’s a different experience,” Kontou said.

One criticism of EV tax credits is that they primarily help wealthier car buyers, because new EVs are expensive. Kontou says even that can have positive trickle-down effects.

“They can bring down the prices of batteries, because demand increases. [They] help solidify the market so that you can justify investments in building electric vehicles. And, of course, as more and more people become familiar with electric vehicles, prices drop, then a greater set of consumer segments can access these vehicles. We can see that this happened very fast in the past 10 years,” Kontou said.

The One Big Beautiful Bill takes aim at EVs in other ways. It would also add a new $250 annual fee for EV drivers, hypothetically meant to correct for the fact that EV drivers don't pay gas taxes.

However, Consumer Reports has calculated that the proposed fee is more than three times what a typical driver of a new gas-powered car pays in gas tax. Kontou is also skeptical of the $250 math.

“I’m not convinced the comparison is fair. We’d need to see that that is the case,” she said.

WGLT asked Kontou what inside the One Big Beautiful Bill would impact Rivian most. She theorized it might be disinvestment in charging infrastructure.

Indeed, Illinois’ chief EV officer Megha Lakhchaura says the legislation would eliminate a 30% tax credit for charging stations in specific areas. She says the areas most affected will be primarily rural communities and underserved regions that currently lack adequate EV infrastructure. She's urging developers and utilities to move quickly and get charging stations installed by Dec. 31 so they don't lose that tax credit.

As the saying goes, “the Stone Age didn’t end because we ran out of stones,” and neither are we moving away from coal because we’ve run out of coal. And yet, Pres. Donald Trump is trying to revive the dying industry with Executive Orders (EOs) and presidential pardons for toxic polluters, including coal mining corporations and NorthWestern Energy.

On his first day in office, Pres. Trump signed an EO declaring an energy emergency and directed federal agencies to do everything possible to expedite the “leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources,” particularly on federal lands. Of course, his definition of energy resources excluded the most affordable, clean, and abundant energy resources on earth today – wind and solar.

While Pres. Trump was elevating fossil fuels, he was also signing EOs targeting wind energy. One EO stopped off-shore wind projects and put the brakes on wind development across the country. His actions threatened the vibrant wind energy industry and the enormous opportunity we have for further clean energy development in Montana.

In late March, polluters were told they could email the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requesting exemptions from toxic air pollution standards. On April 8, Pres. Trump issued another series of EOs and proclamations aimed at coal. He granted scores of industrial polluters a two-year waiver from toxic air pollution standards, including the Colstrip power plant, which has the highest rate of toxic emissions of any coal plant in the country. The waiver was issued with complete disregard for technology, public health, aquatic resources or wildlife. As a result, people near and downwind from the Colstrip plant will continue to experience higher levels of lead and arsenic than other coal communities in the nation. While every similar power plant in the country has already installed pollution controls limiting toxic air pollution, Montanans will pay the price of this delay with their health, water resources, aquatic life, and wildlife.

The EO didn’t just grant a two-year waiver from toxic air pollution requirements; It also directed EPA to revise the rule and eliminate the requirement that these plants reduce toxic pollution – even if they have the ability to do so. This puts Montanans’ health in the crosshairs despite technology being readily available to protect people from air toxins.

Other EOs claimed that “[c]oal is abundant and cost-effective, and can be used in any weather condition.” First, the plant is only cost-effective compared to nuclear and NorthWestern’s new gold-plated methane gas plant near Laurel. The Colstrip plant is anything but cost-effective, especially when you consider the annual cost of fuel, maintenance, and operations, and eventual cost of cleanup. The EO also ignores the Colstrip plant’s abysmal record of operations during times of extreme weather. In recent years, the plant has been partially or entirely offline during extreme weather events, costing customers a fortune because NorthWestern had to buy power from the market when it was the most expensive.

Some of the EOs try to claim that reopening closed coal plants or extending the life of uneconomic plants is a matter of “energy security.” But these EOs encourage the overseas sale of coal and do nothing to stop the flow of oil and gas resources to overseas markets. If energy security were the concern, the orders would have mandated increased production of renewable energy resources and prohibited the export of coal, oil, and gas. But instead, the orders did the opposite.

One of the EOs directed the Department of Interior (DOI) to prioritize and expedite coal leasing on public lands despite the dramatic decline in coal production over the last 20 years due to competition with cleaner resources. In response, the Interior Secretary issued orders to the agency to approve the environmental impact statement for new coal mine expansions within 28 days, ignoring the time it takes to determine baseline conditions, analyze water resources, consider community impacts and concerns, or protect public health and water resources.

There have even been rumors of EOs that would target nonprofits that work on environmental issues, promote climate action, or oppose the bolstering of the coal industry. Rest assured that, in the case of such an EO, MEIC will continue to advocate for clean air, clean water, sustainable communities, justice, and a livable climate. We will speak out against those who weaponize authority, and we stand firmly united with our fellow environmentalists and nonprofit advocates who work to provide vital services across this country.

Ultimately, these energy EOs are just a wishlist for an uncompetitive industry and a power-hungry administration. Most of the published orders will be implemented through rules adopted by the EPA and DOI. These and future rules will be subject to judicial challenge where courts will hopefully hold the administration in check and require it to comply with the laws adopted by Congress and signed by previous Presidents.

I wanted to share a brief update on the current status at the Capitol. As I mentioned in my last update, just before the midnight deadline on May 19, the Minnesota House officially adjourned the 2025 regular legislative session. We successfully passed many of our key budget bills in time, sending them to the Governor’s desk for his signature. However, about ten remaining components of the budget were still tied up in negotiations. As a result, we’ll need to return for a brief special session to complete our work.

Special sessions aren’t unusual in budget years, especially when government control is divided. In fact, the only recent budget year we avoided one was in 2023, when DFL leadership in the House, Senate, and Governor’s office collaborated to pass one of the most impactful budgets in state history.

Just before I sent this out today, an agreement was reached between House & Senate leadership and the Governor that a special session will start next Monday, June 9th, at 10:00 am.

So the next time I send out an update, it will be about how the special session was completed!

Wildfires and our Air Quality

The recent poor air quality across our community is yet another stark reminder of the growing impacts of climate change. The thick haze from wildfire smoke is becoming an all-too-familiar sight.

Climate change fuels hotter, drier conditions, which drive more frequent and intense wildfires. According to the World Resources Institute, forest fires are now destroying more than twice as much tree cover as they did just 20 years ago. The trend is only worsening as global temperatures continue to rise.

Minnesota is on the frontlines. The northern part of our state is part of the northern boreal forest, one of the regions warming faster than the global average. Alarmingly, 70% of all wildfire-related tree loss worldwide is happening in boreal regions like northern Minnesota.

We can’t afford to ignore this. Bold climate action is no longer optional. It’s urgent. Much of what we did this year in the Energy and Transportation Committees is fight against rollbacks of key climate policies passed in prior years. While we were largely successful, it also is a lost opportunity to keep making progress on climate action.

Clean Energy = Jobs

While wildfire smoke reminds us of the urgent need to tackle climate change, we’re also seeing positive action right here in Minnesota. Just a few days ago, I joined the House DFL Energy team at the ribbon cutting for Heliene’s new solar module manufacturing line in Rogers, MN.

This expansion means 220 new clean energy jobs and over 500 megawatts of solar production capacity each year, which is enough to power thousands of homes. As our Senator Amy Klobuchar said at the event, she “loved the sound of Minnesota jobs.” So do I!

Clean energy isn't just about reducing emissions. It's about creating good-paying jobs, lowering electricity costs, improving air quality, and building a stronger, more resilient economy. Minnesota is proving that we don’t have to choose between economic growth and climate action. We can and must do both.

Happy Pride Month!

As we celebrate Pride, we reaffirm our commitment to making Minnesota a welcoming, inclusive, and affirming place for everyone, no matter who you are or who you love.

While some national figures and extremist movements work to roll back hard-won rights and target LGBTQ+ youth and communities, here in Minnesota we’re standing firm.

HARRISBURG, Pa. – With Congress rolling back numerous federal clean energy programs, hundreds of Pennsylvanians joined PennEnvironment’s annual virtual “citizen lobby day.” New data shows the Keystone State ranking a lowly 49th in the nation for growth in renewable energy over the past decade, making it even more important for constituents to lobby their state senators and representatives to fill the potential federal funding gap.

“Red, blue and purple states are all diving in and taking advantage of the clean energy opportunities readily available in their states. But Pennsylvania is falling far behind in the renewable energy race,” noted PennEnvironment Deputy Director Flora Cardoni. “It’s time for the Keystone State to stop being a clean energy laggard, and implement the policies needed to make it a clean energy leader.”

Over the course of the day, nearly 400 constituents from Erie to Philadelphia and everywhere in between met with their respective state legislators from 65 different (more than one quarter of the) state House and Senate districts. This cross-section of Pennsylvanians called on their state legislators to pass the package of energy conservation and clean energy policies put forth in Gov. Josh Shapiro’s energy plan — often referred to as the Lightning Plan.

The plan includes proposals to increase the amount of clean, renewable energy that utility companies must supply in Pennsylvania; expand the state’s cornerstone energy conservation program to reduce energy consumption and save Pennsylvanians money on their utility bills; reduce climate pollution from the state’s largest global warming polluters; authorize community energy, which will allow residents to access and jointly share solar energy resources; and streamline the process for wind and solar projects to come online faster, to help deliver more clean energy.

“PennEnvironment’s annual virtual citizen lobby day is a simple and effective way for concerned Pennsylvanians to have their voices heard about the environmental and energy issues that affect their lives and they care so deeply about,” said Cardoni. “That’s why so many residents take time out of their busy schedules to call on their elected officials to implement policies to expand clean energy, improve energy efficiency, reduce climate and air pollution, and protect our children and future generations.”

The day also included a virtual rally featuring cosponsors of Lighting Plan legislation, including state Sen. Judy Schwank, as well as Jessica Shirley, the acting secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection

“Climate change is causing more frequent and severe extreme weather events, putting Pennsylvania communities in harm’s way,” said Senator Judy Schwank. Substantive action to address our over-reliance on fossil fuels and meet our need for clean, renewable energy is long overdue. Community Energy is just one of many policies we can enact at the state level to modernize Pennsylvania’s energy agenda and ensure we protect our environment for future generations.”

This year’s citizen climate action lobby day is co-sponsored by PennPIRG, Solar United Neighbors, Vote Solar Action Fund, POWER Interfaith, Sierra Club PA, Clean Air Action Fund, KEEA, Lutheran Advocacy Ministry in PA, Audubon Mid-Atlantic, PA-IPL, Evergreen Action, Third Act PA and more.

A report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) said that the industry currently contributes $18 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product and supports over 122,000 manufacturing jobs.

The industry is primed to grow to 579,000 jobs and an $86 billion increase to GDP by 2030. It would provide $42 billion in earnings to American workers, said the report.

ACP said clean energy manufacturing jobs pay an average of $42,000 more than the typical American worker’s salary. This is especially true in solar, where direct manufacturing job salaries averaged $134,000 in 2024, said the report.

Solar manufacturing

Solar manufacturing alone supports 75,400 jobs across 90 facilities, $5.9 billion in earnings and $11.5 billion in GDP, according to the report.

For active facilities, the United States currently has 35 module manufacturing sites, 25 tracker manufacturing facilities, seven for racking, 13 for inverters, three solar cell facilities, one ingot and wafer fabrication and four sites producing solar-grade polysilicon.

Today, the United States has over 20 GW of active module manufacturing capacity and 3 GW of cell capacity directly supporting the utility-scale sector. This leaves a 25% gap for module demand and 75% gap for cell demand for manufacturers to fill. However, if all announced projects come online as planned, total utility-scale module capacity could exceed 75 GW and cell manufacturing could reach 40 GW, enough to meet projected demand, said ACP.

Further upstream, the United States currently has no commercial-scale solar ingot and wafer manufacturing capacity. However, Qcells and Corning are building facilities that together would add 6 GW to the domestic supply chain of ingots and wafers. If all announced projects move forward, the United States could reach 15 GW of ingot and wafer capacity for utility-scale solar by 2030, said ACP.

As for solar-grade polysilicon, the producers in the United States supplied 4.5 GW – equivalent of material in 2024, with expectations to reach 10 GW by 2030, said ACP.

The full report tracks manufacturing output, jobs and economic impact for solar, wind and energy storage manufacturing.

Policy

The trade association made several policy recommendations to maintain manufacturing momentum:

Preserving energy tax credits (45X, 45Y, 48C, 48E)

Ensuring executive orders on energy and critical minerals security appropriately leverage demand from downstream manufacturers

Create a stable and strategic trade environment

“When tariffs are used to counter unfair trade practices, they must be phased in over time and be sector-specific to avoid inadvertently raising costs and suppressing demand for American businesses, including domestic manufacturers,” said the report.

Facilitating a true all-of-the above energy strategy

“ACP estimates that the U.S. will require up to 50% more power on the grid in the next 15 years. Traditional energy sources, while necessary, are not enough to meet near-term needs. Solar, wind and energy storage are immediately available and will ensure that the cost of U.S. energy—including costs for energy-intensive domestic manufacturing processes—remains low.”

Streamlining permitting

“The Administration and Congress should establish clear, predictable, standardized permitting timelines across agencies and technologies, streamline permitting processes, align judicial review requirements (e.g., FAST-41) for manufacturing and energy projects with other sectors, and expedite high-impact transmission projects.”

Bottom line

Over 73% of the 800-plus active manufacturing facilities in the United States are located in Republican districts. Despite this, the budget resolution bill moving through Congress makes drastic cuts to tax credit support for the industry, threatening 94,000 manufacturing jobs across the nation, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

But not all SAFs are created equal. With a potential to slash aviation’s CO₂ emissions by more than 90%, e-kerosene (also known as e-SAF) is the only scalable and sustainable option in the long term.

Despite a strong regulatory framework under the Fit for 55 package and ReFuelEU Aviation, e-SAF projects in the EU have yet to reach Final Investment Decision (FID). This is due to high capital and operational costs, a lack of long-term offtake agreements, and insufficient revenue certainty — a market failure that existing EU mechanisms have not been able to resolve.

The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) presents a unique and timely opportunity to correct this imbalance. By focusing its support on the most strategic SAF pathway – e-SAF – the STIP can catalyse the deployment of clean aviation fuels while boosting the EU’s industrial competitiveness, energy independence, and jobs.

To do so, the STIP should embed a comprehensive mechanism, such as a European Hydrogen Clearing House (EHCH). The EHCH would operate through double-sided auctions, matching fuel producers and buyers (e.g. airlines), while ensuring price stability and demand aggregation. This would de-risk production through long-term contracts and contract for differences for e-SAF, enabling scale-up while ensuring alignment with the EU’s competitiveness goals.

CEO Alex Urist of XCharge, which makes battery-integrated chargers, raised the issue in an interview with Charged (see our Oct-Dec 2023 issue).
The company recently introduced a line of EV chargers that can handle a variety of input voltages, including 240 V single-phase and 208 V/240 V three-phase—all in the same box, without derating the charger.
At that time there were a lot of customer comments from some of the incumbents in the DC fast charger space.
Inside of the charger there’s this big open space for ease of installation, and in this area are what we call configurable busbars.","Power Innovations International’s new line of DC fast chargers can accept a wide range of input voltages.

The utility connection bottleneck has become the bête noire of the EVSE world. But sometimes the problem isn’t getting enough power, but rather getting the right kind of power—and sometimes the real bottleneck is getting the transformers and switchgear needed to work around these issues.

Power Innovations International has a solution—its new line of EV chargers can handle a wide range of input voltages, eliminating the need for step-up transformers and 480 V switchgear, which can translate to big savings of time and money.

Pii’s new chargers have several other features that customers have been asking for, including a modular architecture that’s designed to simplify installation and improve reliability.

There are three things everyone in the EV industry seems to agree on: (1) we need more charging infrastructure; (2) it needs to be more reliable; and (3) installation often takes much too long. Project delays very often have to do with getting a site connected to the grid, but it isn’t (always) the fault of local utilities—high demand for essential power equipment such as transformers and switchgear has created a shortage, and wait times can stretch into months or even years.

In addition to equipment shortages, many sites have problems obtaining the right kind of power. The majority of DC fast chargers on the market today require 480-volt, 3-phase power, instead of the 208 V and 240 V supplies found at many commercial and residential properties. And there are some areas in the US where 480 V is simply not available.

Several EVSE industry pros have told us that this is a major bottleneck. CEO Alex Urist of XCharge, which makes battery-integrated chargers, raised the issue in an interview with Charged (see our Oct-Dec 2023 issue). If 480 V isn’t available at your site, you’ll need an extra piece of equipment called a buck-boost transformer to step the voltage up to what you need. Charging industry consultant Forest Williams told us that this item can cost thousands of dollars, and the lead time for obtaining the necessary switchgear can stretch to months.

EVSE manufacturer Power Innovations International (Pii) has a solution. The company recently introduced a line of EV chargers that can handle a variety of input voltages, including 240 V single-phase and 208 V/240 V three-phase—all in the same box, without derating the charger. This eliminates the need for step-up transformers and 480 V switchgear, which can translate to big savings of time and money.

Charged spoke with Nick Stone, Pii’s Product and Market Manager.

Charged: What’s the origin story behind your new EVFC line of chargers?

Nick Stone: Pii was started in 1997 as a small business in Utah, and developed a rugged, reliable type of UPS product, focusing on industrial applications. [Taiwanese electronics company] Lite-On acquired Pii in 2013. In the 2020-2021 timeframe, there was an opportunity to complement that business with what Pii can do. Lite-On has a number of Level 2 chargers, but Lite-On didn’t have a Level 3 charger. With DC fast charging, of course, we’re integrating power conversion to convert AC to DC, and that’s one of the core competencies that Pii offers.

At that time there were a lot of customer comments from some of the incumbents in the DC fast charger space. We listened to some of that feedback and tried to understand what customers were saying about their chargers. Of course, uptime is certainly imperative, but we wanted to add some other features.

We spent some time around 2022 developing some rectifiers that we use across our product lines, and leveraging the same power supply topology that Lite-On uses in the data center space. This gives us one million hours demonstrated MTBF [Mean Time Between Failures, a measure of reliability] within the data center. We wanted to take that same type of power supply topology that’s been demonstrated in mission-critical applications and integrate that into a DC fast charger.

One of the things that our firmware team does is a lot of embedded control. One of the competitors in this space builds a UL 508 A panel where your power supply and power meter are DIN rail-mounted, and you open it up and it’s a maze of wires. We wanted to take all the control and the power conversion that’s doing the auxiliary power and integrate that into one solution that sits on top of our power conversion. We spent some time developing that to where you take AC power coming into our power conversion block, measure the AC power, do all your low-voltage conversion—12, 24 and 48 volts for all the internal power needs and the auxiliary loads—bring that down to our power supplies, bring it back up through the high-voltage line, back through that same controller, and to the CCS1 output.

Charged: The low-voltage auxiliary loads are things like the video screen and the user interface?

Nick Stone: Yes. Our modem, the display, the buttons, the e-stop, the heat exchangers—all of those are coming from a central power supply that’s built in. There’s no need for a separate DIN rail power supply or a whole bunch of other wiring. Conversion of any type of AC voltage is a core competency that Lite-On has, and we integrated that into our overall design. We don’t have external wires come and go to the power supply, then come out and feed all these loads—we’re doing it all in an integrated, clean solution.

Now, of course, we need an enclosure, we need thermal management, environmental protection, a display, some type of user interface. That’s where we spent some time listening to customers and installer partners. They were saying, “I don’t like to do filter replacements.” Okay, we will integrate that into our design. We will have a way to do thermal management that requires no maintenance.

They were saying, “I need this thing to be easy to install.” How do we do that? One key is having a very wide space to land your cables, so you can do any type of configuration when you’re doing the installation. With a lot of space, you don’t need tweezers. Even if you’re doing 60 kilowatts, 240 single-phase, for instance, your cable bending space, you could struggle with that during the installation.

That was one of the key messages that we heard. Another was, when we’re in existing infrastructure, they don’t always have 480-volt power available. They may only have 208, 240 single-phase or delta, so they have to buy a step-up transformer. That’s another pain point that we heard: “I can buy a charger with maybe six months of lead time, but I have to wait two years to get my transformer.” We came up with a way, which we have a patent pending on, to accommodate any standard US installation voltage out there. We can do 208, 240 delta, 240 single-phase, 480 delta [a form of three-phase that doesn’t have a neutral], 480 wye, all in the same charger.

Accommodating the available power can help speed up getting the chargers into the ground. If you’re looking at a hotel or a car dealership or a gas station, they’re probably not going to be installing ten DC fast chargers, so they don’t want to get that additional transformer. In some cases, you would have to pour a pad, get a primary and secondary disconnect, and depending on who owns that station, you might have to get a meter socket to branch off power. There’s a lot of different variables, and we have seen instances where doing that can double your project cost.

Charged: Our Chloe Theobald spoke to your Global Sales Manager Tim Rees at the 2024 ACT Expo, and he explained that Pii’s chargers are based on a modular power architecture that can keep them delivering electrons even if individual modules fail.

Nick Stone: It’s similar to a data center type of architecture. If a power supply goes down, it doesn’t take the rest of the system down. For example, we have nine modules in our 30 kW charger. If one does go down, the other eight are still operational. You’re running at 26.7 kilowatts instead of 30, but your whole station doesn’t go down. And to replace a power supply, the module slides right in and out in a matter of seconds. Any other type of charger, you have to take that whole 30 or 40 or 50 kW block out, and it’s a pretty serious level of effort. For us, we ship out another module, you take the top off, there’s a little tab that you pull out, slide another one in, and you’re back up and running at full capacity.

Charged: Your chargers can accept not only a wide range of voltages on the input side, but on the output side too, so they can already accommodate the new EVs that are moving to 800-volt systems.

Nick Stone: Correct. We have the dual drivetrain in our rectifier that can do that. Some of the first Hyundai/Kia 800-volt vehicles out there, we’ve already been charging those for a couple years now. We know that’s where the industry’s heading, because you can lower your current and increase your overall power.

Charged: It all seems like a no-brainer. You’ve got a charger that can eliminate the need for a transformer. Why isn’t every EVSE manufacturer offering that?

Nick Stone: I’ll say a couple things. One, we’re one of the only ones that are vertically integrated in this space, so we are able to configure our power supplies to the application that we have. And looking at the power supply topologies that are used in the data center space, we have to have a wide input range to accommodate that market segment. Also, the way we’ve arranged our rectifiers within what we call our power shelf is a proprietary arrangement, and that’s something we do have a pending patent on.

Now, there are a few manufacturers that can take a 240 delta input, but you’re derating the amount of power. For instance, if you go to that 30-kilowatt charger, it’s 30 kilowatts if you feed it 480 three-phase. You can apply 240 to it, but you may derate to maybe 22 or 24 kilowatts of power. We’re the only ones that we’ve seen that can take any of those different input voltages without derating the amount of power. So, if you buy 30 kilowatts or 60 kilowatts or 120 kilowatts, you get what you bought.

Charged: And whoever’s installing the chargers can easily choose the input voltage that they need.

Nick Stone: Yes. It’s not something you have to do with firmware or anything like that, it’s actually a mechanical way that we do that. Inside of the charger there’s this big open space for ease of installation, and in this area are what we call configurable busbars. This is something that is smaller than the palm of your hand. It’s a very easy process. All three of these are available in every charger that we sell, so when the electrician or the installer sees what input voltage they have available, they simply pick the appropriate voltage. It’s printed right on the front of the busbar.

Charged: Considering that this can save money and time, and increase reliability, do you foresee that your competitors are going to start doing this too?

Nick Stone: I think they’ll certainly take notice. When we were at ACT doing our initial market launch of the product, there were a number of competitors that came by to learn about what we’re doing. The way we’ve done it though, I think we have enough protection there for our IP for them not to do it the same way, and it will then take another couple years for them to do it a little bit differently.

Charged: So you’ve got a first-mover advantage that’s going to last you for a couple years, hopefully.

Nick Stone: We believe so, yes. There’s one additional featurethat I haven’t mentioned yet. Our standard rectifier today uses AC input voltages, but it is capable of taking a DC input voltage as well, so we can now take inputs from a battery source or a hydrogen fuel cell input. So, we’re looking at these other applications—if you’re in the portable power space serving applications such as events or movie studios, those are some of the additional applications that we are working with partners to expand the application set, because we can do DC input.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Power-innovations-copy.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 14:18:21.445897

LEOPOLD, Ind. (AP) — On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Rule required big polluters to say how much they are emitting

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama’s administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they’ve collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

“We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press’ analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to … document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that’s an inducement to lower emissions.

“It is money for those companies. It’s costs. It’s reputation. It’s been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country’s air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

“The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know” how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group’s community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state, including members of Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life, aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

Environmental inspection legislation in China At the central legislative level, the Central Environmental Inspection (CEI) mechanism remains underdeveloped in formal legal frameworks.
The hybrid model establishes environmental inspection systems in both comprehensive environmental legislation and specific environmental legislation.
The analysis reveals eight possible scenarios for provincial-level environmental inspection legislation: “no legislation”, “Party regulations only”, “comprehensive environmental legislation only”, “specific environmental legislation only”, “Party regulations + comprehensive legislation”, “Party regulations + specific legislation”, “comprehensive legislation + specific legislation”, and “Party regulations + comprehensive legislation + specific legislation”.","Scholars have a long-standing tradition of conducting political-economic analyses of environmental legislation, which has yielded a wealth of research findings (Oates and Portney 2003). However, existing literature on environmental legislation tends to focus predominantly on laws that are implicitly regarded as “regulations of the market”. For instance, traditional theories view environmental regulation as a tool for internalizing negative environmental externalities (Oates and Portney 2003), while median-voter models often conceptualize industries as the primary targets of environmental legislation (Peltzman 1976; Stigler 1971). What if the target of environmental legislation is the government and its officials, rather than corporations or individual citizens? Unlike “laws regulating the market”, laws designed to “oversee the regulators” primarily impose legal obligations on environmental regulators (such as local environmental protection agencies and their officials) to diligently investigate environmental violations and ensure local environmental quality, accompanied by corresponding liability for non-compliance. Under such circumstances, what factors might influence the development of environmental legislation?

Although existing studies on the factors influencing environmental legislation are extensive, they remain insufficient to address the questions raised above. This limitation is evident in two main aspects: First, as noted earlier, most research—whether in the environmental field or other domains—focuses primarily on legislation regulating the market, with relatively little attention given to laws that oversee environmental regulators (Boyer and Laffont 1999; Dougherty and Heckelman 2008; Ekelund et al. 2010; Jenkins and Weidenmier 1999). The distinction between legislation regulating the market and laws overseeing environmental regulators lies in their respective governance targets and institutional functions. While the former primarily constrains market actors’ environmental behaviors through compliance mandates, the latter establishes accountability mechanisms for regulatory agencies themselves, addressing principal-agent dilemmas that could otherwise lead to lax enforcement, regulatory capture, or bureaucratic inertia. This institutional oversight dimension proves critical because even the most sophisticated market-oriented environmental laws risk becoming symbolic gestures if the regulators entrusted with their implementation lack effective supervision and performance evaluation frameworks (Gunningham et al. 1998; McAllister 2010).

Second, existing scholarship on environmental legislation has predominantly focused on analyzing the influence of individual determinants, such as conflicts between local economic interests and environmental objectives (Adetutu 2024), shifts in policymaker risk perceptions triggered by environmental disasters (Emam et al. 2020), disparities in subnational governance capacities (Provins 2024), and public opinion pressures amplified by climate extremes (Herrnstadt and Muehlegger 2014). These studies collectively emphasize how singular factors—whether institutional, perceptual, or socio-political—shape legislative outcomes. While emerging research has begun examining contextual drivers in non-Western settings, including China’s centralized environmental governance mechanisms like central inspection systems (Ding et al. 2022) and localized legislative responses to environmental accidents (Zang 2022), the field remains dominated by analyses of isolated variables rather than their systemic interactions. Such an approach, however, risks oversimplifying the complexity of environmental lawmaking, which is shaped by the interplay of political, economic, and institutional dynamics rather than any single determinant (Harrison and Sundstrom 2010; Vogel 2003). A fragmented analytical lens may obscure the cumulative and interactive effects of these factors, leading to partial or even misleading conclusions about the drivers of legislative change.

To bridge these research gaps, this study employs fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to examine the complex configurations of factors shaping environmental inspection legislation in China. The establishment of the Central Environmental Inspection System is widely regarded as a landmark event marking China’s shift in environmental governance from “regulating enterprises” to “regulating governments” (Feng et al. 2022). Since 2016, China has conducted three rounds of Central Environmental Inspections. However, this system is currently stipulated only in the internal Party regulation, Regulations on Central Environmental Protection Inspections, and has yet to be codified into national law. Consequently, the system has been criticized by scholars for its “lack of legitimacy” (Zhang 2017), its limited long-term effectiveness as a campaign-style governance tool (Tan and Mao 2021; Xiang and van Gevelt 2020), and its tendency to result in overly rigid enforcement practices at the local level (Kou et al. 2024). Against this backdrop, some regions have proactively incorporated the environmental inspection system into local legislation ahead of national codification. Regional approaches vary significantly in terms of whether and how environmental inspections are included in local laws. This variation provides valuable material for studying the factors influencing environmental inspection legislation. Adopting a configurational perspective and employing fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), this study examines the local environmental inspection legislation of 31 provincial-level administrative regions in mainland China to identify and analyze the factors shaping such legislation.

This study offers potential contributions in three main areas: First, it fills a void in the study of the factors affecting “oversight of regulators” within environmental legislation. Second, it employs fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to rigorously explore the complex interactions among the various determinants shaping environmental lawmaking. Third, it broadens the research perspective on environmental inspections. While scholars have conducted extensive research on environmental inspections, the majority of studies have focused on the environmental governance performance resulting from central environmental inspections (Jia and Chen 2019; Li et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2021; Lu 2022; Pan and Hong 2022; Tan and Mao 2021; Wang et al. 2021; Wei and Kang 2023; Wu and Hu 2019; Yuan et al. 2022), their impacts on corporate investment, environmental information disclosure, and green technological innovation (Cheng and Yu 2023; Pan and Yao 2021; H. Wang et al. 2021; J. Wang et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2023), as well as their influence on regional industrial structure upgrading (Chen and Shen 2022; B. Wang et al. 2022; Zeng et al. 2023). However, there has been a lack of research specifically focused on environmental inspection legislation, particularly concerning provincial-level environmental inspection systems.

This study is structured into five sections. Apart from the Introduction, the second section provides an overview of China’s environmental inspection system, followed by an analysis of the factors influencing environmental inspection legislation from a political-economy perspective. The third section employs a configurational analysis approach, utilizing fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to conduct an empirical analysis of the factors affecting environmental inspection legislation. The fourth section focuses on the analysis and discussion of the empirical results. Finally, the fifth section presents the conclusions.

Environmental inspection system in China

Central environmental inspection practices in China

Since the beginning of the 21st century, China has increasingly emphasized strengthening environmental regulation in response to mounting environmental challenges. A milestone in this effort was the enactment of the revised Environmental Protection Law in 2014, widely regarded as “the strictest environmental protection law in history”. However, despite the introduction of a progressively comprehensive environmental regulatory framework, China’s environmental issues remain unresolved, leading to growing public dissatisfaction (Xiang and van Gevelt 2020). The central government attributes these persistent issues to a critical factor: the failure of local governments to fulfill their environmental protection responsibilities in accordance with the law. To ensure the effective implementation of local governments’ environmental obligations, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Environmental Inspection Plan (Trial) in 2015, formally establishing the Central Environmental Inspection (CEI) systemFootnote 1.

The Central Environmental Inspection (CEI) refers to a mechanism through which the central government establishes dedicated inspection bodies to oversee the environmental performance of provincial-level Party committees, governments, and other relevant organizations. The CEI teams serve as the primary implementation entities, typically led by provincial-level or ministerial-level leaders from the central government, with the vice minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment acting as the deputy leader. Other team members include experts in environmental protection and officials from central government departments.

The scope of the inspections includes assessing regional compliance with national environmental laws, regulations, policies, standards, and plans; identifying and addressing prominent environmental problems; and examining how complaints from the public regarding environmental issues are handled. Sources of inspection leads include both information collected independently by CEI teams and environmental complaints lodged by the public. For cases of environmental damage resulting from failure or improper fulfillment of duties by local Party and government leaders uncovered during inspections, CEI teams are authorized to refer case leads to relevant authorities for investigation and accountabilityFootnote 2.

As of December 19, 2024, China has conducted three rounds of Central Environmental Inspections. The first round began in 2015 and was completed in 2018, covering all 31 provincial-level administrative regions. The second round, conducted from 2019 to 2022, also achieved full coverage of the 31 provincial-level regions across six batches. The third round commenced in November 2023 and, as of now, has completed three batches of inspections, covering 20 provincial-level regionsFootnote 3. Statistics from the first round of CEI reveal that over 135,000 public complaints were processed, resulting in penalties for approximately 29,000 enterprises, with total fines amounting to about 1.43 billion yuan. Additionally, 1518 enterprises faced criminal investigations, and 1527 individuals were detained. The inspections also led to the questioning of 18,448 Party and government officials and the accountability of 18,199 individualsFootnote 4.

Environmental inspection legislation in China

At the central legislative level, the Central Environmental Inspection (CEI) mechanism remains underdeveloped in formal legal frameworks. While Chinese central legislation typically operates through a three-tier hierarchy—comprising laws (法律), administrative regulations (行政法规), and departmental rules (部门规章)—CEI currently lacks anchoring in national laws or State Council-issued administrative regulations. Its sole statutory basis resides in a single departmental regulation: Article 3(6), 20, and 31(4) of the Measures for Supervision and Administration of Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection by Central Enterprises (2022) outline the obligations for the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) and central enterprises to cooperate with CEI activities.

Beyond this limited regulatory footing, CEI primarily derives authority from administrative normative documents (行政规范性文件). For example, the Implementation Opinions on Strengthening the Supervision and Management of Sewage Outlets into Rivers and Seas, issued by the General Office of the State Council in 2022, states that “the rectification and supervision of sewage outlets should be included as a key element in central and provincial-level environmental inspections”. Nonetheless, administrative normative documents (行政规范性文件) are not recognized as formal sources of law under the Legislation Law. The absence of formal legislation is the primary factor underpinning scholarly critiques regarding the CEI’s lack of legitimacy (Zhang 2017).

This contrasts markedly with provincial-level environmental inspection regimes, which exhibit greater legislative maturity. Twenty-four provincial-level jurisdictions have formally institutionalized environmental inspection systems through local legislations (地方性法规)—legislative instruments enacted by provincial People’s Congresses or their Standing Committees. These binding legal frameworks establish comprehensive procedures for inspection implementation, rectification mandates, and accountability mechanismsFootnote 5.

The term “local legislation” herein specifically refers to these province-level statutory instruments, distinct from both central-level departmental rules and non-binding administrative directives. This subnational legislative development addresses the regulatory gap observed at the national level, providing formalized legal bases for environmental governance that align with regional enforcement realities.

In terms of local legislative models for environmental inspections, three primary approaches can be identified: the comprehensive environmental legislation model (hereinafter referred to as the “comprehensive model”), the specific environmental legislation model (hereinafter referred to as the “specific model”), and the hybrid model combining comprehensive and specific legislation (hereinafter referred to as the “hybrid model”). Details of local environmental inspection legislation for each provincial-level region are provided in Table 1.

Specifically, the comprehensive model incorporates the establishment of environmental inspection systems into general environmental protection legislation. For instance, Article 28(1) of the revised Hunan Province Environmental Protection Regulations (2019) states: “The provincial people’s government shall inspect the performance of environmental protection responsibilities by lower-level governments, their achievement of environmental protection targets, improvements in environmental quality, and their resolution of prominent environmental issues. For violations identified during inspections, the relevant people’s government shall be urged to address them promptly in accordance with the law, and the results shall serve as a basis for assessment and evaluation. Inspection results shall be disclosed to the public”. A total of 10 provincial-level administrative regions have adopted the comprehensive model for legislating environmental inspections, including Shanghai, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Tibet, Qinghai, and Xinjiang.

The specific model refers to the establishment of environmental inspection systems within specialized environmental legislation. For example, Article 7 of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Water Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (2019) stipulates: “The people’s government of the autonomous region shall establish systems related to water pollution prevention and control, including ecological protection compensation for water environments, monitoring and early warning of water environment carrying capacity, and environmental inspections”. A total of 3 provincial-level administrative regions have adopted the specific model for legislating environmental inspections: Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, and Henan.

The hybrid model establishes environmental inspection systems in both comprehensive environmental legislation and specific environmental legislation. For instance, Article 23 of the Tianjin Municipal Environmental Protection Regulations (2019) establishes a specialized inspection system for environmental protection: “The municipal people’s government shall establish an environmental supervision system to conduct routine supervision and specialized inspections of the implementation of environmental protection laws and regulations and the fulfillment of environmental quality responsibilities by municipal departments and district governments”. Meanwhile, Article 20 of the Tianjin Municipal Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality Promotion Regulations (2021) explicitly applies environmental inspection to the “dual carbon” field: “The implementation of laws, regulations, and responsibilities related to carbon peaking and carbon neutrality by municipal departments and district governments shall be included in environmental inspections”. A total of 11 provincial-level administrative regions have adopted the hybrid model for legislating environmental inspections: Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Jilin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Chongqing.

Factors driving environmental inspection legislation: a theoretical framework

The heterogeneity of provincial-level environmental inspection legislation in China’s political-legal landscape calls for a theoretical framework that captures the multi-actor dynamics inherent in legislative processes. Stakeholder theory—originally formulated by Freeman (2010) for corporate governance—posits that organizational decisions emerge from interactions among diverse actors who hold varying interests, wield different degrees of power, and offer distinct value propositions. This perspective has been effectively extended to environmental governance research, illuminating how government agencies, industries, civil society groups, and citizens negotiate competing priorities in regulatory policymaking (Driscoll and Starik 2004; Zhang and Cao 2015). Recent studies further demonstrate its utility in explaining environmental legislation variations through the lens of power-resource configurations among legislators, bureaucrats, and advocacy coalitions (Berrone et al. 2013; Delmas and Toffel 2008).

Drawing on existing research based on stakeholder theory, this study develops a tailored theoretical framework for analyzing local environmental inspection legislation in China. The framework identifies four primary stakeholder groups in the legislative process: legislators, enforcement authorities, market entities, and the general public. Legislators—embodied by local People’s Congresses and their Standing Committees—are responsible for drafting, reviewing, enacting, and amending laws (Bektas 2023; Trajkovska-Hristovska 2022). Although enforcement authorities typically have limited direct involvement in the legislative process, their role is pivotal in implementing laws and ensuring compliance, thereby translating legislative intent into practice (Van Kreij 2022). Market entities, such as industrial enterprises, actively shape legislative processes by providing information and lobbying for favorable policies, which can influence legislators’ perceptions of public opinion and the broader representation of societal interests (Hertel-Fernandez et al. 2019; Judge and Thomson 2019). Meanwhile, the public and civil society organizations participate through consultations and public hearings, contributing diverse perspectives and expertise essential for democratic representation and shaping legislative outcomes (Rasmussen and Toshkov 2013; Tao and Jasper 2022).

Building on “Power-Legitimacy-Urgency” framework by Mitchell et al. (1997), this study identifies the key stakeholders in local environmental inspection legislation and elucidates their interactional dynamics (see Fig. 1). The definition of significant stakeholders requires meeting at least two of the three dimensions outlined in the framework. In the context of China’s environmental inspection legislation, four categories of significant stakeholders are identified: legislators (local People’s Congress and its Standing Committee), enforcers (local governments and environmental protection departments), market entities (industrial enterprises), and the general public. The following sections will examine the three-dimensional attributes and roles of each stakeholder.

Legislators: local people’s congresses and their standing committees

Local legislative bodies possess high levels of power and legitimacy in the process of local environmental inspection legislation. This is primarily due to the exclusive powers granted to them by the ConstitutionFootnote 6 and the Legislation LawFootnote 7, which enable them to formulate, amend, and repeal local regulations. As the statutory authorities, they are the final decision-makers on whether local environmental inspection legislation will be enacted. However, because legislators must balance multiple interests during the drafting, revision, and deliberation phases of the legislation, their sense of urgency is relatively low. For instance, local People’s Congresses must weigh the accountability pressure from central environmental inspections, the capacity of local enforcement agencies, and the practical needs of local economic development. This process is often accompanied by complex negotiations and coordination of interests.

For legislators, an assessment of the existing legislative stock in a related field is typically conducted before initiating new legislation. Generally, if there is already a significant body of existing legislation, the likelihood of enacting new laws decreases (Fankhauser et al. 2015). Environmental inspections fall under the category of administrative enforcement supervision within the specialized domain of environmental protection. Prior to the enactment of local legislation on environmental inspections, there may already have been laws addressing administrative enforcement supervision in a general context. For legislators, if existing administrative enforcement supervision legislation sufficiently supports local environmental administrative enforcement efforts, there is little necessity to incorporate environmental inspections into local legislation. This is because enacting new laws imposes additional responsibilities on local legislators, such as conducting subsequent enforcement reviews and post-legislation evaluations, which significantly increase their workloadFootnote 8.

However, on the other hand, diverging from the conventional theories discussed above, this study contends that within the Chinese context, a larger legislative stock may actually promote a higher degree of local environmental inspection legislation. Specifically, local legislators do not necessarily approach environmental inspection legislation purely from a functional standpoint; they may also be driven by a desire to “keep pace with national policy trends” or to “outperform other regions”, resulting in these laws being difficult to enforce in practice and ultimately becoming “zombie provisions”Footnote 9. The research by Qin et al. (2023) has also noted that Chinese local legislative practice is characterized by an overemphasis on quantity at the expense of quality, as well as a tendency toward blind competitive behavior. In regions with a higher stock of enforcement supervision legislation, local legislators generally exhibit greater initiative and efficiency in the legislative process, which can help them distinguish their environmental inspection legislation efforts on a national scale.

Enforcers: local governments and environmental protection departments

In the context of local environmental inspection legislation, enforcers exhibit both high power and high urgency. The power of enforcers is reflected in their substantial capacity to influence the legislative process. According to Article 73 of the Legislation Law, although local governments do not hold direct legislative power, they can indirectly shape the content of legislation through activities such as drafting regulatory proposals, making legislative suggestions, and coordinating stakeholder interests. From a legitimacy standpoint, local governments’ participation in the legislative process must be bounded by their statutory functions. Article 59 of the Organic Law of Local People’s Congresses and Local Governments clearly assigns local governments the responsibility to “implement the resolutions of the local People’s Congresses”. However, proactive involvement in legislation can provoke controversy over “executive overreach” into the legislative domain, particularly within the framework of “campaign-style governance”, where policy-driven acceleration of legislation may undermine procedural legitimacy. The high urgency of enforcers stems from the rigid constraints imposed by central environmental inspections—such as deadlines for corrective actions and the public disclosure of accountability lists—which compel local governments to view legislation as a tool for risk mitigation.

For enforcers, their attitudes toward environmental inspection legislation are primarily influenced by two factors: motivation and capacity. First, central environmental inspections provide a strong impetus for local governments to improve environmental legislation (Ding et al. 2022). According to the Regulations on Central Environmental Inspections, inspection results serve as a critical basis for assessing the leadership teams and officials of inspected entities. These results are submitted to the relevant organizational (personnel) departments according to the cadre management authority for decision-making regarding rewards, punishments, appointments, and removals. Additionally, inspection teams must compile accountability issue lists and case files on significant environmental problems, along with any associated negligence or misconduct. These are transferred to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the National Supervisory Commission, the Central Organization Department, or other relevant authorities based on jurisdiction, procedures, and requirements.

Under the pressure exerted by central environmental inspections, provincial-level administrative regions may standardize procedures, methods, and criteria for provincial environmental inspections through local legislation. This allows for the establishment of routine inspection mechanisms that enable more comprehensive and in-depth monitoring of local environmental issues. These mechanisms can identify and address problems that central inspections might overlook or deprioritize, aiming to minimize exposed issues in subsequent rounds of central inspections. This paper argues that the greater the pressure from central environmental inspections, the stronger the motivation of local enforcers to support and promote local legislation on environmental inspections.

It should be explicitly stated that within the framework of this study, the central government is treated not as an independent legislative stakeholder but as an external source of pressure on local enforcers. This classification is based on the following considerations: the legislative authority for environmental inspections rests with the provincial People’s CongressFootnote 10, and the central government indirectly drives local legislation through the environmental inspection system (e.g., accountability case counts serving as pressure indicators), rather than by directly participating in the legislative process. In other words, the role of the central government is primarily manifested in its supervision and accountability mechanisms over local enforcers, rather than through the direct allocation of legislative resources (Du et al. 2023; Kou and Han 2021). Consequently, the political pressure exerted by the central government is internalized as a behavioral constraint on local enforcers rather than representing an independent stakeholder.

Additionally, enforcers’ attitudes toward environmental inspection legislation are constrained by their enforcement capacity. The formulation of laws often takes enforcement costs into account (Ehrlich and Posner 1974). If a region lacks sufficient enforcement resources to support the actual implementation of provincial environmental inspections, the corresponding local legislation would ultimately become an unenforceable “paper tiger”. Therefore, this paper contends that the more resources local governments allocate to environmental enforcement, the stronger the support of enforcers for local legislation on environmental inspections.

Market entities: industrial enterprises

In the process of local environmental inspection legislation, market entities hold both high power and high urgency. Market entities, particularly industrial enterprises, primarily participate in the legislative process through their economic influence (Liu and Ren 2023). When industrial enterprises anticipate that forthcoming environmental legislation may impact their operations, they often promptly exert pressure on local legislators through mechanisms such as emphasizing their tax contributions and job creation roles. This strategic lobbying aims to influence the legislative process in their favor (Hobbs 2020). However, the legitimacy of the demands from market entities, especially industrial enterprises, is relatively low, as their profit-maximizing goals often conflict with environmental protection obligations.

In general, for market entities, environmental legislation signals a tightening of regulatory oversight and the imposition of greater environmental obligations on industrial enterprises, potentially disrupting their routine production and business operations (Cai and Ye 2020). Consequently, industrial enterprises are inclined to oppose such measures. However, within the context of local environmental inspection legislation, these enterprises may exhibit two distinct responses.

On one hand, if the legislation primarily enhances the supervision of local environmental enforcement inaction, it indirectly increases regulatory pressure on industrial enterprises—thereby reinforcing their opposition. On the other hand, if the legislation functions to standardize local environmental inspection practices, it can protect the legitimate rights and interests of industrial enterprises by preventing local governments from overreaching in their enforcement effortsFootnote 11 to meet environmental performance targets (Slivka and Lesko 2021), which in turn may garner support from these enterprises.

Importantly, the eventual impact of environmental inspection legislation is not determined solely by its textual provisions—typically a blend of measures to address both enforcement inaction and overaction—but rather by the level of political pressure exerted by the central government (He et al. 2022). Specifically, under high central political pressure, local governments are more likely to emphasize measures curbing enforcement inaction, leading industrial enterprises to oppose the legislation. Conversely, under lower central political pressure, local governments tend to focus on mitigating excessive enforcement, thereby protecting industrial interests and securing their support.

The general public

In the process of environmental inspection legislation, the key characteristics of the general public are high legitimacy and high urgency. As an essential human right, the public’s demand for clean air and water carries both moral and legal legitimacy. The direct threat of environmental pollution to public health and quality of life further intensifies the immediacy of these demands. However, the public’s power to participate directly in the legislative process is limited, primarily relying on indirect channels such as petitioning and public opinion supervision to exert pressure. For example, environmental mass incidents may compel local governments to accelerate legislation, but the public faces challenges in directly intervening in legislative decision-making.

Local environmental inspection legislation is influenced by the public’s demand for environmental quality. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory, when people have low incomes, their primary focus is on meeting basic survival needs, such as food and housing, with less attention given to environmental quality. However, as income levels rise and basic needs are met, people begin to focus on quality of life and higher-level spiritual needs, with a good environment becoming a key factor in fulfilling these higher-level needs (Maslow 1943).

Based on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory, environmental quality may deteriorate during the initial stages of economic growth but improves as income levels reach a certain threshold. This improvement partly reflects increased demand for and provision of environmental protection in higher-income societies (Grossman and Krueger 1995).

In the legislative process, public demand for environmental quality can translate into environmental legislation. For instance, during the 2014 revision of the Environmental Protection Law, public feedback prompted lawmakers to add 14 provisions to the second draft and an additional 7 provisions to the third draft (Zhu and Wu 2017).

In this study, I have chosen to apply fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate the factors influencing local environmental inspection legislation. fsQCA is particularly well-suited for examining complex causal relationships and identifying patterns across multiple cases, making it an ideal method for this research. Unlike traditional statistical techniques, fsQCA allows for the exploration of how different combinations of conditions lead to a particular outcome, providing a nuanced understanding of the factors that contribute to the development of local environmental legislation.

The legitimacy of fsQCA is anchored in its foundations in set theory and Boolean algebra, with a focus on analyzing necessary and sufficient conditions for outcomes (Ragin 2000). This method operates under the principle of “causal complexity”, acknowledging that outcomes often result from combinations of conditions rather than isolated factors. Unlike regression-based methods that emphasize net effects, fsQCA examines how conditions interact conjunctively (through logical AND) and substitutively (through logical OR) to produce outcomes (Schneider and Wagemann 2012). This approach aligns with the study’s configurational perspective, which posits that local environmental legislation emerges from the interplay of political, economic, and social factors.

The fsQCA process comprises three key steps: calibration, truth table construction, and solution evaluation. First, variables are calibrated into fuzzy-set membership scores ranging from 0 (full non-membership) to 1 (full membership), reflecting the degree to which cases belong to a given set. A critical assumption underlying fsQCA is that set membership must be well-defined, which necessitates careful determination of appropriate cut-off points for fuzzy sets (Olsen and Nomura 2009; Tóth et al. 2017). Second, a truth table is constructed to systematically compare case configurations. This study analyzed 31 provincial-level cases, generating a truth table with 25 = 32 possible configurations. Third, logical minimization algorithms simplify complex configurations into parsimonious solutions, distinguishing between core and peripheral conditions (Rihoux and Lobe 2009).

The choice of fsQCA is justified by three methodological considerations. First, the study addresses the issue of “multiple conjunctural causation”, recognizing that different combinations of conditions may lead to the same outcome (Fiss 2011). For example, both public demand and political pressure might independently drive legislation under specific contexts. Second, the sample size (N = 31) is moderate, making fsQCA preferable to large-N regression methods that require stricter assumptions about linearity and independence. Third, fsQCA accommodates asymmetric causality, recognizing that the presence and absence of a condition (e.g., high vs. low political pressure) may have distinct effects on the outcome (Misangyi et al. 2017).

Despite its advantages, fsQCA is not without limitations. In addition to the challenges of establishing a well-defined set membership and determining appropriate fuzzy-set thresholds, there is an inherent risk of oversimplification. The subjectivity involved in setting these thresholds may also influence the configuration results, potentially affecting the robustness and generalizability of the findings. Acknowledging these limitations, this study has taken care to define and operationalize each condition in a manner that is both theoretically informed and empirically grounded, while remaining mindful of the methodological challenges posed by fsQCA.

Methods

This study primarily employs the fsQCA method to investigate the driving factors behind local legislation on environmental inspection. fsQCA is a case-oriented method that analyzes causal complexity from a configurational perspective, exploring combinations of multiple condition variables that lead to an outcome variable (Ragin et al. 2005). The fsQCA method posits that multiple combinations of conditions can lead to the same outcome (e.g., A × B + C × D = Y, where both A × B and C × D are sufficient combinations for the outcome Y). It also emphasizes that the effect of a single condition on the outcome is substitutable and asymmetric (e.g., if the combination of A and B leads to Y, it is possible for ~A, in combination with other conditions, to also produce Y).

To operationalize fsQCA, this study followed standardized procedures (Rihoux and Ragin 2009): First, continuous variables (e.g., per capita GDP) were transformed into fuzzy-set scores using direct calibration in fsQCA 3.0, with thresholds for full membership (0.95), the crossover point (0.50), and full non‐membership (0.05) determined through theoretical reasoning and case knowledge. We then conducted a necessity analysis to evaluate whether any single condition was necessary for the outcome (consistency > 0.90). Next, a truth table was constructed to define configurations and assess each configuration’s consistency (threshold = 0.80) and coverage. Boolean algebra was then applied to simplify the solution by eliminating redundant conditions, yielding the most streamlined configuration. Finally, the resulting solution was elucidated and interpreted in light of the study’s theoretical framework.

Data

Dependent variable: local environmental inspection legislation

Local legislation is a variable that is challenging to quantify. To ensure objectivity in this study, we adopt a binary approach by measuring whether a provincial-level administrative region has enacted relevant local legislation on environmental inspection, while avoiding subjective evaluations of legislative content.

Based on this standard, three questions are posed to assign values to local environmental inspection legislation across provincial-level regions: First, has the provincial-level region enacted internal Party regulations on environmental inspection? (If yes, the value is 0.5; if no, the value is 0.) Second, has the region incorporated environmental inspection into comprehensive environmental legislation? (If yes, the value is 1; if no, the value is 0.) Third, has the region incorporated environmental inspection into specific environmental legislation? (If yes, the value is 1; if no, the value is 0.)

It should be noted that provincial-level Party regulations do not strictly qualify as local legislation enacted by provincial legislative bodies, such as the provincial people’s congress or its standing committee. However, given that Party regulations constitute an important institutional source for environmental inspection, excluding them would omit critical information. Therefore, this study extends the scope of local environmental inspection legislation to include Party regulations. To distinguish between Party regulations and formal local legislation, the former is assigned a value of 0.5, while the latter is assigned a value of 1.

The analysis reveals eight possible scenarios for provincial-level environmental inspection legislation: “no legislation”, “Party regulations only”, “comprehensive environmental legislation only”, “specific environmental legislation only”, “Party regulations + comprehensive legislation”, “Party regulations + specific legislation”, “comprehensive legislation + specific legislation”, and “Party regulations + comprehensive legislation + specific legislation”. Following the coding rules, these eight scenarios are assigned six distinct values ranging from low to high (see Table 2 for details).

Independent variables

Political pressure from the central government

This study measures the political pressure exerted by the central government on provincial-level administrative regions through the number of environmental damage accountability cases transferred by the Central Environmental Inspection Teams. Environmental damage accountability cases refer to investigations and determinations of behaviors that violate environmental protection laws, regulations, or policies, or failures to fulfill environmental protection duties, resulting in environmental damage. These cases primarily hold government departments and their officials accountable.

As a result, environmental damage accountability cases heighten local governments’ attention to environmental inspection efforts, thereby accelerating the process of local environmental inspection legislation. Accordingly, this study collects data on the number of environmental damage accountability cases transferred to each provincial-level administrative region during the first round of Central Environmental Inspections and uses it as a conditional variable representing pressure from higher authorities.

Notably, this study exclusively utilizes data from the first round of Central Environmental Inspections due to the following two reasons: First, compared to other indicators, the environmental damage accountability cases transferred by the central government to local authorities during inspections offer a more direct measure of the political pressure exerted on local governments. For instance, while other environmental inspection-related metrics—such as the post-inspection accountability of local cadres—are available, the number of officials held accountable is determined by local authorities based on their independent investigations of potential legal violations. As a result, these figures do not directly capture the extent of political pressure imposed by the central government. Second, official disclosures on the website of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment indicate that only the first round provides complete and publicly accessible records of transferred accountability cases across all 31 provincial-level regions. In contrast, for the second round, accountability case statistics for 12 provinces remain undisclosedFootnote 12, and for the ongoing third round (since 2023), no provincial-level data have yet been released. This limitation necessitates reliance on first-round data to ensure methodological consistency and comparability.

The legislative stock for supervising administrative enforcement

As analyzed in Section “Legislators: local people’s congresses and their standing committees”, drawing on the approach of Fankhauser et al. (2015), this study uses the stock of administrative law enforcement supervision legislation in each region to represent the stance of local legislators on environmental inspection legislation. To achieve this, I collected all provincial-level legislations for administrative enforcement supervision enacted by the people’s congresses or their standing committees across China’s 31 provincial-level administrative regions.

Based on this dataset, I categorized and synthesized the legislative landscape of each region, and six distinct models of administrative enforcement supervision legislation were identified across provincial-level administrative regions. The various legislative models and their assigned values in this study are as follows: no local legislation or government regulations (0); only non-specialized local legislation (0.2)Footnote 13; only specialized local government regulations (0.4)Footnote 14; both non-specialized local legislation and specialized local government regulations (0.6)Footnote 15; only specialized local legislation (0.8)Footnote 16; and both specialized local legislation and specialized local government regulations (1)Footnote 17.

The share of the secondary sector

This study employs the share of the secondary industry as an indicator to represent industrial enterprises—key stakeholders in local environmental inspection legislation. This choice is based on three main considerations.

First, industrial pollution remains the primary source of environmental degradation in China (Shi et al. 2017), and empirical studies have shown that, controlling for other factors, regions with a higher secondary industry share tend to experience more severe pollution (Luo et al. 2018). Given this, industrial enterprises are among the market actors most directly affected by environmental legislation (Peng et al. 2018), which suggests they have a strong incentive to actively engage in and influence the legislative process.

Second, in this study, the secondary industry share is not used as a measure of regional environmental pollution but rather as an indicator of the bargaining power of industrial enterprises in environmental legislation. Generally, larger enterprises have stronger bargaining power in negotiations with the government (Egger et al. 2020). In the context of environmental regulation, industries that constitute a larger portion of a region’s economy, especially those in the secondary sector, typically exert greater influence over local environmental policies. This influence stems from their critical role in sustaining local economic stability and employment (Decker 2006).

Third, in existing literature, the share of the secondary industry is explicitly used as a key variable in both the theoretical framework and empirical analysis to examine its role in shaping the relationship between environmental tax legislation and air pollution reduction (Tang and Yang 2023).

Considering industrial enterprises’ motivation to engage in local environmental inspection legislation, the effectiveness of the secondary industry share in capturing their bargaining power, and its established use in existing environmental legislative research, this study argues that employing the secondary industry share as an indicator to analyze the role of industrial enterprises in local environmental inspection legislation is an appropriate approach.

Notably, as analyzed in the “Market entities: industrial enterprises” section, industrial enterprises may exhibit divergent attitudes toward environmental inspection legislation depending on the specific regulatory context—they may either oppose or support such legislation. The proportion of the secondary industry reflects the intensity of either support or opposition rather than a unidirectional stance. To capture this dimension, I compiled data on the proportion of the secondary industry from the China Statistical Yearbook (2018–2023) for China’s 31 provincial-level administrative divisions. The six-year average for each region was calculated as an indicator of its industrial structure.

Resource allocation for environmental enforcement

Drawing on the approach of Blundell et al. (2021), this study uses public fiscal expenditures on energy conservation and environmental protection to represent enforcement resources across provincial-level regions. Such expenditures provide financial support for environmental enforcement personnel, including equipment, salaries, and training, as well as funding for routine and specialized enforcement actions (Ercolano and Romano 2018). Similarly, the implementation of provincial-level environmental inspection systems also relies on these financial resources. Compared to general public fiscal expenditures, expenditures specifically allocated to energy conservation and environmental protection more directly reflect a region’s investment in enforcement resources.

I compiled data on public fiscal expenditures on energy conservation and environmental protection for China’s 31 provincial-level administrative regions from the China Statistical Yearbook (2018–2023). The six-year average for each region was calculated as an indicator of its enforcement resources.

Public demand for environmental quality

Following extant literature, this study employs per capita GDP at the provincial level as a proxy for public environmental demand (Ahmad et al. 2021; Pata 2018). The underlying rationale is that as per capita GDP increases, individuals’ basic material needs are increasingly satisfied. Drawing on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (Maslow 1943), once these lower-level physiological and safety needs are met, attention tends to shift toward higher-level aspirations, including the desire for improved environmental quality (Ahmad et al. 2021; Verbič et al. 2021). Consequently, higher per capita GDP is generally associated with a stronger public demand for environmental sustainability.

I acknowledge, however, that per capita GDP alone may not fully capture the complexities of public environmental demand, particularly in regions with varying levels of environmental awareness, divergent policy frameworks, and distinct socio-political contexts. While measures such as the frequency of public environmental complaints might offer a more direct reflection of public environmental concerns, my ability to utilize such indicators was limited. Specifically, according to the China Environment Yearbook (2018–2023), comprehensive data on public environmental complaints for the years 2017 and 2019 across provincial-level regions are unavailable.

Despite these limitations, per capita GDP remains a practical and consistent proxy within the scope of our analysis, providing a valuable comparative metric across China’s provinces.

Drawing on data from the China Statistical Yearbook (2018–2023), this study extracted per capita GDP figures for China’s 31 provincial-level administrative regions spanning 2017 to 2022. The six-year average per capita GDP for each region was then computed and employed as a proxy indicator for public environmental demand.

Table 3 summarizes the operational definitions, data sources, and calibration methods for each condition variable. Except for X2 (The Legislative Stock for Supervising Administrative Enforcement), which is directly assigned based on legislative model classification, all other variables are calibrated using the direct calibration method based on theoretical thresholds or percentile ranks (Ragin 2000). The specific calibration logic is detailed in the table.

Based on the established criteria for assigning and calibrating values for the outcome and condition variables, the 31 selected cases in this study were evaluated, yielding the results presented in Table 4.

Necessity analysis of condition variables

The necessity analysis of condition variables aims to determine whether these variables are essential factors influencing the outcome. The preliminary criterion for identifying a necessary condition is that the necessary consistency score should exceed 0.9. After running calculations with the fsQCA 3.0 software, the output results for the consistency and coverage of the condition variables related to local environmental inspection legislation are presented in Table 4.

From the consistency results shown in Table 5, it is evident that the consistency scores for each individual variable fall below 0.9. This indicates that none of the condition variables are necessary conditions for the outcome variable; in other words, each individual condition variable can be substituted for others in the context of producing the outcome. Given this situation, it is essential to employ configurational analysis to explore which combinations of factors provide a sufficient explanation for local environmental inspection legislation.

Configurational analysis of conditions

Configurational analysis of high-level local environmental inspection legislation

After conducting the consistency test, it is necessary to perform a configurational analysis of the constructed truth table. First, the case frequency for the configurations should be set according to the sample size. Generally, the selected case frequency should retain at least 75% of the observed cases. Based on this criterion, this study sets the case frequency to 1. Next, the consistency threshold is established. Following research conventions, the threshold is set at the default value of 0.8 in fsQCA 3.0 (Ragin et al. 2005). Condition configurations with consistency below 0.8 are recorded as 0, while those above 0.8 are recorded as 1. Through configurational analysis, three types of solutions can be obtained: parsimonious solutions, complex solutions, and intermediate solutions. This study follows Ragin’s (2014) recommendation and adopts an intermediate solution for explanation. The results of the model analysis are presented in Table 6.

Analyzing Table 6 reveals that five distinct conditional configurations can lead to the achievement of high-level local legislation on environmental inspection. The model’s intermediate solution demonstrates robust explanatory power. On one hand, its consistency value of 0.877 indicates that 87.7% of the cases conforming to these configurations have successfully enacted high-level legislation; on the other hand, a coverage value of 0.624 shows that these five configurations account for 62.4% of the high-level legislative cases. Based on these configurations, we can further identify the corresponding roles of The Legislative Stock for Supervising Administrative Enforcement, Political Pressure from the Central Government, The Share of the Secondary Sector, Public Demand for Environmental Quality, and Resource Allocation for Environmental Enforcement in advancing local environmental inspection legislation. The following discussion elaborates on these relationships:

Pathway 1—3: Industry-Driven Legislation under Low Central Pressure

Pathway 1 indicates that when a region possesses a high legislative stock and strong public demand for environmental quality, it can still achieve a high level of local environmental inspection legislation even in the context of a high share of the secondary sector and low political pressure from the central government. This pathway has an initial coverage of 0.352, meaning that it accounts for 35.2% of cases exhibiting high-level environmental inspection legislation, with 2.2% of cases being exclusively explained by this pathway.

Pathway 2 shows that when a region has a high legislative stock coupled with abundant enforcement resources, it can also realize high-level local environmental inspection legislation despite a high secondary sector share and low central political pressure. This pathway explains 38.2% of cases, of which 2.4% are solely attributable to it.

Pathway 3 demonstrates that when a region features high public environmental demand together with substantial enforcement resources, it can achieve high-level local environmental inspection legislation even with a high share of the secondary sector and low central political pressure. This pathway explains 29.4% of cases, with 2.7% exclusively explained by this configuration.

At the level of provincial administrative divisions, these three pathways show some overlap, as all include Zhejiang ProvinceFootnote 18. The three pathways share a common feature: low central political pressure combined with a high proportion of secondary industry. This observation is consistent with the study’s theoretical assumptions. In contexts where local governments face minimal central oversight, industrial enterprises are less likely to view environmental inspection legislation as a threat; rather, such legislation operates as a regulatory framework that standardizes supervision and safeguards their legitimate rights. Across all pathways, low central political pressure and a dominant secondary industry emerge as pivotal factors—a combination we term the “Industry-Driven Model under Low Central Pressure”. Nonetheless, distinctions remain among the pathways. Path 1 is marked by a high legislative stock alongside strong public demand for environmental quality; Path 2 features a high legislative stock paired with abundant enforcement resources; and Path 3 exhibits strong public environmental demand and substantial enforcement resources. These findings suggest that in provincial administrative divisions characterized by low central political pressure and a dominant secondary sector, these conditions are functionally equivalent in fostering robust local environmental inspection legislation.

To provide a more concrete and intuitive illustration of Industry-Driven Legislation under Low Central Pressure, the following content will take Jiangsu Province as an example:

First, political pressure in the region has remained relatively low. During the second round of central environmental inspection conducted by the Second Central Environmental Protection Inspection Team from March 25 to April 25, 2022, only three environmental damage accountability issues were transferred to Jiangsu Province for investigationFootnote 19. This figure is notably lower compared to economically developed regions such as Guangdong Province and Shandong Province, which received five accountability cases each. Besides, according to statistics compiled by the author, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has publicly reported 227 cases of insufficient local rectification following environmental inspections. Among these, Jiangsu Province accounted for only 5 cases, representing a mere 2.2% of the total. This indicates that Jiangsu has faced relatively limited political pressure during the implementation of central environmental inspection.

Second, in terms of economic structure, from 2017 to 2023, the secondary industry’s share of GDP in Jiangsu Province remained stable between 43% and 46%, significantly higher than the national average of approximately 39%. This reflects a strong industrial base and high reliance on secondary industry.

Third, regarding public demand, according to the 2019 China Environmental Yearbook, Jiangsu Province handled 88,775 environmental complaints in 2018, far exceeding the national average of 22,907 cases. This figure ranked first nationwide, accounting for 12.5% of the total complaints across all provinces, highlighting strong public demand for improved environmental quality.

Fourth, in terms of enforcement resources, from 2017 to 2022, Jiangsu Province’s average public fiscal expenditure on environmental protection and energy conservation reached 3.226 million RMB, ranking third nationwide. This substantial investment demonstrates robust environmental enforcement capacity.

Under the aforementioned conditions, Jiangsu Province promulgated the Jiangsu Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Regulation in 2022, which explicitly grants the provincial government the authority to supervise and inspect the soil pollution prevention performance of municipal governmentsFootnote 20. In 2024, Jiangsu Province promulgated the Jiangsu Environmental Protection Regulation, which provides a more comprehensive framework for provincial-level environmental inspection, including inspection formats, utilization of results, and rectification processesFootnote 21.

It is particularly noteworthy that the Jiangsu Environmental Protection Regulation explicitly stipulates that inspection authorities must publicly disclose inspection results and that inspected entities must disclose their rectification progress to the public. This legislative provision directly addresses public environmental demands and ensures citizens’ right to know. For a long time, the public’s right to information regarding local governments’ environmental inspection rectification efforts has lacked legal guarantees. The primary reason lies in the nature of the documents produced during inspections, which are often joint party-government documents. Such documents do not fall under the purview of the Regulations on Open Government Information, making it difficult for the public to access them through formal information disclosure requests.

For example, in the case of Yingkou Haigong Fuel Petrochemical Co., Ltd. v. Dashiqiao City People’s Government on Information Disclosure, the Dashiqiao City government conducted a “Special Rectification of Oil Storage and Transport Enterprises” as part of an inspection rectification initiative. The plaintiff, Yingkou Haigong Fuel Petrochemical Co., Ltd., was ordered to suspend operations due to insufficient regulatory compliance. Consequently, the plaintiff requested the disclosure of the “Detailed Measures and Responsibility List for the Special Rectification of Oil Storage and Transport Enterprises” from the Dashiqiao City government. Upon review, the court held that the document in question was jointly issued by the Dashiqiao Municipal Party Committee and the Dashiqiao Municipal Government, thereby classifying it as a party-government joint document. According to the Regulations on the Disclosure of Party Affairs, such documents do not fall within the scope of the Regulations on Open Government Information. As a result, the court rejected the plaintiff’s claimFootnote 22. This indicates that in the absence of explicit provisions in laws or administrative regulations, the specification of information disclosure obligations for relevant parties regarding the implementation of environmental inspection and subsequent rectification in local regulations can provide tangible legal guarantees for the public’s right to be informed about these inspections.

Pathway 4: Institutional Inertia-Driven Legislation

Path 4 demonstrates that when a region exhibits a high legislative stock alongside a low share of the secondary sector, it can still achieve high-level local environmental inspection legislation even under conditions of low central political pressure, limited public environmental demand, and scarce enforcement resources. This pathway explains 36.2% of the cases, with 11.4% of the cases being exclusively attributable to it. Unlike Paths 1, 2, and 3—which feature a high share of the secondary sector and other high-intensity factors—Path 4 is primarily driven by the existing legislative stock for enforcement supervision, rather than by high central political pressure, strong public demand, or abundant enforcement resources. Regions that conform to Path 4 include Gansu, Yunnan, and Tibet.

In these regions, environmental protection is a central pillar of governmental priorities. For example, environmental initiatives in Gansu are regarded as a key component in “strengthening the ecological security barrier in western China” as emphasized by President Xi Jinping during his visit to Gansu in September 2024Footnote 23. Yunnan is charged with the important mission of “strengthening the ecological security barrier in southwest China”Footnote 24. Tibet, meanwhile, is considered “an important national ecological security barrier occupying a key position in China’s ecological security framework”, with environmental supervision recognized as a critical means to bolster this barrierFootnote 25. Thus, given the paramount importance of environmental protection in these three western regions, coupled with institutional inertia, Gansu, Yunnan, and Tibet have been notably proactive in formulating local environmental supervision legislation. Consequently, this study categorizes Path 4 as an “institutional inertia-driven” model.

Taking Yunnan Province as an example, the political pressure it faces is relatively low, similar to Jiangsu Province, under the framework of central environmental inspection. During the central government’s “review” of previous inspections, Yunnan Province accounted for only two typical cases, below the national average of 2.76 cases per provincial-level region.

However, unlike Jiangsu Province, Yunnan’s economic development is less dependent on industrial activities, with the secondary industry accounting for only about 35% of its GDP. Regarding public demand, Yunnan handled 6,578 environmental complaints in 2018, significantly lower than the national average of 22,907 cases and accounting for only 0.93% of the total complaints nationwide. In terms of enforcement resources, Yunnan’s average public expenditure on environmental protection from 2017 to 2022 was 16.69 million yuan, below the national average of 18.59 million yuan.

Nevertheless, Yunnan Province has undertaken “high-level” local legislation on environmental inspection. Not only has Yunnan issued dedicated provincial-level Party regulations on inspections—such as the Measures for the Implementation of Environmental Inspection in Yunnan Province (promulgated in 2020)—but it has also integrated inspection mechanisms into comprehensive environmental protection legislation. For instance, Article 24 of the Regulations on Environmental Protection in Yunnan Province (promulgated in 2024) states: “A sound environmental inspection system shall be established and improved to supervise and inspect the implementation of environmental protection in accordance with relevant national and provincial regulations”.

Moreover, Yunnan has incorporated environmental inspection mechanisms into sector-specific environmental laws. Article 9 of the Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution by Solid Waste in Yunnan Province (promulgated in 2022) stipulates: “The provincial government shall include the prevention and control of environmental pollution by solid waste in the provincial environmental inspection framework, inspecting the fulfillment of related responsibilities by relevant departments and subordinate governments”.

In terms of the function of local legislation on environmental inspection, rather than alleviating industrial structural pressures or improving environmental quality, institutional inertia-driven legislation primarily serves to establish the environmental inspection system. Consequently, the content of such legislation is largely declaratory, focusing on the formalization of the inspection framework while lacking detailed procedural provisions. Scholars often refer to this approach as “institutional empowerment” (McElwee 2010). For example, Yunnan Province has incorporated environmental inspection systems into nine pieces of local legislation—the highest number among all provincial-level regions in China. These laws uniformly proclaim the establishment of a provincial-level inspection system without offering detailed provisions for its operation. For instance, Article 24 of the Regulations on Environmental Protection in Yunnan Province (promulgated in 2024) states: “A sound environmental inspection system shall be established and improved to supervise and inspect the implementation of environmental protection in accordance with relevant national and provincial regulations”. Similarly, Article 9 of the Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution by Solid Waste in Yunnan Province (promulgated in 2022) stipulates: “The provincial government shall include the prevention and control of environmental pollution by solid waste in the provincial environmental inspection framework, inspecting the fulfillment of related responsibilities by relevant departments and subordinate governments”.

Pathway 4 represents a model of local legislation on environmental inspection driven by the core impetus of a high legislative stock for supervising administrative enforcement. This pathway demonstrates that even in the absence of significant political pressure, strong public demand, or ample enforcement resources, regions with relatively low dependence on secondary industries and a strong emphasis on legislative oversight and environmental protection can actively advance local legislation on environmental inspections.

Pathway 5: Political Pressure-Driven Legislation

Path 5 demonstrates that when a region is characterized by a high legislative stock, high central political pressure, a low share of the secondary industry, and high public demand for environmental quality, even limited enforcement resources do not preclude the achievement of high-level local environmental inspection legislation. This pathway accounts for 25.6% of the cases, with 6.3% being exclusively attributable to this configuration. Liaoning Province is a prototypical example of Pathway 5:

First, in terms of political pressure, the Central Third Environmental Inspection Team conducted an inspection in Liaoning Province from April 25 to May 25, 2017, identifying 14 cases of accountability for ecological and environmental damage, a notably high number.

Second, regarding economic structure, the secondary industry in Liaoning accounted for approximately 38% of GDP from 2017 to 2022, lower than Jiangsu Province but slightly higher than Yunnan Province.

Third, in terms of public demand, Liaoning received 45,297 environmental complaints in 2018, significantly higher than the national average of 22,907 cases, accounting for 6.4% of the total—among the highest nationwide.

Fourth, as for enforcement resources, Liaoning’s average public expenditure on environmental protection from 2017 to 2022 was only 9.73 million yuan, far below the national average of 18.59 million yuan.

Following the first round of central environmental inspection, Liaoning introduced the Provisional Guidelines for Handling Matters Assigned by Environmental Inspection in Liaoning Province in 2019. In 2022, during the amendment of the Regulations on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Liaoning Province, the environmental inspection system was formally incorporated. Article 25 of the amended regulations states:

“The provincial government shall establish and improve an air environment protection inspection system, ensure regular inspections, strengthen accountability, and promptly disclose inspection results.

For major air environment violations or significant air pollution issues that are inadequately addressed or provoke strong public concerns, the provincial environmental department shall prioritize supervision in accordance with relevant regulations and publicly disclose the supervision results.”

In terms of legislative content, under the dual influence of political pressure and strong public demand, the Regulations on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Liaoning Province emphasize both the effectiveness of inspection and rectification and the transparency of inspection processes. Specifically, Clause 2 of Article 25 underscores the importance of disclosing key supervision results to the public, aiming to enhance accountability and social oversight.

Pathway 5 represents a model of local legislation on environmental inspection driven primarily by political pressure. This pathway illustrates that under conditions of significant political pressure and strong public demand, regions may actively promote such legislation despite limited enforcement resources.

Regions following this model typically exhibit levels of economic development and dependence on secondary industries that fall between those observed in Pathways 3 and 4. Without political pressure from the central government, even strong public demand alone would not suffice to motivate these regions to enact local inspection legislation, as their lack of sufficient enforcement resources would undermine their ability to do so effectively.

Configurational analysis of low-level local environmental inspection legislation

Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) emphasizes the asymmetry of causal relationships. Therefore, this study further examines the specific configurational conditions that lead to low-level environmental inspection legislation. The intermediate solution is presented in Table 7. The results indicate that a provincial administrative region tends to exhibit low-level environmental inspection legislation under two distinct conditions. The overall consistency of these two pathways is 0.866, meaning that 86.6% of the cases conforming to these configurations exhibit low-level environmental inspection legislation. The overall coverage is 0.512, suggesting that these two configurations collectively explain 51.2% of the cases characterized by low-level environmental inspection legislation. The detailed interpretations are as follows:

Pathway 1 indicates that when a region has a low legislative stock for enforcement supervision, low central political pressure, low public demand for environmental quality, and limited enforcement resources, it is likely to exhibit low-level environmental inspection legislation. This pathway has a raw coverage of 34.1%, meaning it accounts for 34.1% of the cases with low-level legislation. Representative regions following this pattern include Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Guizhou Province, and Hainan Province. These results corroborate the high-level environmental inspection legislation model—termed “Industry-Driven Legislation under Low Central Pressure”—by showing that even in areas with a high share of secondary industry and low central political pressure, robust legislation emerges only when at least two of the following conditions are met: high legislative stock, strong public demand for environmental quality, and abundant enforcement resources. Failure to satisfy these conditions invariably results in low-level legislation, underscoring that an industry-driven approach requires supportive external factors.

Pathway 2 reveals that even if a region has a low share of the secondary sector, high public demand for environmental quality, and abundant enforcement resources, its environmental inspection legislation remains weak if the legislative stock for enforcement supervision is low. This pathway explains 28.8% of the cases characterized by low-level legislation, with representative regions including Beijing, Shanghai, and Hunan Province. The analysis further suggests that in regions with both low legislative stock and low secondary sector share, central political pressure exerts minimal influence on legislative outcomes. In conjunction with the Political Pressure-Driven Legislation model for high-level legislation, these findings indicate that high central political pressure can effectively promote robust legislation only when accompanied by a high legislative stock.

Notably, both pathways highlight a common constraint—low legislative stock for enforcement supervision—which appears to be a critical bottleneck in advancing environmental inspection legislation in these regions. This empirical finding diverges from some existing research. Generally, when a significant body of legislation already exists, the likelihood of enacting new laws tends to decrease (Fankhauser et al. 2015). However, this study demonstrates that a high legislative stock facilitates a higher degree of local environmental inspection legislation, while a low legislative stock tends to result in less comprehensive local legislation in this area. This finding partially validates the theoretical hypothesis proposed in Section “Legislators: local people’s congresses and their standing committees”, suggesting that local legislators do not approach environmental inspection legislation purely from a functional perspective; they may also be motivated by a desire to “keep pace with national policy trends” or to “outperform other regions”.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-025-05127-w/MediaObjects/41599_2025_5127_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-06-06 17:14:17.528588

Now there may be some pushback from Washington on what is being discussed and debated in Albany.

Republican U.S. Rep. Nick Langworthy, who represents portions of Western New York in the 23rd District, announced Thursday the bipartisan Energy Choice Act in the U.S. House and Senate to stop state and local governments from trying to ban utility service hookups with any connection, reconnection, modification or expansion.

Langworthy was unavailable for an interview but in a press release stated in part, ""I’ve introduced the Energy Choice Act — to slam the brakes on these reckless, ideological mandates and restore sanity to America’s energy policy. People deserve the freedom to choose energy that is affordable, reliable, and proven — not be forced into rolling blackouts to please eco-activists who don’t live in the real world.""

It is an obvious shot across the bow at the New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act passed in 2019 which calls for the eventual elimination of fossil fuels as an energy and heating source in favor of total electrification. That would involve the use of electric heat pumps and other such appliances for homes with specific future dates required as goals for such a transition.

A 2024 New York State Comptroller's Office Audit did raise some serious questions about costs and implementation of CLCPA

Also now there is state legislature discussion of the related New York HEAT or Home Energy Affordable Transition Act reintroduced by Democratic State Senator Liz Krueger of Manhattan.

Here are portions of the measure:

Minimize the need for new gas infrastructure investments by redirecting ratepayer funds to alternatives including electrification, thermal energy networks, targeted energy efficiency, demand response, and market

transformation measures.

Facilitate a planned, neighborhood-scale transition away from fossil fuels, avoiding stranded gas infrastructure costs and supporting coordinated investments that reduce emissions, increase affordability, and create good-paying jobs, while covering transition costs of customers moving to non-gas alternatives.

Ensure equitable access to affordable, clean energy for heating, cooling, and other building needs, protecting customers from undue burdens during the transition.

The NY HEAT Act does not impose a ban on the use of gas. Rather, it supports a gradual, long-term, and carefully planned transition for existing gas customers to cleaner alternatives, ensuring affordability, reliability, and equity throughout the process.""

While not specifically stating it would ban natural gas some are concerned it could have the affect of eventually putting natural gas utilities out of business by encouraging reduced customer base and revenue.

Concerns have been raised about the Christmas Weekend Blizzard of December 2022 in which power was lost and there were 47 deaths. Most of the victims were determined to be elderly residents including many on Buffalo's East Side who did not have heat in their homes. Other residents say they depended on heat from still functioning gas stoves to provide some warmth even though that practice can also be dangerous.

Also, natural gas is used to power standby generators for homes.

The HEAT Act has been passed by the Democratic controlled State Senate.

And now HEAT Act supporters like a group of leaders from Buffalo's East Side hope to see it passed by the State Assembly with other provisions.

PUSH Buffalo Executive Director Dawn Wells-Clyburn told reporters: ""The New York Heat Act would provide the state the tools to guarantee affordable energy bills for low and moderate income households by capping energy costs at 6 percent.""

But that same HEAT Act has builders of new homes very concerned.

Essex Homes President & CEO Phil Nanula who also leads the Buffalo Niagara Homebuilders Association says: ""It's been difficult to get anyone to really listen to any logic on the problems that this poses to us as builders. It was gonna create about a $20,000 dollar increase in the cost to build a home. And we just don't understand how that could be absorbed by the home buyer when interest rates are up.""

State Senator Krueger's office later released this statement regarding the proposed Energy Choice Act for Congress: ""Talk about a poorly thought-out bill with unlimited unintended consequences. This would essentially upend all energy regulations, building codes, zoning, fire codes, health and safety rules, you name it. It would create absolute chaos — which seems to be the point of Donald Trump's presidency — and do nothing for people struggling to pay their bills. Let's call this what it is: a BAN on state sovereignty, that takes away our right to self-govern and makes us wards of the federal government.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A Japanese company has halted construction on a $1.6 billion factory in South Carolina to help make batteries for electric BMWs, citing “policy and market uncertainty.”

While Automotive Energy Supply Corp. didn’t specify what those problems are, South Carolina’s Republican governor said the company is dealing with the potential loss of federal tax breaks for electric vehicle buyers and incentives for EV businesses as well as tariff uncertainties from President Donald Trump’s administration.

“What we’re doing is urging caution — let things play out because all of the these changes are taking place,” Gov. Henry McMaster said.

AESC announced the suspension in construction of its plant in Florence on Thursday.

“Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” the company’s statement said.

AESC promised to restart construction, although it didn’t say when, and vowed to meet its commitment to hire 1,600 workers and invest $1.6 billion. The company said it has already invested $1 billion in the Florence plant.

The battery maker based in Japan also has facilities in China, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. In the U.S., AESC has a plant in Tennessee and is building one in Kentucky. The statement didn’t mention any changes with other plants.

The South Carolina plant is supposed to sell battery cells to BMW, which is building its own battery assembly site near its giant auto plant in Greer. BMW said the construction pause by AESC doesn’t change its plans to open its plant in 2026.

AESC has already rolled back its South Carolina plans. They announced a second factory on the Florence site, but then said earlier this year that their first plant should be able to handle BMW’s demand. That prompted South Carolina officials to withdraw $111 million in help they planned to provide.

The company is still getting $135 million in grants from the South Carolina Department of Commerce and $121 million in bonds and the agency said a construction pause won’t prompt them to claw back that offer.

But clean energy investment follows a different path, a far more aggressively positive trend: The curve is up and to the right.

But analysts have previously issued overly cautious clean energy investment forecasts.
Clean energy technologies are cheaper by the year, which makes them more accessible.","The world is set to invest nearly twice as much in clean energy as fossil fuels this year, according to a new International Energy Agency report.

While fossil fuel outlays are still significant — about $1.15 trillion this year — they’ll be dwarfed by clean energy, which is expected to receive $2.15 trillion in 2025.

But the real takeaway is that the energy transition doesn’t show signs of slowing.

Plotting the two investment trends is revealing. Over the last decade, fossil fuel investment has been relatively steady, if declining slightly. There has been an uptick since a drop that coincided with the pandemic, but even that shows signs of softening this year.

But clean energy investment follows a different path, a far more aggressively positive trend: The curve is up and to the right.

For data nerds: A second-order polynomial fit to the fossil fuel investment does a reasonable job of explaining the variance (R2 = 0.74), suggesting the world might be extracting a bit more oil, coal, and gas in the near future. But the same type of equation applied to clean energy figures fits the data far better (R2 = 0.94). Unless the world takes a U-turn — something that hasn’t happened in the 10 years the IEA has collected this data, pandemic included — expect bigger clean energy numbers next year.

The big question is whether it’ll be too little, too late.

To hit net zero by 2050, the world has to invest an average of $4.5 trillion annually, according to a report from the World Economic Foundation. That’s double this year’s investment, which sounds like a lot. But analysts have previously issued overly cautious clean energy investment forecasts. The trend in the new IEA data suggests that the goal is within reach.

Clean energy’s exponential growth won’t last forever; the trend is likely to taper off in the coming years, just like it did in the mid-2010s. But as I’ve written before, these sorts of fits and starts are not unusual, and adoption of new technologies is never continuous. Instead, it’s influenced by global economic trends and the learning curve that companies face when incorporating them into their businesses.

Ultimately, by 2050, I suspect average annual investment will probably meet or exceed the $4.5 trillion annual rate that the World Economic Forum calls for. Clean energy technologies are cheaper by the year, which makes them more accessible. Indeed, 85% of electricity demand growth in the next two years is going to come from developing and emerging economies, and while cheap coal has driven the narrative in many of those, solar and wind shouldn’t be counted out.

The wildcard, of course, is data centers. In the U.S., at least, utilities are confronting demand forecasts with enormous error bars. Those forecasts may fall short, but utilities tend to err on the side of caution, which means finding more power.

Some will turn to gas turbines, others will bet on nuclear. But in the next few years — and likely over the long term — renewables paired with energy storage will have the upper hand. They’re probable winners not just because they’re getting cheaper, but because they’re modular. They can be deployed at a range of scales and prices. It’s easy for them to be everywhere, and that’s something investors love to see.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1475927398.jpeg?resize=1200,674",N,,2025-06-06 14:16:51.884196

Evan Halper and Jake Spring report for The Washington Post.

In short:

The Trump administration used emergency authority to stop the closure of the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan, despite opposition from the plant’s utility, state regulators, and grid operators.

The decision aligns with a broader federal strategy to prioritize fossil fuel energy over renewables, justified by claims that wind and solar can't reliably meet future electricity demands, particularly with rising artificial intelligence-related energy use.

Critics say the policy will raise electricity costs and undermine local clean energy goals, while pushing outdated, polluting infrastructure into extended use without sufficient justification.

Key quote:

“It came as a surprise to everybody, and it was baffling why they chose this plant. Nobody asked for this order. The power grid operator did not. The utility that owns the plant did not. The state regulator did not.”

— Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission

Why this matters:

Coal plants are among the dirtiest sources of electricity, emitting high levels of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. These pollutants contribute to climate change and directly harm human health, increasing the risk of respiratory diseases, heart attacks, and premature death. The J.H. Campbell plant, specifically cited as the largest local source of greenhouse gases in western Michigan, was slated for retirement based on both environmental and economic grounds. Reversing its closure not only delays air quality improvements but signals a federal move to override state efforts to decarbonize. By targeting renewables with new hurdles and re-prioritizing fossil fuels, the administration is shifting national energy policy in ways that could stall climate progress and saddle communities with dirtier air and higher costs. This rollback also limits the authority of state and local agencies that have worked to craft cleaner, more affordable energy plans.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60498208/origin.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 14:17:26.539376

Sitting on as much as 2,100 acres of rural land in California’s Antelope Valley, this site will pump out around 22,000 tons of renewable hydrogen every year. The secret sauce? Clean solar energy driving electrolysis, all supported by industrial-scale batteries to keep everything running 24/7—no grid needed. The hydrogen is stored on-site in liquid form and will mostly be used for heavy-duty transport, public transit, and key industrial uses.

Why It’s a Big Deal: Climate Goals Meet Energy Independence

This isn’t just about checking boxes for California’s climate goals, which aim to slash emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. It’s also about building an energy system that can stand on its own. By staying off-grid, the facility adds a layer of energy resilience—a big plus in a state wrestling with grid overloads, wildfire threats, and power reliability issues.

A City Transforms: From Farming to Future Fuels

With a population of about 173,000, Lancaster already has a solid track record in renewables, attracting solar companies for more than ten years. This time around, the shift is even more dramatic—swapping out water-hungry farming for a low-impact, water-efficient hydrogen project. In fact, the new plant will use just 15–20% of the water that agriculture once did, easing the load on local water supplies and aquifers.

The Tech Behind the Transformation

Solar PV: Harvests solar energy to power the entire system.

Battery Storage: Keeps the juice flowing even when the sun isn’t.

Electrolyzers: Break down water into hydrogen and oxygen using solar electricity.

Liquid Hydrogen Storage: Keeps the hydrogen safely stored and ready for shipping.

Why It Matters Nationally: Jobs, Investment & Clean Energy

This isn’t just good news for Lancaster—it’s a potential blueprint for clean energy projects across the country. The site is expected to create plenty of construction and operational jobs, boost local suppliers, and act as a magnet for future investments in the broader hydrogen infrastructure. The push also aligns with national incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act, which supports projects that boost domestic clean energy production.

At first, most of the hydrogen produced at the facility will be used locally and across the region—think trucking fleets, transit buses, and port equipment. But with built-in scalability, the site has the potential to serve industrial decarbonization efforts far beyond California’s borders.

Real-World Impact: More Than Just Lower Emissions

Here’s what the project expects to deliver, according to the company estimates:

Over 200,000 tons of CO2 emissions avoided every year.

Cleaner air in a region that’s battled ozone pollution for years.

Less groundwater usage compared to traditional farming on the same land.

Of course, no transformation is without its challenges. As the area shifts from agriculture to clean energy, care will be needed to make sure former landowners and residents are part of the process and local zoning stays community-friendly.

The City of Lancaster is leading the charge on permits and environmental reviews, making sure everything aligns with both city requirements and California’s CEQA standards.

What’s Next?

Construction is expected to kick off in mid-2025, with full operations targeted for 2027. As the cost of electrolyzers and green hydrogen production continues to drop, this isn’t just a one-off—it could be the first of many large-scale projects that reshape the industrial energy landscape.

Led by seasoned clean energy pros, Element Resources is staking its claim at the intersection of technology, policy, and scale. If all goes as planned, Lancaster won’t just be part of the zero-emission technology movement—it’ll help lead it.

This was evident at CERAWeek 2025, held in Houston, Texas, against a backdrop of surging energy demand in the host country(link is external), in large part due to the rapid expansion of data centers as AI use grows.

The question now on the industry’s lips, according to attendee Bill Newsom, President and CEO of Mitsubishi Power Americas, is: “How do we meet the challenges of electricity demand growth and still chart an economically viable path to decarbonization?”

AI’s energy needs

Globally, over the next three years, electricity consumption will rise by an unprecedented 3,500 terawatt hours(link is external) (TWh), according to International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts. Alongside data centers, this growth is fueled by industrial production, the rising use of air conditioning and accelerating electrification.

In the US, which according to the World Resources Institute (WRI) “needs more electricity than ever(link is external)”, the demand spike could increase emissions, cost consumers more and make the grid less reliable if left unaddressed.

The challenge is compounded by policy shifts causing uncertainty around the energy transition and geopolitical tensions putting energy security firmly back on national agendas(link is external).

Utilities and energy providers are having to rethink how they deliver reliable power quickly and sustainably, Newsom says.

Nuclear energy to power AI

The industry is increasingly recognizing that meeting demand is a delicate balancing act between ensuring clean, secure and affordable energy. And there is no single solution, the WRI notes, but a “menu of options to choose from”.

At CERAWeek, two such options — nuclear and geothermal power — were the topic of multiple discussions(link is external), observed Takajiro Ishikawa, President & CEO at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America. “These are two areas we’ll see a lot of movement in 2025 and beyond as we look to meet the increasing energy demand from various sources,” he said in a blog post after the event.

On the conference sidelines, big tech firms Amazon, Google, Meta and others recognized the role of nuclear(link is external) for reliable power and energy security by signing a pledge to support the goal of at least tripling the world’s nuclear capacity by 2050.

But with data center demand projected to triple in the US(link is external) within the next three years, consuming 12% of the nation’s entire power supply, what happens in the short term?

Meeting global energy demand today

At a panel called ‘System Reliability: The Challenges of Risk and Demand’, delegates discussed gas-fired power generation as a near-term solution to meet demand. This would be through a mix of gas turbine combined cycle power plants (GTCC), which offer high generation efficiency while reducing CO2 emission by about 65% compared to traditional coal plants, and peaker plants to ensure grid reliability during peak periods.

Hydrogen blending and CO2 capture, utilization and storage, which can capture more than 90% of the CO2(link is external) from GTCC plants, were seen as promising routes to further decarbonization.

The future of the energy transition

While the conversation around the green transition may be evolving, MHI delegates came away from CERAWeek optimistic about the path ahead.

“Despite the current uncertainty, deep emission reduction as a long-term trend will continue,” says Mike Fowler, Vice President, Engineered Systems Division, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America, reflecting on his discussions at the event. “We’re still seeing high demand for clean energy, with several projects set to cross the finish line in the next few years and market dynamics creating new opportunities.”

For Newsom, creating more of these opportunities will require a careful combination of technology, economics and regulation working together. Cross-industry partnerships are already helping to achieve this, accelerating innovation and managing rising demand. And he suggests that reframing the issue could drive further advances.

“One term that I keep hearing is the ‘energy trilemma’ but I see it as an ‘energy trifecta’,” he says. “Every challenge is an opportunity, and we as an industry are inherently optimistic, always striving to advance in the best ways possible. Our goal is to lead the energy transition with innovative and reliable solutions.”",https://spectra.mhi.com/sites/g/files/jwhtju2216/files/styles/crop_freeform/public/Meeting-AI%E2%80%99s-energy-demand-with-clean%2C-secure-and-affordable-power.jpeg?itok=NoEgpRy2,N,,2025-06-06 15:11:56.409644

In short:

The House bill sets narrow windows for clean energy projects to start and finish in order to qualify for tax credits, with added restrictions on sourcing components from countries like China, Russia, and North Korea, raising major compliance challenges.

Analysts warn the rollback could drastically reduce renewable energy deployment, with a Princeton University analysis projecting a one billion metric ton rise in annual emissions and job losses potentially reaching 300,000 nationwide, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

Battery storage may be the hardest hit sector due to its dependence on foreign supply chains, with modeling by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions showing up to an 89% drop in deployment by 2035.

Key quote:

“Lost jobs in every single state are a recipe for disaster for American families, businesses, and the U.S. economy.”

— Abby Ross Hopper, Solar Energy Industries Association president and CEO

Why this matters:

Slashing tax credits for wind, solar, and battery projects could undermine years of growth in America’s clean energy sector. These incentives, expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act, have driven the rapid deployment of low-carbon technologies, supported hundreds of thousands of jobs, and made solar and wind competitive with fossil fuels. By tightening construction deadlines and introducing vague, geopolitically charged sourcing rules, the proposed legislation risks freezing many new projects in place. This is especially disruptive at a time when the U.S. grid faces rising demand and aging infrastructure. Penalizing projects for foreign components without clear alternatives in place could delay or derail vital capacity expansions. Meanwhile, electricity users could see rising costs, especially in states already strained by heat, wildfires, or power outages.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60501497/origin.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 13:09:59.185404

This bill is part of Gov. Josh Shapiro's ""Lightning Plan"" and aims to create jobs, reduce costs, and boost long-term energy stability by focusing on clean energy and sustainability, per Central Penn Business Journal.

As the world moves toward a cleaner economy, there are growing opportunities for investors to back companies that focus on renewable energy, clean tech, and sustainable practices. These industries are proving to be financially smart investments, often outperforming traditional fossil fuel stocks in long-term growth.

Pennsylvania is positioning itself to capitalize on this global shift, supporting sectors like semiconductor manufacturing, hydrogen hubs, and sustainable aviation fuel. The bill now heads to the state Senate for further approval.

State Rep. John Inglis, a key sponsor of the bill, highlighted the importance of acting now.

""With costs rising due to inflation, tariffs and a confluence of other factors, we're seeing companies across the country shy away from making long-term investments,"" he said, per CPBJ. ""This is a critical moment for us to assure businesses and energy producers that, despite looming economic uncertainty, Pennsylvania is leading the nation toward a cleaner and stronger energy future.""

Beyond the environmental benefits, the bill's people-first approach promises substantial economic rewards. By expanding tax credits and attracting investment in clean energy, the legislation could create thousands of new jobs and lower energy costs for consumers. This approach not only strengthens Pennsylvania's economy but also provides resilience in an unpredictable global market.

The long-term momentum of the clean economy remains strong. While there have been ups and downs, the shift to clean energy makes logical economic sense.

In fact, the EPA helped the health department’s air pollution control program with “devising ways to reduce the formation of ozone,” SCHD said.
Methane is a “key ingredient in ground-level ozone pollution,” according to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.
The petition cites five air monitors in the Memphis Metropolitan area “showing clear violations of the 2015 Ozone” standard.
The petition asks the health department to revise the plan to include measures to bring the Memphis Metropolitan area in compliance with national standards.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been asked to find that the Memphis Metropolitan area has failed to meet national air quality standards for ozone, in a petition filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center on Thursday.

A ruling of “non attainment” would “force the Shelby County Health Department and other health officials to finally take meaningful action to address smog problems in the area,” the SELC said in an email.

Local health officials would have to impose stricter standards on future air permits and require “polluters to invest in better emissions controls that can limit the amount of smog-forming pollution they could pump into the air,” SELC senior attorney Caroline Cress told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism in an email.

Ozone exposure can cause health effects that include coughing, difficulty breathing, increased susceptibility to lung infection, increased frequency of asthma attacks and can aggravate lung diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, according to the EPA.

“Some of these effects have been found even in healthy people, but effects can be more serious in people with lung diseases such as asthma,” the EPA states. “They may lead to increased school absences, medication use, visits to doctors and emergency rooms, and hospital admissions. Some studies in locations with elevated concentrations also report associations of ozone with deaths from respiratory causes.”

Memphis has been named an “Asthma Capital” by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, and Shelby County has received an “F” grade from the American Lung Association due to its ozone pollution for the past two years. The county leads Tennessee in emergency room visits for asthma.

LaTricea Adams, founder of Young, Gifted and Green, told MLK50 that these designations show “a long history of legacy air pollution, such as smog, that simply has not improved.”

“We are calling on EPA to protect our air and lungs, and the health department needs to do their job and enact permitting policies that better protect children and families from smog and other air pollution,” she said. “It’s a matter of life and death.”

The SCHD told MLK50 in a written statement that there are numerous ongoing ozone reduction projects in Shelby County, including replacing some of the county’s gas vehicles with electric vehicles and promoting bicycle commuting. In fact, the EPA helped the health department’s air pollution control program with “devising ways to reduce the formation of ozone,” SCHD said.

“SCHD has had meetings with various industries in Shelby County and has engaged air program managers from Mississippi and Arkansas in ongoing discussions to address regional ozone pollution,” the department said. “The entire Mid-South region would be impacted by non-attainment status.”

The petition was filed on behalf of Memphis Community Against Pollution, the Sierra Club and Young, Gifted and Green, three organizations that have been at the forefront of fights against industrial pollutants in Memphis, including most recently Elon Musk’s xAI.

xAI has been running unpermitted methane gas turbines and is currently in the process of seeking air permits for the permanent installation of 15 of the 35 turbines reported on site. The Tennessee Valley Authority is also planning to install six new methane gas-fired turbines at the Allen Plant in South Memphis. Methane is a “key ingredient in ground-level ozone pollution,” according to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.

According to the SELC’s calculations, the xAI facility in South Memphis is “likely the largest industrial emitter of (nitrogen oxides) in Memphis.” Nitrogen oxides are a main component in the formation of ozone.

The Memphis Metropolitan area includes nine counties in Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas, comprising about one million people, with the majority living in Shelby County.

The petition cites five air monitors in the Memphis Metropolitan area “showing clear violations of the 2015 Ozone” standard.

“And the problem is only getting worse with each passing year,” the petition states.

None of the monitors is located in South Memphis, the area that houses the first xAI facility and is known for having high industrial pollutants. The Shelby County Commission recently allocated $411,000 to the SCHD to establish an air monitoring station in South Memphis, but that remains a work in progress.

“The petition to the Environmental Protection Agency by the Southern Environmental Law Center is a flare into a dark abyss of corporate overreach that has sacrificed our health for far too long,” said KeShaun Pearson, head of MCAP. “Smog is known to complicate and contribute to respiratory illnesses and emergencies. The petition is an alarm-sounding because we are slowly being suffocated with poison by air pollution.”

The health department agreed to participate in a plan to address local ozone pollution alongside the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment in August 2023. However, a draft of the plan obtained by the SELC “​​contains no new control measures that will be effective in reducing ozone concentrations in the area,” the petition says.

The petition asks the health department to revise the plan to include measures to bring the Memphis Metropolitan area in compliance with national standards. In a written statement, the SCHD told MLK50 that it is working to update the Path Forward plan, which predates xAI’s arrival in Memphis.

“This petition is a last resort,” Cress said. “We’ve attempted to work with local health leaders, including SCHD, to get them to address local smog problems in the Memphis area, but they haven’t taken the necessary steps to fight smog pollution. …. Concerningly, local health officials recently missed an important deadline to submit a plan to reduce smog in the area. That’s why we’re asking federal officials to act.”

The Inflation Reduction Act has jump-started hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy and manufacturing development — and most of its benefits have gone to regions represented in Congress by Republicans.

But House Republicans still chose to pass a budget bill two weeks ago that would crush the bustling clean energy sector by rapidly phasing out incentives for making energy-efficient home improvements, buying EVs, and building solar, wind, and battery projects.

Now, it’s the Republican-controlled Senate’s turn to consider the bill. Early signs suggest that at least two GOP senators — John Curtis of Utah and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — are not on board with the aggressive cuts in the current version of the bill.

Tillis represents a purple state where clean manufacturing and solar project development has boomed in recent years, Canary Media’s Elizabeth Ouzts reported this week. He’s since said that he wants to revise the House’s cut to IRA production and investment tax credits, as well as a provision that bars companies with ties to China from accessing incentives. Tillis and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) also said that the Senate is unlikely to stand by the House’s provision that would require clean energy projects to start construction within 60 days of bill enactment or miss out on tax credits.

Curtis meanwhile authored a Deseret News op-ed on Wednesday diving into the consequences of a total IRA repeal. While he agrees that some IRA provisions included ​“frivolous spending,” he warned against treating ​“good policy ideas as guilty by political association.”

“The simple truth is this: many of these credits are Republican policies that we fought to protect,” Curtis wrote. ​“We must build a thoughtful, principled bill that doesn’t pull the rug out from under American innovators.”

Other Republican senators have expressed reservations too. Chuck Grassley, who represents wind turbine-dotted Iowa, suggested he’ll try to find compromise on extending support for wind power. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said he may look to change the House’s proposed 60-day deadline for accessing tax credits. North Dakota’s John Hoeven wants to preserve some incentives for geothermal; Shelley Moore Capito, from West Virginia, would like to keep hydrogen incentives alive.

We still have yet to hear from Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, who in April penned a letter alongside Sens. Curtis, Murkowski, and Tillis defending IRA tax credits.

These public statements in support of some aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act could be read as a signal that the House’s ​“backdoor repeal” of the landmark climate law will fail at the hands of the Senate. On the other hand, plenty of House Republicans spoke out before the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” passed, too. In fact, nearly two dozen signed a letter opposing IRA cuts in late March.

But come time to vote in May, not a single one of those signatories voted against the bill. It passed the House 215-214.

More big energy stories

Trump’s coal-boosting efforts don’t make sense

The Trump administration keeps trying to prop up fossil-fuel power plants. Experts and regulators say it’s an uneconomical and unwise mission.

President Donald Trump’s coal-boosting endeavors kicked off last month with a slate of executive orders that would let the U.S. Energy Department order power plants to stay open and would exempt some coal plants from air-pollution regulations. Among those facilities targeted for reinstatement is the Cholla coal plant in Arizona, which shut down in March, and which a state energy regulator warned would cost utility customers nearly $2 billion to reopen.

In recent weeks, the DOE has ordered a Michigan coal power plant and a Pennsylvania oil and gas facility to stay open just days before their planned retirements. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis examined the challenges of keeping the Michigan plant open, noting that its power prices were becoming increasingly uncompetitive and that its owner has already been working for years to replace its generation capacity with renewables and gas. And with coal companies laying off miners across Appalachia, keeping coal alive is only going to become more impractical.

Bad news/​good news for greener steel

A potential deal between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, backed by President Trump, would likely be bad news for efforts to clean up steelmaking. A week ago, Trump announced that Japan’s Nippon Steel was set to acquire U.S. Steel in a deal whose details are yet to be disclosed. Nippon has previously pledged to extend the life of U.S. Steel’s coal-burning furnaces, Alexander C. Kaufman reported for Canary Media this week, and to build a new electric arc furnace in the U.S. should the deal go through.

Meanwhile, Massachusetts-based Boston Metal is honing a greener steelmaking process of its own. The start-up is developing a technique that uses electricity to remove contaminants from iron ore, the company told Canary Media’s Sarah Shemkus. Refining iron ore is responsible for most of steelmaking’s emissions, but in Boston Metal’s process, the only greenhouse gas emissions created come from the electricity used to power it.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Rule required big polluters to say how much they are emitting

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama’s administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they’ve collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

“We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press’ analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to … document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that’s an inducement to lower emissions.

“It is money for those companies. It’s costs. It’s reputation. It’s been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country’s air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

“The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know” how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group’s community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state, including members of Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life, aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

A little-known provision of Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” would open thousands of acres of public lands at the edge of Minnesota’s Boundary Waters wilderness to a foreign-owned mining company.

The move amounts to a giveaway “in perpetuity” to a company that has lobbied in Washington for years, environmental campaigners say, potentially opening up one of the US’s most famous wilderness areas to water-pollution risks.

Earlier this month, conservationists cheered when Congress withdrew from the reconciliation bill several provisions that would have sold off hundreds of thousands of acres of federal land in Nevada and Utah. Those provisions had sparked fury among public land advocates and staunch opposition even from some Republicans, including the representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, who vowed to oppose the bill if the land sell-off provisions were retained.

Despite that fury, a lesser-known public lands giveaway remained in the reconciliation bill. If approved as currently written, the provision could lease in perpetuity land near Minnesota’s Boundary Waters wilderness, an enormous complex of pristine lakes and untrammeled forests, to Twin Metals Minnesota, a subsidiary of the Chilean mining giant Antofagasta PLC.

Becky Rom, the national chair of Save the Boundary Waters, a campaign to protect the wilderness area from mining, described the provision as “a giveaway of critical and sensitive federal public land forever to a single mining company”.

“It is a giveaway,” Rom added. “This is forever.”

An ‘irreplaceable’ wilderness area

First set aside by Congress in 1964, the 1.1m-acre Boundary Waters canoe area wilderness, as it is officially known, is the only large-scale protected sub-boreal forest in the lower 48 states. Each year, about 150,000 visitors come to partake in the all-American tradition of canoe travel and enjoy a pristine landscape where wolves, moose, loons, bears and bald eagles thrive. Those who come to explore it help contribute to Minnesota’s $13.5bn outdoor recreation economy. According to the US Forest Service, the landscape contains “healthy forests with extremely high water quality”. It is “irreplaceable”.

But the Boundary Waters also sit atop mineral-rich lands. Antofagasta has for years sought to develop a copper and nickel mine on public land near the wilderness, amid the headwaters that feed its famous lakes. The company and its American subsidiary, Twin Metals Minnesota, came close to success during the first Trump administration, which overturned an Obama-era denial and renewed mining leases for the project.

The Biden administration, recognizing the threat the proposed mine posed to the environment, subsequently rescinded those discretionary leases, arguing that they were legally deficient. The Biden administration also issued an order that prohibited mining for 20 years in the portion of the Superior national forest where Antofagasta wants to extract copper and nickel. Twin Metals Minnesota, which declined to comment for this story, filed litigation to fight the Biden policies in court. That lawsuit is ongoing.

Meanwhile, the companies went to Capitol Hill in their quest to build their mine, which they say will directly employ more than 750 people and could revitalize “the entire region”. In the last three years alone, Antofagasta and Twin Metals have poured more than $1.6m into lobbying efforts in Washington DC, according to OpenSecrets.

Among the lobbying shops they retained is Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, the powerful firm that was the longtime home of David Bernhardt, interior secretary during Trump’s first term. Brownstein’s employees and its political action committee, in turn, were together among the top 10 donors last election cycle to the campaign committee of representative Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, the powerful chair of the House natural resources committee.

Last month, that lobbying apparently bore fruit. Westerman’s committee unveiled its portion of the president’s reconciliation bill and it contained a major win for Antofagasta and Twin Metals.

The bill, which passed the House and is now being considered by the Senate, includes provisions that rescind the Biden administration’s 20-year mining prohibition in the Superior national forest and grants Twin Metals 20-year mining leases to pursue its copper-nickel project on nearly 6,000 acres (2,500 hectares) of public land near the Boundary Waters. It also grants Twin Metals rights in perpetuity to lease renewals and it prohibits judicial review of the leases, meaning that citizens cannot sue to challenge them. Only one party retains rights to judicial review per the legislation: Twin Metals. If the federal government fails to comply with the reconciliation bill, Twin Metals can sue to enforce it.

“The reconciliation bill compels the issuance of four leases forever,” said Rom. “To get there it expressly overrides four federal laws, it expressly overrides BLM regulations, so all of those rules that apply to everybody else in the world, the laws, the regulations, for Antofagasta they don’t apply.”

“There is a heavy hand in here,” she added. “The heavy hand of Antofagasta.”

Pollution fears and pushback

Neither Antofagasta nor Westerman’s office responded to requests for comment. Twin Metals has said its mine will provide a supply of strategic minerals that are important to national security and the emerging green energy economy.

For conservationists like Rom – who grew up helping her father run an outfitting business in the Boundary Waters wilderness and has since spent decades working to protect the wilderness area – the major threat from Twin Metals’ proposed mine is water pollution. That threat was described in a 2016 letter by the US Forest Service, when it initially denied its consent to the Twin Metals mine leases during the waning days of the Obama administration. There is “inherent potential risk that development of a regionally-untested copper-nickel sulfide ore mine within the same watershed as the BWCAW might cause serious and irreplaceable harm to this unique, iconic, and irreplaceable wilderness area”.

The agency’s letter particularly drew attention to the risk of acid mine drainage, a potent form of water pollution that is a well-known risk of the sort of sulfide-ore mining that Twin Metals and Antofagasta wish to undertake. Any drainage from the “mine workings and mining wastes are likely to be highly acidic”, the agency said of the Twin Metals mine. Any failure to contain such waste could have “potentially severe consequences for the BWCAW” and could “cover a very broad region”.

Twin Metals Minnesota has denied that acid mine drainage will be a potential threat, calling it a “nonissue”.

As the reconciliation bill moves through the Senate, conservationists as well as their allies in Congress are hoping it will be stripped out of the bill before it lands on Trump’s desk. They argue, among other things, that the bill’s Twin Metals provision may run afoul of Senate rules governing the reconciliation process, which disallows the body from including “extraneous provisions” in budget bills.

Among the opponents of the Twin Metals provision is Minnesota’s junior senator, Tina Smith, though the state’s congressional delegation is split on the issue.

“Senator Smith strongly opposes the reckless Republican provision in the US House-passed Big Beautiful Bill that would give a foreign conglomerate full permission to build a copper-nickel sulfide mine right on the doorstep of the Boundary Waters watershed,” wrote a spokesperson for Smith in a statement to Public Domain. “By including this language in their massive budget bill, Republicans in Congress have made it clear they don’t care about the science or the data, which shows unequivocally that this type of mining poses an unacceptable risk and stands to irreversibly pollute this pristine wilderness.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be3ce87aa173df50e48098a2ce1e3ef99681b3f/480_0_4800_3840/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0b51d4d8b114d1a2b40c7a26e9f78445,N,,2025-06-06 13:10:22.660519

1. The Supreme Court Just Started a Permitting Revolution — Heatmap

The Supreme Court just narrowed NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act. Federal agencies now don’t have to analyze downstream impacts of projects, only the direct environmental impact of the project itself. The ruling also significantly limits judicial oversight of agency NEPA reviews, directing courts to broadly defer to agency decisions.

This ruling is a major win for project developers – it’s easier and faster to approve projects, including clean energy. Most oil and gas drilling is already exempt from NEPA thanks to a 2005 law, but pipelines are still subject to NEPA and environmental groups say NEPA is useful in slowing them down.

2. U.S. Oil Companies Are ‘Battening Down the Hatches’ — The New York Times

US oil companies are shutting down rigs and laying off workers because oil prices have stayed low, around $60 a barrel. Global demand for oil is weakening due to an expected slowdown in global growth from Trump’s trade war, and at the same time OPEC Plus increasing production.

Smaller US oil producers have been hit the hardest. Those that still want to drill for oil are planning to cut capital spending by about 3.5%, while majors like Exxon and Chevron hold steady. Some companies are drilling less in Texas and New Mexico, and more in areas with natural gas, which is holding its value better.

BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (June 6, 2025) – The Illinois Soybean Association (ISA) commends members of the Illinois congressional delegation for their steadfast bipartisan support of the 40A Blenders Credit, a critical measure that strengthens America’s biofuels fuel industry while supporting Illinois soybean farmers.

Reps. Mike Bost (R-IL-12), Nikki Budzinski (D-IL-13), Darin LaHood (R-IL-16), and Eric Sorensen (D-IL-17) have all signed onto H.R. 3137, which was introduced by Reps. Mike Carey (R-OH-15) and Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA-1) on May 1.

The bipartisan legislation, which extends the biodiesel and renewable diesel blenders tax credit, represents a crucial investment in America’s energy independence and commitment to soybean farmers and rural communities across the Midwest. As the nation’s top soybean-producing state, Illinois stands to benefit significantly from this extension, which ensures the state’s biofuel refiners stay open, retain good paying jobs and continue to contribute to local and state economies.

“Southern Illinois farmers play a vital role in powering our nation forward – not just with food, but with fuel,” said Rep. Bost. “I’m proud to help lead the effort to extend the biodiesel and diesel blender tax credits, which supports good-paying jobs, strengthens energy independence, and protects the market for Illinois-grown soybeans. This bipartisan bill gives our biofuels producers the certainty they need to keep investing in rural communities and delivering American-made energy.”

“Soybeans are a cornerstone of Illinois’ economy, and few issues are more critical to our state than strengthening the biofuels industry and expanding market opportunities,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I am proud to support this legislation, which extends the federal tax credit for biodiesel producers and encourages continued investment in renewable fuels. We owe it to our farmers to help them stay competitive and provide certainty in these uncertain economic times.”

“Representing one of the largest corn and soybean producing districts in the nation, I know how critical biofuels are to the agriculture industry,” said Rep. LaHood. “The Biodiesel Tax Credit Extension Act will provide more certainty and opportunities for farmers, producers, and rural communities throughout the state. I am proud to join my colleagues in supporting this legislation to invest in the future of Illinois agriculture and American energy independence.”

“Illinois farmers work hard to feed and fuel our country, and they deserve a fair shot in the marketplace. This bill helps keep demand strong for biodiesel made from soybeans grown right here in Illinois and provides stable markets for farmers,” said Congressman Sorensen. “It’s a smart, bipartisan fix that supports good-paying jobs, strengthens our rural economy, and helps us keep moving toward cleaner energy.”

“We’re grateful to our representatives in Congress for recognizing the importance of this measure,” said ISA Chairman Ron Kindred. “Their strong bipartisan support demonstrates their commitment to Illinois farmers and economic stability for our rural communities.”

The 40A Blenders Credit supports biodiesel and renewable diesel production, which creates significant demand for soybean oil and provides stable markets for Illinois soybean farmers. This tax incentive helps level the playing field with petroleum-based fuels, making clean, renewable biodiesel more competitive in the marketplace.

Illinois produces more than 600 million bushels of soybeans annually, and Illinois’ biodiesel industry, which is the 4th largest in the nation with an annual production of approx. 192 million gallons a year, supports nearly 2,000 jobs in all sectors of the state’s economy. The extension of this tax credit will help provide certainty for both farmers and biodiesel producers, allowing for continued growth and investment in the sector.

The bill has earned support from the American Trucking Associations (ATA), Clean Freight Coalition, Energy Marketers of America (EMA), Illinois Soybean Association (ISA), National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), National Energy & Fuels Institute (NEFI), NATSO, Representing America’s Travel Centers and Truck Stops, Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), Sustainable Advanced Biofuels Refiners (SABR), SIGMA: America’s Leading Fuel Marketers, National Tank Truck Carriers, and Truckload Carriers Association (TCA).

BACKGROUND ON 40A:

Biodiesel and renewable diesel are advanced biofuels that are generally produced from feedstocks such as soybean oil, recycled cooking oil, or other animal fats. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines the two fuels as renewable fuels that emit at least 50 percent less lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuel alternatives. In many cases, biodiesel and renewable diesel reduce emissions by more than 70 percent.

The biodiesel tax credit refers to a group of incentives included in Section 40A(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

The Second-Generation Biofuel Producer Tax Credit provides a tax credit of up to $1.01 per gallon of qualifying advanced biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol made from corn kernel fiber. This tax credit incentivizes investment in innovative fuel production technologies and has resulted in critical advancements in the production of domestically produced second generation biofuels.

The bill proposes a phaseout or wholesale repeal of these tax credits, which were designed to incentivize investment in and development of clean energy projects, by the end of 2025.

“Like our colleagues at Canary Media, we work to advance the clean energy transition and find solutions to the climate crisis.
But these fees tend to be borne disproportionately by developing countries that historically have contributed little to global emissions.","The budget reconciliation bill includes proposed annual registration fees on electric vehicles (EVs)—$250 for new EVs and $100 for hybrids—aimed at offsetting losses in revenue from gasoline taxes. The fee adds to the expenses incurred by EV owners, as the bill also includes a provision to phase out consumer tax credits for EVs. As lawmakers debate these policies, Resources for the Future (RFF) researchers consider another key component of the cost of owning an EV—how the costs of public and private EV charging vary, and how charging costs compare to the costs of refueling gasoline-powered vehicles. In an article from the latest issue of Resources magazine, RFF Fellow Beia Spiller and coauthors Trenton Marable and Benjamin Leard collected and analyzed data on these pricing differences. “Home charging is the most financially viable option in terms of reducing the costs associated with EV operation,” the researchers conclude. “With public EV charging … the cost is much higher and can exceed the costs associated with operating and refueling gasoline vehicles.”

Senators are debating the future of clean energy tax credits as they deliberate on the budget reconciliation bill. The bill proposes a phaseout or wholesale repeal of these tax credits, which were designed to incentivize investment in and development of clean energy projects, by the end of 2025. Critics of these broad repeals cite concerns that the loss of these incentives would increase emissions, constrain efforts to meet rising energy demand, and undermine economic gains in US states that already have increased their investment in clean energy projects. In a new In Focus video, RFF Senior Research Associate McKenna Peplinski explains what the repeal of two clean electricity tax credits in question could mean for the energy sector and consumers. “If these two tax credits are repealed, it’s likely that we will see higher emissions for the power sector … and negative consequences for the clean energy sector, as well as for consumers,” says Peplinski.

Wildfires have been burning in Canada since last week, sending smoke southeast into the United States and worsening air quality from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast. This prevalence of wildfire smoke significantly increases people’s exposure to fine particulate matter—known as PM2.5—which poses health risks. But exposure to PM2.5 is not limited to outdoor air pollution. Common household activities, such as cooking, release PM2.5 into the home. Robert D. Metcalfe, a professor at Columbia University, investigated the levels of indoor air pollution in homes and the behavioral changes people make when they are made aware of fluctuating levels. He joined Resources Radio last week to share his findings, along with insights about how this type of research can inform effective public health policy responses. “When we reveal that information to the households … we find that the indoor PM2.5 levels fell by just under two micrograms per cubic meter … a big change,” says Metcalfe.

A new report from the World Meteorological Organization projects that between 2025 and 2029, global temperatures will increase by 1.2°C–1.9°C above pre-industrial levels. The report also forecasts an 80 percent chance that one of those years will be the hottest on record. These projections bring the world close to surpassing limits set by the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global temperature rise below 2°C—and, more recently, below 1.5°C—to avoid severe impacts of climate change.

In a 2023 issue brief, RFF researchers Jordan Wingenroth, Brian C. Prest, and Kevin Rennert assessed the global economic benefits of limiting temperature increases to the Paris Agreement targets. “We find that mitigation efforts that reduce expected warming to well below 2°C would generate cumulative economic benefits of $467 trillion through 2300,” Wingenroth says. “Relative to the path the world is currently expected to take, that dollar figure amounts to about half of the climate damages from the sectors covered in our model, which demonstrates the substantial value of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the near term.”

Upcoming Event: Analyzing Policy Action in 2025

This spring, RFF launched its If/Then series, an initiative that shares timely insights from researchers on developments in energy and environmental policy in a rapidly changing legislative landscape. In an upcoming webinar on June 24, RFF scholars Alan Krupnick, Kevin Rennert, and Carlos Martín will be joined by NOTUS reporter Anna Kramer to discuss notable policy actions so far in 2025 and some key issues to watch. Register for the webinar.

Recent Event: Conversations on Electricity Affordability

Electricity affordability is a problem in the United States, as growing electricity demand puts pressure on aging infrastructure. Earlier this week, RFF and Canary Media hosted a panel of journalists, industry experts, and researchers who discussed possible solutions to this problem. “These are the types of conversations we are compelled to have in our current context—conversations about how the energy transition affects all of us in our day-to-day lives,” said Carlos Martín at the event. “Like our colleagues at Canary Media, we work to advance the clean energy transition and find solutions to the climate crisis. And, like Canary Media, we do our best to share information in accessible ways.”

Trade Policies Targeting Foreign Pollution Highlight Shared but Unequal Climate Responsibilities

Countries vary in how they regulate carbon emissions—some require that companies pay domestic fees for generating emissions, while imports from countries with weaker emissions standards often go untaxed. Some countries address this regulatory imbalance by placing fees on imports through policies known as carbon border adjustment mechanisms. But these fees tend to be borne disproportionately by developing countries that historically have contributed little to global emissions. In a new issue brief, RFF researchers Milan Elkerbout and Katarina Nehrkorn, with David Kleimann of ODI Global, examine these international climate-and-trade policies, considering how such policies can meet climate objectives while fairly distributing the responsibility of reducing global emissions.

India’s Urbanization Ambitions Are Shaping Its Plans for Decarbonization

India’s power sector has expanded rapidly over the past 25 years, fueled largely by coal. The timing of this development puts India on a unique path to meeting global emissions-reduction targets. Sandeep Pai, who researches and advises on energy transitions at nonprofit Swaniti Global, joined Resources Radio this week to discuss India’s efforts to expand energy access while moving toward a lower-carbon future. “India has a lot of aspirations to urbanize, grow, and industrialize … to at least reach the world average of per capita electricity consumption,” says Pai. “That means India’s electricity system has to triple as India tries to decarbonize.”",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2185514865.width-600.png,N,,2025-06-06 14:16:31.304542

Dive Brief:

The tax credit transferability provision included in the Inflation Reduction Act has introduced new deal structures and is allowing clean energy developers to secure project financing faster, said speakers at a Thursday panel at the American Council on Renewable Energy’s Finance Forum.

“The closing of transactions has become so much easier,” said Gaurav Raniwala, global renewable energy leader at GE Vernova. “You don't have to line up two different structures simultaneously and then close everything when there's already enough mess going on. And the type of players that are now able to enter the market has broadened significantly.”

A Wednesday report from Crux, a finance technology company that connects tax credit buyers and sellers, said lenders are “increasingly” looking to finance less established technologies like carbon capture, and that “this openness is supported by the robust and progressively more liquid market for transferable tax credits.”

Dive Insight:

Raniwala said that financing had previously relied on the tax equity market, which “was limited in capacity. The industry wanted to be bigger.”

“If you really want to have a dominant energy industry which has abundance of supply to help with electrification, to help with all the AI stuff, we need all sources of energy out there,” he said. “And I think what transferability did was it broadened the market from just traditional tax equity to a whole host of players.”

Crux’s analysis said that “tax equity structures have evolved to hybrid structures, or t-flips, which explicitly contemplate the sale of a portion of tax credits in the transfer market” and found that t-flips “made up about 60% of the tax equity committed in 2024, and that share is expected to rise.”

“Historically, the tax equity market was about a $20 billion a year market dominated for many years by a handful of institutions,” said panelist Meghan Schultz, executive vice president and CFO at Invenergy. “And with the transferability market, the size more than doubled … it allows the tax investor, the tax credit buyer, to be able to monetize those tax benefits without actually needing to be an owner in the project.”

Raniwala noted that transactions can also now be customized based on credit profile. “As an example, you could do the traditional tax equity, but now you know you can transfer the credits, so you could also borrow against those credits from banks.”

Despite this sea change for project financing, transferability itself is endangered, as the budget bill that passed the House last month would eliminate or severely restrict transferability for the credits included in the IRA — and eliminate or shave down the credits themselves.

“The medium-term policy environment contains significant uncertainty, which investors in clean energy and manufacturing projects must navigate,” Crux said.

Crux’s report noted that the Senate will have to pass its own version of the budget, and “senators have telegraphed their desire to make substantive changes to the House’s version. That said, the near-term uncertainty may lead some developers to face higher costs of capital, more limited capital availability, or higher equity requirements as they seek to finance their projects.”

Despite looming threats to the IRA, Crux’s report took a bullish stance overall on the U.S. clean energy economy, noting that it “directed nearly $340 billion in new investment in the United States last year.”

One factor driving new projects is the added transaction speed offered by transferability.

The tax credit trade has “allowed people to close financing much more quickly, to not need to have that tax equity or tax credit buyer lined up at close, knowing that there is this liquid market for the tax credits,” Schultz said. “It’s facilitated speed to market for projects, because you can be efficient in your financing.” The lowered cost of debt and added flexibility of being able to lend against the expected transfer of your credits has also streamlined the process, she said.

David Haug, CEO of Bildmore Clean Energy, said the option to transfer the credits allows developers to choose “whether you want to have a long term offtake contract, or a long term revenue contract or a hedge to lock in your revenues or not.”

“Most of the projects that we're providing [preferred] equity for have a significant component of merchant risk,” he said. “So we do not require them to have long term offtake contracts. We also don't require them to have pre-sold the tax credit. If they want to go all the way to commercial operation with no tax credit sale agreement in place, we will do that because we're betting that the tax credit market is strong, and we're also betting that the merchant power market is strong.”

But accommodating those drivers while preparing for growth within the EV industry remains a work in progress.

The City of Missoula this week unveiled a draft of its new Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan. Two years in the making, the product covers a range of strategies focused on both infrastructure and education.

The plan is set for adoption later this summer, according to Devin Filicicchia, the city's electrification specialist.

“We want EV supply equipment be easy to implement,” he said. “We're looking at land-use regulations, permitting and ordinances to ensure they're not a cumbersome hurdle when someone's thinking about purchase an EV or instilling a charger.”

Montana has one of the lowest EV adoption rates in the country, though the number of electric vehicles on the road is slowly increasing. Statewide, EV registrations nearly doubled in 2023, though pickup trucks still represent around 35% of all registered vehicles.

But that hasn't deterred those looking to move away from combustible engines and go electric. Participants in a recent open house held around the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan mapped their preferred locations for EV charging stations.

Filicicchia said the results weren't a big surprise.

“Many of the locations that people plotted as high-priority areas are areas with high dwell times – or places where people spend a lot of time – and close to businesses or other community centers,” he said. “We're not using it as the end-all-be-all where charging should be located, but it's a helpful start.”

According to the plan, roughly 17 fast DC charging ports were mapped within the Metropolitan Planning Area. Combining that with other data will help inform future action, including the placement of charging stations.

As it stands, Filicicchia said the city can work to simplify the adoption of EV infrastructure and outline goals around public-private partnerships. Future land-use regulations will recognize EV infrastructure needs. Other regulations, such as “across sidewalk” charging and any role local government can play in enhancing EV use, will also be explored, he said.

“We're hoping to layer more data and what the public thinks is important, and create a priority map,” said Filicicchia. “Because we want to see more charging on private land, one of the key strategies will be reaching out to entitles where people want to see charging.”

The state in 2023 adopted its own Montana Alternative Fuel Corridors, identifying Interstates 90 and 15 as corridors, along with Highway 93 and Highway 2. Given that 40% of Missoula's greenhouse gas emissions stem of tailpipes, the city sees growth in the EV market as powerful tool in addressing climate change at the local level.

The plan also calls on the city “to lead by example,” which includes increasing the city's own EV fleet. Filicicchia said the city has roughly 463 vehicles in its fleet, including 11 fully electric, five plug-in hybrid and 42 conventional hybrid vehicles.

Growing those numbers remains challenging, he said.

“I think the development for charging infrastructure for fleet vehicles is the biggest challenges,” he said. “Fleet vehicles are parked at a variety of locations, and many of these facilities are facing changes or a move in the coming years. A comprehensive fleet charging plan is necessary to support future electrification.”

While the future of EV tax credits and other incentives remains uncertain under the Trump administration, industry growth is expected to continue. According to the International Energy Agency, the number of EVs in the U.S. is estimated to reach 27 million by 2030 and 92 million by 2040.

Filicicchia said the city is looking at the University of Montana as a model to enhance its own EV infrastructure plan.

“The university has been a close partner, because they're a great example of providing a lot of workplace charging,” he said. “They have multiple charging locations across campus, and we can receive that data to see what that charging usage looks like.”

Areas identified as Phase 1 of the city's Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan are slated for achievement by 2027. Phase 2 categories lie further down the road.

“This is a plan we're excited to see carried out” said Filicicchia.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e4245ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/980x515+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7a%2F6d%2Fe0b50422416e9defabb50654ca83%2Fattachment-electric.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 15:11:27.323341

The U.S. faces a looming nuclear fuel supply gap due to the loss of Russian uranium.
Western enrichment capacity, meanwhile, is dominated by two players that are not American owned.
The European enrichers are reliable partners and have done a good job supporting the market, Vexler told CNBC.
Centrus wants to break the stranglehold that state-owned corporations have over the U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain.","President Donald Trump's push to dramatically increase nuclear power in the U.S. will require a tremendous amount of fuel, but the country remains heavily dependent on foreign state-owned companies for its supplies, the CEO of the only publicly traded uranium enricher in the world told CNBC.

""There's barely enough Western enrichment, if at all, to satisfy existing operating plants,"" Centrus Energy CEO Amir Vexler said in an interview. ""If the nuclear industry is to add all this generation capacity, there will have to be a tremendous amount of enrichment capacity that's added.""

Trump issued a series of executive orders on nuclear power last month that set a target for the U.S. to quadruple the sector's capacity to 400 gigawatts by 2050. Nuclear energy is one of the few issues in deeply polarized Washington these days that enjoys some level of bipartisan support. Trump's push expands on former President Joe Biden's goal to triple nuclear power by midcentury.

Most nuclear plants worldwide use low-enriched uranium, or LEU. The U.S. relied on foreign countries for around 70% of the fuel for its reactors in 2023, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.

About 27% of U.S. fuel purchases came from Russia that year, one of the principle geopolitical foes of the U.S. But Russian uranium will be forced out of the U.S. supply chain by 2028 at the latest, after Biden signed legislation in 2024 to ban imports over Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. faces a looming nuclear fuel supply gap due to the loss of Russian uranium.

Western enrichment capacity, meanwhile, is dominated by two players that are not American owned. They are France's Orano and a British-Dutch-German consortium called Urenco, according to the World Nuclear Association.

The European enrichers are reliable partners and have done a good job supporting the market, Vexler told CNBC. But trade tensions threaten to disrupt global supply chains, he said on the Centrus first-quarter earnings call.

""We don't have any domestic fuel cycle capacity, almost at all,"" Vexler told CNBC, referring to American-owned companies. ""We don't mine anything, we don't convert anything. We don't enrich anything. We rely on others. And others are all state-owned enterprises, maybe with a few minor exceptions.""

The only commercial enrichment facility operating in the U.S. is owned by Urenco, the European consortium. It is located in Eunice, New Mexico. Centrus wants to break the stranglehold that state-owned corporations have over the U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain.

""The circumstances in the market are such that we believe and we're staking everything we have on the fact that the market needs another enricher,"" Vexler said. ""It needs competition.""

Bethesda, Maryland-based Centrus is also the only company in the U.S. that has a license to produce a type of fuel that some next-generation nuclear plant designs, such as small modular reactors, are planning to use.

The U.S. wasn't always dependent on foreign countries. It was the first country to enrich uranium for the commercial market and was a dominant player in the market through the 1980s. The federal government owned and operated the nation's enrichment facilities during that period.

The U.S. sold its enrichment business through a company called the United States Enrichment Corp. in a public offering in 1998. USEC went bankrupt in 2014 as nuclear plants struggled to compete against cheap natural gas and support for the industry declined in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. Centrus emerged from the reorganization of USEC later that year and is now profitable.

""We were just not able to compete with other government, state-owned competitors,"" said Vexler, who took over the helm at Centrus in 2024. When times got tough for the industry, national governments in Europe and Russia would not allow their state-owned enrichers to fail, he said.

Centrus plans to transition away from its trading business as it stands up its domestic enrichment capacity. The vast majority of the enriched uranium produced in Ohio will be sold on the commercial market and potentially for export, Vexler said.

""I would certainly aim for us to not only backfill sort of the vacancy that the Russians are creating, but I also hope that we're going to gain market share, both in the LEU and in the HALEU market,"" Vexler said.

But this will require some level of government support given the state-owned competition, he said. Congress has passed $3.4 billion to support domestic enrichment and reduce U.S. dependence particularly on Russia. Centrus is one of several companies competing for the funding.

""We've always said that it has to be a public-private partnership,"" Vexler said. ""We've been raising our own funds. We've been raising our own financing. We will contribute significantly to this, but we have to have government support.""

""There is a path here where we could have a prosperous, commercially competitive American industry,"" he said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108155194-1749130755984-gettyimages-1733949510-URENCO_URANIUM.jpeg?v=1749130897&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-06-06 12:24:24.740085

Antipathy toward environmental protections was a hallmark of the first Trump administration, but in his second term, the president and his congressional allies are redoubling their efforts to allow cars to pollute more and limit the adoption of electric vehicles.

Congressional republicans have been working on a budget bill that would radically transform many aspects of American life. Among the environmental protections being stripped away in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (yes, that's what it's called) is a repeal of the US Environmental Protection Agency's rules on ""greenhouse gas and multi-pollutant emissions standards.""

These regulations are meant to limit the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the US vehicle fleet, a major driver of climate change, as well as the noxious pollutants containing sulfur and nitrogen compounds that have more immediate and deleterious effects on human health. And if the budget bill is sent to Trump to sign, the existing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules, implemented in 2022, and the future rules meant to take effect next year will be no more.

The House bill also eliminates the IRS clean vehicle tax credit, which provides up to $7,500 for buyers of some new EVs, plug-in hybrids, and fuel cell EVs; $4,000 for buyers of some used EVs; and the commercial vehicle tax credit of $7,500 that applied to any leased EV.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is on record as supporting the repeal of the EV tax credit, as it would hurt his rivals more than Tesla. But yesterday, Musk decried the fact that the spending bill does not cut subsidies for oil and gas, just EVs and solar.

No fines for you

Yesterday in the Senate, Republicans proposed another new measure that can only be seen as pro-pollution. Should it pass, the EPA would no longer be able to levy fines against carmakers that exceed fleet averages set out in the CAFE regulations. OEMs have paid the government hundreds of millions of dollars in these fines over the past decade. (Note that these fines are different from those imposed on Volkswagen and other automakers for circumventing efficiency standards.)

This would allow OEMs to save money by removing emissions equipment from their products, and it could potentially bring back older powertrains that would otherwise be prohibited on the roads. Tesla may well be the biggest loser here, as the bill removes incentives for other automakers to purchase carbon credits. The GOP is also attacking California's ability to set its own emissions standards. That would remove another major source of emissions credits for Tesla, which are, again, increasingly important in keeping the company's books out of the red.

Over at the Department of Transportation, similar efforts are underway. Secretary Sean Duffy's first action as the head of DOT was to begin reviewing Biden-era fuel efficiency regulations, and today, the department decided that it makes no sense to include EVs as part of its CAFE rules.

At this rate, it's a wonder they're not trying to mandate coal-fired steam engines as an alternative.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2165387463-2560x1440.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 15:11:32.041808

ROCKFORD — A Rockford company is preparing to test a prototype that will harness the power of the Rock River to generate electricity for local homes.

Latitude Power of Rockford is working with Studio GWA on a demonstration product that would generate enough electricity to power five homes. If its test is successful, it could pave the way for Rockford to become a hub for micro-hydro cycling systems, state Sen. Steve Stadelman said.

The local companies were awarded a $914,330 grant through the Illinois Equitable Energy Future program to help develop the project at the Fordam Dam in downtown. Stadelman confirmed the award of the grant on Thursday.

“The test program being proposed for the Fordam Dam is just the type of clean energy development we had in mind when we approved the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act,” Stadelman said in a news release. “Rockford has a proud manufacturing tradition, and being the base for production and sales of this technology will bring jobs and could lead to wider economic growth.”

Once proven, the technology would be expanded to generate enough electricity to power at least 50 homes. Latitude Power would also need to reach an agreement with ComEd to direct energy into its grid and offer residential users a credit on their bills.

The demonstration product is expected to take about 18 months to manufacture and install, including the time it takes to obtain approvals required by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, according to Latitude Principal Carl Cacciatore.

“There are all sorts of applications for this that will then spread out across the country,” said Cacciatore, a retired program manager for what is now Collins Aerospace. “Rockford will be at the center of it all.”

Fordam Dam was built in the 1840s as part of the Rockford Water Power Co., and it was first used for hydroelectric power in 1896 by Rockford Electric Co., according to ComEd.

Latitude Power’s grant is among 27 awarded statewide by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. The agency is preparing a third round of applications for $25.5 million in grants. The grant program is designed to benefit clean energy development in communities that have historically lacked access to capital.",https://3d60ad30.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DSC_2408-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 14:17:01.806977

The federal clean energy incentives have given our state a major boost and Arizona is seizing the opportunity.
It’s about families and communities: better paying jobs, lower energy bills, economic opportunity, stronger schools, and thriving communities.”","“Arizona is on its way to clean energy dominance, with 24 major new projects and more than $11.8 billion in private investments, thanks, in part, to federal clean energy tax incentives that are now under threat,” Steven G. Zylstra, president and CEO of the Arizona Technology Council, wrote in a guest commentary piece published in the Arizona Capitol Times. The state’s ongoing energy transition “means good paying jobs, cleaner air, and thriving communities, especially in rural parts of Arizona that are often overlooked. And it means that Arizona is leading the way as the U.S. seeks to hold its position as a global energy leader,” Zylstra elaborated.

Zylstra pointed to many factories and operations “building a prosperous and vibrant future for our state.” In 2022, American Battery Factory announced the first domestic network of Lithium-Iron Phosphate battery cell giga-factories, which will contribute to chipping away at China’s dominance in manufacturing these batteries that are vital for energy storage systems and electric vehicles. Zhenfang Ge, Chairman of the Board, discussed the impact of these upcoming facilities: “Each factory we build will create an estimated 300 to 1,000 quality jobs. As our network grows, we will help mitigate decades of U.S. manufacturing job losses resulting from the closure of nearly 66,000 U.S. manufacturing sites while eventually making it possible to move the country and the entire world to 100% renewable power.”

In 2023, the company broke ground on a $1.2 billion gigafactory in Tucson that it estimated would create 1,000 jobs and have a $3.1 billion economic impact on Arizona. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero reflected, “Many years from now, when we look back at the global race to develop the clean technologies of the future, people will look to the Sonoran Desert.”

Lucid Motors’ 3 million-square-foot expansion of its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, which it announced last year in advance of the production launch of the electric Lucid Gravity, also stands out. “The expansion of our manufacturing footprint in Arizona is a significant milestone for the company, as we prepare for the next phase of Lucid’s growth… We are proud to call Casa Grande home, to continue in our role pioneering advanced technology in Arizona, and to be an American electric vehicle company,” said CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson. The company has partnered with the Arizona Commerce Authority, the City of Casa Grande, and Central Arizona College to source, develop, and train local employees.

Meanwhile, in March, Sion Power installed a new large-format battery cell production line at its facility in Tucson. Using lithium metal, these batteries have double the energy density of comparable graphite or silicone anode versions, reducing cell material costs by 15% and cell count by 20%. President Tracy Kelly explained the importance of the technology: “The ability to scale performance from small prototype cells to large-format cells is often where battery technologies face the greatest challenge. Our new manufacturing line bridges that gap, demonstrating the capability of our lithium-metal battery technology in formats applicable to real-world applications.”

Finally, Zylstra highlighted EVelution Energy, which announced in April it would begin building the first solar-powered cobalt processing plant in the U.S. this year. When it is up and running in 2027, the facility near Wellton will be able to meet up to 40% of domestic cobalt demand, benefiting the aerospace, defense, and electric vehicle sectors. The company expects the site to create 3,300 direct, indirect, and induced jobs during its lifetime, many sourced through training programs at the Wellton Campus of the Arizona Western College, and contribute $750 million to the state’s economy. The company expected to benefit from $42.5 million in energy subsidies, however, that is now at risk as Congress considers legislation that could strip such incentives away.

Zylstra explained what is at stake: “Higher-paying jobs will empower more people to buy homes, start small businesses, and make EVs more accessible to everyday consumers. This in turn will help create a higher tax base, which translates into better schools, better roads, and stronger communities.” The U.S. Department of Energy counted more than 65,000 clean energy jobs in the state, accounting for approximately half of all jobs in the energy sector.

Zylstra’s organization promotes the state’s technology ecosystem by organizing events, offering resources, and pushing for policies to connect and empower Arizonian tech companies. He noted, “As president and CEO of the Arizona Technology Council, our mission is to position our state as a clean energy and technology hub and a national center of innovation. The federal clean energy incentives have given our state a major boost and Arizona is seizing the opportunity. Southern Arizona, in particular, with its ideal climate and skilled workforce, is positioned to become a flourishing clean energy hub for the nation.”

Moreover, Zylstra highlighted the importance of the projects in the district of Rep. Juan Ciscomani, where, according to Climate Power, new projects representing “at least half a billion dollars” will contribute to making the region “the capital of electric batteries while the state becomes a solar powerhouse and electric-vehicle manufacturing hub.”

Although the U.S. House’s version of the reconciliation bill essentially takes a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits, there is still hope to preserve them as the Senate considers the legislation. Zylstra expanded that the significance is more than these industries: “This isn’t just about businesses and factories and leading the way. It’s about families and communities: better paying jobs, lower energy bills, economic opportunity, stronger schools, and thriving communities.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/481180429_1088233103339216_3734100789110007386_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 15:11:42.237782

That list includes 25 coal plants with a combined capacity of 18.2 gigawatts.
Research has shown that it costs more to operate most coal plants than it would to build wind and solar power replacements.
Thirty power plants with a combined capacity of 12.2 gigawatts are scheduled to retire just this year.
Of those facilities, 10 are coal plants with a combined capacity of 7.7 gigawatts.","A 63-year-old coal-fired power plant was scheduled to permanently close its doors in Michigan on June 1. So was an oil- and gas-powered plant that was built in the 1960s in Pennsylvania.

But at the last minute, the Trump administration ordered both to stay open. The orders came as it pursues a far-reaching plan to boost fossil fuels, including coal, by declaring a national “energy emergency.”

The grid operators in Michigan and Pennsylvania said they hadn’t asked for the orders and hadn’t planned on using the plants this summer.

The costs to keep the plants open, which could total tens of millions of dollars, are expected to fall on consumers. Experts have said there’s little evidence of a national energy emergency, and 15 states have sued to challenge President Trump’s declaration, which was issued the day he took office.

The emergency orders, which came last month, surprised the companies that operate the plants, and they are now scrambling to delay some workers’ retirements and reverse nearly complete plans to shutter their facilities. In Michigan, the plant operator raced to buy enough coal to power operations.

The episode marks a highly unusual use of the Energy Department’s emergency powers under the Federal Power Act. In the past, the department has typically issued emergency orders at the request of regional grid operators to stabilize the power supply during extreme weather events and blackouts.

Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, said he estimated that the 90-day order to keep the coal plant open would cost ratepayers tens of millions of dollars.

“What was surprising about this order is that nobody was asking for it,” he said. “The grid operator wasn’t asking for this plant to be kept online. The utility that owns and operates the plant wasn’t asking for the plant to be kept online, the state wasn’t asking for the plant to be kept online.”

Dana Nessel, Michigan’s attorney general, a Democrat, said she was “certainly considering” challenging the order affecting the coal plant in her state.

“We think this is par for the course with the Trump administration,” Ms. Nessel said. “They’re abusing emergency authorities and really manufacturing an emergency that doesn’t exist, in a way that’s really unprecedented.”

Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization, also plans to challenge the orders, according to Tyson Slocum, the group’s energy program director.

In a statement, Ben Dietderich, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, said the department under Mr. Trump was “ensuring Americans have access to all forms of reliable energy, including coal” and that the administration was committed to ensuring access to “reliable, affordable, and secure energy that isn’t dependent on whether the sun shines or the wind blows.”

The Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The plant was just one week away from closing. The order prompted a rush to replenish the giant coal pile that feeds the plant, which had dwindled ahead of the planned closure. Coal is the dirtiest of the fossil fuels in terms of planet-warming pollution.

A week later, near Philadelphia, the oil- and gas-powered Eddystone plant was one day away from closing when it received similar news. In order to keep the affected units available, Constellation Energy, the facility’s parent company, is “currently focused on securing the staff and performing the maintenance necessary,” a spokesman said.

In its official order, the Energy Department cited projections showing potential summertime electricity generation shortfalls as the basis for the emergency action. Electricity demand is typically higher during the summer when temperatures rise and people use air-conditioning. Overall electricity demand is projected to increase because of data center construction and the adoption of electric vehicles.

All told, 108 plants with a combined capacity of 31.5 gigawatts are set to be retired by the end of Mr. Trump’s term. That list includes 25 coal plants with a combined capacity of 18.2 gigawatts. One gigawatt is roughly enough to power the city of San Francisco.

Mr. Trump attempted something similar during his first term, but the idea faced fierce opposition from grid operators, power companies and consumers, and the White House eventually backed down.

The April order was one in a wave of executive actions aimed at reviving the coal industry by slashing regulations and opening more land for mining, among other things. Coal use in the United States has been declining for more than a decade, and coal plants now produce less than a fifth of the nation’s power.

Despite Mr. Trump’s vocal support of coal during his first administration, the period saw more coal capacity retired than the Biden era did. Research has shown that it costs more to operate most coal plants than it would to build wind and solar power replacements.

Thirty power plants with a combined capacity of 12.2 gigawatts are scheduled to retire just this year. Of those facilities, 10 are coal plants with a combined capacity of 7.7 gigawatts. Another 12 plants set to retire this year are powered by natural gas or oil.

These facilities are generally being replaced with renewables, but grid operators have raised concerns that new sources of energy are not coming online fast enough to meet supply shortfalls left by retiring plants.

Companies that generate power typically work with grid operators, often years in advance, to ensure that a planned retirement will not increase the risk of blackouts or other power failures.

Grid operators have broad power to reverse or delay planned retirements if they forecast an electricity generation shortfall. Because of electricity reliability concerns, PJM Interconnection, a grid operator affected by the Energy Department’s emergency orders in May, separately called on two power plants that burn oil and coal to stay open four years past their retirement dates this year.

Because the Michigan and Pennsylvania plants were set to close at the end of May, keeping these plants open will involve spending money on maintenance, staff and supplies, and these additional costs are expected to be borne by consumers through higher bills.

In Michigan, Consumers Energy rushed to buy more coal. The plant which uses 15,000 tons of coal per day bought from Wyoming and Montana. And then there were other costs: Employees who had planned to retire or transfer were suddenly needed for at least another three months.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06cli-doe-emergency-01-fvlb/06cli-doe-emergency-01-fvlb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 12:24:28.030337

While demand for clean energy continues to grow, executive orders, regulatory changes, and evolving legislative priorities are reshaping the landscape for project development and investment.

In this Insight based on our Earth Day webinar series we outline some of the key federal developments affecting renewables in 2025, including changes to permitting and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementation, vehicle emissions standards, the future of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax incentives, and additional considerations for clean energy project developers, and highlight how legal and regulatory changes are being implemented and what to watch in the months ahead.

RENEWABLE INFRASTRUCTURE PERMITTING

The administration’s early executive orders have sent strong signals that it intends to prioritize domestic fossil fuel production over renewable energy development. The implications for project permitting are particularly acute.

Executive Orders

Three major executive actions will reshape the permitting landscape:

National Energy Emergency Declaration: Defines “energy” to include fossil fuels but excludes solar and wind, directs agencies to invoke emergency powers under the Defense Production Act to accelerate fossil fuel projects, and provides specific instructions for expediting Clean Water Act permitting and Endangered Species Act reviews for such projects.

Unleashing American Energy: Directs agencies to revise or repeal regulations that hinder fossil fuel development, rescinds multiple Biden-era environmental orders, and instructs the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to withdraw NEPA regulations and issue new permitting guidance.

Offshore Wind Leasing Halt: Suspends new offshore wind leases, raising concerns about the reliability of federal permitting for renewables.

Collectively, these measures have introduced uncertainty and additional risk for clean energy projects across the country.

NEPA Reform

The rescission of the CEQ’s NEPA regulations represents a particularly significant change in federal policy for the renewables sector. The interim final rule removes the governmentwide framework for environmental reviews, replacing it with a directive that agencies craft their own NEPA regulations.

This transition period raises key questions:

Will agencies voluntarily follow now-rescinded CEQ guidance?

How will courts treat NEPA documents prepared under the old framework?

Will ongoing or future litigation challenge agency processes be built on unstable legal footing?

The administration has stated that permitting should continue without delay, however, the absence of consistent guidance combined with pending litigation and shifting agency procedures has introduced notable uncertainty, making it more difficult for developers to predict permitting timelines or requirements.

As agencies work to update or replace their NEPA processes, developers must stay closely engaged with regulators, monitor evolving standards, and remain flexible in project planning to avoid delays or compliance setbacks.

VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS

The transportation sector, another key pillar of the energy transition, is undergoing a similar recalibration. The previous administration’s tailpipe rules and fuel economy standards aimed to accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption. The current administration is now working to unwind those efforts, and a budget reconciliation bill currently making its way through the US Congress includes provisions to revise or repeal the programs discussed below.

GHG Tailpipe Rules

The previous administration’s tailpipe rules for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles set aggressive greenhouse gas (GHG) emission limits, effectively pushing automakers toward electrification. It was projected that EVs would make up 60% of new car sales by 2030 and 67% by 2032. However, these rules are now in legal limbo.

Under the Unleashing American Energy executive order, agencies have been instructed to revise or suspend rules that limit consumer vehicle choice. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has stated its intent to revise these tailpipe standards and the 2022 nitrogen oxide rules for trucks, which also incentivized manufacturers toward EVs.

The previous administration’s rules technically remain in effect and litigation over them is paused, but they are providing little to no incentive for EV adoptions as their compliance deadlines remain years away and the industry anticipates that they will soon be repealed and replaced.

CAFE Standards

Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, overseen by the US Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), have received less public attention but also face revision. These fuel economy benchmarks were aligned with EPA’s tailpipe rules and similarly incentivized EV production. NHTSA is now reconsidering these standards, with litigation held in abeyance pending agency action.

The California Waiver

In May 2025, Congress passed resolutions under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to nullify EPA waivers granted to California for its Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks programs along with related nitrogen oxide standards. These waivers issued under the Clean Air Act have long allowed California to set more stringent vehicle emissions rules. More than a dozen states follow these stricter standards, collectively representing roughly half of the US auto market.

This action by Congress followed earlier determinations by the Senate parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office that such waivers do not constitute “rules” under the CRA and are therefore not subject to its provisions. The resolutions now await the president’s signature.

California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta, have announced intentions to challenge the revocation in court, arguing that it undermines the state’s longstanding authority under the Clean Air Act to protect public health and the environment. The outcome of this legal dispute could have significant implications for state-level environmental regulations and the broader framework of federalism in environmental policy.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT INCOME TAX BENEFITS

The IRA fundamentally reshaped the US clean energy economy by introducing and expanding tax credits across the energy supply chain and for deployment and the way these credits could be monetized. While these benefits remain in place, they face political headwinds.

Background and Scope

The IRA enhanced or introduced federal income tax credits for renewable electricity, energy storage, clean hydrogen and other clean fuel, and carbon capture utilization and storage facilities, among other technologies.

It introduced credit-enhancing “adders” for meeting certain labor standards, using domestic content, “energy community” location, and investing in low-income communities. The IRA also introduced the advanced manufacturing credit for US production of clean tech equipment and critical minerals.

Critically, the IRA enacted two new ways to monetize these tax credits, transferability and direct payment. These provisions opened the market to new investors and financing structures, significantly expanding participation in the clean energy economy.

Current Status

With a Republican trifecta now in place for control of the US House of Representatives, Senate, and presidency, the future of these tax benefits is unclear. Guidance on IRA tax provisions has largely halted. A regulatory freeze was imposed shortly after the new administration took office.

Additionally, lawmakers are pursuing a budget reconciliation bill that seeks to extend the 2017 tax cuts and enact other tax cuts, and limitation and accelerated sunset of IRA tax benefits and transferability monetization are being proposed as offsetting revenue raisers.

While the tax credit transfer market has flourished since the IRA’s enactment, with a wide range of buyers and sellers now active, uncertainty is dampening enthusiasm. Developers and investors are increasingly focused on demonstrating that projects began construction early enough to hopefully “safe harbor” from any new legislative changes. Still, no strategy offers absolute protection in the current climate until legislation becomes certain.

CONSIDERATIONS FOR PROJECT DEVELOPERS

In addition to the above policy shifts, regulatory uncertainty, and market disruptions, renewable energy developers must contend with the following:

Permitting Risk and Offshore Wind: The abrupt halt of the Empire Wind project, despite extensive permitting and billions in secured financing, has raised concerns about the durability of federal approvals. While the stop work order was recently lifted, the lack of notice or process surrounding the pause has not only caused the developer significant financial losses but also created broader uncertainty across the project finance market, calling into question whether other federally permitted projects could face similar disruptions.

Impacts of Prolonged Fossil Fuel Operations: Executive orders aimed at keeping coal plants online will have an impact on electricity markets. These legacy facilities were previously scheduled for retirement and their extended operation could slow investment in renewable energy projects in the short term.

Tariff Uncertainty and Supply Chain Disruption: The imposition of reciprocal tariffs has complicated procurement for solar and storage projects, particularly those relying on manufacturers based in Asia. Projects already under construction are particularly exposed, as fluctuating costs and delivery schedules impact budgets and financing arrangements.

Tax Credit Market Caution: As noted above, the post-IRA boom spurred by the new and enhanced tax credits and monetization methods brought many new participants into the clean energy deployment, manufacturing, and financing spaces. But with policy changes under consideration, some parties are pulling back, and financings based on tax credit monetization (including credit transfers) now face increased uncertainty in light of this risk. The financing market for IRA tax credit benefitting in-development projects has generally proceeded in earnest, but pricing and terms continue to evolve on a real-time basis to react to this legislative uncertainty.

Defensive Strategies: Developers are responding by advancing construction timelines to qualify under current tax rules, revisiting offtake agreements to reflect cost volatility, and exploring alternative suppliers to hedge against tariff-related delays and price swings. These risk mitigation efforts are becoming essential in project planning and execution.

CONCLUSION

While renewable energy demand remains strong, the policy landscape in 2025 has so far been defined by legal uncertainty and administrative changes. Executive orders, rescinded regulations, stalled guidance, and legislative developments are forcing developers and investors to rethink strategies, assess new risks, and act decisively to protect the viability of current and future projects.

In this environment, close monitoring of agency and legislative actions and developments, proactive project planning, and agile legal guidance are more important than ever. The road ahead may be uncertain, but for those who adapt opportunity remains.",https://www.morganlewis.com/-/media/images/tiles/energy-environmental/earth-day-webinar-series_478656454_240717_largetile.jpg?rev=ed5aa94be8174b3bb3a7c333c6bc6530&hash=691947489C864498F2DDA69BCCB3FE21,N,,2025-06-06 12:24:02.762298

(AP) — On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama’s administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they’ve collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

“We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press’ analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts See a Role for Registry in Cutting Emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to … document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that’s an inducement to lower emissions.

“It is money for those companies. It’s costs. It’s reputation. It’s been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country’s air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

“The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know” how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA Seeks to Cancel Money to Fund Some Monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group’s community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

In a new video conversation, environmental scientist Dana Nuccitelli, a research coordinator for the nonprofit Citizens’ Climate Lobby and Yale Climate Connections contributor, joins features editor Pearl Marvell of Yale Climate Connections to explain what’s at stake.

Passed by Democrats in 2022, the IRA invests hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years in clean energy, from electric vehicle tax credits to new solar panel factories. But now Republican Senators are considering a bill – already passed by the House – that would slash those investments to help fund their top priority: extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts.

Nuccitelli explains that repealing key parts of the IRA would eliminate hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy incentives. Ironically, the lion’s share of these benefits has gone to Republican-leaning districts, where land for clean energy development is most available.

Without the IRA’s support, communities that have seen new factories, battery storage sites, and solar farms could instead face layoffs, stalled projects, and rising power bills.

So why would lawmakers target a policy that’s creating jobs and boosting rural economies?

Nuccitelli says it’s less about favoring fossil fuel interests and more about a budget trade-off: Republican lawmakers are prioritizing extending the tax cuts and minimizing the federal deficit. Repealing the IRA’s tax credits – worth about $560 billion – is one way to help pay for that.

The result? Congress could undercut America’s clean energy boom just as it begins to take off.

Despite growing calls from both parties for Congress and federal agencies to reform that process, there had been few significant revisions—until now.

In one fell swoop, the U.S. Supreme Court has changed a big part of the game.

Whether the effects are good or bad depends on the viewer’s perspective. Either way, there is a new interpretation in place for the law that is the centerpiece of the debate about permitting—the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, known as NEPA.

Taking a big-picture look

NEPA requires federal agencies to document and describe the environmental effects of any proposed action, including construction of oil pipelines, renewable energy, and other infrastructure projects.

Only after completing that work can the agency make a final decision to approve or deny the project. These reports must evaluate direct effects, such as the destruction of habitat to make way for a new highway, and indirect effects, such as the air pollution from cars using the highway after it is built.

Decades of litigation about the scope of indirect effects have widened the required evaluation. As I explain it to my students, that logical and legal progression is reminiscent of the popular children’s book If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, in which granting a request for a cookie triggers a seemingly endless series of further requests—for a glass of milk, a napkin, and so on. For the highway example, the arguments went, even if the agency properly assessed the pollution from the cars, it also had to consider the new subdivisions, malls, and jobs the new highway foreseeably could induce.

The challenge for federal agencies was knowing how much of that potentially limitless series of indirect effects courts would require them to evaluate. In recent litigation, the question in particular has been how broad a range of effects on and from climate change could be linked to any one specific project and therefore require evaluation.

With the court’s ruling, federal agencies’ days of uncertainty are over.

Biggest NEPA case in decades

On May 29, 2025, the Supreme Court (minus Justice Neil Gorsuch, who had recused himself) decided the case of Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, the first major NEPA dispute before the court in 20 years.

At issue was an 85-mile rail line a group of developers proposed to build in Utah to connect oil wells to the interstate rail network and from there transport waxy crude oil to refineries in Louisiana, Texas, and elsewhere. The federal Surface Transportation Board reviewed the environmental effects and approved the required license in 2021.

The report was 637 pages long, with more than 3,000 pages of appendices containing additional information. It acknowledged but did not give a detailed assessment of the indirect “upstream” effects of constructing the rail line—such as spurring new oil drilling—and the indirect “downstream” effects of the ultimate use of the waxy oil in places as far-flung as Louisiana.

In February 2022, Eagle County, Colorado, through which trains coming from the new railway would pass, along with the Center for Biological Diversity appealed that decision in federal court, arguing that the board had failed to properly explain why it did not assess those effects. Therefore, the county argued, the report was incomplete and the board license should be vacated.

In August 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed and held that the agency had failed to adequately explain why it could not employ “some degree of forecasting” to identify those impacts and that the board could prevent those effects by exercising its authority to deny the license.

The railway developers appealed to the Supreme Court, asking whether NEPA requires a federal agency to look beyond the action being proposed to evaluate indirect effects outside its own jurisdiction.

A resounding declaration

Writing for a five-justice majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh delivered a ringing, table-pounding lecture about courts run amok.

Kavanaugh did not stop to provide specific support for each admonition, describing NEPA as a “legislative acorn” that has “grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development.” He bemoaned the “delay upon delay” NEPA imposes on projects as so complicated that it bordered “on the Kafkaesque.”

In his view, “NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents.” He called for “a course correction . . . to bring judicial review under NEPA back in line with the statutory text and common sense.” His opinion reset the course in three ways.

First, despite the Supreme Court having recently reduced the deference courts must give to federal agency decisions in other contexts, Kavanaugh wrote that courts should give agencies strong deference when reviewing an agency’s NEPA effects analyses. Because these assessments are “fact-dependent, context-specific, and policy-laden choices about the depth and breadth of its inquiry . . . (c)ourts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.”

Second, Kavanaugh crafted a new rule saying that the review of one project did not need to consider the potential indirect effects of other related projects it could foreseeably induce, such as the rail line encouraging more drilling for oil. This limitation is especially relevant, Kavanaugh emphasized, when the effects are from projects over which the reviewing agency does not have jurisdiction. That applied in this case, because the board does not regulate oil wells or oil drilling.

And third, Kavanaugh created something like a “no harm, no foul” rule, under which “even if an [environmental impact statement] falls short in some respects, that deficiency may not necessarily require a court to vacate the agency’s ultimate approval of a project.” The strong implication is that courts should not overturn an agency decision unless its NEPA assessment has a serious flaw.

The upshot for the project at hand was that the Supreme Court deferred to the board’s decision that it could not reliably predict the rail line’s effects on oil drilling or use of the oil transported. And the fact that the agency had no regulatory power over those separate issues reinforced the idea that those concerns were outside the scope of the board’s required review.

A split court

Although Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote that she would have reached the same end result and upheld the agency permit, her proposed test is far narrower.

By her reading, the federal law creating the Surface Transportation Board restricted it from considering the broader indirect effects of the rail line. But her finding would be relevant only for any federal agencies whose governing statutes were similarly restrictive. By contrast, Kavanaugh’s “course correction” applies to judicial review of NEPA findings for all federal agencies.

Though the full effects remain to be seen, this decision significantly changes the legal landscape of environmental reviews of major projects. Agencies will have more latitude to shorten the causal chain of indirect effects they consider, and to exclude them entirely if they flow from separate projects beyond the agency’s regulatory control.

Now, for example, if a federal agency is considering an application to build a new natural gas power plant, the review must still include its direct greenhouse gas emissions and their effects on the climate. But emissions that could result from additional gas extraction and transportation projects to fuel the power plant, and any climate effects from whatever the produced electricity is used for, are now clearly outside the agency’s required review. And if the agency voluntarily decided to consider any of those effects, courts would have to defer to its analysis, and any minor deficiencies would be inconsequential.

That is a far cry from how the legal structure around the National Environmental Policy Act has worked for decades. For lawyers, industry, advocacy groups, and the courts, environmental review after the Eagle County decision is not just a new ball game—it’s a new sport.

Moreover, automakers are expected to lead product replacement through 2029, with notable contributions from Tesla (22.4%), Honda (16.9%), Hyundai/Kia (16.5%), and Ford (16.1%). Those below the 16% industry average include Nissan (12.3%), Toyota (13.7%), and European legacy brands (15.2%). GM and Stellantis fall just below average at 15.7% and 15.4%, respectively.

Meanwhile, China is experiencing a market collapse due to extreme price wars and oversaturation. According to Nomura, average car prices have decreased by 19% over the past two years, with sharper declines for hybrids (–27%) and EVs (–21%). Murphy warned of looming consolidation among China’s hundreds of automakers and recommended shielding the U.S. market from an influx of cheap Chinese exports in the near term.

The report also notes a slowdown in the launch of new models. Automakers expect to release only 159 models over the next four years, down from more than 200 in previous cycles. Murphy noted that the “crossover surge is over,” as Detroit automakers focus on refreshing their full-size pickups, while Japanese manufacturers struggle with unpredictable production schedules.

Despite missed expectations in EVs and connectivity, Murphy still sees opportunities in automotive software and dealer services. He highlighted a $2.4 trillion aftermarket business, half of which is untapped by automakers. “It is vision critical that you get the dealers on board,” Murphy said, arguing that tech-driven service and sales strategies could unlock $133 billion in new profitability.

This year’s analysis is the 10th edition of the report and details energy investment trends through 2024 and the start of 2025. The investment surge reflects not only continued efforts to cut emissions, but also growing concerns over energy security and industrial competitiveness.

Investment in clean technologies is projected to draw $2.2 trillion and is double the investment expected in fossil fuels. This is driven by growth in renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, energy efficiency and electric transport. Solar PV alone is forecast to attract $450 billion, making it the single largest energy investment category worldwide. Nuclear power investment will exceed $70bn in 2025, representing a 50% increase over five years.

IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol noted that despite economic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions, energy security remains a powerful motivator for countries and companies alike. He clarified that, “The fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects.”

One of the biggest barriers is the lack of modern grid infrastructure. Investment in electricity grids, currently at $400 billion annually, is falling short of what's needed to keep up with renewable energy deployment and growing electricity demand. Prolonged permitting processes, supply chain delays and underfunded utilities, particularly in developing economies, are stalling progress.

Meanwhile, fossil fuel investment is expected to decline, with upstream oil spending set to fall by 6% in 2025- the sharpest drop since 2016, outside the COVID-19 pandemic. However, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is on a growth path, with major new projects in the US, Qatar, and Canada expected to expand global capacity significantly between 2026 and 2028.

Investment in clean technologies is still heavily concentrated in advanced economies, with China now the world’s largest energy investor, spending nearly as much as the US and EU combined. In contrast, regions like Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America continue to lag behind, raising concerns about the equity of the global energy transition: “Despite being home to 20% of the world’s population and rapidly growing energy demand, total investment across the continent has fallen by a third over the past decade due to declining fossil fuel spending and insufficient growth in clean energy.”

The IEA warns that while overall investment levels are moving in the right direction, achieving net-zero goals by mid-century will require more money from international public finance organisations, as well as more strategic and inclusive deployment of capital, particularly to developing countries.

Dive Brief:

A coalition of 175 mayors, city council members and county commissioners from 45 states and the District of Columbia signeda letter asking members of the Senate Finance Committee to preserve clean energy tax credits that would be rescinded in theOne Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The bill, currently being debated in the Senate,calls for rapidly phasing down tax credits for clean energy sources, including wind, solar and geothermal, that were part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The May 29 letter states the local leaders “are concerned that repealing these clean energy tax credits could create economic uncertainty in our communities.”

Dive Insight:

The Inflation Reduction Act made 13 clean energy tax credits available to state and local governments and public power utilities throughelective pay, a platform that allows them to receive a payment equal to the full value of a tax credit when they build qualifying clean energy projects, even if they do not owe Federal income taxes.

“For the first time, state and local governments, as well as essential nonprofit community organizations – such as houses of worship, hospitals, and schools – can access the same clean energy tax credits as the private sector through elective pay,” the letter states. “This has led to major projects in our communities like solar installations for town halls, alternative fueling infrastructure and charging stations for local government fleets of electric and alternative fueled vehicles, electric school buses, and more.”

More than 500 state and local governments are accessing the incentives, according to the letter. Repealing them would “raise energy costs by $489 a year for families, result in up to 97,000 net fewer American jobs, hurt private sector investments, slow economic growth, and make the U.S. less globally competitive,” the letter states.

The only energy emergency in the U.S. is the failure to transition fast enough to clean energy.","In the Trump administration’s latest attempt to try to prop up costly, polluting fossil fuel-burning power plants, the Department of Energy (DOE) ordered two power plants to keep operating, overturning long-time plans to retire the aging, polluting power plants.

The orders, which came just days or hours before each power plant was scheduled to retire, are part of an unprecedented power grab to override the decisions made in the interest of customers by power companies, grid operators, state utility regulators, and state legislators.

The DOE ordered the J.H. Campbell coal plant in West Olive, MI and two units of the Eddystone oil and gas power plant in Eddystone, PA to remain open for the summer.

Under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, a statute originally passed in the 1930s, Congress gave the DOE a last-resort option to solve energy reliability issues during emergencies such as hurricanes, wildfires, and extreme winter storms. In these recent moves, however, the administration is falsely invoking emergency powers in order to evade the usual legal and regulatory decision-making process.

These unprecedented actions threaten to keep some of the nation’s oldest and dirtiest power plants operating unnecessarily and could end up costing utility customers millions, especially if the orders get extended or renewed. Earthjustice will continue to fight on behalf of consumers and communities to resist this abuse of power.

Sham ‘Emergency’ Order Will Cost Utility Customers

DOE ordered the Campbell plant to continue operation just eight days before the power plant was scheduled to retire, as long-agreed to and planned for in a 2022 settlement that let the aging power plant substantially reduce its spending on major maintenance and capital projects needed for long term operation. The Campbell plant remains the largest source of air pollution and climate-harming emissions in western Michigan.

As part of the 2022 settlement, Consumers Energy (the owner of the power plant) already purchased another power plant to make up for the generation previously provided by Campbell, extended the lives of two other generating units, and is in the process of building or acquiring significant amounts of wind, solar, and storage resources. Continuing to operate an unnecessary and expensive coal plant threatens to saddle Consumers Energy customers with increased utility bills and dirtier air and is counter to the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040.

In addition to usurping the judgment of Michigan regulators, the utility, the state Attorney General, and numerous other parties who negotiated and approved the 2022 settlement, the Department of Energy order, if allowed to stand, will potentially cost Michiganders millions of dollars or more in order to further the Trump administration’s agenda to prop up expensive, dirty, and uncompetitive coal resources.

There is no evidence to support an emergency declaration. Consumers Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission, and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) have all concluded that there is no reliability risk created by Campbell’s retirement. The DOE order cites the most recent NERC assessment, but takes its conclusions out of context. NERC found an elevated risk of needing to make operational changes only by making “extreme” assumptions, and even then, confirmed that the risk can be addressed with available tools such as demand response and transfers of power from neighboring areas. Similarly, the MISO auction results “demonstrated sufficient capacity” by the order’s own admission.

Instead of addressing a genuine need, the order is a pretext for the Trump administration to justify propping up expensive and polluting coal generation. As Consumers Energy and the Michigan Public Service Commission found in the 2022 settlement, however, the planned retirement of the Campbell plant would save ratepayers money and reduce the public health impacts caused by burning coal. The cost of operating coal power plants has only gone up since then — and is likely to be heightened at the Campbell plant, where preparations were already well underway for the plant’s planned retirement.

Forcing Campbell Coal Plant to Operate is a Costly, Illegal Abuse of DOE’s Authority

There is no legal basis or precedent for the administration to grant the Secretary of Energy sole authority to force a retiring power plant to remain open. DOE’s role, as designated under Federal Power Act Section 202(c), is limited:

Section 202(c) only applies to wartime situations or certain unexpected emergencies such as hurricanes or wildfires that pose an immediate threat.

The law limits the solutions that the Secretary can order to “temporary interconnections” and directives concerning the flow of electricity. Longer-term issues and planning decisions are made in processes before state commissions and other bodies.

If an order conflicts with environmental requirements, the law requires that such conflicts be minimized as much as possible and limits the order to only the hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest.

In overstepping these restrictions, DOE’s orders will not hold up in court. And DOE’s orders cannot substantiate an “emergency” that does not exist.

Myriad planning processes and operational protocols exist to ensure that the power stays on. States, for example, often require utilities to conduct Integrated Resource Plans that look years into the future in order to plan for resource mix and adequate total supply to meet demand under a range of scenarios. Depending on the region, states or regional grid operators ensure there is enough excess generation to meet “planning reserve margins.” Additionally, NERC works with stakeholders to develop reliability standards, which are binding and enforceable once approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

In addition to these proactive planning measures, grid operators conduct reliability studies whenever a generator announces it plans to shut down. If the study reveals that a grid reliability issue would be caused by the plant’s retirement, it explores solutions to the reliability issue, including temporarily allowing the plant to operate with a special agreement, filed at FERC, to recoup its costs.

In light of the robust, multi-layered system to ensure electric system reliability, especially in recent decades, DOE has generally used its 202(c) authority only in truly time-sensitive emergencies affecting the power system. As a result, previous orders have recognized that extra generation is likely only needed for limited hours, and usually include requests that consumers reduce their electricity usage. These orders insist that utilities use tools with less or no environmental harm before authorizing operation of generation under narrowly tailored emergency circumstances. In contrast, by directing the broader continued operation of dirty fossil fuel plants like Campbell without an actual emergency situation, the Trump DOE disregards state policy, energy affordability, and the limits imposed on its authority by Congress.

DOE’s order to force ongoing operation of the Eddystone plant makes the political agenda motivating these claims of “emergency” more explicit. The order states that DOE plans to evaluate Eddystone again in the future, under a yet-to-be-published methodology for evaluating power plants’ contributions to the grid required by executive order. But DOE cannot use a poorly substantiated Section 202(c) to halt a power plant’s retirement merely as a placeholder until DOE can contrive a new rationale. The only energy emergency in the U.S. is the failure to transition fast enough to clean energy. This administration has tried to throttle domestic energy production by pausing all wind energy projects, halting funding for hundreds of clean energy projects across the U.S., and proposing to gut DOE’s budget for offices that administer programs for solar and wind energy, energy efficiency, and the office that helps upgrade America’s electric infrastructure.

Coal use has been falling for decades. Forcing power companies to run polluting fossil fuel plants they do not need will not only harm our health, the climate, and communities, but also our wallets. Renewable sources of energy are now less expensive than coal for almost every coal plant in the country. These orders and the President’s executive order on grid reliability threaten a political takeover of the electricity grid, granting the Secretary of Energy the sole authority to override markets, states, FERC, and NERC to bolster uneconomic and polluting fossil fuels.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-06-06 12:24:35.262248

Inside its warehouse in Stillwater, USA Rare Earth is rushing to assemble massive machines that will eventually produce up to 5,000 tons of magnets per year. According to Ballard, that will equal about 10% of U.S. demand.

""Right now, we have to ask permission from China in order to get the magnets and minerals we need for our defense technologies,"" Ballard said. ""...This is an incredible choke point for this country.""

In April, the Trump administration announced an economic investment deal with Ukraine designed to give the U.S. access to Ukraine's rare earths, a move that comes amid the White House's trade disputes with China.

Ballard showed CBS News a small-scale laboratory that is showcasing what could be possible. Inside, engineers are refining the volatile rare earth metals, cooking and compressing them into tiny but powerful magnets.

Meta and energy producer Constellation Energy announced a 20-year nuclear power purchase agreement on Tuesday that will give the social media and tech conglomerate access to zero emissions power for its artificial intelligence goals and help keep an Illinois facility online.

The agreement will give Meta 1,121 MW of nuclear energy beginning in June 2027 from Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. The PPA will also support the relicensing and continued operations of the Illinois power plant when a state zero emissions energy tax credit expires in 2027.

Meta is among a growing number of tech giants who have turned to nuclear to help offset growing data center energy needs driven by artificial intelligence. The company previously released requests for proposals seeking up to 4 GW of new nuclear energy generation capacity to support its “AI innovation and sustainability objectives.”

Dive Insight:

Meta’s deal will also allow Constellation to expand the facility to generate an additional 30 MW of power during the 20-year extension of operations, which will also preserve more than 1,000 jobs and deliver an estimated $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the June 3 release.

The Clinton Clean Energy Center had previously been saved by a state zero emissions tax credit program, after it was slated for closure in 2017. Meta’s power purchase agreement is designed to replace that credit and support the continued operations of the plant “without ratepayer support,” according to Constellation.

Meta Head of Global Energy Urvi Parekh said in the release that in addition to ensuring the long-term operation of the plant and preserving jobs, the deal demonstrates that “this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.” The deal will also aid the global tech and social media conglomerate in its goal to reach zero emissions across its supply chain by 2030.

“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Parekh said.

Constellation said it is also exploring strategies that would extend an existing early site permit at the plant or approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop either an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor at the Illinois site.

This deal marks the second high-profile nuclear power purchase agreement Constellation has signed with a tech giant, following Microsoft’s 20-year agreement with the energy producer last fall. This deal will restart operations for a nuclear generator at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island facility in 2028.

Constellation CEO and President Joseph Dominguez said that after its plans to restart the Three Mile Island facility became national news, Meta questioned why “such a valuable plant” would be allowed to close in the first place, then “figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy.”

Meta — along with fellow tech giants Google and Amazon — was among a group of “large energy users” who signed a pledge to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050 at S&P Global’s CERAWeek conference in March.

And the type of players that are now able to enter the market has broadened significantly.”

A Wednesday report from Crux, a finance technology company that connects tax credit buyers and sellers, said lenders are “increasingly” looking to finance less established technologies like carbon capture, and that “this openness is supported by the robust and progressively more liquid market for transferable tax credits.”

Raniwala said that financing had previously relied on the tax equity market, which “was limited in capacity. The industry wanted to be bigger.”

“If you really want to have a dominant energy industry which has abundance of supply to help with electrification, to help with all the AI stuff, we need all sources of energy out there,” he said. “And I think what transferability did was it broadened the market from just traditional tax equity to a whole host of players.”

Crux’s analysis said that “tax equity structures have evolved to hybrid structures, or t-flips, which explicitly contemplate the sale of a portion of tax credits in the transfer market” and found that t-flips “made up about 60% of the tax equity committed in 2024, and that share is expected to rise.”

“Historically, the tax equity market was about a $20 billion a year market dominated for many years by a handful of institutions,” said panelist Meghan Schultz, executive vice president and CFO at Invenergy. “And with the transferability market, the size more than doubled … it allows the tax investor, the tax credit buyer, to be able to monetize those tax benefits without actually needing to be an owner in the project.”

Raniwala noted that transactions can also now be customized based on credit profile. “As an example, you could do the traditional tax equity, but now you know you can transfer the credits, so you could also borrow against those credits from banks.”

Despite this sea change for project financing, transferability itself is endangered, as the budget bill that passed the House last month would eliminate or severely restrict transferability for the credits included in the IRA — and eliminate or shave down the credits themselves.

“The medium-term policy environment contains significant uncertainty, which investors in clean energy and manufacturing projects must navigate,” Crux said.

Crux’s report noted that the Senate will have to pass its own version of the budget, and “senators have telegraphed their desire to make substantive changes to the House’s version. That said, the near-term uncertainty may lead some developers to face higher costs of capital, more limited capital availability, or higher equity requirements as they seek to finance their projects.”

Despite looming threats to the IRA, Crux’s report took a bullish stance overall on the U.S. clean energy economy, noting that it “directed nearly $340 billion in new investment in the United States last year.”

One factor driving new projects is the added transaction speed offered by transferability.

The tax credit trade has “allowed people to close financing much more quickly, to not need to have that tax equity or tax credit buyer lined up at close, knowing that there is this liquid market for the tax credits,” Schultz said. “It’s facilitated speed to market for projects, because you can be efficient in your financing.” The lowered cost of debt and added flexibility of being able to lend against the expected transfer of your credits has also streamlined the process, she said.

David Haug, CEO of Bildmore Clean Energy, said the option to transfer the credits allows developers to choose “whether you want to have a long term offtake contract, or a long term revenue contract or a hedge to lock in your revenues or not.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/lEsJQUbBSWmsnW8h62oIQMypKsdQTCbq-HKsG6_tEh8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjAyMTEwODA4XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-06 11:22:06.751846

Campbell plant.
Campbell order in a post on the website of its Count on Coal campaign and in a video.
In 2016, Peabody Energy had to disclose it paid $50,000 to IER over the previous two years.","A Department of Energy memorandum identified significant logistical challenges facing the Trump administration’s last-minute order to prevent the closure of the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in Michigan.

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the order on May 23, just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down on May 31st. Wright’s order invokes wartime powers typically reserved for temporary electric grid emergencies related to extreme weather, but Michigan’s top state utility regulator says no energy emergency exists to warrant the order.

The DOE memo was also dated May 23 and marked as privileged and Controlled Unclassified Information, or CUI. The memo identifies “SENSITIVITIES” and makes clear the “challenges” the plant’s owner Consumers Energy may face if forced by Wright to reverse course on the closure after years of preparations and planning:

Past the planned retirement date of May 31, Consumers has ended its contracts for coal procurement, coal delivery, and power plant staffing and may face challenges with addressing these issues on short notice. The order provides reasonable last-minute contract extensions for fuel and operations, if feasible.

The memo was addressed to Wright and from Alex Fitzsimmons, a Trump DOE political appointee who previously held jobs at organizations funded by one of the power plant’s coal suppliers. Fitzsimmons recommended in the memo that Wright approve the order.

Fitzsimmons’ memo was initially posted publicly on DOE’s website, but the link where the memo was previously found now leads to a “Page not found” message. The existence of the memo was mentioned last week by the local news site Hollander.News.

Tyler Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, said Wright’s order “serves no purpose beyond attempting to prop up the dying coal industry.”

“We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed,” Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps said. “The unnecessary recent order from the U.S. Department of Energy will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses across the Midwest.”

The cost of procuring additional coal and keeping the plant open will fall on customers of Consumers Energy and other utilities located within the 15-state Midwest Independent System Operator regional power grid, which the J.H. Campbell plant is connected to. Consumers Energy previously estimated the plant’s closure would save its customers in Michigan $600 million. Wright’s order expires on August 21, meaning the plant could still close soon unless the order is extended.

The latest fuel receipt data available from the Energy Information Administration identifies the North Antelope Rochelle and Black Thunder coal mines in Wyoming as suppliers of coal for the power plant. The Black Thunder Mine is owned by Core Natural Resources, the fossil fuel company formed by the merger of Arch Coal and CONSOL Energy.

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reports that Peabody Energy provided 1.47 million tons of coal to the J.H. Campbell plant last year. Peabody Energy told the Cowboy State News in Wyoming last week that it supplies coal to other plants in Michigan, but not to the J.H. Campbell plant.

After Wright signed the J.H. Campbell order last month, Peabody Energy called for further action to “halt coal plant retirements, use existing plants at higher utilization and restart shuttered coal plants.”

James Grech, the CEO of Peabody Energy, attended the White House ceremony in April where Trump signed an executive order commanding Wright to use DOE’s emergency powers under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to prevent the closure of coal plants. Peabody Energy and Core Natural Resources’ stock value jumped after Trump signed the executive order, along with several others benefiting the coal industry.

The National Mining Association (NMA) praised Wright’s J.H. Campbell order in a post on the website of its Count on Coal campaign and in a video. NMA reported lobbying the White House and DOE on the use of Federal Power Act authorities earlier this year. Paul Lang, the CEO of Core Natural Resources, is currently the chairman of NMA’s board of directors.

Wright signed another Section 202(c) order late last week to prevent the closure of the Eddystone gas plant in Pennsylvania, in another move opposed by environmental groups like the Sierra Club, which warned it would hurt everyday utility customers.

Trump political appointee Alex Fitzsimmons, who previously worked for organizations funded by Peabody Energy, recommended Chris Wright issue the order

Fitzsimmons was tapped last month to lead DOE’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) after serving as Wright’s chief of staff since January.

Fitzsimmons previously served as a political appointee in DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy during Trump’s first term as president. In between Trump’s terms in the White House, Fitzsimmons worked for an energy storage company and for ClearPath, a conservative group that’s supportive of clean energy but holds a favorable view of fossil fuels.

Fitzsimmons worked on energy policy for the Institute for Energy Research (IER) and its lobbying arm the American Energy Alliance (AEA) from January 2013 to April 2014 and again from November 2014 to January 2017.

At IER/AEA, Fitzsimmons was part of a long-running campaign by right-wing groups aligned with the fossil fuel industry to roll back state renewable energy standards that have helped power the growth of wind and solar power.

“Launched an in-house ghostwriting shop that crafts, pitches, and places op-eds on behalf of partner organizations,” Fitzsimmons said of his work for IER/AEA on a resume obtained from DOE by American Oversight.

In 2016, Peabody Energy had to disclose it paid $50,000 to IER over the previous two years. The disclosure came in Peabody Energy’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, where the coal producer also had to reveal its funding of multiple climate change denial and anti-clean energy groups.

Peabody Energy also listed AEA as a creditor in its bankruptcy case.

Fitzsimmons spent eight months in 2014 at the corporate public relations firm Berman & Company, where he worked with a front group called the Environmental Policy Alliance that attacked environmental conservation groups like Trout Unlimited. Peabody Energy later listed Berman & Company as a creditor in its bankruptcy.

Fitzsimmons also worked for a year and a half in 2016-2017 as the Director of Communications for the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce’s pro-fossil fuels Fueling U.S. Forward campaign. Fitzsimmons described the experience on his resume:

As the first hire for a multi-million dollar energy-advocacy campaign funded by Koch Industries and led by former AFPM President Charles Drevna, I managed the public launch of the organization in 2016 and am responsible for developing and executing the communications and digital-media strategy.

Koch Industries is the petrochemical company helmed by billionaire conservative megadonor Charles Koch. AFPM is the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. Wright was an outspoken member of Koch’s network of political donors before he was tapped to become Trump’s Energy Secretary in November.

AEA endorsed Trump for president during the 2016 election. After Trump won, he also picked several of Fitzsimmons’ former IER colleagues to serve on his presidential transition team and as DOE political appointees during his first term. Among them was Travis Fisher, who co-authored a DOE grid study that Trump’s first Secretary of Energy Rick Perry used as a pretense for a failed 2017 proposal to bail out struggling coal and nuclear plants. Perry’s proposal would have cost consumers billions of dollars if it hadn’t been rejected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Perry spoke openly in 2017 about the administration’s “very classified” conversations about using national security as a pretext for preempting state climate change and clean energy policies. In January, Trump declared a national energy emergency and cited what he called “dangerous State and local policies [that] jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs” in an executive order signed on the first day of his second term.

In April, seven Republican state lawmakers from Michigan signed a letter to the Trump administration attributing the J.H. Campbell plant’s closure to the 100 percent clean electricity by 2040 law enacted by Michigan in 2023. Consumers Energy first announced plans to phase out its use of coal in 2018, and the Michigan Public Service Commission later approved a multi-party agreement to close the J.H. Campbell plant by 2025 and invest in cleaner sources of electricity like solar and energy storage.

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families,” Wright said in a DOE press release last month announcing the order to keep the J.H. Campbell plant running until August.

IER published a post this week highlighting Wright’s order as “contrary” to Michigan’s clean electricity law and “Consumers Energy’s plans to remove coal entirely from its fleet by closing the Campbell plant.”

Trump’s executive order revamps a failed first-term attempt to use Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to bail out coal-fired power plants for the benefit of top donors

In 2018, a leaked memorandum revealed the Trump administration was considering using Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and the Defense Production Act to bail out coal plants struggling to compete with cheaper and cleaner forms of electricity. Trump abandoned that first-term effort amid concerns from advisors like Larry Kudlow that the public would view the move as a bailout.

The electric utility FirstEnergy later admitted to federal prosecutors that it secretly paid $5 million in 2017 to America First Policies, a group formed by Trump insiders to support Trump’s agenda, as it lobbied the Trump administration for a Section 202(c) bailout for its coal and nuclear power plants.

FirstEnergy was joined in the push by coal producers Murray Energy, which contributed $1 million to the pro-Trump Super PAC America First Action in 2017, and Alliance Resource Partners.

Joe Craft, the CEO of Alliance Alliance Resource Partners, attended Trump’s pro-coal executive order signing ceremony in April. Craft contributed $1 million to Elon Musk’s pro-Trump America PAC last year.

“AESC has invested over $1 billion into the Florence facility, and we anticipate being able to resume construction once circumstances stabilize,"" AESC spokesman Brad Grantham said in a statement sent to media.
That money invested by AESC is in addition to the millions of dollars invested by the state and Florence County.

""It's incredibly impactful,"" from jobs, housing, planned development and potential suppliers to AESC, Kirby said.","AESC, an electric car battery maker, says it's hitting pause on construction of the company's $1.6 billion facility in Florence County.

In a Thursday statement, AESC cited policy and market uncertainty for the pause. State and local leaders were informed of the decision Thursday.

The Japanese manufacturer's announcement comes as the Trump administration pushes and implements higher tariffs and the budget reconciliation bill in Congress — known as the Big Beautiful Bill — seeks to end electric vehicle tax credits.

“AESC has invested over $1 billion into the Florence facility, and we anticipate being able to resume construction once circumstances stabilize,"" AESC spokesman Brad Grantham said in a statement sent to media. ""AESC fully intends to meet our commitments to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs in the coming years.”

The battery cells made at the plant will be used for BMW's high-voltage battery plant in Woodruff. BMW Manufacturing said the company has already invested $700 million into the plant, which is expected to start assembling cars next year.

That money invested by AESC is in addition to the millions of dollars invested by the state and Florence County.

""This is a gut punch. Simple as I know to put it,"" state Rep. Roger Kirby, a Florence Democrat, told SC Public Radio by phone Thursday. ""It's just unimageable really.""

Despite the company's promises, Kirby said he's concerned the pause could last longer than a few months. That extension, he said, would likely have an impact on other EV-related companies in South Carolina.

Late last month, production at Volvo's Ridgeville plant temporarily paused. The company said it was due to a supply chain issue.

The impact of a longer delay would also affect the Pee Dee region, Kirby said.

""It's incredibly impactful,"" from jobs, housing, planned development and potential suppliers to AESC, Kirby said.

Gov. Henry McMaster told reporters Thursday that his office is in contact with the state’s federal delegation and White House.

SC Public Radio has reached out to the offices of U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott for comment.

The state Commerce Department said ""we are fully and unequivocally committed to supporting existing companies including AESC.""

For now, McMaster urged patience.

""There is a lot of uncertainty in the reconciliation bill, whether (those) tax credits will still be in there or incentives. Of course, with the tariffs, the tariffs are going up and down. Some of those are being paused,"" McMaster said.

To that end, it takes pains to make a key distinction between “carbon capture” — which includes technologies that filter CO2 from industrial sources — and “carbon removal” like Heirloom’s, which draws existing carbon out of the atmosphere.
“For those earlier-stage startups who are not backed by a large corporation or multinational, I think you could see this as absolutely devastating,” said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, a trade group.
To that end, the company is trying to win over wary opponents who argue that any climate dollars should go toward nearer-term reductions.
California lawmakers this week advanced a bill to require the state to purchase $50 million in carbon removal credits between 2026 and 2035.","Another win in progress: While last week’s House-passed megabill would gut the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for renewables and nuclear power by tightening their construction deadlines to near-impossibilities, it leaves the IRA’s credits for carbon capture largely intact, other than cutting the credits’ transferability to third parties.

Carbon capture has plenty of enemies on the left, where it’s often viewed as a nascent, expensive distraction from reducing emissions in the near term. But it’s the right that wields influence over the huge pots of money that are the Biden administration’s biggest climate legacy — and as Republicans prepare to decimate incentives for renewable resources like solar, wind and geothermal energy, carbon capture has managed to weather the storm better than many other climate technologies.

Heirloom is as savvy an operator as any, having announced its Louisiana facility in 2023 in conjunction with Climeworks and Battelle on the back of an initial $50 million award from the bipartisan infrastructure law. The company is pursuing a two-pronged policy strategy: It’s trying to win over the right with the promise of jobs and heavy industry in their districts, and the left with the additional promise of a way to tackle climate change — with caveats about it not being a substitute for other emissions reductions. To that end, it takes pains to make a key distinction between “carbon capture” — which includes technologies that filter CO2 from industrial sources — and “carbon removal” like Heirloom’s, which draws existing carbon out of the atmosphere.

“By building in California, you get the door knocks from the Microsofts of the world,” Vikrum Aiyer, the company’s head of global public policy, told me on a tour last month of its first plant, on the agricultural eastern outskirts of the Bay Area, over the hum of a kiln that heats up the limestone to extract the captured CO2. “By building in Louisiana, we get more companies interested in ‘How do I use this CO2 for other things?’”

Choosing Louisiana was a prescient bet. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration pleaded the project’s case after it ended up on the Energy Department’s preliminary hit list.

“I urge you to contact DOE Secretary Chris Wright and ask him to take every necessary step to advance this critically needed federal grant,” Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bonnett Bourgeois wrote to the state’s congressional delegation.

Local port commissioners and business groups chimed in, too; an April letter touted the project’s ability to “generate demand for American-made steel, concrete, and advanced equipment, revitalizing our industrial heartland.”

It probably also helped that Heirloom was a relative old-timer, getting its funding award in August 2023; two-thirds of the projects on the kill list received final approval after the November election. But either way, avoiding being on the list was a significant victory, given how much work remains to get the technologies to economic viability.

“For those earlier-stage startups who are not backed by a large corporation or multinational, I think you could see this as absolutely devastating,” said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, a trade group.

The Senate is currently working through the megabill, but the House version’s 2033 deadline to start construction works for Heirloom, which is banking on the preservation of the existing $180-per-ton tax credit to remove CO2 as well as permanently store it (in concrete, at its plant in California, and in an underground well, in Louisiana). Another $130-per-ton credit, for using the carbon, would help it capitalize on its recently announced deal with United Airlines to incorporate it into jet fuel.

That would all go a decent way to helping the company get beyond the initial corporate buyers — Microsoft, Meta, McKinsey and JP Morgan among them — willing to shell out the roughly $600 per ton that direct-air capture currently costs. (It needs to get down to about $100 per ton to make it attractive to companies that have to reduce their emissions under government climate programs in California and the European Union, for example.)

Heirloom’s strategy on the left, meanwhile, involves trying to cobble together more funding for research and development to get the cost down further while allaying environmental groups’ concerns that the technology will enable industrial emitters to keep polluting.

Heirloom is hoping to leverage California’s carbon-trading program, which generates billions in proceeds from the sale of emissions permits to industry. It’s backing an “advanced climate technology” fund for industrial decarbonization technologies, pegged to the state’s 2022 climate roadmap that envisions carbon removal contributing to 15 percent of the state’s goal to get to net-zero emissions by 2045.

To that end, the company is trying to win over wary opponents who argue that any climate dollars should go toward nearer-term reductions. “Could that someday be a realistic part of the solution?” former Vice President Al Gore, one of the most powerful climate voices on the left, said of carbon capture in a speech in April in San Francisco. “Perhaps. But not now. Not even close.”

Carbon capture is “probably the most expensive and the least reliable thing that we could possibly be doing right now,” Katie Valenzuela, a consultant for environmental justice groups, said on a panel at a Sacramento climate conference in April.

“I recognize I’m not coming into this room as a very popular dude,” Aiyer responded. “We have to earn your trust. I get that.”

But they’re having some success there, too. California lawmakers this week advanced a bill to require the state to purchase $50 million in carbon removal credits between 2026 and 2035.

Another bill would lift California’s moratorium on carbon dioxide pipelines, which Heirloom would need if it scales up enough to move large volumes to storage wells or other sites. “There’s a huge opportunity here,” said Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, its author, who joined last month’s tour of the Tracy facility.

For now, much of Heirloom’s fate is in the hands of the Senate, where their industry-friendly pitch to the right might allow them to slip through the Trump administration’s net once again. And as other emissions-cutting efforts fall to Republicans’ machete, time is on their side.

“By 2050, we need to start taking down six to 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year for the rest of the century,” Aiyer said, “if we stand any chance of realizing either the temperature goals or the Paris Accords.”

Carbon capture might not be a favorite among progressives yet, but with the Trump administration’s gutting of other climate projects, companies like Heirloom may be some of the only ones left.",https://static.politico.com/31/a0/f4caa292449e8a3b390f66ccd839/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1753047155,N,,2025-06-06 11:22:38.179949

Ireland’s Emissions Targets

Ireland’s national target is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 51% by 2030. However, even with full implementation of current climate policies and measures, emissions are projected to fall by only up to 23%, a drop from last year’s projection of 29%. Almost all sectors are on a trajectory to miss their emissions targets.

Here’s a look at some sector-by-sector snapshots of projected emissions by 2030 (compared to 2018 levels):

🐄 Agriculture: Emissions projection - Range of 1% increase to 16% decrease by 2030. Measures to reduce emissions include limits on nitrogen fertiliser usage, switching to different fertilisers and bovine feed additives.

🚚 Transport: Emissions projection - Reduction of up to 21% by 2030. Measures to reduce emissions include 640k EVs on the road by 2030, increased biofuel blend rates and measures to support more sustainable transport.

🏠 Residential: Emissions projection - Reduction of up to 22% by 2030. Measures to reduce emissions include 571k domestic heat pumps projected to be installed by 2030.

Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will boost $2.45 billion in additional income and support 31,500 full-time jobs for Missourians annually.
Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits.","On May 22, the U.S. House voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m disappointed to see that the House advanced this legislation.

Make no mistake: These cuts will hurt Missouri if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution, and threaten growing economic investments we’ve seen in Missouri. The House passage of this bill just put these investments at risk.

Federal tax credits — designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. — have been working. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, Missouri has benefited from $2.5 billion of investment from 10 projects, that have led to the creation of 2,400 jobs.

The tax credits were passed by Democrats, so they have been an easy target for Republican attacks. But the legislation has overwhelmingly benefited Republican-held districts — 78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP. That includes Missouri, where companies like Ameren and ICL have announced major investments thanks to these tax credits.

But that success story could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Rolling back these tax credits means Missouri ratepayers will face electricity prices that are 12% higher in the coming years, putting us (and many of our neighbors) in the top 15 states with highest price impacts from 2026 onwards.

Manufacturing will slow. Phasing out tax credits that support clean energy manufacturing could jeopardize long-term projects like US Strategic Metal’s battery recycling and manufacturing facilities in Fredericktown. Eliminating clean vehicle tax credits could put up to 100% of planned EV plant construction and a significant portion of existing capacity at risk, according to industry analysis.

Households and local businesses will take a huge hit. A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades like rooftop solar is a blow to Missourians who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills. Incentives have made it easier for homeowners to install solar panels, save money, and even help stabilize America’s power grid.

But those benefits — and the local businesses that depend on them — are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts.

By contrast, if Congress protects clean energy tax credits, it would be a huge boost to Missouri’s economy over the next decade. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will boost $2.45 billion in additional income and support 31,500 full-time jobs for Missourians annually. That’s not hypothetical — that’s real money and real livelihoods for Missourians.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits. Four Republican senators recently sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

The numbers are clear: clean energy tax credits are working for Missouri. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. I urge Missouri Sens. Hawley and Schmitt to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect these tax credits.

This investment represents Airex Energy’s first step toward scaling global biochar production, a product that will help many businesses here and abroad achieve net zero.” — Michel Gagnon, CEO of Airex Energy and Chair of Carbonity's Board.
Alongside Airex Energy and SUEZ, we are building a new economy—future-focused and environmentally committed.
“We are delighted to contribute to this pioneering biochar production project in Canada.
“I’m thrilled to see the Carbonity project come to life.","Airex Energy, an innovative leader in the development of world-class decarbonization solutions, Groupe Rémabec, a cornerstone of Quebec's forest industry committed to responsible transformation and decarbonization, and SUEZ, a global leader in circular solutions for water and waste, are inaugurating Carbonity on May 22—the first industrial-scale biochar plant in Canada, located in Port-Cartier.

Born from a partnership between the three companies, the plant begins with an annual production capacity of 10,000 metric tons of biochar, which is expected to triple by 2026, making it the largest facility of its kind in North America—and one of the most important globally. Biochar is recognized by the IPCC as one of the most effective technologies to combat climate change due to its long-term carbon sequestration capacity. In addition, its many benefits enhance agricultural resilience, drive sustainable innovation in construction and urban development, and support the decarbonization of heavy industries.

Biochar: A Decarbonization Tool for Multiple Industries

Biochar is produced through pyrolysis—a process of carbonizing residual biomass at high temperatures without oxygen.

When used as a soil amendment, biochar enhances nutrient and water retention, aeration, drainage, and microbial activity. It regenerates soil, increases fertilizer efficiency, improves crop yields, and aids water drainage—key advantages for the agriculture sector. It can also be added to livestock feed to promote animal health and reduce methane emissions.

When integrated into concrete, cement, or asphalt, biochar enhances material performance while significantly lowering their carbon footprint—addressing a major challenge in sustainable construction and urban development. Its production also yields surplus energy in the form of steam or pyrolytic oil, which can be used as fuel.

Cities are increasingly using biochar to process organic waste and combat flooding. Its absorbent qualities make it ideal for creating ""sponge parks."" It also supports the remediation of contaminated soils.

An Innovative Facility Driven by Three Pioneers of the Transition

Carbonity, located in Northern Québec, is an equally held joint venture between the three partner organizations. It will create 75 direct and indirect jobs in the region and produce carbon-rich biochar from approximately 58,000 tonnes of forestry residues annually, sourced from Groupe Rémabec’s operations. Carbonity is powered by Airex Energy’s proprietary technology. Its proprietary and patented DryFX™ and CarbonFX™ technologies are at the heart of the plant’s innovative process. SUEZ brings key expertise in organic waste recovery, the production of amendments and biofertilizers, and the development of circular solutions to help clients reduce their carbon footprint.

This project marks the first step in Airex Energy and SUEZ’s ambitious roadmap to build a global annual production capacity of 350,000 tonnes of biochar by 2035 to meet the decarbonization challenges of industrial operations.

“The inauguration of Carbonity is a true industrial milestone for Québec. Airex Energy’s technology, including our patented CarbonFX and DryFX solutions, is central to this success, and it makes us very proud. Our primary mission is to contribute to the decarbonization of our economy. This investment represents Airex Energy’s first step toward scaling global biochar production, a product that will help many businesses here and abroad achieve net zero.” — Michel Gagnon, CEO of Airex Energy and Chair of Carbonity's Board.

“Today, we continue an extraordinary journey that is shaping the future of forestry and asserting Quebec’s leadership in bioproduct development. Alongside Airex Energy and SUEZ, we are building a new economy—future-focused and environmentally committed. At Port-Cartier, we’re betting on innovation and boldness to convert our forest residues into sustainable economic value. This project breathes new life into a long-neglected industrial site, giving it a promising future. Thanks to strong partnerships, cutting-edge technology, and a clear vision, we are positioning ourselves as a global player while diversifying our products and markets for a better future.” — Réjean Paré, President and Chief Operating Officer, Groupe Rémabec.

“We are delighted to contribute to this pioneering biochar production project in Canada. Identified by the IPCC as a negative-emissions solution, biochar is effective in fighting climate change and aligns with SUEZ’s waste recovery activities. We believe biochar will play a key role in the ecological transition of industry. That’s why we aim, alongside Airex Energy, to produce 350,000 tonnes of biochar annually by 2035, providing our customers committed to carbon neutrality with innovative solutions to reduce their residual emissions.” — Yves Rannou, Interim Co-CEO, SUEZ, and Head of Recycling.

“The inauguration of Carbonity marks a pivotal step toward a new, more sustainable forestry model rooted in today’s economic and environmental realities, and serving the ecological and industrial transition of tomorrow. Taking part in this Canadian first is a tremendous source of pride.” — Patrick Girard, General Manager, Carbonity.

This project was made possible thanks to the vision and financial support of the governments of Quebec and Canada.

“The federal government is proud to have contributed to this flagship project supporting the establishment of a new subsidiary in Canada. Biochar is a key solution for carbon sequestration, with additional benefits for agriculture, the development of resilient cities, and the support of a diversified forestry industry.” — Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister of Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions.

“I’m thrilled to see the Carbonity project come to life. The new automated plant will generate significant economic and social benefits in Côte-Nord, including the creation of highly specialized jobs. It also strengthens the region’s forestry sector, which plays a key role in our economy.” — Kateri Champagne Jourdain, Minister of Employment, Minister Responsible for the Côte-Nord region, and Member for Duplessis.

“Carbonity is helping accelerate decarbonization in key sectors across Quebec. Our government is proud to have invested more than $16 million in this project, which leverages innovative technology and contributes to building a prosperous, sustainable economy.” — Christine Fréchette, Minister of Economy, Innovation and Energy, and Minister responsible for Regional Economic Development.

“With Carbonity, Port-Cartier becomes a leader in sustainable innovation. By transforming our forest residues into biochar, we are smartly harnessing local resources while creating lasting jobs. This is a flagship project that proves environmental protection and economic development can go hand in hand. It’s a great source of pride to see our community become a model of responsible development.” — Alain Thibault, Mayor of Port-Cartier.

At full capacity, the plant will sequester 75,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per year. This output will generate certified and guaranteed carbon credits, marketed on the voluntary market by First Climate. In 2024, Microsoft selected Carbonity to purchase 36,000 carbon credits over the first three years of operations.

“The official launch of Carbonity is an important step in international climate protection through technical carbon removal solutions, demonstrating that biochar technology can scale. We are thrilled by the strong interest our clients have shown in Carbonity, supporting the continued development of carbon removal technology.” — Olaf Bachert, CEO, First Climate.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Airex_Energy_June25_476c16f428.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 15:12:01.173164

If successful, the Lucid and Graphite One partnership would establish a U.S. source of graphite materials for EV batteries for the carmaker.","Dive Brief:

Lucid Group has signed a second agreement with Graphite One for U.S.-sourced materials needed for lithium-ion batteries as the electric car maker seeks to strengthen its domestic supply chain, according to a June 4 press release.

The latest agreement will provide Lucid and its battery cell suppliers with natural graphite from the Graphite Creek deposit north of Nome, Alaska, where Graphite One expects to begin production in 2028, per the release.

The deal complements a 2024 pact in which Graphite One agreed to provide Lucid and its battery cell suppliers with graphite processed for use in battery anodes, starting in 2028, the release said. The active anode material (AAM) would come from Graphite One's planned plant in Warren, Ohio.

Dive Insight:

Lucid has increased U.S.-based battery-electric-vehicle production as part of its strategy for weathering tariff uncertainty. Executives have highlighted the company's efforts to localize critical supplies, including the transition to Panasonic's Kansas battery facility and the sourcing of domestic graphite through partnerships with Graphite One and Syrah Resources.

Beginning next year, Syrah will supply AAM from its production facility in Vidalia, Louisiana, under a three-year deal with Lucid, per the release.

""A supply chain of critical materials within the United States drives our nation's economy, increases our independence against outside factors or market dynamics, and supports our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our vehicles,"" Lucid interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said in the release.

Establishing supplier networks to build EV batteries has been a trend encompassing both traditional automakers and EV-only makers, such as Lucid. For example, Nissan Motor Corp. and SK On signed a battery deal in March.

The previous deal between Lucid and Graphite One is a non-binding supply agreement, pending Graphite One's commencement of AAM graphite production at the Ohio facility, according to the Canadian company's annual Management's Discussion and Analysis document, filed in April.

If successful, the Lucid and Graphite One partnership would establish a U.S. source of graphite materials for EV batteries for the carmaker. However, Hunan Chenyu Fuji New Energy Technology, an AAM manufacturer based in Changsha, China, would play a critical role in supporting the partnership.

Graphite One signed a technology licensing agreement and a consulting agreement with Chenyu last October, according to the MD&A document. Chenyu agreed to assist in the design, construction and operation of the Ohio facility. Additionally, Chenyu would receive quarterly royalties for its technology used in AAM manufacturing.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/gxOj-AMAhVueXt1u2KTRdG_tGgP752AAUS_GecNbaZg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTU0NTE0ODk0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-06 12:26:31.186448

Customers in 15 ... - CNN,Ella Nilsen,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/climate/michigan-coal-plant-energy-cost-wright,"An aging coal power plant that was supposed to shutter last week will run throughout the summer at the order of President Donald Trump’s Energy Sec.
But Consumers Energy, the utility that owns the coal plant, told CNN in an email it already purchased another natural gas-fired power plant to carry the load when the coal plant went offline.

In 2021, the average coal-fired power plant was 45 years old, according to a report from the Energy Information Administration.
Unlike gas plants, coal plants can’t be easily turned on and off with the flip of a switch and take time to ramp up and come online.","An aging coal power plant that was supposed to shutter last week will run throughout the summer at the order of President Donald Trump’s Energy Sec. Chris Wright, a decision that could cost Midwest energy customers tens of millions of dollars.

The last-minute federal order to keep the J.H. Campbell plant operating came as a surprise to Michigan officials, including the head of the state’s Public Service Commission, given it was at the tail end of a multi-year retirement process that was approved in 2022.

“The grid operator hadn’t asked for this, the utility hadn’t asked for this, we as the state hadn’t asked for this,” said Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission. “We certainly didn’t have any conversations with the (Energy Department) in advance of the order, or since.”

Wright’s May 23 emergency order cited concerns the Midwest could face a summer electricity shortage due to a lack of available coal, gas and nuclear plants that can provide stable baseload power. But Consumers Energy, the utility that owns the coal plant, told CNN in an email it already purchased another natural gas-fired power plant to carry the load when the coal plant went offline.

Scripps said the cost to keep the over-60-year-old plant operating, even for 90 days, will be high, and customers in 15 states will foot the bill.

“I can say with a pretty high degree of confidence that we’re looking at multiple tens of millions of dollars at the low end,” Scripps said. “I think there’s a range between there and the high end of getting close to $100 million.”

It’s unclear so far what that will mean for individual electricity bills, Scripps added, given the uncertainty about final cost.

“For years, American grid operators have warned decommissioning baseload power sources such as coal plants would jeopardize the reliability of our grid systems, which has raised alarm bells,” Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement.

Dietderich didn’t say whether the Energy Department had conducted a cost analysis before issuing the emergency order. It’s unclear whether the department realized the company already had a plan to maintain baseload power after its closure.

Wright issued another emergency order last week to keep a Pennsylvania power plant that runs on natural gas and oil open past its May 31 retirement date.

Coal is the dirtiest fuel large plants still burn for electricity, and it’s now the most expensive as renewable energy sources like solar have become increasingly cost-effective. Although natural gas is a fossil fuel and contributes significantly to warming the planet, it is still considered a cheaper and less-polluting option. Gas generates 43% of the country’s electricity.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said she is considering legal action against the federal government. Nessel and energy experts said such an emergency order from the federal government is extremely rare and usually reserved for the aftermath of severe storms or natural disasters.

“This is a novel case for us,” Nessel said. “We’ve not had to do this before.”

She reiterated keeping the plant open would “significantly” raise electricity rates, saying, “The whole point of closing this plant down was to save money.”

More electric utilities are retiring their coal plants because they are old and especially expensive to run. In 2021, the average coal-fired power plant was 45 years old, according to a report from the Energy Information Administration.

The Energy Department’s order didn’t specify exactly how much the Michigan coal plant should run, saying it was requiring the utility to “take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate.”

Scripps and energy experts said that means the coal plant would likely run continuously at a lower level throughout the summer, or until Wright’s order ends. Unlike gas plants, coal plants can’t be easily turned on and off with the flip of a switch and take time to ramp up and come online. The Campbell plant is so old — it has been operating since 1962 — that Michigan energy regulators feared it could not physically turn back on once it was powered off.

The utility will also have to buy more coal to keep it going. Consumers Energy said it has “arranged for new shipments of coal to keep the plant operating.”

A new report from think tank Energy Innovation found the cost of coal-fired power has grown faster than inflation in the last few years — collectively costing US consumers $6.2 billion more in 2024 than it would have cost in 2021.

“Even existing coal where it has fully depreciated and been paid off, the cost of coal is more than solar and storage at this point,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas based energy expert who authors the Texas Energy and Power Newsletter and host of the Energy Capital Podcast.

Lewin covers the energy transition in deep red Texas, where power companies are building wind, solar and battery storage at an incredible pace. Of the significant amount of new electricity added to the Texas grid in the last four years, 92% has been wind, solar and storage, Lewin said.

That has paid dividends, keeping energy prices relatively low and meeting the state’s exploding power demand from air conditioning, data centers and big industry.

“All throughout the summer months, you’re getting maximum solar output,” Lewin said. “It’s very well correlated to peak demand. For a place with massive AC load like Texas, it’s fantastic.”

Texas has also invested a lot in big batteries that can keep power flowing to the grid after the sun stops shining and the wind stops blowing.

Energy Sec. Wright, however, has panned renewables, saying they are not a reliable replacement for fossil fuels.

“There is simply no physical way that wind, solar and batteries could replace the myriad uses of natural gas,” he said at Houston energy conference CERAWeek in March. “I haven’t even mentioned oil or coal yet.”

According to Politico’s E&E News, the new AI tool listed power companies as the No. 2 contributor to climate change. And while it doesn’t take a lot of mental work to derive that major energy producers are emitting massive amounts of pollution, Zeldin’s actions say otherwise.

The automotive component manufacturer has made notable gains in efficiency in several key systems, including weight and space savings, as automakers turn their attention to cutting EV curb weights.

ZF's optimization of battery temperature controls via the TherMaS system has demonstrated significant gains in range.

The pace of change in the EV world is often likened to that of computers in the 1990s, with vehicles that debuted around the turn of the decade already seeming dated if not outright stale. The same goes for the tech underneath, with the hardware produced today differing noticeably from what we saw a scant five years, and this goes well beyond battery tech.

ZF is best known as a developer and supplier for automakers, producing everything from transmissions to ADAS systems, letting automakers assemble cars with its components. And in the current EV landscape, it has been tasked with developing quite a bit of what goes into cars produced everywhere from Europe to China.

The company showcased its latest developments at eMobility Tech Day in Germany, bringing its modular electric powertrain hardware to the event. And the systems already show significant gains in power density, weight, and efficiency compared to just a few years ago.

And ZF's progress can be seen firsthand in the company's Select drivetrain for electric vehicles.

""The pace of innovation in many e-drive components is enormous. Our customers want to have the latest technology available quickly – and with limited integration effort,"" says Dr. Otmar Scharrer, Senior Vice President R&D, Electrified Powertrain Technology at ZF.

""This is exactly where we come in with our Select platform: the overall system and components are perfectly matched to each other – at the same time, the components are interchangeable depending on requirements.""

The platform was engineered to feature interchangeable components, depending on automakers' goals for a particular EV, and easy to offer in various states of tune depending on vehicle trim.

ZF's recently developed e-drive has efficiency in mind, using a coaxial primary drive coupled with a PSM (permanently excited synchronous machine) to produce just north of 400 hp and 4056 lb-ft of torque.

The company notes that the latest generation of the unit reduces losses by more than 25%, while also improving weight and efficiency parameters.

The em:Select is just one component that ZF has recently developed as part of the larger EV powertrain package. The company's components for this system also include an inverter, a reduction drive platform, and a converter. Gains in efficiency having been made in all four with this latest generation of an EV powertrain, with ZF finding new ways to save weight and space, while taking future uses into consideration.

""The co:SELECT modular system includes bidirectional charging as well as V2L and V2G functionality (vehicle-to-load, vehicle-to-grid). Both make the vehicle's battery energy available for the power grid as well as for external power consumers – even simultaneously,"" ZF notes.

ZF has made significant gains in optimizing EV drive systems, achieving weight and space savings, while allowing for interchangeable components based on automaker needs.

ZF is also mindful of recent trends in the auto industry, including a renewed focus on extended-range powertrains that now appear headed into large trucks and SUVs in the US, starting with the Ram 1500 REV and the new Scout model range revived by Volkswagen.

The company is currently developing a next-generation Range Extender (eRE) and the electric Range Extender plus (eRE+), the latter featuring an intelligent clutch and a differential. This will allows it to act not only as a generator, but as an additional drive unit.

Among other things, EREV powertrains promise smaller vehicle batteries, shorter development times, and lower overall platform costs.

But squeezing more range out of EVs also remains a priority. And gains can be made via a more advanced thermal management system for a battery pack.

""The battery of an electric car in particular is very sensitive when it comes to its ideal operating temperature. It feels most comfortable between 15 and 25°C (59 to 77°F),"" Scharrer notes.

Controlling the battery's temperature, therefore, has a big effect on range, and ZF's solution in this regard is called TherMaS, which is a system that uses propane as a refrigerant, thereby thermally keeping the battery in its optimal operating range.

At its core, TherMaS is propane-based heat pump refrigeration circuit, one that features a lighter and smaller housing compared to existing units.

The payoff in a demonstration vehicle tested by ZF ended up delivering 10% more electric range in the winter time, with the company seeing 30% in more extreme weather conditions.

Still, the next big breakthrough in EV drivetrains could still expected to materialize in the form of batteries with greater energy density, namely solid-state designs. A number of new compositions are inching their way through the pipelines of developers and automakers, including in-car road testing, though mass production remains a hurdle to be overcome in the future.

But EV motor evolution won't stand still in the meantime, before the solid-state era arrives, and more gains remain to be made in the drivetrain sphere.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/zf-crossovers-6841ab382a939.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.0513xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-06-06 15:11:35.128321

Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real.","LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

""We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,"" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to ... document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.

""It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

""The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

The goal is to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, increasing capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.
The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.
China has 55 nuclear reactors in operation, while France has 56 reactors at 18 different power plants.
Chinese officials have touted their strategy of standardized development of nuclear power plants, which enables the faster completion of projects.","On May 23, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders that directed the nation’s independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to reduce regulations and expedite the licensing process for new reactors and power plants, effectively overhauling the agency. The orders intend to fast-track new nuclear projects and technologies through federal permitting and deploy cost-cutting initiatives to scale back the NRC. The industry will be encouraged by federal subsidies as the draft budget legislation passed by the House of Representatives keeps tax credits for new and existing nuclear plants, but requires them to begin construction before January 1, 2029. The goal is to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, increasing capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

The orders provide an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications and create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026, in just 13 months. They also invoke the Defense Production Act to facilitate federal purchases of nuclear fuel to strengthen the domestic supply chain and weaken Russia’s substantial hold on it. Until 2023, the United States got much of its enriched uranium from Russia, which stopped after Russia invaded Ukraine, and a bipartisan law was passed. The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

According to the order reforming the NRC, “the current structure and staffing of the NRC are misaligned with the Congress’s directive that the NRC shall not unduly restrict the benefits of nuclear power.” It directs the NRC to consult with the Department of Government Efficiency to “reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology.”

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, rather than the NRC. Even so, Trump’s goal will be difficult to achieve with the current state of the U.S. nuclear industry. The U.S. nuclear renaissance was decades ago, and only two new large reactors, which are at a nuclear plant in Georgia, have been built in nearly 50 years. They were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget, but many attribute that to overregulation and red tape by the NRC. The United States currently operates 94 nuclear reactors, which generate approximately 19% of the nation’s electricity.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity from artificial intelligence data centers and electrification, which the Biden administration pushed during his term in office. Recognizing the need for new baseload power, President Biden signed legislation to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster. The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies and a utility that want to build small nuclear reactors to begin generating electricity in the early 2030s. It expects its review to take three years or less, but this is 18 months longer than Trump’s orders allow.

On May 20, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced that it had submitted a permit to install the nation’s first small modular nuclear reactor (SMR). In Ontario, Canada, the power company has begun building the first of four small nuclear reactors. Russia and China are also adding to their nuclear arsenal. China is building new nuclear plants at a stunning pace, with 10 reactors green-lighted in each of the last two years and 26 under construction. Its fleet may soon displace France as second in reactors behind the United States. China has 55 nuclear reactors in operation, while France has 56 reactors at 18 different power plants. Chinese officials have touted their strategy of standardized development of nuclear power plants, which enables the faster completion of projects.

China is also in the process of constructing a SMR , known as “Linglong One,” which is the first SMR globally to have passed the universal safety review by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Its construction is expected to be finished by 2026 with a power generation capacity of 125 megawatts.

If New York Republicans in the House refuse to advocate for the best interests of their state, I will.","Governor Kathy Hochul today issued a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune outlining the potentially disastrous impact that the House’s proposed budget would have on New Yorkers. If enacted, the bill would gut New York’s healthcare system, strip families of crucial nutrition benefits, trigger billions in economic losses through the removal of clean energy tax credits and continue to unfairly tax hard-working New Yorkers by failing to fully repeal the SALT cap.

The House bill slashes $13.5 billion in funding for our healthcare economy through cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplace, putting nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers at risk of losing their health insurance. Safety net hospitals in rural and low-income areas could be forced to shutter their doors permanently and doctors and health care providers would face financial jeopardy. The bill also significantly shrinks federal support for SNAP nutrition and food benefits, making it more difficult for the nearly three million New Yorkers who rely on SNAP to put food on the table for their families.

In addition, the House bill would put the safety and reliability of our power grid at risk by repealing tax credits that support major renewable and energy storage projects with an estimated loss of $25 billion in clean energy investments. The bill would also curtail efforts to reduce housing energy costs and improve resilience by eliminating the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, an important resource to retrofit affordable housing stock. Other proposed measures include gutting student loan programs, levying outrageous taxes on nonprofits and universities, eliminating the popular direct-file program to simplify the tax process, and prohibiting state AI regulation.

The proposed budget would inflict all of these harms while still failing to deliver on a key promise made by New York Republicans in Congress to their constituents: a full repeal of the SALT cap. Congressional Republicans’ decision to impose a new, permanent SALT cap upholds a double-tax on New York taxpayers and unfairly burdens middle-class households.

The full text of the letter is below:

Dear Majority Leader Thune and Minority Leader Schumer:

As Governor of New York, I am writing to you ahead of the Senate’s consideration of the House reconciliation legislative package to underscore the detrimental impact this bill would have on my state. If enacted, the proposed bill would gut New York’s healthcare system, strip families of crucial nutrition benefits, trigger billions in economic losses through the removal of clean energy tax credits, stagnate growth in education and critical technology sectors, and continue to unfairly tax hard-working New Yorkers by failing to fully repeal the SALT cap. Passage of this legislation would worsen the affordability crisis and inject further instability into an already fragile economy.

Restricting Access to Healthcare: The House bill slashes $13.5 billion in funding for our healthcare economy through cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace. Make no mistake: if the Senate passes this legislation and it is signed into law, nearly 1.5 million people in New York will lose their health insurance. Over $3 billion will be lost to our hospitals, with safety net hospitals in rural and low-income areas at significant risk of shuttering their doors permanently. These closures will harm all New Yorkers, regardless of their insurance coverage.

Reducing Food Security: The bill also significantly shrinks federal support for SNAP nutrition and food benefits, making it more difficult for the nearly three million New Yorkers who rely on SNAP to put food on the table for their families. The bill places significant administrative burdens on our state and counties and will create headaches for eligible families in receiving their benefits. States have always played a key role in SNAP; this bill decimates the longstanding federal-state partnership by penalizing states with recurring annual costs. We expect the House-passed bill to cost New York State alone over $2.1 billion annually.

Undermining Energy Modernization and Resilience: The House reconciliation package would put the safety and reliability of our power grid at risk by repealing tax credits that support major renewable and energy storage projects. The financial impact to New York from the loss of the investment tax credit alone would be $25 billion to the state’s current portfolio of large-scale clean energy investments and would further make new projects more expensive for businesses and threaten good-paying union jobs. Added fees on electric vehicles, canceled IRA transportation funding, and the rollback of EV and home energy credits would also drive-up costs statewide. The bill would also curtail efforts to reduce housing energy costs and improve resilience by eliminating the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP), an important resource to retrofit our nation’s affordable housing stock.

Education Undermined, Disparities Widened: The House bill threatens to dismantle essential supports for low-income and nontraditional students by imposing restrictive eligibility changes for working, part-time learners; establishing harsh institutional penalties; and eliminating key federal loan programs. In New York, where nearly half of community college students attend part-time and rely heavily on Pell Grants, these changes could force thousands to drop out or incur deeper debt. Additionally, the bill eliminates some subsidized student loans and forces loan risk onto education institutions. Taken together, these provisions represent a regressive shift that threatens to widen educational disparities, destabilize community colleges and minority-serving institutions and undermine national efforts to promote affordable higher education.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) Moratorium: The House legislation also includes a highly-problematic and broad prohibition on state AI regulation for a decade. States like New York have passed laws to both invest in the incredible potential of AI and thoughtfully address potential AI harms in the face of federal inaction. Under my leadership, New York has enacted several first-in-the-nation AI safety measures, including the Safe for Kids Act to curb the addictive nature of social media for kids, and safeguards for AI Companion chatbots to reduce harmful interactions. If this federal prohibition remains in reconciliation, the impact is not merely a bureaucratic moratorium; it undermines the states’ fundamental right and responsibility to protect the safety, health, privacy, and economic vitality of its citizens.

Unfair Tax Burdens: Not only does this bill guarantee higher costs, it also fails to deliver on a key promise made by New Yorkers in your caucus to their constituents: a full repeal of the SALT cap. House Republicans’ decision to impose a new, permanent SALT cap upholds a double-tax on New York taxpayers and unfairly burdens households. The bill also levies outrageous taxes on nonprofits including universities, and eliminates the popular direct-file program that simplifies the tax filing process – all in an effort to cut taxes for the richest Americans.

These are just some of the more egregious harms this bill would inflict on my constituents. If New York Republicans in the House refuse to advocate for the best interests of their state, I will. As Governor, I must stand up for middle-class New Yorkers who cannot afford the consequences of this budget. I urge you to reject the House proposal and instead work with Leader Schumer on a bipartisan reconciliation package that delivers for working families, invests in the future, and reflects the real needs of the people we serve.

Sincerely,

Governor Kathy Hochul",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2024-08/Governor%27sSeal1280x512_1.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=eC_EGWCa,N,,2025-06-06 11:22:23.755724

California's climate superfund plan may have stalled - CalMatters,"Alejandro Lazo, Alejandro Lazo Climate",,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/climate-change/2025/06/climate-superfund-california-legislature-oil/,"In the battle over how to pay for damage wrought by climate change, California lawmakers had an idea: Create a “superfund” that makes big polluters pay.
The Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act of 2025 would make the world’s largest sources of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels financially responsible for the damage caused by wildfires, droughts and other events exacerbated by the warming climate.

The Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act of 2025 would make the world’s largest sources of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels financially responsible for the damage caused by wildfires, droughts and other events exacerbated by the warming climate.

The idea adopts the “Superfund” model — created by Congress in 1980 to clean up the nation’s worst toxic waste sites — and applies it to greenhouse gases, aiming to hold companies financially accountable for emissions that drive climate change.

New York and Vermont have already enacted similar measures despite massive opposition from the oil and gas industry.

But the proposed California legislation has stalled since April, even as environmental groups — galvanized by the death and destruction of the January Los Angeles wildfires — have made it a top priority.

Identical versions in both legislative houses have sat idle in Assembly and Senate committees despite a full-court press by supporters framing the superfund as a solution to California’s $12 billion budget deficit. The bills passed out of their first committees but have not advanced further.

“Nobody can afford the kind of financial crisis that the climate crisis has caused,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat from San Luis Obispo, one of the authors, told CalMatters. “Oil caused the climate crisis, in large part … they lied about it as they caused the damages, and it’s time for them to come to the table and create more affordability for the very people that they’ve harmed.”

The funds would be earmarked for paying for community disaster preparedness, such as evacuation planning and emergency housing, as well as energy efficiency, zero-emission fleets and charging, and natural resource protection, among other projects, according to the bill.

Opposition includes oil companies and major business groups. In addition, despite worsening wildfires and floods, many Californians have been increasingly voicing concern that the state’s climate policies are driving up gas and electricity costs.

Oil and gas industry lobbying has been fierce. Jim Stanley, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association, the industry’s top lobbying group in the West, said in a statement that the measures were “misguided proposals to retroactively punish companies for providing a legal product that was, and remains, critical to our state’s economy.”

He said that “at a time when Californians are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis, these bills will likely result in massive price increases for gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electricity and consumer goods.”

The climate superfund also faces resistance from a powerful ally of Big Oil: California’s State Building and Construction Trades Council, a key union that has repeatedly backed the industry’s positions, as CalMatters has previously reported.

Earlier this year, the council also opposed legislation by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, that would have allowed residents to sue oil companies for climate damages.

In April, Keith Dunn, a lobbyist for the trades union, told an Assembly committee that the climate superfund would drive up energy prices, kill middle-class jobs and act as a stealth tax on working families. “The affordability gap is widening,” Dunn told lawmakers. “It’s not by chance, it’s by choice.”

Both measures include “urgency” provisions, which allow them to take effect immediately if passed by a two-thirds vote and signed by the governor. That higher threshold makes them less vulnerable to certain legal challenges and exempts them from the usual legislative deadlines. (Most bills must clear their house of origin by today.)

“There was quite a bit of opposition earlier in the year so we’re continuing those conversations,” Addis said. “We have time to have those conversations.”

The bill would make companies pay for emissions from “the extraction, production, refining, sale, or combustion, including by third parties, of fossil fuels or petroleum products,” which includes oil, gas and coal.

Bill targets multinational corporations

The bill applies to companies that emit more than a billion metric tons of global emissions from 1990 through 2024 — that means multinational oil and gas corporations. Within three months of the law taking effect, the agency would publish a list of companies that would pay into the fund.

There are no official estimates as to how much companies would pay. The legislation would require the California Environmental Protection Agency to estimate costs from past and projected climate damages to people, governments, ecosystems and infrastructure every five years through 2045, using peer-reviewed science.

“It is imperative that we make polluters that caused a large percentage of the climate crisis pay for the thing that they knowingly caused,” said Maya Golden-Krasner, an attorney with the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, which has sponsored the California bills. “They’ve known that this would cause damage since at least the 1950s, they knew that these greenhouse gases would be regulated since the 1990s and they’ve been gaslighting us all the way and blocking climate regulation.”

The climate superfund fight is part of a broader national movement against major oil companies that is playing out in legislatures and courtrooms across America.

California is leading efforts to hold oil companies accountable in court for climate change, recycling a legal strategy deployed during the 1990s, when states alleged that tobacco companies knew cigarettes cause cancer.

Trump-era politics have also been at issue. In April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order targeting state climate programs, specifically calling out Vermont’s and New York’s polluter-pays laws and threatening legal action against California’s landmark cap-and-trade program.

Backers say the climate superfund is a fair solution to California’s budget crunch as well as a long-overdue reckoning for an industry that knowingly caused the climate crisis.

But the plan — which could cause oil and gas companies to pay billions for emissions over the last three decades — faces an uphill battle in Sacramento.

Last year, Californians voiced strong opposition to plans to overhaul one of its cornerstone climate programs, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which could push gasoline prices higher. Last week, Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Democrat from Bakersfield, called for California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, who led the board in its passage of that measure, to resign over cost concerns.

Likely to trigger a legal onslaught

If enacted, the climate superfund would almost certainly trigger a wave of legal challenges. Donald Sobelman, a San Francisco environmental attorney, told CalMatters that the bill is legally ambitious — and is almost certainly headed for a courtroom challenge if it passes.

The Trump administration, for instance, sued New York and Vermont over their climate superfund measures, arguing they are unconstitutional.

Another potential legal argument, Sobelman said, is that the measure could charge companies now for pollution emitted years or even decades ago. Another is that the measure could act like a tax, which could make it easier to challenge in California court without two-thirds approval by the Legislature.

And some judges may question whether the science linking the emissions to worsening fires and other climate events is strong enough to single out specific companies for climate damage, leading to the “classic battle of the experts,” Sobelman said.

In addition, courts could determine that consumers hold some responsibility for their actions, such as driving cars and trucks powered by fossil fuels, and that other industries around the world, such as power plants and farms, also emit a lot of greenhouse gases.

A spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom declined to tell CalMatters whether he supports the measure.

In his May budget proposal, the governor adopted “polluters pay” language to rally support for an existing California climate program, cap-and-trade, which raises money by selling pollution credits to companies.

The debate is unfolding amid a worsening budget crisis in which lawmakers are under pressure to find new revenue sources — especially ones that don’t involve tax hikes on Californians. Supporters of the Superfund Act argue that the bill offers a “polluter-pays” principle rather than new taxes.

Newsom’s budget proposal said extending cap and trade “aligns with the polluter-pays principle in which carbon emitters will fund the state’s world-class forestry and fire protection programs in the face of wildfires that have become increasingly destructive because of climate change.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/070622_OilField_LV_CM_009.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-06 11:22:42.548705

Tariffs and potential repeals of federal funding are creating roadblocks to the further buildout of energy projects.

Wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects have helped revitalize rural communities by creating jobs, generating new tax revenues, and providing lease payments to landowners.

However, energy projects rely on globally-sourced components, due to the U.S. supply chain's inability to meet rising demand. To avoid tariffs, solar developers are stockpiling panels, but the impact is only delayed. Battery storage is critical for grid reliability and faces tariffs of up to 65%.

The rising costs are forcing companies to delay or cancel plans.

For example, the Plum Creek Wind Project in Minnesota was cleared for construction this fall, but the project developer, National Grid Renewables, has pressed pause due to escalating costs tied to tariffs.

The slowdown threatens rural economies by halting the local jobs and long-term positions in operations and maintenance that new construction brings. Tax revenues from energy projects fund vital infrastructure and critical public services like schools, emergency services, and roads. In Iowa’s Howard County, 147 wind turbines account for 14.5% of the county’s total annual tax revenue.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, about 85% of U.S. farm households earned the majority of their income from off-farm sources. Hosting wind turbines or solar panels offers a stable source of income through lease payments, but the additional income is at risk if renewable energy development declines.

Rural economies have grown, thanks to renewable energy development, but without continued investment, many communities will not be able to unlock those economic benefits.

Data centers alone account for about half of Xcel’s expected 5% annual sales growth through 2029.
“It’s shifted from us trying to attract (data center) companies to Minnesota to them knocking on our doors.” Smaller utilities like Dakota Electric Association are also gearing up for massive amounts of data center development, CEO Ryan Hentges said later on the webinar.","The intra-DFL rift between labor unions whose members build data centers and progressives skeptical of corporate giveaways was on full display at the Capitol last week as lawmakers considered extending generous tax breaks for data centers’ purchases of computers, software and energy equipment.

It was also evident in a May 28 energy webinar featuring top utility executives, state officials and representatives from regional labor, agriculture and environmental groups.

The conversation came as Minnesota utilities weigh proposals for thousands of megawatts of new data center capacity, representing new electric consumption equal to millions of homes. As other construction sectors falter amid high interest rates and sluggish demand, union laborers and tradespeople see an opportunity in building data centers and the power plants to run them.

“We need to be involved in the next iteration of energy development here in Minnesota,” said Joe Fowler, business manager for Laborers International Union of North America Local 563.

To labor, that means building not only the wind, solar and battery plants that will form the backbone of Minnesota’s future electric grid, but large industrial facilities to soak up the power they produce. Others in the left-of-center coalition say unfettered data center growth could jeopardize progress toward the state’s statutory target of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 while threatening grid reliability and raising costs for ordinary utility customers.

“We want to bring on large users like data centers, but not to the exclusion of others,” said Margaret Cherne-Hendrick, CEO of St. Paul-based Fresh Energy, a policy and communications shop focused on clean energy.

Though the data center boom was the elephant in the room, the conversation touched on some of the broader challenges issues facing Minnesota electric utilities, workers and customers as a dysfunctional state legislative session limps to a close and federal policymakers get closer to passing a budget bill that cuts taxes for the rich and Medicaid for the poor while, experts say, raising power prices for everyone.

How much data center demand is actually coming?

Developers have proposed nearly 9,000 megawatts of new data center capacity across Xcel Energy’s eight-state territory, CEO Bob Frenzel said in October, or almost 9 million homes’ worth of electricity consumption. Data centers alone account for about half of Xcel’s expected 5% annual sales growth through 2029.

Xcel expects Minnesota’s share of that growth to be about 1,300 megawatts over the next seven to eight years, said Ryan Long, Xcel’s president for Minnesota and the Dakotas. That’s up from 60 megawatts of total capacity as of early last year.

“The curve is up and to the right,” Long told Energy Futures Initiative Foundation CEO and former U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz on the webinar. “It’s shifted from us trying to attract (data center) companies to Minnesota to them knocking on our doors.”

Smaller utilities like Dakota Electric Association are also gearing up for massive amounts of data center development, CEO Ryan Hentges said later on the webinar. Projects proposed for Dakota Electric territory include a 12-building, 340-acre Farmington campus that residents are suing to stop.

But the demand won’t hit all at once, Hentges said.

“One gigawatt is not all going to happen next year,” he said. “It’s going to happen over time, and that gives us more time to plan.”

Can utilities serve new data centers while meeting Minnesota’s carbon-free power mandate?

The short answer is yes, according to Long. Even with the influx predicted over the next five years, Xcel is on track to shut down its three remaining Minnesota coal units by 2030 and meet the interim state goal of 80% clean power by 2030, he said.

“These are aging, somewhat inefficient plants and we are blessed to live in a region that has excellent renewable resources,” he said.

Xcel could partner on future “clean firm” power projects with big tech companies, which have their own sustainability goals, Long added. Google, utility NV Energy and power developer Fervo Energy recently announced a geothermal power partnership in Nevada, while Meta, Amazon and Microsoft have all inked splashy nuclear deals. Nuclear and geothermal both produce carbon-free power without relying on variable weather conditions.

Those partnerships could eventually help wean Minnesota off natural gas power despite uncertainty around federal support for cleaner technologies, said Sydnie Lieb, assistant commissioner with the Minnesota Department of Commerce.

“In the absence of the federal government continuing to push development of clean firm resources, we are thinking about what the state can do,” she said.

Big data centers could also cover at least some of the cost of new transmission infrastructure needed to serve them, easing the burden on existing ratepayers, Hentges added.

But the state needs to ensure Minnesota data centers fully decarbonize their operations over time, including onsite backup generators that today generally run on natural gas or diesel, Cherne-Hendrick said. It also needs to push data centers to pay into state-administered equity programs facing sharp federal funding cuts, like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, she said.

Is Minnesota really facing a ‘power emergency’?

Also no, Long said, despite the Trump administration’s claims to the contrary.

Last month, Trump invoked an obscure law to order a Michigan coal plant to operate past its planned May 31 retirement date. Moniz, the former U.S. Energy Secretary, asked whether he could do the same in another Midwestern state committed to transitioning off coal.

Xcel is “obviously paying a lot of attention” to the issue but isn’t changing its coal retirement plans, which have been in the works for years and won’t affect system reliability, Long said.

He allowed that Minnesota will need gas power plants for many years, though they’ll increasingly serve as backup for renewables, nuclear and long-duration batteries. Xcel plans to build a new “hydrogen-capable” gas plant in southwestern Minnesota that will likely operate past 2040.

Will the transition to carbon-free power kill jobs?

Building new wind, solar and battery plants has been cheaper than running existing coal plants for years, in part because renewable power requires far less labor to operate and maintain.

Fowler said that’s a challenge for unions like LIUNA, whose work in the power sector increasingly focuses on facilities that more or less run themselves. And LIUNA members are uneasy about the future.

“Our job is to work ourselves out of a job — we build something and then move onto the next project,” he said.

A February settlement between Xcel and Minnesota’s utility regulator pushes the utility to expand training opportunities for underrepresented populations and work with labor on workforce transitions at retiring power plants. The training partnership has already produced around 100 graduates who can now work on new power plant or data center construction projects, Fowler said.

“There are real benefits the state will see from … having citizens who feel like their job is waiting out there,” he said.

Is rural Minnesota being asked to do too much to support the green transition?

Wind and solar development is a double-edged sword for rural communities, where income-earning opportunities for landowners clash with concerns about removing prime farmland from production, said Anne Schwagerl, vice president with Minnesota Farmers Union.

To demystify the issue and strengthen members’ negotiating position with power developers, Minnesota Farmers Union plans to update its five-year-old “farmers’ guide” to renewable energy. But the best way to ensure durable rural support for clean energy is to give farm communities more skin in the game, Schwagerl said.

Right now, for example, conglomerates barge most of the fertilizer used on Minnesota farms up the Mississippi River from massive factories on the Gulf Coast. Minnesota Farmers Union wants to see more local production, ideally led by rural cooperatives using excess wind power with support from federal and state green fertilizer grants, Schwagerl said.

“Our thinking is that the green transition is happening,” she said. “We’re seeing it in agriculture as in energy, and it would be a big bummer to us if it ended up being owned by the same multinational megacorporations.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/nuclear-power-plant-2048x1365.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 09:03:03.630542

A recent survey found that Texas experienced 4.1% year-over-year job growth within the sector, ""demonstrating that traditional energy states can successfully transition toward cleaner alternatives.""

Generator and electrical services provider Oregon Generators gathered 2023 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Energy's 2024 report to compare states by clean energy job prevalence. The company, which specializes in power solutions including generator installation and electric vehicle (EV) charging setups, sought to find where the clean energy industry is booming in scale as well as relative job concentration.

""Understanding where clean energy jobs are concentrated should help both workers and businesses make more informed decisions about their future,"" Oregon Generators Owner Corey Gilgan said.

Here's how the Lone Star State's clean energy industry compares to those in other states.

Which states have the most clean energy jobs?

The six states with the most residents also lead the country in clean energy jobs. Data collected by Oregon Generators shows that each state approaches the sector in unique ways.

California's significant job market reflects the state's commitment to renewable energy and progressive climate policies. As it invests in solar and wind infrastructure, the largest tech sector in its clean energy economy is traditional HVAC.

While California's clean energy job growth has slowed in recent years, Texas boasts strong growth as it uses its energy expertise and infrastructure to expand into renewable energy. Energy Star & Efficient Lighting is the state's primary clean energy employment sector. The industry has become a significant employer, accounting for 3.02% of total employment in Texas.

North Carolina had by far the highest year-over-year growth, at 10.6%. Like Texas, its primary clean energy employer is Energy Star & Efficient Lighting.

Smaller states have highest rates of clean energy jobs

While the states with the most residents generally had the most clean energy jobs overall, it was actually the smaller states that tended to have the highest concentration of those jobs.

Vermont leads states in clean energy job rates. Its share of clean energy jobs within total employment (6.00%) was nearly double that of Texas (3.02%). The northeastern state's specialized focus was on high-efficiency and renewable heating and cooling technologies. Following Vermont, the highest rates were in Wyoming and West Virginia.

""In states like Vermont and Wyoming, clean energy is becoming fundamental to the local economy, rather than just being supplementary,"" Gilgan said.

Like Texas, Wyoming and West Virginia are former fossil fuel-dependent states that are successfully transitioning to focus on clean energy sources.

Utah and South Dakota also stand out for their impressive growth rates of 9.0% and 8.4%, respectively. Utah also has one of the largest employment bases in the country, with nearly 18 million total jobs.

Reviewing the study's results, Gilgan had this to say:

This sector creates quality, sustainable employment while addressing climate challenges. States investing in clean energy infrastructure and workforce development can drive significant job creation. Those establishing leadership now will maintain competitive advantages for decades to come.

For workers, these trends signal valuable opportunities in a growing field with long-term stability. The clean energy transition serves both environmental and economic imperatives, reshaping the American workforce in substantial ways.","https://www.statesman.com/gcdn/authoring/images/Hearst/2025/06/06/NAAS/84066191007-rawImage.png?crop=1124,632,x0,y2&width=1124&height=632&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-06 10:09:18.027374

Musk has spent the past few months alienating the electric automaker’s base of climate-minded car buyers by moonlighting as Trump’s government-slasher-in-chief. Now, the billionaire’s fixation on the GOP megabill has opened a dangerous rift with the president, who threatened Thursday to end all subsidies to Musk’s companies.

Tesla’s stock had its largest one-day drop in history Thursday as Musk and Trump sniped at each other from their respective social media platforms. The share price fell more than 14 percent, lopping off more than $150 billion from Tesla’s market value — and, according to Bloomberg, tanking Musk’s personal net worth by $34 billion.

The core of the argument between the two men — whether the Republican spending package is a “big, beautiful bill” or a “MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK” — is a side concern for people whose main priority is Tesla.

“The CEO of that company needs to spend his time focused on the company’s success,” said Nick Nigro, the head of Atlas Public Policy, which analyzes the electric vehicle market. “Whether his interest in federal policy comes from a good place, it’s a distraction from what Tesla shareholders and drivers need, which is his full attention.”

Seth Abramson, a vociferous Musk critic who is writing a book about the entrepreneur, wrote on X that “Musk will go the rest of his life without a political home or patron, shunned by politicians of both parties and therefore unable to effectively operate as a CEO of any company.”

The breakup between the world’s richest man and one of its most powerful could have far-reaching impacts for Musk’s companies.

Investor optimism about Tesla has been based on the assumption that Musk’s proximity to power would lead to a national policy on autonomous vehicles that would ease the arrival of Tesla’s robotaxi, which is supposed to hit the roads of Austin, Texas, this month. Musk could also lose leverage on other issues important to Tesla, such as Trump’s tariffs on China’s critical minerals. Meanwhile, his space company SpaceX has billions of dollars of federal defense and space contracts — now at risk — while its satellite subsidiary Starlink is angling for billions more in federal broadband subsidies.

‘Attack mode’

Tesla is still the country’s largest electric automaker. But the Trump-Musk split comes at a vulnerable moment for both Tesla and electric vehicles writ large.

The company is facing declining sales around the world, as its vehicle lineup has grown stale and Musk’s political activities have turned off many EV buyers in Europe and North America.

Meanwhile, federal support for EVs is hanging by a thread. The House’s version of the megabill would drastically scale back Biden-era tax incentives meant to stimulate EV manufacturing and sales.

The fight between Trump and Musk escalated on Thursday after Trump told reporters that Musk was “upset” about the House-passed bill’s proposal to remove EV tax credits and other incentives. Musk took to X to deny that narrative, writing: “Keep the EV/solar incentives cuts in the bill, also cut all the crazy spending increases in the Big Ugly Bill so that America doesn’t go bankrupt!”

The president’s repeated attacks on EVs and vows to repeal the Biden administration’s subsidies certainly didn’t seem to trouble Musk much during last year’s campaign, when the megabillionaire spent more than $270 million and countless hours to help put Trump back into the White House. (Trump did concede at the time that Tesla made a “great product.”)

Musk’s apparent willingness to sacrifice federal incentives was unwelcome news to clean energy and EV advocates who hope Republican senators will save some of the tax credits from the Democrats’ 2022 climate law. Republicans can afford to lose only three votes in the Senate, and some GOP senators have indicated they think the bill’s rollbacks go too far.

The war of words between Trump and Musk ended any hopes that the Tesla CEO would have the leverage with the White House to tip the scales.

“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social.

That statement was a far cry from three months ago, when Trump made a show of buying a Tesla in front of the White House. That gesture raised hopes among some Tesla shareholders that Republicans would embrace Tesla and compensate for its diminished popularity among Democrats, many of whom had taken to staging protests outside its showrooms.

“I’m going to buy because No. 1, it’s a great product, as good as it gets. And No. 2, because this man has devoted his energy and his life to doing this, I think he’s been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people,” Trump said at the time about Musk.

Now, that’s all changed.

“Trump no longer has to say nice things about Tesla and EVs,” said Loren McDonald, an analyst at the EV data shop Paren, in a message. “He and the admin can go back to ‘EVs are evil’ attack mode.”

Critical minerals and beyond

The fizzled bromance could also alter the myriad and complex relationships that Tesla has across the globe, as well as its business before the federal government.

Musk, for example, will presumably hold no sway over the administration’s intended move to impose steep tariffs on imports of Chinese graphite used to make EV batteries.

The Commerce Department concluded last month that imported Chinese graphite is receiving unfair subsidizes. The agency laid out a plan to impose tariffs of up to 721 percent on some natural and artificial graphite active anode material from China that’s used in batteries.

Tesla has fought against the tariffs, with one of the company’s attorneys pointing out that U.S. manufacturers don’t yet produce anode material that meets carmakers’ standards.

The fallout could also put a bulls-eye on Musk’s financial ties to Beijing, something Democrats have repeatedly railed against.

The Trump administration and lawmakers from both parties are pushing to ease China’s grip on supply chains, from the production of critical minerals to processing and manufacturing of EV batteries.

Yet Tesla has many ties to China, including reliance on graphite imports, a gigafactory located in Shanghai, and ongoing work with Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. CATL, the world’s largest battery-maker, is on a U.S. government list of companies that work with the Chinese military.

In short, nothing on Thursday boded well for America’s leading electric automaker.

“It’s another Twilight Zone moment in this Musk/Trump relationship which now is quickly moving downhill,” wrote Dan Ives, an analyst at investment shop Wedbush Securities who tracks Tesla.

But Ives nonetheless remained hopeful. The subject line of his email: “Friends Again Soon?”

A local environmental group is questioning how truly committed the City of Windsor is to its climate goals, despite recently earning a top green grade from a global non-profit.

The Citizens Environment Alliance said the ‘A’ grade — placing Windsor among roughly 100 cities recognized worldwide — does not reflect the city’s actual follow-through on its climate goals.

“From our perspective, and from our experience, it’s not an ‘A’ grade from us,” said Derek Coronado, president of the Citizens Environment Alliance.

“There’s a gap there between getting an ‘A’ grade from some nonprofit that’s not here on the ground, really paying attention, handing out questionnaires instead of actually seeing the city in action.

“The city is supposed to be a leader on environmental actions and policies, and more often than not, they’re followers.”

The organization CDP included Windsor on its ‘A’ list this year — one of just 112 cities worldwide so recognized, and only eight in Canada, to earn top marks. Other Canadian cities on the list included Calgary, Montreal, and Vancouver.

However, Coronado said the recognition may not tell the whole story. He said the methodology used to earn a top score is not an independent audit of the city’s actual performance, but a survey.

In an emailed statement to the Star, the city said it “recognizes the urgency of climate action and remains committed to sustainability.”

The city said its Environmental, Sustainability & Climate Change (ESCC) department is currently reviewing four master plans with more than 500 climate-related action items.

The statement added that since adopting the Community Energy Plan (CEP) in 2017, Windsor has made “significant progress.” It cited a decline in community-wide emissions since 2005, and said the city surpassed its emissions target for 2023.

Coronado’s local group, however, claims the city isn’t being fully transparent when it comes to keeping up with its climate promises.

Among the many oversights the CEA noted are delayed committee meetings, lackluster public communication, and missing public reports.

The group said the city has yet to publicly release its 2023 greenhouse gas emissions inventory, target updates, or its net-zero implementation plan.

“We are getting a bit more frustrated as time passes with the city’s lack of action on not only implementing climate action, but communicating and being accountable for that action,” said Coronado.

“It’s a two-fold problem, and it’s been going on for some time.”

Coronado said the city has yet to implement its Urban Forest Master Plan.

Asked by the Star to respond, the city stated that plan, which outlines Windsor’s long-term urban forestry goals, will be brought to council in the coming weeks for formal discussion and feedback.

The Environment and Climate Change Advisory Committee (ECCAC), which advises the city on environmental and climate change matters, is mandated to meet at least six times annually. The committee held only its second meeting of the year on May 22.

“While administration has made efforts to schedule meetings in recent months,” the city told the Star, “achieving quorum has been a challenge.”

Coronado said local environmentalists want to see the city “lay down cohesive principles for what the city stands for” when facing the unavoidable reality of climate change.

“We’re seeing it happen all over the place in Canada, from forest fires and flooding and heat waves, to all of those things that directly impact people’s health, but also people’s pocketbooks,” he said.

“The longer the city waits, the greater the risk and threat to the health and safety of members of the community.

Instead, we find that it is governed by complex interdependencies and feedback loops.","The global shift towards a clean-energy system is much more than just a technological switch – it is a profound transformation of markets, industries and societal behaviours.

This complex undertaking is often characterised by “non-linearity” and “feedback loops”, where small changes can go on to have disproportionately large impacts and where seemingly straightforward paths encounter unexpected roadblocks.

Interventions can be self-amplifying – leading to runaway change, or they can be self-defeating – when progress seems impossible to attain.

Our new policy brief sheds light on these intricate dynamics, which can be overlooked when governments use analytical frameworks based on standard economic thinking.

The brief sets out the most common archetypes of system change and behaviour, as well as the underlying feedback loops that drive them, with the aim of helping policymakers to understand the recurring patterns that can either accelerate or impede progress.

Governments that can recognise these patterns – as well as the ways they can be harnessed or sidestepped – are likely to be better equipped to manage structural change.

This article delves into three key examples from the policy brief, exploring how they are influencing the energy transition and what lessons can be drawn for effective policymaking.

Reinforcing feedback loops

At the heart of the energy transition lies a powerful engine: the reinforcing feedback loops inherent in the development and diffusion of many clean-energy technologies.

This virtuous cycle operates through several mechanisms.

First, “learning by doing”, which means that as more units of a technology, such as solar panels or wind turbines, are produced and deployed, manufacturers and developers become more efficient, processes are refined and costs fall.

Second, economies of scale kick in: as production volumes increase, unit costs decrease due to efficiencies in manufacturing and more developed supply chains.

Finally, wider deployment can trigger network effects and the emergence of complementary innovations. This means that as the adoption of a given technology grows, it can foster an ecosystem of supporting infrastructure, skilled labour and supporting technologies, which can further boost its attractiveness and viability.

Together, these three elements create a powerful reinforcing loop: initial investment drives innovation and cost reduction, which spurs increased demand, attracting further investment.

Solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines are prime examples of this dynamic.

The astonishing growth of solar offers a particularly vivid illustration of the way in which reinforcing feedback loops can blindside experts and policymakers alike.

Solar growth has far exceeded projections made in the early 2000s. Indeed, the world’s actual installed capacity in 2020 was over 700 gigawatts (GW), more than ten times the level expected in outlooks published in 2006, as shown in the figure below.

Global solar deployment has exceeded expectations due to disparate trends and drivers in individual markets that, together, all point in the same direction. China, for instance, met its 2030 target for wind and solar capacity six years ahead of schedule in 2024.

Batteries are also riding this wave, with costs plummeting by around 85% over the past decade as deployment, particularly in road transport, scales up.

However, not all clean-energy technologies benefit from this self-amplifying pattern.

Nuclear power and hydropower, for example, have historically not shown the same rapid cost declines, due to their large, complex and site-specific nature. This contrasts with the smaller, modular and replicable characteristics of technologies, such as solar PV.

This does not negate the potential role of such technologies, but it does mean that they are less likely to see disruptive, exponential and self-reinforcing growth.

There are a number of potential conclusions for policymakers.

Early in the transition, interventions such as feed-in tariffs and public procurement were crucial in kick-starting these reinforcing feedbacks for solar and wind.

As these technologies mature and become cost-competitive, the focus shifts to removing other barriers, such as streamlining permitting processes, investing in grid expansion and reforming markets so they are better able to integrate variable renewable output.

These same principles could now be applied to newly emergent clean-energy technologies. Policies that directly nurture these reinforcing loops, such as deployment subsidies and clean technology mandates, can be expected to be most effective in the initial stages.

Turning again to the example of solar energy, while such initial efforts appeared to be expensive, they paid off over time by unlocking future cost reductions and, thus, kick-starting the self-amplifying feedback loops that are now driving further progress.

This contrasts with the idea that carbon pricing is necessarily the most efficient policy for decarbonisation. It may well be helpful, but as it will not drive rapid early technology adoption, it is less likely to have a self-amplifying effect in the initial stages of the transition.

Renewable ‘cannibalisation’

While the growth of renewable energy is the driving force of the energy transition, another system dynamic, termed “renewable cannibalisation“, can act as a dampening feedback loop. This can potentially slow progress long before full decarbonisation is achieved

This cannibalisation process results in variable renewable energy (VRE) sources, such as solar and wind, receiving decreasing prices for the electricity they generate.

Essentially, the more solar and wind capacity that is connected to the grid, the more they undermine their own revenue. This happens through three main channels.

First, the merit order effect, whereby solar and wind, which have very low operating costs, push more expensive fossil-fuel generators out of the market when supply is abundant.

In markets with marginal pricing, this leads to lower wholesale electricity prices during periods of high renewable output. While this cuts prices for consumers – at least in the short term – these lower prices also reduce revenues for renewable generators, potentially undermining the economic case for further investment.

For example, in California, solar power unit revenues fell by $1.30 per megawatt hour (MWh) for each percentage point increase in solar penetration between 2013 and 2017.

Second, price volatility, where uncertainty over future trends in the generation mix and the balance between supply and demand can make long-term revenues difficult to predict.

This increased uncertainty can raise the cost of capital for new renewable projects, again acting as a brake on investment

The UK, for example, experienced this before the introduction of “contracts for difference” (CfDs), which helped stabilise revenue expectations for renewable developers.

Third, volume risk, where rising VRE capacity increases the likelihood of more frequent curtailment – periods when renewable generation exceeds demand or grid capacity, forcing generators to scale back output and lose potential revenue.

Curtailment in itself is nothing new, but the scale and frequency is changing. Recent analysis by University College London suggests that without significant flexibility or storage, UK renewable generation could exceed demand for more than 50% of the time by 2030.

The analysis found that installed wind and solar capacity is set to surge beyond current levels of electricity demand, as illustrated in the figure below, finding that this could “deter investment” in new projects if no action is taken to address the problem.

These dampening feedback loops illustrate a classic “limits to success” scenario. The very success of renewables, if unmanaged, can create conditions that hinder their continued expansion.

The policy implications here are nuanced. One solution is CfDs, which offer renewable generators a fixed price and have been effective in many countries at mitigating the merit order effect and price volatility, thus maintaining investment.

However, as VRE penetration becomes very high and surplus generation becomes a regular occurrence, other solutions are likely to be needed. This is because existing CfD designs often include clauses that stop payments when market prices drop below zero.

As a result, alternative CfD designs, guaranteeing revenues based on installed capacity or potential – rather than actual – electricity generation might be considered, for example, even though these have other drawbacks.

More fundamentally, our research suggests the solution to this challenge lies in fostering the co-evolution of renewables with technologies such as energy storage and green hydrogen production. These can absorb surplus generation and turn a problem into an opportunity.

Whereas, traditionally, it might be assumed that the market on its own can optimally allocate risk, research suggests that a redesign of market structures may be needed to enable investment and fully realise the cost-saving opportunities of the new technologies.

This is one of several sets of feedbacks discussed in a separate new report published today, looking at the power sector transition in China.

The power of connection

The energy transition is not a series of isolated changes in different sectors. Instead, it is an interconnected system, where progress in one area can catalyse shifts elsewhere. Shared technologies can create reinforcing feedbacks that accelerate decarbonisation across multiple fronts, generating cross-sector synergies.

The relationship between clean power and transport electrification is a powerful example of this. As batteries are deployed at scale in electric vehicles (EVs), their costs fall, enabling ever-wider deployment and further cost declines, as shown in the chart below.

This is due to the learning-by-doing and economies-of-scale feedbacks discussed above.

This cost reduction then makes batteries more viable for grid-scale energy storage, which, in tur, helps integrate more low-cost VRE into the power system.

Cheaper, cleaner electricity then further incentivises the electrification of transport, as well as heating and light industry. This increased electrification boosts demand for renewable power, driving further deployment and cost reductions in solar and wind. It also expands the potential for demand-side response, where consumers adjust their electricity use to help balance the grid.

A similar dynamic is anticipated for “green” hydrogen. As deployment in one anchor sector – perhaps fertilisers or refining – drives down the cost of electrolysers, it makes green hydrogen more competitive for other applications, such as shipping or even long-duration energy storage in the power sector.

Each sector’s adoption of green hydrogen contributes to the shared learning and cost reduction, benefiting all.

The policy implications of these cross-sector synergies could be significant. Their existence suggests, for example, that there is no need to wait for decarbonisation of the power sector to advance further, before beginning the electrification of transport, heating or industry.

This is in contrast to the argument that transport should only be electrified after cutting power sector emissions, since increased EV charging will drive up demand for gas- or coal-fired generation.

While there will be a marginal increase in emissions from plugging a new EV into the power grid, the insights described in our brief imply that it is still likely to be more effective to pursue the transition away from fossil fuels in multiple sectors in parallel, because it can activate beneficial cross-sector feedback loops that are greater than the sum of their parts.

As such, our research suggests that policymakers hoping to take advantage of cross-sector synergies could aim to deliberately strengthen technological linkages between different parts of the energy system. Examples include electricity tariffs and market structures that reward “smart” EV charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services, encouraging industrial participation in demand-side response and promoting integrated home energy systems. These interactions can amplify the benefits of early investment in the transition.

Policy insights from system dynamics

Archetypes such as the self-reinforcing growth of clean technologies, the potential for renewable cannibalisation, the accelerating power of cross-sector synergies and seven others described in our new report paint a picture of a transition that is far from linear. Instead, we find that it is governed by complex interdependencies and feedback loops.

Consequently, our research suggests that policymakers will be much better equipped to manage and steer the transition, if they adopt a systems thinking approach.

Recognising these recurring patterns allows for the design of more robust and effective policies that anticipate challenges and leverage opportunities.

For instance, understanding the power of reinforcing feedback loops in technology diffusion underscores the value of early-stage support for nascent clean-energy technologies.

Conversely, anticipating the dampening effects of renewable cannibalisation highlights the likely benefits of combining renewable buildout with evolving market designs and strategic investments in flexibility solutions, such as storage and demand-side response.

Policymakers that understand and work with these dynamics are likely to be in a better position to spark self-amplifying changes – achieving maximum value for minimum effort – and to avoid self-defeating interventions that go nowhere.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EANABH.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 10:09:21.522342

""We are again having a remarkable start to fire season here in Canada,"" Daniels says.
He says most people think forest fires are sparked by carelessness, such as a discarded cigarette.
People in the U.S. shouldn't be too quick to criticize Canada when it comes to wildfires, Daniels says.","Paige Fischer was driving to the picturesque Traverse City region along Lake Michigan for a family vacation. But even as she was leaving her home in Ann Arbor this week, the smoke from massive wildfires in Canada's northern boreal forests was already evident.

Fischer, who as a professor of environmental sustainability at the University of Michigan, understands better than most what she and her family were getting themselves into.

""Even though I study this, I haven't completely caught up in terms of planning ahead to make sure there's good filtration systems where I'm staying,"" she acknowledged. ""But I definitely have masks with me.""

As of Thursday, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center said 201 fires are burning right now in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario, with fully half of them considered ""out of control."" While Canada is busy fighting fires, residents of the U.S. Midwest — especially in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan — are being forced to contend with the thick smoke.

While tens of thousands of Canadians have had to flee their homes in scenes reminiscent of what has occurred in recent years in California, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's AirNow page is showing air quality moderate to unhealthy throughout a large swath of the U.S., with the worst conditions in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana.

Fischer says we'd all better get used to it. The hotter, drying conditions that come with climate change are making these annual fires across North America, and in other parts of the world, the new norm.

""Wildfires are happening more frequently. They're getting bigger. They're emitting more smoke,"" Fischer says. ""The climate models are projecting that we're going to have more frequent, more severe wildfires.""

Lori Daniels, a forest ecologist and professor at the University of British Columbia (UBC) who specializes in wildfire science, agrees. ""Smoke knows no political boundaries — and neither does fire,"" she says. ""The wind patterns have taken that smoke kind of from the northwest across a big diagonal. And that's why you're getting so much smoke down in the United States.""

Canada and the U.S. are seeing a virtual repeat of 2023, when smoke from wildfires from some of the same regions lingered over the U.S. Midwest for days.

""We are again having a remarkable start to fire season here in Canada,"" Daniels says. ""Like the U.S., we've been struggling with these really mega fires that have huge consequences for our ecosystems and for our human communities ... we're all struggling with this, not just in Canada and the United States, but worldwide.""

John Smol is a biology professor at Queen's University in Ontario who studies long-term environmental change. He says most people think forest fires are sparked by carelessness, such as a discarded cigarette. Not true, he says. Most are sparked by lightning. ""To have a big forest fire … you need fuel, you need a spark, and you need fuel that'll burn. If it's hot, dry, and you didn't have summer rains — and you get a lightning strike — that's it,"" he says.

Even for the people not driven from their homes, the effects of these fires can be harmful. According to the EPA, exposure to high concentrations of wildfire smoke ""can cause persistent coughing, phlegm, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Even in healthy people, exposures to fine particles can potentially lead to transient reductions in lung function, and pulmonary inflammation.""

Fischer says unless people are paying close attention to the news, they might not know where the smoke is coming from. ""They have a hard time conceiving of wildfire smoke from Canada coming here. They might not take measures to protect their health,"" she said.

People in the U.S. shouldn't be too quick to criticize Canada when it comes to wildfires, Daniels says. She notes that the worst air quality conditions ever measured in Vancouver, where she lives and works, were in 2020 — and that was due to California wildfires that year.

Still, Daniels expresses sympathy to anyone in the U.S. who's being impacted.

More than three-quarters of new gas pipeline capacity under development in the US would feed additional liquefied natural gas exports rather than supporting domestic energy needs, a new report concludes.

Greenhouse gas emissions tied to that new capacity would be far larger than the current climate pollution from all coal-fired power plants nationwide, according to the report, published Monday by the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis. CEEA is a recently formed think tank based in Arlington, Virginia, that focuses on energy and environmental policy.

“The money flowing to gas pipeline infrastructure is not slowing and is intended to push US gas production even higher from its current record levels,” Jeremy Symons, president of the CEEA and a former federal climate policy advisor, said in a written statement. “This buildout will extend our dependency on natural gas for decades to come, slowing the transition to cleaner, more affordable alternatives.”

Planned natural gas transmission pipelines would add 99 billion cubic feet per day of additional capacity, a figure just below the total volume of US natural gas production in 2024, according to the report. The 10 largest planned pipelines across the country—and 80 percent of total capacity of active pipeline projects—are intended to export gas overseas as LNG, based on the authors’ assessment of federal data and other public records.

The additional gas shipments would have significant implications for climate change. If all of the pipelines are built and run at full capacity, carbon dioxide emissions from burning this additional gas would be two and half times greater than the CO2 currently released from all US coal-fired power plants, the report found.

This doesn’t include emissions of methane, a climate super pollutant and the primary component of natural gas. Methane emissions occur at every step of the natural gas supply chain—from wellheads and pipelines to LNG vessels and end users—as the gas leaks or is intentionally vented.

Methane emissions from the additional pipelines would pack a climate punch nearly twice that of CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants over a 20-year period, according to the report.

The amount of gas leaks from the oil and gas sector will likely increase as the Trump administration rolls back the industry’s methane regulations, the report noted.

“We know from hundreds of thousands of aerial and satellite measurements that methane leaks from oil and gas production are far worse than we previously realized, which makes the climate footprint of natural gas as bad as coal in many regions of the country,” said Danny Richter, a senior fellow with CEEA and the report’s lead author. “We had a clear path to clean up the methane problem, including the methane emissions reduction program enacted by Congress in 2022 as well as EPA regulations for the oil and gas industry. But that pathway has been shut down by the current administration.”

A fee on excessive methane emissions from oil and gas producers implemented under the Biden administration was rescinded by the Trump administration on May 12.

“It is clear from the beginning of this ‘report’ that it was created with the outcome already determined and no desire to provide facts,” an EPA spokesperson told Inside Climate News. “US methane emissions have been falling for decades thanks to American innovation, not heavy-handed government regulations, while domestic production of oil and gas has exponentially increased. According to EPA, methane emissions in the United States decreased by 19% between 1990 and 2022.”

Measurements in the field have repeatedly shown that reported methane emissions far understate actual releases.

The American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas industry group, did not respond to a request for comment.

The report is based on US Department of Energy data on 104 pipeline projects currently under development. It is unclear whether all of the planned pipelines will be built. Fifty-four of the projects, slightly more than half of all pipelines under development, have either not yet been approved or are on hold.

This includes one of the largest proposed pipelines, the $45 billion Alaska Nikiski LNG project. The pipe, which proponents have sought for decades, would transport gas 805 miles from Alaska’s North Slope to an LNG export terminal in southern Alaska. Completing the proposed export terminal, a retrofit of an existing import terminal, is included in the project’s projected cost.

The developer, the Alaska Gasline Development Corp, has applied for permits for the pipeline, many of which were approved during the last Trump administration, but still requires more.

President Donald Trump has directed agencies to speed up permitting and roll back environmental protections. He touted the Alaska Nikiski LNG project in an address to Congress earlier this year as “truly spectacular” and said “the permitting is gotten.”

Arvind Ravikumar, co-director of the Energy Emissions Modeling and Data Lab at the University of Texas at Austin, cautioned that the report included figures for carbon dioxide emissions of gas burned by end users in other countries that import the LNG. “The way international carbon accounting works in this space is that you count only those emissions that happen within your national border,” Ravikumar said.

However, David Lyon, a senior methane scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, said including emissions from burning the gas, wherever it occurs, made sense. “Climate change is global,” Lyon said. “If we are just exporting our emissions to other countries, that’s still going to cause climate change and have impact.”

However, Lyon noted that in some cases, building gas pipelines could actually help reduce emissions. For example, in the Permian basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico—the largest oil and gas producing region in the country—gas is often flared, or vented, due to a lack of sufficient pipeline capacity.

In such cases, additional pipelines could help reduce flaring and its associated emissions. But it would be better to avoid drilling new wells in areas that lack sufficient pipeline capacity in the first place, Lyon added.

In comparing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the planned pipelines to those of coal-power plants, the report only compares CO2 emissions between the two fuel sources. Elsewhere, the report discusses methane emissions from the gas supply chain, but does not consider methane emissions from coal mines that feed coal-fired power plants. A recent peer-reviewed study comparing the greenhouse gas emissions of LNG and coal found methane emissions from coal mines were relatively modest compared to coal’s CO2 emissions.

In addition to permitting issues, economic forces could also limit the number of pipeline projects that get built in the coming years, or the extent to which completed pipelines operate at full capacity. China, the world’s largest importer of LNG, stopped taking US gas entirely in March in response to US tariffs on Chinese goods.

Symons said the ongoing pipeline buildout could commit the US to significantly larger LNG exports for decades to come. “This locks in more fossil fuel dependency that future presidents won’t be able to make go away,” he said. “Policies like tax incentives come and go, but pipelines are forever.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250604-lng.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-06-06 09:03:16.034388

Drastic cuts to the Office of Research and Development would undermine the science that guides environmental health policy.
We urge Congress to reject the proposed FY2026 budget cuts and restore full funding to EPA.","Congress created the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with a clear and unambiguous mandate: to protect public health and the environment. For over five decades, under both Republican and Democratic leadership, that mission has been reinforced through bipartisan legislation to clean up hazardous waste, improve air and water quality, and assist states, territories, and tribal nations in safeguarding their communities. Congress also provided the EPA with the funding, never excessive but historically sufficient, to fulfill those legal responsibilities.

Today, that funding is under threat. The proposed 55% cut to EPA’s budget would reduce the agency’s capacity to its lowest level since its founding in 1970, at a time when environmental emergencies are becoming more frequent and more severe. From the catastrophic wildfires in Los Angeles, to the recent deadly tornadoes in Kentucky and Oklahoma, to hurricanes like Helene that ravaged the East Coast, communities across the country rely on EPA’s expertise in emergency response, air and water monitoring, hazardous materials management, and environmental recovery. Drastically reducing EPA’s funding undermines not only the mandate to provide clean air and clean water but also the government’s ability to respond rapidly and effectively when disaster strikes.

Here in Region 2, which includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and eight federally recognized tribal nations, EPA’s work has been central to health, safety, and environmental progress. EPA has helped clean up toxic Superfund sites like the Hudson River and the Raritan River, restored safe drinking water access in cities like Newark and San Juan, and supported air quality improvements that have reduced asthma rates and premature deaths. These aren’t abstractions; they are measurable public health and environmental victories.

But, they depend on federal funding and expertise. The proposed budget would slash $2.46 billion from the clean water and drinking water state revolving funds, stalling long-overdue repairs of pipes in schools, homes, and hospitals. Drastic cuts to the Office of Research and Development would undermine the science that guides environmental health policy. Eliminating the Environmental Justice and Community Outreach program would turn a blind eye to communities long overburdened by pollution.

Some argue that states should simply take on more of this responsibility. But, EPA was never designed to replace the states; it was built to support them. EPA provides technical assistance, enforcement backing, and funding for state and territory-run air and water programs. Pulling federal support out from under states and territories won’t streamline regulation. It will leave communities with weaker protections, inconsistent enforcement, and fewer avenues for progress and accountability.

President Trump’s recent claim that pollution has “zero impact” reflects a deep misunderstanding of both science and governance. Pollution has real, well-documented effects on human health, from cancer and developmental disorders to respiratory illness and premature death. EPA exists because Congress recognized that the consequences of pollution cross state lines and demand a national response.

Congress now faces a critical decision. Will it honor its own environmental laws by funding the agency charged with enforcing them? Or will it impose cuts that prevent EPA from doing what it was created to do?

We urge Congress to reject the proposed FY2026 budget cuts and restore full funding to EPA. Environmental protection isn’t partisan; it’s a matter of law, of science, and of basic public duty. Undermining the EPA won’t eliminate the costs of pollution. It will simply shift those costs to states and local communities through higher health care bills, degraded ecosystems, and long-term harm to our children’s futures.

Importantly, however, SCOTUS says it’s not the role of agencies (or courts) to speculate on environmental effects from subsequent projects.
The SCOTUS ruling largely follows these lines, so we’ll assume the justices are avid readers of R Street’s permitting work.
While I expect the SCOTUS decision to benefit infrastructure development timelines, the core issue of NEPA’s vagueness remains.","Advocates of building more things in America scored a big win last week in the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS). For some context, a proposed railroad in Utah that would have connected an oil field to downstream refineries was delayed over litigation challenging the adequacy of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared for it as compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The plaintiffs challenged that although the EIS had evaluated the direct environmental impacts of the railroad, the agency preparing the EIS had failed to consider the upstream and downstream environmental impacts from increased oil drilling and refinery use. Regular readers of Low-Energy Fridays will note that I often point to exactly this type of litigation as a common reason for delays in major infrastructure projects. SCOTUS handed down a unanimous decision approving the EIS, but more importantly, harshly noting that the lower courts are getting it all wrong on NEPA cases.

The fundamental challenge with NEPA litigation is that plaintiffs can broadly accuse permitting agencies of failing to have adequately considered some environmental impact associated with a project. It’s almost impossible for an agency to recognize every potential environmental impact of a major infrastructure project, and the EIS at the center of the SCOTUS case was over 3,600 pages long. But agencies try to be as broad as possible, and project opponents can use NEPA litigation to further move the goalposts. SCOTUS is essentially putting the kibosh on this by clarifying that the law only requires adequate evaluation, not exhaustive.

The SCOTUS ruling makes a couple key points, the first of which is that EISs need only focus on the direct environmental impacts of the proposed project. Agencies don’t need to consider how a project might affect someone else’s decision to build or not build something else. This is big, because major infrastructure projects have what we nerds call “incidental environmental impacts,” the indirect effects—positive or negative—of a project, which are extremely difficult to credibly evaluate. For example, while building a bridge directly impacts water quality and animal life in and around the waters, it also affects what gets built around the bridge, which affects further construction, and so on. Importantly, however, SCOTUS says it’s not the role of agencies (or courts) to speculate on environmental effects from subsequent projects.

At R Street, we’ve argued that the evaluation of incidental environmental impacts is outside the scope of NEPA, beyond the expertise of permitting agencies, and creates unnecessary delays without producing any discernable environmental benefit. The SCOTUS ruling largely follows these lines, so we’ll assume the justices are avid readers of R Street’s permitting work.

The second key point from the SCOTUS decision is that when NEPA permits are litigated, the immediate reaction of the courts should not be to vacate the decision—that is, if the courts find a fault in an EIS, it doesn’t mean the permit should be revoked until new documentation is prepared. This is particularly important because evidence indicates that litigation rarely has any substantive effect on environmental reviews.

SCOTUS is now saying these permits should only be withdrawn when there is a good reason to suspect that additional EIS documentation would have changed the agency’s decision to issue the permit. This substantially raises the bar for litigants that seek to delay or prevent construction, since any permitting deficiency they claim to occur will need to have been substantial enough that it would materially affect a project’s compliance with environmental law.

Overall, the SCOTUS ruling is good news from a permitting policy perspective: Agencies now have clearer guardrails on what they must evaluate, and the SCOTUS decision should make it tougher for permits to be needlessly delayed—so is the permitting policy issue solved?

Unfortunately, not quite. While I expect the SCOTUS decision to benefit infrastructure development timelines, the core issue of NEPA’s vagueness remains. Only Congress itself can correct that, since only they have the authority to narrow the scope of NEPA—even if SCOTUS has narrowed how courts ought to respond to NEPA-related cases. There is also a question of policy: How will current or future administrations promulgate their permitting decisions, and what will they consider adequate compliance with NEPA absent clarification from Congress?

In practice, the main effect of the SCOTUS ruling will be that litigants challenging NEPA decisions must clear a higher bar when challenging projects, while defendants who want to sustain a permit’s eligibility have a clear-cut defense that courts should not needlessly delay project construction. But much of this procedure still rests with the discretion of the permitting agency, which is why there is still a need for Congress to better define such functions.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AdobeStock_114815662-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 08:27:18.915193
,American Energy,2025-06-06 10:01:29+00:00,Nebraska Examiner,Nebraska needs a nuclear energy strategy,"Bruce Bostelman, Julie Masters, Heath Mello, Gregory Wees",,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/06/06/nebraska-needs-a-nuclear-energy-strategy/,"However, even as multiple power sources failed, one remained steadfast — nuclear energy.
To avoid future blackouts and maintain affordable, resilient, firm and reliable power, Nebraska needs nuclear energy.
Nuclear energy, which currently generates 17% of Nebraska’s power, brings unique strengths.
The cost of new nuclear energy is within a penny per kilowatt-hour of other forms of new energy sources, including natural gas, wind and solar.
It has proven a huge help in incentivizing the development of nuclear power at a time when NPPD is exploring options.","In February 2021, thousands of Nebraskans found themselves in the dark of rolling blackouts. A brutal polar vortex froze wind turbines, strained natural gas supplies and exposed serious weaknesses in our energy grid. However, even as multiple power sources failed, one remained steadfast — nuclear energy.

That moment was a wake-up call. We can no longer afford to treat energy policy as a matter of convenience or short-term cost. To avoid future blackouts and maintain affordable, resilient, firm and reliable power, Nebraska needs nuclear energy. Wind and solar are intermittent. Natural gas is a vital bridge fuel, but it is vulnerable to supply shocks in extreme weather. This is about building a reliable and resilient energy source that can deliver for Nebraska families, farmers and businesses when it counts.

Nuclear energy, which currently generates 17% of Nebraska’s power, brings unique strengths. It provides carbon-free baseload power that runs around the clock regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. During the 2021 deep freeze, Nebraska’s lone nuclear plant kept running at full strength while other sources faltered. The United Nations 2021 report, “Life Cycle Assessment of Electricity Generation Options,” shows that nuclear has the lowest overall impacts on human health and the environment by any measure and from any perspective.

The cost of new nuclear energy is within a penny per kilowatt-hour of other forms of new energy sources, including natural gas, wind and solar. Is that one cent too much to have a resilient, reliable power source for Nebraska?

We’ve seen what happens when nuclear gets overlooked. Omaha Public Power District’s Fort Calhoun plant and Nebraska Public Power District’s Cooper Nuclear Station accounted for about a quarter of Nebraska’s net generation capabilities before Fort Calhoun was shut down in 2016. The shut down was nearly two decades ahead of schedule, a casualty of market conditions that failed to account for long-term reliability and energy needs. Hundreds of skilled jobs were lost. Our energy safety net shrank.

And just a few years later, that decision looked shortsighted as the grid buckled under pressure. To avoid repeating that mistake, policymakers should ensure that energy markets properly value reliability and resilience.

As 26 House Republicans made clear in a late April letter to congressional leadership, protecting the federal nuclear production tax credit (PTC) is one way to do so. It has proven a huge help in incentivizing the development of nuclear power at a time when NPPD is exploring options. For Nebraska, the credit helps create and protect hundreds of high-paying, skilled jobs, generating local tax revenue and sustaining a stable source of affordable power.

Another step Congress could take is expanding investment incentives for next-generation technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs). These compact, scalable reactors can serve Nebraska’s rural areas and industrial parks where large traditional plants aren’t practical, offering flexibility and grid stability. Policies like the Advanced Nuclear Production Credit and bipartisan permitting reform proposals can help accelerate local deployment.

U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., has advocated for nuclear’s role in America’s energy future on the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee, where it helps Nebraska to have a voice in ensuring that our state’s long-term energy interests remain protected.

Nebraska’s energy future isn’t just about keeping the lights on. It’s about protecting lives during extreme weather, powering our farms and factories and anchoring high-skilled jobs in our communities. If we want to avoid another round of blackouts, we should encourage policies that keep every reliable tool in the toolbox — including nuclear.

All Maryland ratepayers are already due to receive a rebate on their utility bills next month.","Discussions about rising energy costs may have dominated this past Maryland General Assembly session. But even higher bills are on the way.

Beginning June 1, elevated rates took effect for utilities across Maryland, from Baltimore Gas & Electric to Delmarva Power and Pepco. The reasons go back to economics class: low supply and high demand. But who is to blame depends on who you ask.

Ratepayer advocates are quick to point the finger at PJM Interconnection, which operates the power grid in a 13-state region, including Maryland, for policies that have driven rates higher. They argue it has been slow to bring renewable energy projects online, constraining the supply, and it failed to account for skyrocketing demand from data centers.

PJM says it’s been warning of the impending supply crunch since “early 2023,” and that a combination of other market forces are at play — including climate change policy shuttering coal plants.

Years of market changes and policy choices have landed Maryland ratepayers in their current predicament, said Laurel Peltier, chair of the Maryland Energy Advocates Coalition, which focuses on low-income utility ratepayers.

“It’s like a teapot that’s been simmering — and it’s been simmering for a decade,” said Peltier, who is also an AARP Maryland utility advocate.

How much are my bills going up this time?

The exact amount of the increase differs depending on where you live. A report from the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, released last August, estimated that Delmarva Power households could see a $4 monthly increase, Pepco and SMECO customers could see a $14 increase and Potomac Edison customers could see an $18 increase.

BGE customers would fare the worst, with a $21 jump. But BGE ratepayers got some welcome news last week, when Maryland’s utility regulator, the Public Service Commission, ordered the utility company to spread out the increase, dulling the impact this summer, when bills will already be soaring due to higher energy use, and sharpening the impact in the fall, when bills are typically lower.

As a result, the increase will be $10 to $15 less than expected on customer’s bills from June through August. But from September through November, bills will be $10 to $15 higher than expected, according to Kathy Fueston, a spokesperson for the PSC.

But ultimately, BGE customers will pay the same total amount.

What’s the reason for this latest increase?

The story starts with PJM Interconnection, which runs an annual auction called the capacity market auction, which essentially ensures there is sufficient power during peak times.

Last year’s auction, which covers 2025, cleared at a record high price — an 800% increase compared to the year before, costing ratepayers a total of $14.7 billion in capacity costs, compared to $2.2 billion previously.

PJM blames the shutdown of costly coal and oil plants, and energy demands from data centers and the electrification of homes and cars, among other factors.

“These higher prices are the result of a loss in electricity supply caused primarily by decarbonization policies that have led to an uptick in generator retirements, coupled with an unprecedented spike in electricity demand due largely to the advancement of data centers to power artificial intelligence, the electrification of vehicles and heating systems, and the onshoring of U.S. manufacturing,” wrote Jeffrey Shields, a spokesman for PJM, in a statement.

But Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, who represents Maryland ratepayers, argued that PJM is “not being straightforward.”

He argues that power-hungry data centers, largely in Virginia, are the primary reason for the increase in demand. If it weren’t for those facilities, the demand, or load, on the PJM grid might not be increasing at all — even with the rise of EVs and electric heat pumps.

“Those load forecast changes are really driven by data-center growth,” Lapp said. “There has been very little growth in demand for quite some time, because of efficiency technologies. More efficient light bulbs, that sort of thing.”

It’s true that Maryland fossil fuel power plants are retiring, and this is impacting energy markets, Lapp said. But Lapp lays some of this blame at PJM’s feet.

Faced with a capacity shortage, PJM is requiring two fossil fuel power plants that were going to be retire this year, Talen Energy’s Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, to keep operating through 2029. It will cost ratepayers about $145 million annually to keep coal-fired Brandon Shores running and $35 million annually for oil-powered Wagner.

But when it held its annual capacity auction in 2024, PJM did not include the output from the two Talen Energy plants in the mix. That caused prices for 2025 to go up: The Office of People’s Counsel estimates that costs rose $5 billion in the auction because of the exclusion of the two plants.

Since last summer’s auction, PJM has changed its policy, with the approval of federal regulators. The electricity generated from “reliability must-run agreements,” like the ones for Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, must be included in the auction.

“Everyone knows that that’s not fair, to require customers to pay twice, and yet, that’s exactly what’s going to happen starting June 1,” Lapp said.

Emily Scarr, a senior adviser at Maryland PIRG who focuses on energy issues, said PJM also should have predicted that coal plants would retire, and it is responsible for planning adjustments to the electric grid accordingly.

“They say it’s a supply and demand imbalance. But what they don’t explain is: ‘Oh, we’re actually the ones who are in charge of controlling supply and demand, and we haven’t done our job,’” Scarr said.

Peltier, the low-income ratepayer advocate, worries about the customers who have been swept up in the recent price hikes, and are now behind on their bills. For instance, BGE recently reported that residential customers were a total of $171 million in arrears, compared to $97 million just last June. In a statement, BGE spokesman Nick Alexopulos cited cold temperatures in January and February 2025, which forced customers to use more energy to heat their homes.

But Republicans in the General Assembly say state policymakers are to blame for the supply shortage, and the resulting rate increases, which they attribute to the state’s policies to reduce carbon emissions. They note that all the state’s coal plants have announced plans to shut down in the years ahead.

“Maryland’s soaring electric rates are not a mystery — they’re a direct result of bad policy choices made by Democratic leaders,” wrote Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready in a recent statement.

“Their obsession with ‘green goals’ has come at the expense of energy reliability and affordability,” Ready wrote. “Now, plants they forced offline are still running because the grid can’t survive without them, and ratepayers are stuck paying hundreds of millions for that mistake.”

Lapp disagrees that Maryland policies played a role. Perhaps some of the blame could be chalked up to federal Clean Air Act policy requiring changes to how plants are operated, he said, but largely, it’s economics.

“Gas is a lot cheaper. Renewables don’t require fuel,” Lapp said. “So, there’s a reason why most of the PJM queue is wind and solar and battery.”

But a backlog in PJM’s queue for new power generation to come online has also influenced the supply curve, Scarr said.

“They’ve created this whole problem themselves, and if they just let clean energy connect, we wouldn’t be in this situation,” Scarr said.

A recent report predicted that Maryland ratepayers could save an average of $546 a year on their electric bills from 2025 to 2040 if PJM implements a laundry list of reforms to clear the bottleneck.

For its part, PJM argues that it is already making a number of reforms to the queue, including a new initiative to expedite “shovel-ready” projects.

In early May, PJM released the list of 51 projects it will expedite through the program, including 22 in Virginia and two in Maryland: a battery storage project in Harford County and an upgrade at a natural gas plant in Prince George’s County.

What happens next?

Lapp and the PSC, backed by 87 Maryland lawmakers, have asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to provide relief from rising rates, by overturning the $5 billion worth of auction costs associated with the Talen Energy deal.

“You just can recalculate the results of the auction, by counting the [Talen Energy] units,” Lapp said. “They could do that quickly.”

A FERC spokesperson declined to comment on when the commission might issue a ruling.

Lapp’s office asked FERC for expedited consideration before June 1. With a decision now coming later than that, Lapp said it’s possible that consumers could receive a future credit on their bills, if FERC rules in his favor.

All Maryland ratepayers are already due to receive a rebate on their utility bills next month. The rebate is estimated at $40 per household, though it depends on a customer’s electricity usage. A second payment is scheduled for January.

It comes from the Maryland General Assembly, which passed an energy reform package just before it adjourned in April. The total sum, about $200 million, is coming from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which is fueled by electricity generators, who submit “alternative compliance payments” when they do not purchase the required amount of renewable energy credits to comply with state law.

But the main thrust of the General Assembly’s energy reforms was increasing power generation and energy storage in the state, by creating streamlined permitting processes for both at the Maryland Public Service Commission. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have highlighted the fact that the state imports more power from other states than it generates within its borders.

Lapp questions whether increasing power generation in the state is needed, especially given that improvements are underway to transmission infrastructure, including to accommodate the eventual closure of Brandon Shores and Wagner.

“The fact that Maryland is a net importer, that’s nothing new, and it’s nothing to be alarmed about, especially because the amount that Maryland imports does not reflect a limitation on Maryland’s ability to generate energy,” he said. “It’s economics.”

He also wonders whether the legislature’s streamlined permitting process at the PSC is a big enough carrot to actually spur significant new power generators to set up shop in Maryland.

“Private companies, they already are able to build plants in Maryland, if the economics work out. So the question there is, does a little easier siting process — Does that change the economics?” Lapp said. “I’m not sure that it will.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/transmission-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 09:03:22.206402

“Between the recent actions by the Trump administration to severely limit the timing of environmental reviews, the Supreme Court’s decision narrowing the scope of environmental reviews, and Republicans’ Big Billionaire Bonus bill that creates a pay to play scheme—industry will have a free pass from all three branches of government to skirt the law that keeps our communities and planet healthy.

Since January 2025, enforcement and implementation of NEPA has been subject to attacks from all three branches of government:

Trump Administration

The Trump administration has cut federal employees and funding intended for expedited yet meaningful NEPA reviews.

On May 23, the administration rubberstamped a mine in just 11 days despite similar projects with complex proposals typically taking two years to meaningfully review, and

On May 28, Trump appointed the architect of the provisions that severely limited the timing of NEPA reviews in the Fiscal Responsibility Act to head the Permitting Council (formerly the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council).

Supreme Court

The Supreme Court unanimously limited the scope of environmental reviews required by NEPA on May 29.

Like most coal plants, Campbell was expensive to run.
That’s more heat-trapping emissions than any of the other 12 coal plants that had been slated to shut down this year.
Nevertheless, Campbell is now the second coal plant in the MISO region that will not be closing down as planned in 2025.
But the three deferred coal plant retirements put at risk nearly one third of the 47 million metric tons of carbon emissions cuts that were expected from the sector due to retirements this year.","The newest player on the U.S. coal scene, Core Natural Resources, had good news and bad news for investors when it announced its results for the start of the year.

The company missed Wall Street expectations with its net loss of $69 million, which it attributed mostly to birth pains: the costs of the January merger of Arch Resources and CONSOL Energy that created Core. The combined company has a solid position as the No. 2 coal producer in the United States, but that’s in a market where production has been cut in half in just a decade.

Nevertheless, company officials exulted because a surge of U.S. coal power plant shutdowns expected in 2025 was slowing. “Just since last fall, the delayed retirements have continued to build,” said Deck Slone, senior vice president for public policy, during the company’s May 8 earnings call. “Hopefully that drumbeat will continue.”

Last week, President Donald Trump’s administration grabbed the drumstick and picked up the pace. With an unusual emergency order, Energy Secretary Chris Wright blocked the retirement of the coal-fired J.H. Campbell Complex in Michigan, saying it was necessary to ensure that the lights stayed on for electricity customers in the Midwest this summer.

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies [to] threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families,” Wright said.

There is little doubt that U.S. electricity demand is growing after decades of staying flat, mostly due to industrial and data center needs. But there’s a great deal of debate about whether there’s a crisis; although Trump declared an energy “emergency” on his first day in office, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that electricity prices were lower and less volatile in 2024 than in the previous few years.

The growth of lower cost renewable energy and record-breaking deployment of battery storage across the system helped meet the new burden. And in a report last year, President Joe Biden’s administration laid out a roadmap for keeping up with demand while driving down carbon emissions, through investments in advanced grid technology and transmission and greater deployment of storage, distributed solar, wind, geothermal and advanced nuclear. Academics have proposed similar plans.

The Trump administration, which is pressing Congress to end Biden-era spending on an energy transition, instead favors the coal industry’s argument that the solution to growing electricity demand is already at hand—keeping old plants open. Electric grid operators have bolstered that view, calling it “one of the easiest approaches” to address the strain the system may face in the high-demand summer months, particularly in the Midwest.

Consumer and environmental advocates argue that the Trump administration’s intervention in the marketplace to keep Campbell and other fossil fuel plants open will be costly—for consumers, the environment and health.

According to a new study, costs have been rising significantly at the Campbell plant, and it happens to have the largest carbon footprint of the 13 coal plants that had been scheduled to close in 2025. Its smokestacks are among the top 10 industrial sources of hazardous pollution in Michigan, according to the federal Toxics Release Inventory, spewing mercury, lead, ammonia and other compounds. Advocates have argued its closure would save nearby residents millions of dollars in health care costs.

Cutting Carbon, Cutting Costs

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond when asked about the criticisms of the order keeping Campbell open. The federal government has issued emergency orders under the Federal Power Act about 25 times in the past 25 years to keep power plants running. But for the most part, this has occurred because of hurricanes, heat waves and overt shortages, like the California crisis of 2000.

The Campbell plant directive was one of four emergency orders that the Trump administration issued in just the past month, all of them pushing aside environmental and public health concerns in favor of getting and keeping power online.

In two May 16 orders, Wright directed Puerto Rico’s public power authority to cut back vegetation and override environmental laws to get old fuel oil generation stations running. On May 30, Wright blocked the planned retirement of the aging Eddystone oil and natural gas plant in Pennsylvania, arguing it was needed to shore up the grid against potential summer outages.

It was essentially the same argument Wright made on May 23, when he directed Campbell’s owner, Consumers Energy, to keep its 63-year-old plant in operation for 90 days—the maximum period allowed under the law (although such orders can be renewed).

The planned May 31 shutdown of Campbell, on the east shore of Lake Michigan, had been part of Consumers’ much-vaunted transition to cleaner energy. The company was already moving its workers at Campbell to other facilities and had planned an open house for local communities in June to mark the Campbell closure, which was set to happen years ahead of schedule.

That’s not to say everyone was happy. At least one local township council passed a resolution urging the utility to keep the plant open, and a group of Republican state legislators from Michigan sent a letter to Trump administration officials asserting that the plant had “years of useful life yet.”

But Consumers’ move to shutter Campbell wasn’t only about climate. Like most coal plants, Campbell was expensive to run. Consumers Energy had projected the retirement would save ratepayers $600 million over the next 20 years. The think tank Energy Innovation has calculated that like 95 percent of the U.S. coal fleet, Campbell could be replaced with local wind or solar at an immediate savings to consumers. In a new analysis released Wednesday, Energy Innovation reported that costs per megawatt-hour of operations at Campbell increased 21 percent, faster than inflation, since the group’s last detailed look at the facility in 2021.

“This is a plant that was preparing for retirement,” said Michelle Solomon, a manager in Energy Innovation’s electricity program. “I imagine they’ve used up all of their coal stored on site that they bought with long-term contracts. There’s a question of, have they been doing the maintenance required to keep this plant operational over the summer, and if not, is it even going to be a reliable plant, whether or not it’s needed?”

Brian Wheeler, a spokesman for Consumers Energy, says that the company has arranged for new shipments of coal to keep the plant operating.

“Consumers Energy plans to comply with the Department of Energy order,” he said. “We are pausing decommissioning activities at the Campbell plant and will operate it in compliance with the order, working in conjunction with MISO,” the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the organization that manages the regional grid.

“The company is actively working to determine appropriate cost recovery consistent with applicable law and the federal order,” Wheeler added. Typically, such costs are recovered through charges on customer bills, after approval of state regulators.

The Campbell plant’s retirement was viewed by many environmentalists as another victory in a long campaign to get the nation to transition away from the most carbon-polluting electricity fuel. About 780 coal power units in the United States have shut down since 2000, and coal’s share of the nation’s electricity mix has fallen from 50 percent to 16 percent. Even so, coal’s carbon intensity is such that it still generated more than half of the power sector’s carbon emissions, as of 2022.

The Campbell plant released 6.6 million metric tons of carbon in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. That’s more heat-trapping emissions than any of the other 12 coal plants that had been slated to shut down this year. An analysis by the Clean Air Task Force calculated that other pollutants from the Campbell complex, including harmful microscopic particles called particulate matter, were high enough to be associated with 44 premature deaths and 455 asthma attacks yearly.

“There is no basis for the DOE’s order whatsoever,” said Greg Wannier, a senior attorney at the Sierra Club, which has led a campaign to get the nation “Beyond Coal.” He pointed to an assessment of the Midwestern region’s electricity resources by MISO, completed just two days before Wright’s order, that concluded that the system’s capacity would be sufficient this summer if operations were normal.

But MISO and the other grid operators have been among the strongest voices calling for the old plants to stay open.

Grid Operators Urge Retirement Slowdown

In issuing his order to keep the Campbell plant open, Wright cited the summer assessment of the national grid oversight body, the North American Electric Reliability Corp., which found the entire middle of the country was at “elevated risk” for power outages at times of high demand.

MISO’s own senior vice president for planning and operation, Jennifer Curran, testified before Congress in March that the system was challenged by increasing demand at the same time that more intermittent resources like wind and solar were coming onto the grid. Even while MISO has maintained that its capacity resources are sufficient in the short term, she said more generation was “desperately needed to meet resource adequacy and reliability risks.”

“One of the easiest approaches,” she said, “is to slow down the retirement of existing resources.”

In emailed responses to questions from Inside Climate News, MISO spokesman Brandon Morris said the grid operator is working with Consumers Energy to comply with Wright’s order. To address reliability issues, he said, “delaying retirements or having a similar resource to replace it is still MISO’s position.” That doesn’t mean the grid operator is favoring coal, he said.

“MISO operates a fuel- and resource-agnostic market, calling on the most cost-efficient resources first to meet demand,” Morris wrote.

Nevertheless, Campbell is now the second coal plant in the MISO region that will not be closing down as planned in 2025. Vistra announced in December it would delay retirement of its Baldwin coal plant in Illinois “amid widespread concern over reliability in the MISO market.”

Meanwhile, the neighboring grid operator, PJM Interconnection, negotiated an agreement in January that keeps Talen Energy’s Brandon Shores coal plant in Maryland alive, a move protested by the state’s consumer advocate.

How often the Campbell, Baldwin and Brandon Shores plants run and how much coal they burn will depend on weather conditions and market prices as the grid operators work in real time to deploy generation to meet demand. But the three deferred coal plant retirements put at risk nearly one third of the 47 million metric tons of carbon emissions cuts that were expected from the sector due to retirements this year.

John Moore, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the emergency orders to keep plants open were “wholly unnecessary,” noting that both MISO and PJM had studied the retirements at the time they were proposed and found no need to keep the plants online. Moore said some of the issues grid operators now face are of their own making, due to poor planning and in PJM’s case, a years-long backup of clean energy projects that are queued up, waiting approval to be connected to the grid.

“To avoid actual grid emergencies in the future, the [grid operators] need to step up their resource adequacy game, especially PJM, whose planning, interconnection, and markets have not kept pace with the energy transition,” Moore wrote in an email.

“Grid operators should be opposing these orders,” he said. “Unfortunately, their tacit or explicit acceptance signals that their resource adequacy processes aren’t working. They need to robustly plan within and between grid regions and break the unacceptable logjam in the enormous interconnection queues. Until they do, consumers and public health will suffer the consequences.”

Staying “In the Mix”

The coal industry sees deferred retirements in a different light. Before the start of this year, the nation’s second-largest coal mine, Core Natural Resources’ Black Thunder Mine in Wyoming, was facing the imminent loss of nearly 12 percent of its sales volume due to power plant retirements, according to data collected by the Energy Information Administration. Campbell was the largest buyer of five Black Thunder customer plants that had recently closed or were closing in 2025.

Core Natural Resources made the case for action directly with Trump administration officials, according to its first quarter lobbying disclosure. Although it didn’t mention specific power plants, the company reported advocating on “grid reliability issues” and “energy-related executive orders.”

Core did not immediately respond to a request for more details on its pleas to the Trump administration. In recent years, the coal industry has been spending roughly $4 million per year on lobbying, according to the watchdog group OpenSecrets. That’s a fraction of the $14 million to $24 million it spent 16 years ago to block President Barack Obama’s effort to get Congress to pass climate legislation. Nevertheless, the diminished dollars have gone a long way. Trump laid the groundwork for the Campbell order in his first-day declaration of an energy emergency and a slew of orders he issued on April 8 aimed specifically at keeping the coal industry alive.

“It’s nice to have an administration that recognizes the industry and the importance that it has on the U.S. economy and really what it means relative to power prices in the U.S.,” said Core Natural Resources CEO Paul Lang in the company’s earnings call last month. “They believe coal should be in the mix and should stay in the mix.”

Whether presidential power can beat the forces lined up against coal remains to be seen. This week, Core notified 200 mineworkers in West Virginia they’d be losing their jobs this summer due to “weaker than expected market conditions.”

“The change in gas demand is pretty large without the tax credits.","Energy policy analysts are in broad agreement about one consequence of major legislation that Republicans are currently pushing through Congress: It will raise energy prices for the average American household by hundreds of dollars, once all is said and done.

That’s because the legislation, which President Donald Trump has dubbed the Big Beautiful Bill, will repeal the vast majority of clean energy provisions contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which a Democrat-controlled Congress passed in 2022. That earlier law provided a wide array of financial incentives for the deployment of electricity sources like solar, wind, battery storage, and nuclear power, as well as support for consumers looking to buy zero- and low-emissions products like electric vehicles. Choking off support for those measures not only hobbles U.S. efforts to fight climate change — the IRA, if left intact, could single-handedly reduce the country’s carbon emissions by 40 percent — but it also means there are fewer new sources of energy for a country that has started to need more and more of it. And reduced supply coupled with increased demand means higher prices.

That’s the virtually unanimous conclusion of the academics and policy experts who have been trying to understand the likely effects of the rollback for the past few months, though each group of experts used different assumptions about the full extent of IRA repeal, given that the legislation is still currently being revised by the Senate. Part of the reason for this unanimity is that, once constructed, many newer energy sources like wind and solar don’t have substantial operating costs, compared to traditional power plants that must be continuously supplied with fuel.

“Clean electricity has zero generation cost,” said Robbie Orvis, a senior director for modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank. “One of the dynamics is that less clean electricity gets built, and that makes power generation more expensive, because we’re relying more frequently on fossil fuels with higher generation costs.”

Orvis’ group calculated that those higher power generation costs from using coal or natural gas, along with other price increases stemming from IRA repeal, would result in household energy costs rising by more than $33 billion annually by 2035, compared to a scenario in which the IRA were left intact. That works out to roughly $250 more per year per household. Other analysts came to similar conclusions: The Rhodium Group, an independent policy analysis firm, estimates that average household costs could be as much as $290 higher per year by the same date. Princeton University’s ZERO Lab projects that energy costs could grow even higher: Their estimates show that, in a decade, annual household prices will be $270 to $415 higher under the GOP plan.

Energy Innovation’s analysis calculated the effects of repealing the IRA on energy bills and transportation costs across the nation. They found that, if the tax credits for clean energy are taken away, utilities will increasingly rely on natural gas and coal, which have higher generation costs. These costs would then be passed on to customers. Additionally, as electric utilities’ demand for natural gas increases, the cost of the fossil fuel in the market will also rise, further raising household energy bills.

“Gas suppliers can’t respond immediately to large changes in the demand for gas,” said Orvis. “The change in gas demand is pretty large without the tax credits. So you’re really increasing the reliance on gas, and therefore, gas demand and gas prices.”

On the transportation front, the legislation passed by the House of Representatives eliminates IRA tax credits for electric vehicles and undoes the nation’s latest tailpipe standards, which limit the amount of pollution that new vehicles are allowed to emit. The result is a greater reliance on gasoline than would happen under the status quo — and more demand for gasoline means higher prices at the pump, per Orvis’ modeling.

These price spikes — and the electricity spikes in particular — won’t be felt uniformly across the nation. One key factor is how utilities in a state are regulated. Many states have just one utility that both generates power and provides it to electricity customers. But in so-called deregulated markets such as Texas and Pennsylvania, electricity providers compete on an open market to sell their power.

The rules around how utilities calculate and pass on the costs of generating electricity vary significantly between these two models. In regulated markets with just one provider, the cost of generating electricity and getting it to homes is averaged out and passed on to customers. But the competitive nature of deregulated markets means that customers can see wild fluctuations in price. During peak winter and summer, when demand for power is high, prices can be double or triple normal rates. As a result, customers in deregulated markets see more variation in their bills — because those bills closely track changes in the marginal cost of electricity. If those costs rise in a dramatic and systematic way because IRA repeal leads to fewer sources of energy, customers in deregulated markets will feel the full force of it. Customers in regulated markets like much of the Southeast, on the other hand, will be somewhat cushioned from the increase, because their costs reflect the average of all generation and transmission costs incurred by their utility.

“That helps minimize the impact of repealing IRA tax credits — though it also runs the opposite way and helps reduce savings when market prices go down,” said Jesse Jenkins, an associate professor at Princeton University who led the modeling conducted by the ZERO Lab, in an email.

These rising costs will come on top of U.S. energy bills that are already ticking upward. Electricity prices have been steadily rising since 2020, and the federal Energy Information Administration recently forecasted that that trend is likely to continue through 2026. Prices have increased for a variety of reasons, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupting global oil and gas supply chains, extreme heat and other weather shocks, costly maintenance needed to protected the grid from wildfires, and the buildout of additional capacity to meet growing demand. U.S. electricity demand is beginning to rise for the first time in decades, thanks to the construction of new manufacturing facilities and data centers, which support operations like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, as well as the growing adoption of electric vehicles.

Orvis said that the IRA has been helping meet that demand and maintain the country’s competitive advantage with China, one of the Trump administration’s stated goals. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill would undermine that progress by reducing the amount of energy available for new manufacturing and AI development — and making the electricity that’s left more expensive for everyone.

“The ironic thing is that what’s in the bill, the net results of it will be completely contradictory to what the [Trump] administration’s stated policy priorities are and will cede a lot of the AI development and the manufacturing to China specifically,” said Orvis. “That’s the important macro context for everything that’s happening now — and some of the un-modelable implications in the long run.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2217850172.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-06-06 09:03:36.978014

This steady growth in clean energy spending reflects a shift away from fossil fuels, yet the agency points to underlying weaknesses in grid infrastructure and a lack of progress across developing economies.

Clean energy outpaces fossil fuels

The IEA report makes it clear: clean energy investment is set to double that of fossil fuels in 2025.

The US$2.2tn forecast includes renewables such as solar and wind, nuclear power, electricity grids, battery storage, energy efficiency measures, electrification and low-emissions fuels.

Fossil fuels will account for around US$1.1tn.

Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA, says: “Amid the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that are clouding the outlook for the energy world, we see energy security coming through as a key driver of the growth in global investment this year to a record US$3.3tn as countries and companies seek to insulate themselves from a wide range of risks.

“The fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects.”

While some investors delay new approvals due to market uncertainties, Fatih notes that existing projects are mostly unaffected.

The share of clean energy investment has steadily grown over five years, supported by climate targets, post-pandemic economic recovery and industrial policy.

Electric mobility is a major growth area. In markets like China, electric vehicles (EVs) are now price-competitive with petrol-powered alternatives.

Electrification of transport is seen as a key route to emissions reduction.

Around 70% of the global growth in clean energy investment has come from countries that rely heavily on fossil fuel imports — including China, India and European nations.

In the United States, the push is also strategic, as competition with China shapes policy around clean tech supply chains.

Electricity sector investment alone is expected to hit US$1.5tn in 2025, which is 50% more than what will be spent on all fossil fuel supply.

Frederic Godemel, EVP of Energy Management at Schneider Electric, says: “It’s encouraging to see growing global investment in the energy transition. We’re getting closer to the US$3.5tn annual capital needed between now and 2050 to achieve net zero, but there’s still more to be done.”

“We cannot let geopolitical uncertainty or economic headwinds derail our progress, after all the climate crisis doesn’t abide by our political or economic cycles.

“We must move beyond cautious optimism. With many clean energy projects still stalling, we need to double down on demand-side solutions, which are half of the solution to net zero.

""We have the technologies to decarbonise today, now it’s about scaling Electricity 4.0 – the combination of electric and digital – to drive immediate progress.”

Solar, nuclear and coal jostle for space

Power generation from low emissions sources is gaining traction.

Investment in solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is projected at US$450bn in 2025, making it the top investment area globally.

Battery storage, critical for grid flexibility, will attract US$66bn.

China continues to expand its solar influence.

Pakistan alone imported 19 GW of solar modules in 2024, nearly half its entire grid-connected capacity.

Nuclear power is also on the rise, with spending set to exceed $70bn in 2025 — up 50% over five years.

Small modular reactors are drawing interest, and new gas-fired capacity is being added in the US and Middle East.

However, the fossil fuel sector presents a mixed picture.

While upstream oil investment is expected to fall by 6% — the largest drop since 2016 — coal activity is rising.

China and India approved nearly 115 GW of new coal power in 2024, the highest since 2015.

In contrast, no new coal-fired steam turbines were ordered in advanced economies, a first.

Fatih recalls: “When the IEA published the first ever edition of its World Energy Investment report nearly ten years ago, it showed energy investment in China in 2015 just edging ahead of that of the United States.

""Today, China is by far the largest energy investor globally, spending twice as much on energy as the European Union and almost as much as the EU and United States combined.”

Grids and global inequalities hinder progress

While clean generation grows, electricity grids are lagging. Current annual grid investment sits at US$400bn — less than half of what is spent on generation assets.

This creates a bottleneck for renewables.

The IEA points to lengthy permitting, shortages in key components like transformers and cables, and financially weak utilities in developing nations.

Low-emissions fuel investment is projected to exceed US$30bn in 2025, and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) could see a tenfold increase by 2027 if planned projects go ahead.

Hydrogen investment is expected to reach US$8bn in 2025, nearly double the previous year, although some schemes have been cancelled or delayed.

China, Europe and the US lead global clean energy investment.

Distributed under the Industrial Demonstrations Program at the Energy Department’s now-embattled Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the funding promised to bolster the manufacturing sector with a major investment in technologies meant to give American companies an edge in global markets.
In addition, federal researchers expected to gather information through the projects that could be used broadly throughout U.S. industry to improve output and bring down energy costs.
Absent that, Mulholland said, U.S. companies risk falling behind competitors who benefit from lower-cost labor and easily accessible components from nearby industrial clusters, like those in Vietnam, China, or Germany.
They need a government incentive to make the technological changes they were trying to do,” the former OCED official said.","Last week, the Trump administration canceled $3.7 billion in federal funding for two dozen green industrial projects that the Department of Energy claimed ​“failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable, and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

More than a quarter of that spending would have gone to 11 projects designed to cut planet-warming pollution from generating the heat used in factories — one of the trickiest decarbonization challenges to solve.

“This is a really, really significant setback for clean heat in the U.S.,” said Brad Townsend, the vice president of policy and outreach at the think tank Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES).

The wide-ranging projects included installing industrial heat pumps at up to 10 plants where giant Kraft Heinz Co. produces its foodstuffs, building an electric boiler at one of plumbing-fixture manufacturer Kohler Co.’s Arizona factories, and adding a heat battery to Eastman Chemical Co.’s facility in Texas.

Distributed under the Industrial Demonstrations Program at the Energy Department’s now-embattled Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the funding promised to bolster the manufacturing sector with a major investment in technologies meant to give American companies an edge in global markets.

Groups such as C2ES and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimated the federal support would generate hundreds of thousands of jobs in both direct construction and operations and indirect hiring at real estate firms, restaurants, and retailers near the industrial sites. In addition, federal researchers expected to gather information through the projects that could be used broadly throughout U.S. industry to improve output and bring down energy costs.

“The data and lessons learned in de-risking this technology would then translate into follow-up investment in the private sector,” said Marcela Mulholland, a former official at the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations who now leads advocacy at the nonpartisan climate group Clean Tomorrow.

“If you were in a technology area covered by OCED, you needed public investment to scale,” she added. ​“Something in the proverbial ​‘valley of death’ made it difficult for the private sector to advance the technology on its own.”

With the funding, U.S. industry had the chance to develop new approaches that could produce greener — and cheaper — materials, giving American manufacturers an edge over Asian or European rivals as corporate and national carbon-cutting policies put a premium on products made with less emissions. Absent that, Mulholland said, U.S. companies risk falling behind competitors who benefit from lower-cost labor and easily accessible components from nearby industrial clusters, like those in Vietnam, China, or Germany.

“It’s hard to overstate the scale of the loss,” Mulholland said.

Already, a handful of companies are considering shifting production overseas in the wake of the funding cuts, according to two sources who have directly spoken to leaders of firms that lost federal funding. The sources were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the plans.

“When these projects don’t go forward, we’re going to see challenges for the companies from a profitability perspective and from a global competitiveness perspective,” said Richard Hart, industry director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. ​“What happens then is other countries and other companies will step in to meet those demands.”

In the long term, he added, the cuts erode the value of a federal contract.

“When the U.S. government signs a contract with you, it’s reasonable to assume that that contract is gold and that you can use that contract to make plans as a company that … you can explain to investors, to employees, and to the full group of stakeholders around your facilities,” Hart said. ​“The loss of trust that comes from canceling those contracts is likely to be pervasive. That’s very sad.”

Part of the problem is that the contracts were cost-share agreements, which traditionally give the federal government the right to exit the deals without any legal penalty. In theory, OCED could have structured the federal contracts differently through a category known plainly as ​“Other Transactions.” The Department of Commerce, for example, issued money from the CHIPS and Science Act to semiconductor companies through such ​“other transactions” that lack the same off-ramps for the government.

But the Commerce Department did so under the advice of a legal memo from its general counsel. By contrast, the Energy Department ​“is way, way behind” on adopting alternative contract structures when disbursing money, according to a former OCED official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

As a result, the agency stuck to the financing mechanisms with which it was familiar — such as cost-share agreements.

Internally, the Trump administration said the cuts were justified in part because the companies involved were well funded and could manage the investments themselves, the official said.

“But I don’t think that’s the case. They need a government incentive to make the technological changes they were trying to do,” the former OCED official said.

“I would bet less than half of them keep going by themselves,” the official added. ​“It’s a big blow.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/doe-sign.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=61c5ff230926877f0c851058b51b54f5,N,,2025-06-06 08:24:33.770675

In those moments, the grid operator will order power plant owners to reduce their output. That’s called curtailment, and it’s common in places like California that have lots of renewables.

It’s no surprise that California is having to curtail power as it adds more solar to the grid — but curtailments are rising faster in the state than renewable generation capacity is growing. Last year, curtailments jumped by 29% compared with 2023, while California added only about 12% more utility-scale solar capacity.

Curtailments are at their highest in California during the spring, when the sun is strong enough to generate a lot of solar power but mild weather keeps air-conditioning use, and thus electricity demand, in check.

With power demand rising around the country thanks in large part to the rapid rollout of AI data centers, and with California behind on climate goals, it’s important for the state to try and reduce curtailments and use more of the clean power it’s already capable of generating.

There are a few ways to do that. California can continue to push buildings, vehicles, and industrial operations to electrify, creating more demand to soak up what is now surplus solar. It can support the construction of interstate transmission lines that would allow it to export more power to states with less solar generation.

The state can also build lots and lots of batteries to store extra solar produced during the day for use in the evening. In fact, it’s already doing that. It has installed more utility-scale storage than any other state, and the sector has grown rapidly in recent years: California had a total of 13.2 GW of utility-scale storage online as of last month, far more than the nearly 8 GW it had at the end of 2023.

On March 4, 2025, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in City and County of San Francisco v. Environmental Protection Agency, holding that EPA does not have the authority to issue “end-result” requirements in National Pollutant Discharge Emissions System (“NPDES”) permits under the Clean Water Act (“CWA”).

The CWA’s NPDES framework prohibits the discharge of pollutants from point sources to any “water of the United States” unless authorized by permit. A key statutory protection is the “permit shield”: if a permittee complies with its permit, it is deemed in compliance with the CWA (33 U.S.C. § 1342(k)).

At issue in this case was the City and County of San Francisco’s (“San Francisco”) NPDES permit for its Oceanside combined wastewater facility (mixed wastewater and stormwater). For years, the permit contained certain effluent limitations pertaining to the levels of pollutants that could be present in the material that was discharged, but in 2019, EPA added two so-called “end-result” requirements to the permit. These requirements did not set specifications for what could be discharged, but rather prohibited discharges that would violate water quality standards for the receiving water (the ocean) or otherwise pollute or contaminate it, leaving it to San Francisco to figure out how to achieve that. Specifically, the permit included the following two “end-result” requirements:

A prohibition on any discharge that would “cause or contribute to a violation of any applicable water quality standard . . . for receiving waters.”

A statement that “neither the treatment nor the discharge of pollutants shall create pollution, contamination, or nuisance” as defined by California law.

For many years, EPA routinely included these types of “end-result” requirements in permits as a backstop to effluent limitations. In this case, San Francisco challenged these requirements as beyond EPA’s authority under the CWA.

The case turned on the meaning of the term “limitation” as used in 33 U.S.C. § 1311(b)(1)(C) of the CWA. This section allows EPA to include “effluent limitations” and “any more stringent limitation” necessary to meet water quality standards in NPDES permits.

San Francisco first argued that EPA only has authority to issue effluent limitations. The Court rejected this argument, finding that Congress would not have used the language “any more stringent limitation” immediately after using the term “effluent limitations” if it intended to limit EPA’s authority to only effluent limitations.

However, the Court did agree with San Francisco’s alternative argument that the term “limitation” means that EPA must be the one to determine and implement standards to achieve water quality standards and cannot shift this responsibility onto permittees by prescribing only the outcome. The majority opinion pointed to three main reasons for this conclusion:

A “limitation” is defined as a “restriction . . . imposed from without,” meaning a “provision that tells a permittee that it must do certain specific things” and not an end-result requirement that puts the responsibility to figure out how to achieve it on the permittee.

The legislative history of the CWA suggests that it was Congress’ intent for the CWA to impose direct restrictions on pollution rather than to work backwards from pollution to assign responsibility. Working backwards was the statutory scheme of the original version of the CWA, and Congress overhauled it in 1972 because it did not think that system was working.

Two features of the broader statutory scheme of the CWA support this conclusion: (1) end-result requirements would negate the CWA’s “permit shield,” which protects permittees from liability as long as they are complying with their permit, even if they violate water quality standards; and (2) end-result requirements would provide no mechanism for fair allocation of responsibility when there are multiple dischargers contributing to violations of water quality standards.

In sum, the majority opinion concluded that “§1311(b)(1)(C) does not authorize the EPA to include ‘end-result’ provisions in NPDES permits. Determining what steps a permittee must take to ensure that water quality standards are met is the EPA’s responsibility.”

The dissent, on the other hand, believed that EPA had the authority to impose end-result requirements under the “any more stringent limitation” language in the statute.

Implications

This decision will impact how EPA and states with NPDES authority issue permits, compelling them to set more specific requirements and relieving permittees of the burden of figuring out how to achieve water quality standards. How this will affect the permit process is still unclear. In many instances, EPA lacks detailed information required to lay out specific effluent limitations a discharger must comply with. In the past, it has issued NPDES permits with end-result requirements to avoid delays or denials of permits. Now that this is no longer an option, as the dissent points out, this may slow down the permitting processes.

For large-scale dischargers like municipal stormwater and sewer systems, this decision may prove to be a double-edged sword. While the onus is now on EPA to set specific requirements in NPDES permits instead of leaving this to the discharger, this could cause issues in obtaining permits that would otherwise have been issued with end-result requirements. Moreover, it is unclear if the current administration’s efforts to downsize EPA will affect the permit process further. Affected dischargers should keep a close eye on how the impacts of this decision develop.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12559_3740.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 11:22:50.599958

Mike Dunleavy’s annual energy conference included visits from three of the Trump administration’s top officials, but it didn’t include any major developments on the financing of the proposed 800-mile trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.

U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, traveled to the North Slope and to Anchorage this week during a visit that coincided with the fourth annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference.

Despite the conference’s name, oil and gas development took top billing, with all three officials saying that they hope to increase oil and gas production in Alaska under the direction of President Donald Trump.

“President Trump wants to see the flows through (the trans-Alaska Pipeline System) doubled,” Wright said during a speech on the North Slope this week. “The oil is here. The discoveries are here. If we free Alaska and the people here (from regulation), we’re going to more than double the oil flow through the pipeline and build the big, beautiful twin, the natural gas pipeline, from the North Slope.”

Despite the week’s enthusiasm for the Alaska Liquefied Natural Gas pipeline, better known as AKLNG, it still isn’t clear who will pay for it to get built.

The natural gas pipeline and associated processing plants are expected to cost $38.7 billion, but that estimate was published in 2020, and it predates inflation-driven and tariff-driven cost increases under the Biden and Trump presidencies.

Energy developer Glenfarne, which is pursuing AKLNG on behalf of the state, announced this week that 50 firms had formally expressed interest in AKLNG contracts worth more than $115 billion.

Those contracts include possible supply agreements — people interested in selling things to AKLNG for construction — as well as possible investors.

An expression of interest isn’t a firm commitment, and no investors said this week that they will back the project. Officials from Japan, Korea and other nations — possible customers for Alaska gas — visited the state this week but made no announcements.

Taiwan’s state-run energy company, CPC, signed a non-binding agreement in March stating that it would buy liquefied natural gas from Alaska and invest in the project.

As currently envisioned, AKLNG would be constructed in two phases — the first would be a pipeline from the North Slope to Fairbanks and Southcentral Alaska for domestic, in-Alaska gas customers.

The second phase would involve facilities and equipment needed to export gas overseas.

Glenfarne is expected to announce a go/no-go final investment decision on the first phase by the end of the year.

Speaking to NBC reporters in Prudhoe Bay, Burgum said that the U.S. military could be a key customer for the first phase of the project.

“They’re ready to sign on to take an offtake agreement from this pipeline to get gas to our super strategic, important bases across Alaska,” he said on CNBC.

Actually signing a customer agreement could make financing easier to come by.

“If you get the commercial offtakers for the gas, financing is pretty straightforward,” Wright told CNBC.

Legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden allows $30 billion in federally guaranteed loans for the project.

This week, Wright told reporters in Anchorage that the U.S. Energy Department could make additional loans available.

“They’re going to get details of the project to come together, but I think it’s quite likely that you will see loan guarantees provided by the loan program office at the Department of Energy to build the pipeline part of that project,” he said.

Under the Biden administration, the DOE’s Loan Programs Office grew into a major financier for green-energy projects.

The results mirror growing pockets of opposition to solar farms, reignited political support for coal plants and moves by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to kill federally funded clean energy projects.

Still, Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment, was surprised.

“I see this shift … as a successful effort to link climate change and renewable energy to broader culture war issues,” Gillingham said. He added that in the past, “prominent” Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as “disloyal” to Trump.

The survey of 5,085 U.S. adults taken April 28 to May 4 revealed that while 79% of Americans favored expanding wind and solar production in 2020, that number has dropped to 60%. And 39% of Americans today support expansion of oil, coal and natural gas — almost double the 20% that supported it in 2020.

Combustion of fossil fuels — in transportation, energy generation and industrial production — is the No. 1 cause of climate change.

Much of the change in opinion is driven by Republicans, whose support of oil and gas grew from 35% in 2020 to 67% today. But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.

While many results reflect Trump’s policies opposing most renewables and boosting fossil fuels, Pew found a few notable exceptions: 69% of all respondents favor offshore wind — a technology Trump has specifically targeted.

Both Democrats and Republicans indicated stronger support for nuclear power, with Republicans’ favorable opinions increasing from 53% in 2020 to 69% in 2025. Democrats’ support rose from 37% to 52%. The Trump administration has signaled support for a nuclear renaissance, despite its high cost.

There were wide partisan splits on several topics. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would scale back environmental regulations. Pew asked whether it was possible to do that and still protect air and water quality: 77% of Republicans said yes and 67% of Democrats said no.

Pew didn’t ask the respondents why their attitudes have shifted. But Kennedy said in Pew’s past surveys, Republicans have expressed concern about the economic impacts of climate change policies and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant and electric vehicle backer, said when the environmental benefits of clean technologies are touted, it polarizes Republicans. Instead, Murphy said messages should be about pocketbook issues — like lower fuel costs — and jobs.

“It’s hard for pro-climate people to understand,” said Murphy, who has advised dozens of state and national GOP campaigns including John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid. “(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate. The key is you want to talk about jobs and national security and other events that naturally resonate a lot more with right-of-center people.”

That’s what Murphy’s groups, the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance are trying to do to depoliticize electric vehicles. “Whenever electric cars are seen through a climate lens,” Murphy said, “their appeal narrows.”

It’s a strategy also being used by the Electrification Coalition, a left-of-center pro-EV group. Ben Prochazka, the coalition’s executive director, echoed Murphy’s strategy, adding that EVs have “become overly politicized and caught in the culture wars, impacting markets and ultimately hurting our ability to realize their many benefits for all Americans.”

Prochazka noted that once introduced to EVs, consumers support them: “EV drivers love their vehicles, with more than eight out of ten reporting that their next car will also be electric.”

Perhaps those practical messages are getting through. In the Pew survey, electric vehicles were the one item that saw an uptick in support – 4 percentage points in the past year.

But popular support might not be enough to stop Congress from killing a $7,500 electric vehicle credit, which Murphy said would be “policy disaster.”

Republicans, he said, are in a “real squeeze,” because “they don’t have enough money for the tax cuts the president has promised.”

Said Murphy: “It’s easier for Republicans to cut Biden electric cars … than it is for them to cut more Medicaid.”

Gillingham is still optimistic that solar, wind and other greenhouse gas-reducing technologies will move forward — because they are the cheapest.

“The continued decline in the price of renewable energy and battery technologies, as well as other new technologies, is a reason to continue to have hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be addressed,” he said.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/offshore_wind_turbines-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 09:03:46.260979

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Following through on the threat could cost Musk billions. His two largest companies, SpaceX and Tesla, both benefit from a wide array of government programs ranging from lunar launch contracts to electric car incentives.

Musk answered Mr. Trump with a threat of his own, vowing to cut off SpaceX's manned spacecraft program. Investors appear to be taking the squabble seriously: As the two men traded barbs Thursday, Tesla's share price tanked 14%.

SpaceX

Musk's rocket company has received tens of billions of dollars from the federal government over the last decade, including $3.8 billion in the 2024 fiscal year alone, according to federal records.

The bulk of those federal grants are from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA has paid SpaceX billions over the last decade to ferry astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station. The agency has also awarded SpaceX upwards of $2 billion in recent years to design and build a lunar lander, as part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in a half-century.

NASA's partnership with Musk ramped up during the Obama administration, which hired SpaceX and Boeing to build spacecraft to transport astronauts — aiming to end NASA's reliance on Russia following the end of the Space Shuttle program. In recent years, SpaceX has carried out several missions to and from the space station using its Dragon spacecraft.

Musk responded to Mr. Trump's threat Thursday to cut off contracts by saying SpaceX would ""begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately."" Hours later, Musk wrote, ""Ok, we won't decommission Dragon,"" in response to an X user who encouraged him to ""cool off and take a step back.""

A NASA spokesperson told CBS News the agency will ""continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the President's objectives in space are met.""

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, dismissed the idea that the government would cancel contracts with Musk and his companies. ""I'm [not] going to comment on who's right or wrong. But [Trump's] not going to take away our only way to get to the Space Station [and] back. I mean, that's ridiculous,"" he told reporters Thursday.

SpaceX has received grants from a handful of other federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, which has awarded the company hundreds of millions for launch services.

Starlink — a division of SpaceX that offers satellite internet services — also has links to the federal government. As of earlier this year, the company was in line to take over a multi-billion dollar contract to upgrade the Federal Aviation Administration's aging air traffic control communication systems.

Tesla

Musk's electric car company gets far fewer direct federal grants than SpaceX — but it indirectly makes billions of dollars a year as a result of various state and federal programs.

The federal government has signed deals to buy cars from Tesla here and there, though a plan for the State Department to buy some $400 million worth of armored vehicles was called off this year.

More importantly, Tesla reported making almost $2.8 billion last year by selling ""regulatory credits"" to other carmakers, helping rival companies reach the car emissions rules set by various governments. Tesla is in an unusually strong position to sell credits because, unlike most carmakers, it exclusively makes zero-emission electric vehicles — and those credit sales come at a ""negligible"" cost to the company, Tesla said in its 2024 annual report.

Many credits are sold to comply with state-level emissions rules, most notably in California, though congressional Republicans have sought to roll back some of the federal waivers that California needs to impose tougher emissions standards than the federal government.

If California's regulatory credit program goes away, it could cost Tesla some $2 billion, JPMorgan Chase estimated in a report last month.

Tesla customers also benefit from a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, a program designed to increase sales of electric cars — including Teslas. And the company's solar power division gets a boost from federal renewable energy tax credits. Many of those incentives would end or face new restrictions under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a domestic policy bill containing Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. It passed by the House last month and is now being considered by the Senate.

The end of those tax credits may cost Tesla $1.2 billion, according to JPMorgan Chase.

Musk has previously shrugged off the idea of winding down electric car tax incentives: ""Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,"" he said on X last year. Some analysts — and possibly Musk — think an end to electric car credits would hurt Tesla's rivals more than Tesla. Nonetheless, in a post last month, Tesla pushed for a ""sensible wind down"" of some renewable energy tax credits, arguing an abrupt end would ""would threaten America's energy independence.""

Musk, for his part, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act a ""disgusting abomination"" this week, helping ignite the feud with Mr. Trump. The billionaire's public criticisms of the bill focus largely on the bill's cost. But Mr. Trump said Thursday that Musk ""went CRAZY"" after ""I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted.""

Tesla's early growth was also fueled by federal money. The company earned a $465 million Department of Energy loan meant to boost electric car production in 2010, and paid the government back several years later.

CBS News has reached out to Tesla and SpaceX for comment.

This isn't the first time the president has needled Musk over his companies' federal subsidies. In a 2022 feud, Mr. Trump claimed Musk would be ""worthless"" without hefty subsidies for ""electric cars that don't drive long enough"" and ""rocketships to nowhere.""

At that time, Musk argued Mr. Trump should not run for another term as president, saying he should ""hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.""

The two ended up mending their relationship. Musk spent hundreds of millions to help elect Mr. Trump in 2024, and he led the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency in the Trump administration's early months, forging a tight alliance with Mr. Trump — until this week.

The tremendous influence of oil and gas companies over political decisions in Brazil is purely a matter of money.
The decision to halt the opening of new oil and gas fields in Amazonia must come from the top, that is, from President Lula.
The president’s support for the project is clearly inconsistent with his rhetoric on climate change.
This requires leading by example by immediately cancelling Brazil’s plans for new oil and gas fields.","On May 19, the head of IBAMA, Brazil’s federal environmental agency, overrode the technical opinion of the agency’s licensing department and issued a decision allowing proposed oil drilling in the FZA-M-59 drilling block in the mouth of the Amazon River to proceed for approval. Pressure on IBAMA has been intense with the approach of the massive June 17 auction of drilling rights, which includes 47 blocks in the mouth of the Amazon River.

Environmental approval of the first block is seen as essential to stimulate oil companies to risk their capital in purchasing drilling rights in the blocks that are up for auction. Direct pressure from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is a likely explanation for IBAMA’s change, as indicated by his comment that he would close the issue of licensing the mouth-of-the-Amazon project upon return from his recent visits to Moscow and Beijing.

At the same time, the National Congress was racing to approve a proposed law that would gut Brazil’s environmental licensing procedures, led by the most powerful proponent of the mouth-of-the-Amazon project: Senate president Davi Alcolumbre of Amapá, the state adjacent to the project that is expecting a financial bonanza from the offshore oilfields. The Senate approved the proposed law two days later, and Lula did not defend the position of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change against approval of the bill. Both houses of the National Congress and Brazil’s political structure as a whole are heavily stacked against action on climate and other environmental issues.

A pressing issue

The issue of oil and gas exploitation in the Amazon is pressing today because decisions are about to be made by the Brazilian government that would put in motion processes that will continue to impact the climate, Amazonian natural ecosystems and Amazonian peoples for decades to come (see here and here). The issue is also pressing because we are very near tipping points both for the global climate and for the Amazon Rainforest. These tipping points are intertwined: if the Amazon forest were to collapse, it would release more than enough carbon to push climate change past a point of no return, and if global warming escapes from human control, the Amazon forest would quickly succumb.

An oil spill at the mouth of the Amazon River would be catastrophic for biodiversity because it would be uncontrollable, at least for a period of many months or possibly years. This is shown by the experience of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, when oil spilled uncontrolled for five months before, with luck and many failed attempts, a concrete dome was lowered on a cable to cover the well. That event proved that no one in the world has the technology to plug a leak at the 1.5-kilometer (0.9-mile) water depth of the Gulf of Mexico site.

The 2.95-km (1.83-mi) depth at the site in the mouth of the Amazon that is up for licensing is essentially double this depth, and the site has ocean currents that are much stronger, more complex and more variable than at the Deepwater Horizon well. The currents flow in different directions at different depths in the water column, with a surface current flowing north and currents flowing south starting at 201 meters (659 feet) in depth. In other words, no one could stop a leak, which would affect eight countries.

On land, oil and gas extraction in the Amazon forest causes deforestation with the construction of access roads and subsequent land grabbing, land invasions and deforestation. The most critical case is the immense Solimões Sedimentary Area project planned in the TransPurus region in Brazil’s state of Amazonas (see here and here). The project, which would cover an area larger than California, would be accessed by the notorious AM-366 road, planned to connect the TransPurus area with the BR-319 (Manaus-Porto Velho) highway.

The opening of this last major area of intact Amazon forest to deforesters would be catastrophic for the climate as well as for biodiversity and local peoples. It is an enormous “elephant in the room” in the discussions of BR-319, the licensing for which completely ignores the impact of AM-366 and other state roads planned to connect to BR-319 (see here and here). The drilling rights in the first blocks have already been sold to the Russian oil company Rosneft, which claims to have the full support of the governor of the state of Amazonas, and, as one of the world’s largest companies, would have influence to obtain the state government’s priority for building AM-366 once the federal government’s planned reconstruction of BR-319 is complete.

Why has oil and gas exploitation in the Amazon not been stopped?

The tremendous influence of oil and gas companies over political decisions in Brazil is purely a matter of money. In Brazil, the discourse claiming that this extraction is needed to keep the country’s population from running out of fuel is simply mendacious. Brazil already exports half of the oil it extracts, and this percentage is expected to increase with the planned expansion of current oilfields and the opening of new ones. Brazil has much more oil in existing oilfields than it can use before the entire world must stop burning petroleum for fuel.

The opening of new oilfields, such as those proposed in the mouth of the Amazon, imply continued extraction of petroleum long after the world must stop using petroleum as fuel. The expectation is that it will take five years for these fields to begin commercial production, and then another five years to pay for the investment. Since no one will want to stop with zero profit, this implies continued extraction for many years.

This logic has even led the International Energy Agency (IEA), which is usually on the other side of environmental issues, to issue a report concluding that no new oil or gas fields should be opened anywhere in the world. The economics of opening new fields is different from that of continued exploitation of existing fields, which the IEA concludes must supply all fossil fuel use in the coming decades, with these fields continually reducing their rates of extraction to achieve net zero by 2050. Others would say that net zero must be reached significantly earlier to avoid a catastrophic escape of global warming from human control.

There is no other choice than a full transition away from fossil fuels, in addition to stopping deforestation and direct human degradation of Amazon forests, as by logging. The Global Stocktake issued by the Climate Convention at COP28 in 2023 calculated that the world must reduce its direct emissions (basically fossil fuels + deforestation + agriculture) by 43% by 2030 and 84% by 2050 to prevent the global average temperature rise from passing the 1.5° Celsius (2.7° Fahrenheit) limit above the pre-industrial average agreed under the Paris Agreement. The amounts by which human society must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions are not subject to negotiation; they are simply fixed unless someone does another scientific study that shows the numbers should be different. Because average global temperature since 2023 has been above the 1.5°C mark, such a study would probably indicate that emissions must be reduced by even greater percentages.

The 1.5°C limit is believed to represent a tipping point both in the global climate system and for the Amazon forest (see here, here and here), where exceeding it means that the annual probability of a catastrophic shift increases sharply, and, therefore, the cumulative probability of such a shift occurring at least once would pass the 50% mark in a much shorter span of years.

The most we can do to contain global warming is to not emit any more, not burning a single liter of fossil fuel or cutting a single tree. But if the emissions that are not “directly human induced” exceed what we emit deliberately, a point of no return is reached where the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increase uncontrollably from sources such as forest fires, soil warming and tundra melting, as well as from warming seawater reducing the ocean carbon sink.

Brazil would be devastated if global warming escapes from control: the Amazon forest would be lost (including its vital water cycling function that maintains human water consumption in cities like São Paulo) (see here and here); northeastern Brazil would become a desert (see here and here), expelling tens of millions of people; the country’s agribusiness and family agriculture would be decimated (see here, here, here and here); the dense population along the country’s Atlantic coast would be exposed to unprecedented storms and sea-level rise (see here and here); and the combined effect of heat and humidity on human survival would make fatalities during heat waves a major source of mortality in much of the country (see here, here, here, here, here and here).

Meanwhile, Indigenous and local peoples are not benefited by fossil fuel extraction, as shown by the examples of the existing oil and gas projects throughout the Amazon. In addition to direct impacts, the “natural resources curse” and the “Dutch disease” are real phenomena in the Amazon (see here, here and here), as is also the case in the rest of Brazil (see here, here and here) and throughout the developing world and in much of the developed one as well (see here, here, here and here). The result is greater economic inequality and increased poverty. A vast social science literature exists on why countries with the greatest mineral wealth, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bolivia, are also the ones with the greatest poverty, among other social ills such as corruption and authoritarianism. This pattern is not a coincidence, and it is already playing out in the Amazon.

The decision to halt the opening of new oil and gas fields in Amazonia must come from the top, that is, from President Lula. This is not a problem to be resolved through environmental regulations, via measures to minimize impacts such as oil spills and increasing inspections and enforcement of the regulations. The Brazilian government is currently focused only on the licensing procedures, as in the case of the proposed mouth-of-the-Amazon oilfields. Making sure that the letter of the law has been followed in the licensing process does not face the fundamental issue of whether these proposed projects should exist at all.

President Lula lives in a “disinformation space” with respect to this issue, where he hears only the false narratives of his minister of mines and energy and the head of Petrobras, the government-owned oil company. The president’s support for the project is clearly inconsistent with his rhetoric on climate change. In addition to cancelling all plans for opening new oil and gas fields, the president needs to recognize that the energy transition is a national imperative and should be at the same level as health and education in having guaranteed funding, rather than being something optional that depends on monetary windfalls such as the money from proposed expanded fossil fuel extraction.

Because of the disastrous impact in Brazil if global warming is allowed to escape from control, President Lula needs to assume a leadership role in global efforts to end fossil fuel use. This requires leading by example by immediately cancelling Brazil’s plans for new oil and gas fields.

For many, the term “mobility” might conjure images of electric cars or public transit. For Reggaria Goddard of Detroit-based Crowned Venture Capital, the mobility opportunity is more expansive – encompassing deep tech, critical infrastructure and a holistic approach to urban development.

Goddard, a Detroit native, defines mobility as the “the way we move people, goods, and services over land, sea and water.”

In the latest Plugged In episode, host Sherrell Dorsey sits down with Goddard, formerly of GM Ventures, to unpack her journey from the legacy auto industry to the forefront of mobility investment, exploring the opportunities and challenges within this rapidly changing sector.

Mobility beyond the basics

“When I talk about the future of transportation and mobility, I think a lot of us get EVs as kind of the first intersection of that, and so I think a lot of minds get stuck there, but it’s so much broader than that,” Goddard explains.

She highlights the link between EVs and infrastructure, which extends beyond charging stations to the underlying grid, fiber optics, cloud storage, and more. Mobility, she notes, also falls squarely within deep tech, with advanced air mobility, eVTOLs, drones, and autonomous vehicles relying on sophisticated AI and other cutting-edge technologies.

“There are lots of overlap from other industries,” Goddard says. “So tech, deep tech, communication, insurance tech, all these things are wrapped up into mobility, and some are probably investing already in these spaces and not necessarily linking it to mobility, but it’s very intricate that all these things work together.”

Shifting landscapes

Despite recent rollbacks in federal funding and energy and transit projects originally slated with Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) dollars, Goddard is steadfast in her belief in the growth of the mobility sector.

She points to the presence of EVs on dealership lots and the increasing conversion of private fleets to electric vehicles, such as buses in Martha’s Vineyard and various city vehicles. These shifts are often driven by private capital and controlled environments, proving that progress can continue even without significant federal backing.

Goddard also emphasizes the role of technological advancements, such as longer-range batteries and inductive charging in roads, as well as the private sector’s increasing investment in charging infrastructure within new buildings and corporate lots. She also highlights the broader energy infrastructure needs that underpin not just EVs, but also the burgeoning fields of AI, cryptocurrency mining, and humanoid robots.

“While we’re not calling it EV infrastructure – it’s not charging stations – That energy infrastructure is still being created,” she notes, pointing to large-scale renewable farms funded by companies like Meta.

Cities as laboratories

Goddard offers a glimpse into cities that are actively pushing the boundaries of mobility and smart city initiatives, praising cities like Detroit for their adoption of electric vehicles. In Miami, initiatives like electric boat companies for passenger transport and the development of a “digital twin” project to test various technologies and energy capacities demonstrate a forward-thinking approach.

These examples underscore a crucial understanding among city leaders: “they can’t stay where they are because they will be left behind.” Cities are actively seeking advanced technologies and open policies to attract and retain talent, reduce congestion, lower emissions, and minimize accidents.

Scalable solutions

When evaluating potential investments, Goddard’s core thesis revolves around two key principles: problem-solving and scalability. “I’m really big on solving problems, so filling in those gaps, like the things that maybe no one’s thinking about, or sometimes it’s a simple solution,” she explains. She cites an example of a company converting garbage into energy, a seemingly small solution with immense potential for cities struggling with waste management and infrastructure.

Beyond addressing immediate needs, Goddard looks for ideas with the capacity for broad expansion. “Maybe it starts for the urban community, but it has a bigger footprint in the long run for all around the world,” she says. Her focus is always on understanding the utility of a solution today and its potential utility in the future.

Shifting sentiments

Goddard observes a growing awareness within the investor and private wealth communities regarding the importance of investing in mobility and its interconnected sectors. She attributes this shift to the significant overlap between mobility and other high-impact areas like deep tech, AI, energy infrastructure, and sustainability.

“When you couple that with electric vehicles, or you couple that with solar panels, or renewable energy, that’s a two fold” Goddard explains. Investors are increasingly seeing the “two for the price of one” benefit: impacting climate change while simultaneously investing in advanced technologies with far-reaching implications across multiple industries.",http://impactalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/66e8ede7a22760d01e216b6b_Goddard.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 08:28:20.335919

The Well Done Foundation, a Montana-based national nonprofit, is spearheading the project in Erie County in collaboration with local and state entities, as well as Pittsburgh students.

A block north of busy West 26th Street, 15 feet from a house and right next to a stormwater pond sits Millcreek Township Orphan Well No. 1, which contains potentially dangerous gases that could cause cancer.

But thanks to a collaboration involving a Montana nonprofit, Millcreek Township officials, Pittsburgh students, a Texas fund, an Indiana crew and Pennsylvania money, work began the first week of June to plug the abandoned natural gas well at 2624 W. 25th St.

""This means a lot to our community as we take pride in keeping our residents healthy and also being responsible to the environment,"" Millcreek Supervisor Kim Clear said June 5 during a news conference at the site.

Joining Clear at the well were Millcreek Supervisor Jim Bock and Curtis Shuck, chairman of the Well Done Foundation.

The Montana-based foundation is a national nonprofit dedicated to plugging orphaned wells, reducing methane emissions and combating climate change. Well Done was working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, which had the Millcreek well on a watch list, Shuck said.

What are orphan wells?

Orphaned wells are abandoned oil and gas wells that are no longer actively managed by an owner, according to the Well Done Foundation, which is coordinating the Millcreek project. These wells pose a significant environmental hazard, leaking methane and carbon dioxide equivalent, which contribute to climate change and global warming, according to Well Done.

Erie County's more than 100 orphan wells placed it ninth on a top 10 list, according to an Environmental Defense Fund fact sheet on orphan wells in Pennsylvania. McKean County led the state list with more than 2,300 orphan wells.

Shuck said there are few records on many of these abandoned wells, which number into the millions across the United States. The well along West 25th Street is believed to date to a 1900s farmstead but little else is known about it. Clear said Millcreek Township owns the land on which the well is located.

Millcreek well No. 1

The Millcreek well No. 1 will be the 58th that the Well Done Foundation has plugged nationally, its seventh in Pennsylvania, fifth in Erie County and first in Millcreek, Shuck said. A second well in the township, off West Eighth Street at the old Manor Motel site, is on the foundation's to-do list, he said.

The No. 1 well was leaking methane when Well Done first arrived on the scene in 2023, according to Shuck and the foundation's website. He said the foundation began monitoring the well's emissions, which were equal to more than 1,000 automobiles.

""This well, in addition to methane, also contains other potentially dangerous gases like benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene and those are known cancer-causing agents,"" he said at the site.

In the event of a catastrophic failure at the well, those chemicals could enter the nearby stormwater system and eventually make their way into Lake Erie, Shuck said.

A crew from Penn Mechanical Group in Indiana, Pennsylvania, was expected to start plugging the well starting June 5. The work was expected to take about a week.

Project contributors

A group of students at Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh raised $5,000 toward the project through their Dice Well Done Club. The club raised the money through fundraisers, including online appeals and movie days in the public school’s auditorium.

“Everyone my age wants to fight climate change but doesn’t know how to do it. I started the Dice Well Done Club because it was a clear opportunity to help a community that’s not too far away,"" sophomore Lucy Hurowitz, club founder and president, said in a news release.

She established the club with fellow Allderdice sophomores Seena Teshome, Jordan Block and Olivia Boyle. Clear thanked the students, who weren't able to be at the site. The money they raised will be matched by the Well Done Foundation and the Texas-based Reimer Family Climate Crisis Fund.

Shuck said his foundation suggested the Pittsburgh students raise money for the Millcreek well because it was ""closer on the execution list"" and not due to any particular connection between the school and the township.

He said there aren't any Erie-area students or groups involved with Well Done Foundation projects yet, but that could change after this one.

In addition to money from the student club, the foundation and the Reimer fund, the project received additional support from Well Done and a $70,000 grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, Shuck said.

He said this Millcreek project should cost about $100,000 to complete.","https://www.goerie.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/05/NETN/84052239007-p-1-well-060525.jpg?crop=1715,965,x0,y225&width=1715&height=965&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-06 08:36:01.074107

The Detroit News

(TNS)

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump hit back at Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk over his criticism of Republicans’ massive budget proposal, suggesting the tech mogul is primarily upset over provisions that slash government support for electric vehicles.

“Elon is upset because we took the EV mandate … which was a lot of money for electric vehicles,” Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office. “They’re having a hard time, the electric vehicles. And they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. And, you know, Elon knew this from the beginning.”

Musk has been critical of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, calling it a “disgusting abomination” for how much it will increase the national deficit and put America “in the fast lane to debt slavery.”

The sweeping tax, spending and policy bill would—among many other changes—gut federal support for Biden-era policies that supported a transition to electric vehicles. The bill would eliminate or scale back several tax credits for the purchase and production of EVs, including a popular $7,500 consumer credit. It also would eliminate tailpipe emissions rules that push automakers to more aggressively electrify their offerings over the next decade.

Trump, speaking to reporters during a sit-down with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, gave an extended, minutes-long response to a question about Musk.

“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” the president said.

Musk, until last week, helped direct the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, a controversial cost-cutting effort meant to rapidly downsize the federal government. Trump hosted Musk in the White House for a sendoff last Friday, thanking the billionaire for his work in the early days of the administration.

“I’ll be honest, I think he misses the place. I think he got out there and all of a sudden he wasn’t in this beautiful Oval Office,” Trump said Thursday. He suggested Musk’s hostility toward the bill was a sign of “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”

Trump added: “I’m very disappointed. Because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here … . He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate.”

Tesla, Musk’s all-electric car and truck company, sold about 634,000 vehicles in the United States last year. That represented nearly half of all EV sales nationally. Detroit-based General Motors Co. was a distant second, selling about 114,000 EVs.

Musk, via his social media platform X, responded to Trump’s comment: “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!”

The bill passed in the House of Representatives but still needs approval in the Senate.

Related article: SALT Write-Off, Harvard Tax, Medicaid Cuts: What’s in Trump’s Bill

“Whatever,” Musk added in another post. “Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.”

Tesla, in addition to selling EVs, also has a solar energy generation and storage segment to its business that generated more than $10 billion last year.

Share prices for the company plunged after Trump’s comments, falling about 8.5% within an hour.

Trump and other Republicans had signaled their intentions to end renewable energy and electric vehicle tax credits throughout the 2024 election cycle and in the early months of Trump’s second term. Musk himself even invited an end to government subsidies for EVs.

“Take away the subsidies,” he wrote in July 2024. “It will only help Tesla. Also, remove subsidies from all industries!”

Musk and Trump appeared to develop a friendship over the past year as the tech mogul worked vigorously to get Trump elected and later joined his administration for the DOGE effort. Musk even referred to himself as Trump’s “first buddy.”

Even as he had furiously criticized the GOP bill on X over the past week, Musk did not criticize Trump directly. But that changed Thursday after the Oval Office comments, as the duo’s relationship quickly and publicly soured.

“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Musk wrote. “Such ingratitude.”

The 1,121 megawatt nuclear plant will help support Meta’s clean energy goals.

Starting in June of 2027, the agreement supports the relicensing and continued operations of the Clinton facility for another two decades after the state’s ratepayer funded zero emission credit (ZEC) program expires.

The Clinton Clean Energy Center was slated for closure in 2017 after years of financial losses, but its retirement was prevented by enactment of the Future Energy Jobs Act, which established a Zero Emission Credit program that provides financial support to the plant through mid-2027. Constellation’s agreement with Meta essentially replaces the ZEC program and ensures long-term operations of the plant without ratepayer support. The PPA will enable the Clinton Clean Energy Center to continue to flow power onto the local grid, providing grid reliability and low-cost power to the region for decades to come.

Under the deal, Clinton will also add 30 megawatts of increased output from nuclear uprates. With the guarantee that Clinton will continue to run for another two decades, Constellation is evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor (SMR) at the plant site.

“Last year, Constellation’s announced plan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center became national news, but despite all of the interest and overwhelming support, a key question was missed: why did we let such a valuable plant close in the first place? We all know that the closure cost our community jobs, tax revenue, more pollution and higher prices,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO, Constellation.

“[Meta] figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy. Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Clinton_Beauty.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 10:09:40.227571

The budget request includes $20.8 million for “deregulation activities” as the agency works toward cutting Biden-era fuel economy standards.","Washington ― President Donald Trump's budget request for next year would support the Flint Lead Exposure Registry and Great Lakes cleanup projects, but slash spending for Army Corps construction and harbor dredging and eliminate the heating assistance program for low-income households.

Trump's 2026 proposal serves as a starting point for negotiations with lawmakers and will likely change as the Republican-controlled Congress reviews it. A detailed spending plan for the Department of Defense hasn't yet been revealed.

But in a positive sign for the Flint registry, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services proposed spending another $5 million in 2026 for the project, which tracks residents who were exposed to lead during the Flint water crisis 10 years ago and links them up with resources, including social and health care services.

The registry funding for 2026 is being requested even though the project's grant for 2025 has been held up at the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention after the elimination of the agency's lead poisoning prevention team back in April amid widespread staff cuts at HHS.

The CDC's lead program is also funded in Trump's budget proposal at $51 million; however, the 26-person team of lead prevention experts remains on leave as part of staff cuts at HHS this spring.

""It's great to see that (the registry) is back in the proposed HHS budget for 2026,"" said Dr. Mona Hanna of the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, the pediatrician who helped expose the Flint water crisis and has led the registry effort.

""It's even more exciting to see the funding continued for the national childhood lead poisoning prevention program, despite the loss of the entire department at the CDC.""

Paul Allwood, who led the CDC's Lead Poisoning Prevention and Surveillance Branch until his layoff in April, also was pleased to see the funding for his program in the budget proposal, though he was wary.

""Without the experts who built the program, I don’t see what will be achieved,"" Allwood told The Detroit News on Thursday. ""We are still waiting to hear that we are reinstated. We are anxious to get on with the work of protecting kids from lead poisoning.""

Hanna said she remains hopeful that the fiscal 2025 funding for the registry will be released. MSU, which sponsors the project, has already notified 20-plus staffers that they could be laid off if the grant money doesn't come through by July 31.

HHS said Thursday the Flint registry grant continuation award date is set for Aug. 1.

""We can't count on it this year because of everything that's happening. Because we have no program officers. We have no program staff. There is no more lead department to oversee this work,"" Hanna said.

""The hardest part is the uncertainty, but the good work will continue.""

The Democratic congresswoman who represents Flint applauded the proposed funding for the registry.

""I’m glad to see the president include its funding in the newest version of his budget, and I look forward to working with him and our bipartisan coalition of Congress members to secure its funding for 2026,"" said Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Bay City.

Less federal support for dredging

Funding requested for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in 2026 was flat at $368 million, which was the same level as 2025. Bipartisan members of Michigan's delegation have sought to renew the public-private program for another five years through 2031 and boost funding levels to $500 million in 2026.

Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Holland, told The News in January that protecting the funding for the program would be a top priority in the new Congress, noting that previous administrations, including Obama's and Trump's, tried to cut its funding.

Trump's budget proposal would cut the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' construction budget 16% from $1.85 billion enacted in 2025 to $1.56 billion in 2026. This follows Congress earlier this year passing a spending bill that saw the Corps' construction budget for 2025 drop over 40%.

The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, which pays for dredging operations at major harbors and rivers around the Great Lakes, would take a hit of about $1 billion or a 39% reduction to $1.7 billion, according to the budget request.

Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, warned at a hearing last month that the proposed cuts to the Army Corps budget and its workforce endanger lives and public safety and undermine economic growth.

""In the Great Lakes region alone, these investments ensure that goods — from American steel to Ohio soybeans — can reach domestic and global markets,"" Kaptur said. ""And cuts to this work would cause costly delays, limit our competitiveness and harm local economies.""

About $28 million in the Army Corps construction plan would be allocated for a key project in Illinois to try to prevent invasive carp from infiltrating Lake Michigan.

Trump in a presidential memorandum last month explicitly expressed support for the $1.15 billion project at the Brandon Road Lock & Dam in Joliet, Illinois, that would install several methods to serve as a barrier to the carp. The State of Illinois last month transferred a tract of land that was needed to start construction.

The Army Corps' Civil Works plan would also allocate $176.6 million toward the $3 billion, 10-year mega project in Sault Ste. Marie to build a second shipping lock capable of handling the largest Great Lakes freighters. All of the country's domestic iron ore passes through the Soo Locks.

The recommendation in the president’s budget for $176.6 million will maintain ""efficient"" funding for the lock project into next year and will allow for the remaining work on the upper approach walls to be awarded, in addition to the continuation of the third phase of construction, said Carrie Fox with the Army Corps' Detroit District that oversees the Soo project.

""While there will continue to be capabilities in future years for the New Soo Lock, we currently remain on track for a Summer 2030 completion,"" Fox said.

Heating assistance program faces cut

The budget proposal would eliminate a program for financing non-federal dam safety projects and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which sent more than $165 million to Michigan in 2024.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he understands the ""critical, historical importance"" of the program, which helps low-income families and seniors afford heating costs.

""President Trump's rationale and OMB's rationale is that President Trump's energy policies are going to lower the cost of energy so that everybody will get lower cost heating oil, and, in that case, this program would simply be another subsidy to the fossil fuel industry,"" Kennedy said at a Senate hearing last month.

The Department of Education is proposing to eliminate the group of federal programs known as TRIO, which aim to support low-income and first-generation students succeed in college.

When Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins asked why TRIO isn't worth the investment at a hearing this week, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said her department lacks the ability to audit TRIO to ensure the federal funding is being used appropriately, NPR reported.

Rural air service, EV chargers on chopping block

Trump's request also aims to cut over $300 million from the Essential Air Service program, which guarantees airport service to nine small communities in Michigan.

The GOP president's budget blueprint also eliminates funding for the refugee resettlement program, which had helped fuel population growth in Michigan in recent years, and would end funding for Community Action Agencies through the Community Block Grant Program.

The budget of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, would see a 27% cut under the proposal.

Budget requests from the Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy reemphasized the Trump administration’s goals of rolling back tailpipe emissions rules and ending federal support for a transition to electric vehicles.

The Energy Department proposal would rescind about $2.3 billion in credit subsidy funds for an advanced vehicle manufacturing initiative. Those funds have helped the agency’s Loan Programs Office issue major financial support for projects related to EVs and batteries.

LPO credit subsidies ― which enable far greater federal loans ― helped support EV battery projects for each of the Detroit Three automakers during the Biden administration. The federal loan commitments across three high-profile projects totaled more than $19 billion.

The Transportation Department proposal said it would cancel about $5.7 billion in unspent money for two EV charging programs funded via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed in 2021 under former President Joe Biden.

The budget request includes $20.8 million for “deregulation activities” as the agency works toward cutting Biden-era fuel economy standards.

The Environmental Protection Agency did not assign a dollar value in its budget brief for pursuing Trump administration goals related to the auto industry.

The agency did, however, affirm its intention to make sure “Americans have the right to decide what vehicle is best for them: electric or gas-powered” and to “protect and bring back American auto jobs.”

""That means, just to keep up, we will need more state funding.
“We must continue to support recovery in western North Carolina.
It also supports what it calls a State Infrastructure Bank that would offer low-interest loans to boost road funding.
North Carolina is projected to hit a deficit as soon as next year unless state lawmakers freeze tax rates in place.","Responding to the widespread devastation from Hurricane Helene will cost so much that it’ll set other road and bridge construction work back by years, state business leaders told reporters Thursday, as North Carolina braces for the upcoming 2025 hurricane season and whatever additional damage that might bring.

Meanwhile, Gov. Josh Stein raised alarms of his own during a separate briefing Thursday, saying President Donald Trump's cuts to federal spending will hurt efforts to predict and respond to natural disasters in the future. That will only end up leading to more damage and an even larger burden on North Carolina taxpayers to fix the damage, he said.

""Cuts to NOAA and FEMA are a man-made disaster,"" Stein said. ""We need these critical agencies to help us anticipate and respond to natural disasters. A lack of forecasting and a lack of funding both harm public safety.""

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] is in charge of forecasting storms. Trump has forced out more than 1,000 employees there since taking office in January. Trump has also advocated for eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], which handles most disaster response efforts. And Trump cut another 600 jobs at the National Weather Service, which last week failed to send alerts in North Carolina despite severe storms sweeping the state.

""We simply have to prepare for the very real possibility that these entities will be of diminished capacity,"" Stein said. ""That means, just to keep up, we will need more state funding. Potentially hundreds of millions of dollars more.""

Business interests, however, are already worried about how much money the state has diverted to emergency responses in the wake of Hurricane Helene last year — particularly for transportation and infrastructure funding — without taking steps to replace the funds that had been set aside for more run-of-the-mill road improvements.

“We have to have the resources to do both things,” Jake Cashion, the top lobbyist for the NC Chamber of Commerce, told reporters Thursday. “We must continue to support recovery in western North Carolina. And we must continue to make investments in the transportation network statewide.”

Focus on roads

As the state’s main business lobbying group, the Chamber is now working to highlight the domino-like effect that natural disasters can have on funding for roads and bridges, since having good roads affects so much of the state’s economy from tourism to trucking.

The Chamber wants to see more public-private partnership options — like toll roads — approved to help fund road construction. It also supports what it calls a State Infrastructure Bank that would offer low-interest loans to boost road funding.

Fixing storm-damaged roads takes away funding that would otherwise be spent on normally scheduled road widening or repairs. That causes those projects to be delayed, which causes costs to rise, which in turn might lead to even longer delays or fewer road projects being completed.

Cashion and others including a state Department of Transportation representative spoke with reporters Thursday about a new report from TRIP, a D.C.-based transportation research group, that estimated the state government will need to spend nearly $1 billion just on fixing roads and bridges damaged by Helene.

That’s equivalent to 3 years’ worth of spending on bridges statewide, or 18 months worth of road resurfacing work statewide — meaning that other non-emergency efforts are now likely going to need to be pushed back by months or years.

“The North Carolina Department of Transportation has really done a heroic job of addressing this devastating damage from Hurricane Helene,” said Rocky Moretti, TRIP’s research director. “But moving forward, they also have significant transportation challenges across the state.”

At the same time, climate change is making storms more severe, along with inflation causing recovery work to cost more. Hurricane Matthew in 2016 set a North Carolina record by doing $5 billion in damage. Two years later Hurricane Florence shattered that record. And in 2024 Helene set a new record, with $60 billion in estimated damage.

More hurricanes coming

Asked by WRAL about what the 2025 hurricane season might add to those pressures, Alyson Tamer, one of NCDOT’s top leaders for Helene recovery work, said Thursday that Helene drained much of the agency’s funding set aside for emergencies.

But DOT has flexibility, she noted, to take money from other road projects to pay for disaster response — if that’s the only option.

“We are working towards preparedness now,” she said. “We've learned a lot of lessons from Helene on steps that we can take, hopefully, to build back well.”

DOT's flexibility to delay or defund previously scheduled projects to pay for disaster response, however, frustrates some business leaders, even in the areas hit hardest by Helene.

“It also is not lost on me that we have transportation projects that are completely apart from anything related to hurricane relief that we want to see funded — as do people throughout the state,” Kit Cramer, president of the Asheville-area Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “So, we have an ongoing concern about the funding level for our transportation infrastructure.”

Wake County affected

Helene is far from the first storm to derail other road projects and lead to unintended consequences years later.

WRAL reported this past weekend that state lawmakers are looking to kill a proposed toll road on Capital Boulevard in Raleigh — even though local leaders say that’s their only option since the cost of widening Capital Boulevard has ballooned from a $93 million plan in 2012 to a $1.3 billion plan in 2025.

A large part of the reason that much cheaper 2012 plan never happened was because it was supposed to get started in 2018. But that year Hurricane Florence hit the state, causing transportation officials to put the Capital Boulevard project on hold to divert the money to repairing storm-damaged roads out east instead.

Since then, the rising costs of labor, construction materials and land have all contributed to the project’s cost exploding — now leaving local and state politicians in a stand-off over how to proceed.

Adam Wright, a Wake Forest Town Commissioner, told WRAL the toll road would never have come up as an option if the stat legislature had appropriated enough money for roads in the first place, to keep transportation officials from having to shuffle funds around and delay the project.

“We don’t want tolling,” he said. “But if you’re going to prevent us from tolling, can you at least give us the money? That’s the long and short of it. None of us want tolling. But NCDOT has been massively under-funded by the legislature for years.”

Fight over taxes

Concerns over transportation funding have been highlighted further this year as the Republican-led state legislature debates pressing ahead with more cuts to the state’s income tax rate, the main source of revenue for state services in general.

North Carolina is projected to hit a deficit as soon as next year unless state lawmakers freeze tax rates in place. Some Republican leaders in the state legislature now want to pump the brakes on tax cuts. But others say they don't believe their own budget analysts and are pushing to pass even more aggressive tax cuts than what's already planned.

That intra-GOP fight on tax policy is currently holding up passage of the new state budget, as well as a new round of funding for Hurricane Helene relief that might end up being tied to the budget.

The current state budget year ends on June 30, but lawmakers appear months away from reaching a final deal on a new budget.",https://images.wral.com/asset/news/local/2025/03/27/21931872/3271900-stein_six_months_since_helene-DMID1-66fravtut-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:33:56.712190

“But let me be clear: this is a short-term solution for the people of our state being battered by rising energy costs.

We must continue to be aggressive in fighting for reforms to the PJM system that caused this crisis in energy costs.","Announcement Includes over $430 Million in Direct Relief to Every Household

TRENTON – Governor Phil Murphy, Senate President Nick Scutari, and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin today announced over $430 million in direct relief to lower the cost of energy bills. This comes in anticipation of the utility rate increase that took effect on June 1, 2025, as New Jersey ratepayers face record high wholesale electric prices which will hit customers with bills 20% higher than they were one year ago.

All 3.9 million ratepayers in New Jersey will receive at least $100 in direct relief, while eligible low-to-moderate income (LMI) New Jerseyans will see at least $150 more deducted from their energy bills.

These credits are funded by the Clean Energy Fund, the Board of Public Utilities’ allocation of Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) proceeds, and the Solar Alternative Compliance Payment account.

“Today, we are coming together to provide critical economic relief to the people of New Jersey by directly lowering the cost of their monthly energy bills,” said Governor Murphy. “But let me be clear: this is a short-term solution for the people of our state being battered by rising energy costs. Moving forward, we are going to work alongside BPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy and our legislative partners to hold PJM accountable for the untenable and unconscionable costs they have forced on our state’s residents. Together, we are going to explore every possible avenue for lowering the cost of energy in the long term to make our state more affordable for more families.”

“The upcoming spike in utility bills imposed on New Jersey residents is unaffordable and unfair,” said Senate President Nick Scutari. “PJM conducted a deeply flawed energy auction, and its continued incompetence is costing the State. These rate-relief credits will bring more immediate relief to consumers, putting money into their pockets to help offset utility costs. We can’t allow New Jerseyans to be left to themselves to shoulder the burden of PJM’s mismanagement.”

“As we continue our efforts in the Legislature to ease the burden of utility rate hikes for New Jerseyans, I am encouraged to see Governor Murphy announce these steps to deliver meaningful and immediate relief,” said Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin. “The return of the REAP program will provide our most vulnerable residents with sustained monthly support, and through the proposed universal credit, every ratepayer, regardless of income, would see relief. I thank my legislative colleagues for demanding relief for our residential ratepayers and commend the Governor and BPU for using the tools at our disposal to meet this moment with purposeful action. No one should have to choose between cooling their homes in the summer and paying for groceries or medication, and that’s why we will continue our legislative focus on keeping energy costs affordable for the long-term. We’ve passed bills that will strengthen oversight, improve accountability and protect New Jersey residents from unfair energy prices while also moving forward with an all-of-the above approach toward increased energy production in the state. Generating our own energy will bring down costs for residents and businesses alike, as well as lead to the creation of good-paying jobs. I expect our state’s electric utilities to be partners in helping us meet these challenges.”

“This will provide direct relief to ratepayers to help offset the costly burden of a sudden spike in utility bills imposed on them by a mismanaged PJM power generation auction,” said Senator John Burzichelli. “This assistance will be a welcomed relief for all ratepayers, but it will be especially helpful for working families and low-income residents who are already struggling to make ends meet. This, however, is not a permanent solution. We must continue to be aggressive in fighting for reforms to the PJM system that caused this crisis in energy costs. We need an energy market that operates effectively, serves the needs of ratepayers, and makes affordability the priority.”

“Families across New Jersey are already feeling squeezed by the rising cost of living, and the energy rate hikes will only make the issue of affordability worse,” said Senator John McKeon. “We cannot allow our residents to shoulder this burden alone. Governor Murphy’s plan to provide millions in direct relief to ratepayers will ensure that no one has to choose between putting food on the table and keeping the lights or air conditioning on. I look forward to working with the Board of Public Utilities to get these credits into the hands of the public as soon as possible.”

“We know that energy bills can spike in the summer, and families need relief now,” said Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin. “The Assembly remains focused on keeping New Jersey affordable. This is the kind of targeted relief that helps while we continue building long-term, sustainable solutions. I appreciate Governor Murphy for putting forward this plan, and I look forward to working together to drive down utility costs.”

“As someone who represents communities in South Jersey, I’ve seen firsthand how devastating unpredictable energy costs can be for working families, seniors, and small businesses,” said Assemblyman Dan Hutchison. “While we continue working toward long-term solutions, I am proud to support this effort to deliver immediate, direct relief through programs like REAP and the proposed Universal Credit.”

“Today’s announcement demonstrates what good governance is all about – delivering real results to those who call New Jersey home, and I'm proud of the work the NJBPU has done to make this historic rate relief announcement a reality,” said NJBPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy. “Under Governor Murphy’s leadership, with support from Senate President Scutari and Speaker Coughlin, we will continue to make affordability a priority for New Jersey utility customers.”

As demand for electricity is on the rise, regional grid operator PJM Interconnection has failed to plan for increased energy capacity and has failed to bring new, renewable energy projects online.

In recent months, New Jersey has led the way in advocating for a solution to the cost crisis faced by multiple states that are members of the PJM region. In April, Governor Murphy called on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to investigate whether market manipulation led to higher capacity auction prices.

The Governor also urged PJM to finally provide long-overdue approvals for new, clean sources of energy, such as solar power, that would help expand New Jersey’s supply of energy. This year New Jersey exceeded 5 gigawatts of installed solar capacity for the first time, enough energy to power 750,000 homes. PJM, however, has delayed the process for allowing new sources of clean, reliable energy to be added to the State’s grid.",https://nj.gov/governor/library/facebook_card.png,N,,2025-06-06 08:25:28.712234

NEW BRAUNFELS Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it.

The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road.

“It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees, outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.”

The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this buildout promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come.

The data center and power plant planned across from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but not likely its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.”

Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability.

“There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.”

IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers — giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said.

There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totalling 411,600 megawatts of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, Senate Bill 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies.

Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply.

Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today.

Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time offering to quickly provide additional power generation.

Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try and slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand.

This buildout promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records.

Texas, with 9% of the U.S. population, accounted for about 15% of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26% of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state.

GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers.

For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. U.S. gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices have tumbled since 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand.

“The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gas outlook report by East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.”

It forecast up to a 20% increase in U.S. gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growing gas export sector on the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in coming years with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers.

Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times the near-term warming effect of carbon dioxide, leading some studies to conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate.

It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the yearslong wait times for turbines has quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook.

“If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said.

The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March.

About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference.

“Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.”

Gas plants for data centers

Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects, applied for permits in January to build 360 megawatts of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 megawatts of gas power generation capacity.

Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 megawatt cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940.

“Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughes told the website Data Center Dynamics at the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.”

CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 megawatt gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tract announced a 1,500-acre, 2,000 megawatt data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart.

Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 megawatt South Texas data center project announced in April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 megawatt megaproject outside Laredo announced in March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texas hopes to draw 1,400 megawatts from the grid.

All together, Texas’ grid operator predicts statewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according to analysis by S&P Global.

“There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.”

However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals.

Restrictions on renewable energy

Looking forward to a buildout of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer.

Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power.

“It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.”

While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry.

One failed bill, Senate Bill 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, House Bill 3356 and Senate Bill 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating.

When the Legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget added another $5 billion to double the fund.

Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, SB 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source — coal, gas or nuclear — needs.

“It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass.

Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state.

Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue.

More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40% of their income.

He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the Legislature is headed with renewables.

“I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us — use them and harness them.”

A report published in April finds that targeted limitations on solar and wind development in Texas could increase electricity costs for consumers and businesses. The report, done by Aurora Energy Research for the Texas Association of Business, said restricting the further deployment of renewables would drive power prices up 14% by 2035.

“Texas is at a crossroads in its energy future,” said Olivier Beaufils, a top executive at Aurora Energy Research. “We need policies that support an all-of-the-above approach to meet the expected surge in power demand.”

Likewise, the commercial intelligence firm Wood Mackenzie expects the power demand from data centers to drive up prices of gas and wholesale consumer electricity.

Pollution from gas plants

Even when new power plants aren’t built on the site of data centers, they might still be developed because of demand from the server farms.

For example, in 2023, developer Marathon Digital started up a Bitcoin mine in the small town of Granbury on the site of the 1,100 megawatt Wolf Hollow II gas power plant. It held contracts to purchase 300 megawatts from the plant.

One year later, the power plant operator sought permits to install eight additional “peaker” gas turbines able to produce up to 352 megawatts of electricity. These small units, designed to turn on intermittently during hours of peak demand, release more pollution than typical gas turbines.

Those additional units would be approved to release 796,000 tons per year of greenhouse gases, 251 tons per year of nitrogen oxides and 56 tons per year of soot, according to permitting documents. That application is currently facing challenges from neighboring residents in state administrative courts.

About 150 miles away, neighbors are challenging another gas plant permit application in the tiny town of Blue. At 1,200 megawatts, the $1.2 billion plant proposed by Sandow Lakes Energy Co. would be among the largest in the state and would almost entirely serve private customers, likely including the large data centers that operate about 20 miles away.

This plan bothers Hugh Brown, who moved out to these green, rolling hills of rural Lee County in 1975, searching for solitude. Now he lives on 153 wooded acres that he’s turned into a sanctuary for wildlife.

“What I’ve had here is a quiet, thoughtful life,” said Brown, skinny with a long grey beard. “I like not hearing what anyone else is doing.”

He worries about the constant roar of giant cooling fans, the bright lights overnight and the air pollution. According to permitting documents, the power plant would be authorized to emit 462 tons per year of ammonia gas, 254 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, 153 tons per year of particulate matter, or soot, and almost 18 tons per year of “hazardous air pollutants,” a collection of chemicals that are known to cause cancer or other serious health impacts.

It would also be authorized to emit 3.9 million tons of greenhouse gases per year, about as much as 72,000 standard passenger vehicles.

“It would be horrendous,” Brown said. “There will be a constant roaring of gigantic fans.”

In a statement, Sandow Lakes Energy denied that the power plant will be loud. “The sound level at the nearest property line will be similar to a quiet library,” the statement said.

Sandow Lakes Energy said the plant will support the local tax base, provide hundreds of temporary construction jobs and dozens of permanent jobs. Sandow also provided several letters signed by area residents who support the plant.

“We recognize the critical need for reliable, efficient and environmentally responsible energy production to support our region’s growth and economic development,” wrote Nathan Bland, president of the municipal development district in Rockdale, about 20 miles from the project site.

Sandow says the plant will be connected to Texas’ public grid, and many supporting letters for the project cited a need for grid reliability. But according to permitting documents, the 1,200 megawatt plant will supply only 80 megawatts to the grid and only temporarily, with the rest going to private customers.

“Electricity will continue to be sold to the public until all of the private customers have completed projects slated to accept the power being generated,” said a permit review by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Sandow has declined to name those customers. However, the plant is part of Sandow’s massive, master-planned mixed-use development in rural Lee and Milam counties, where several energy-hungry tenants are already operating, including Riot Platforms, the largest cryptocurrency mine on the continent. The seven-building complex in Rockdale is built to use up to 700 megawatts, and in April it announced the acquisition of a neighboring, 125 megawatt cryptocurrency mine, previously operated by Rhodium. Another mine by Bitmain, also one of the world’s largest Bitcoin companies, has 560 megawatts of operating capacity with plans to add 180 more in 2026.

In April, residents of Blue gathered at the volunteer fire department building for a public meeting with Texas regulators and Sandow to discuss questions and concerns over the project. Brown, owner of the wildlife sanctuary, spoke into a microphone and noted that the power plant was placed at the far edge of Sandow’s 33,000-acre development, 20 miles from the industrial complex in Rockdale but near many homes in Blue.

“You don’t want to put it up into the middle of your property where you could deal with the negative consequences,” Brown said, speaking to the developers. “So it looks to me like you are wanting to make money, in the process of which you want to strew grief in your path and make us bear the environmental costs of your profit.”

Boviet Solar Technology Co. once again is recognized as a Tier 1 PV module manufacturer by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) for Q2 2025. Boviet first achieved this rankling in 2017.

“This recognition goes beyond an accolade; it represents the dedication and innovation our teams bring to the industry every day,” says Sienna Cen, President of Boviet Solar USA, added. “As we address the growing needs of utility-scale and large commercial and industrial applications, our unwavering focus remains on quality, innovation, and fostering strong collaborations with our valued partners.”

BloombergNEF Tier 1 status

BloombergNEF, a leading authority on research and analysis in the transition to a low-carbon economy, employs a stringent tiering system to assess the bankability of PV module manufacturers. BNEF’s Tier 1 bankability rating is benchmark that investors, developers, EPCs, and asset owners use as shorthand for a measure of a manufacturer’s long-term stability and product dependability.

Achieving Tier 1 status requires manufacturers to supply their own-brand, self-manufactured products to at least six separate solar projects, each backed by non-recourse financing from six different banks within the last two years. These projects, with capacities of 5.0 MW or more, must be listed in the BNEF database with publicly accessible details about their location, size, developer, financial backers, and module supplier.

Boviet Solar technology

Boviet Solar is solar energy technology company specializing in monocrystalline PV cells and Gamma Series Monofacial and Vega Series Bifacial PV modules. Engineered with advanced solar cell technology and intelligent design features, Boviet modules are crafted from robust components and subjected to rigorous quality control and state-of-the-art manufacturing processes.

Scott Chen, VP of Global Sales and Marketing at Boviet Solar, commented, “Achieving and maintaining Tier 1 status is a testament to the trust our partners have in us and the exceptional quality of our product portfolio. It underscores our leadership in providing solutions that consistently deliver reliability and bankability at the highest level.”

Boviet Solar Technology Co. officially opened the doors on its PV module plant in Greenville, Pitt County, North Carolina—its first U.S. manufacturing facility. The $294-million facility will produce high-performance Gamma Series Monofacial and Vega Series Bifacial PV modules with PERC and N-Type solar cell technology. Boviet Solar modules are built for residential, commercial, industrial, and utility-scale applications.

,Indiana Environment,2025-06-06 01:52:06+00:00,The Daily Reporter - Greenfield Indiana,Trump's EPA targets environmental rules projected to save billions — and many thousands of lives,The Associated Press,,,,,https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/2025/06/05/trumps-epa-targets-environmental-rules-projected-to-save-billions-and-many-thousands-of-lives/,"“More people will die,” said Cory Zigler, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University who has studied air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants.
In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.
In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.
Under Trump, the EPA’s fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.
But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.","When the head of the Environmental Protection Agency announced a wide-ranging rollback of environmental regulations, he said it would put a “dagger through the heart of climate-change religion” and introduce a “Golden Age” for the American economy.

What Lee Zeldin didn’t mention: how ending the rules could have devastating consequences to human health.

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated; they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

But experts say the numbers are conservative and that even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

“More people will die,” said Cory Zigler, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University who has studied air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants. “More of this type of pollution that we know kills people will be in the air.”

What went into AP’s examination of the pollution rules

The AP set out to look at what could happen if all the rules were eliminated, by first examining exhaustive assessments the EPA was required to produce before the rules were approved. Though the agency’s priorities can change as presidential administrations change, the methods for the assessments have been largely standard since Ronald Reagan’s presidency and are deeply rooted in peer-reviewed scientific research.

The AP used those and eight different government and private group databases for its estimate of financial costs, some death estimates and analysis of pollution trends. AP performed additional analysis of potential deaths by drawing on peer-reviewed formulas and scientific research on the impacts of increased heat and pollution. And AP vetted its work with multiple outside health experts, who said it is scientifically justified, but likely an undercount.

Multiple experts say the science behind the rules is strong, and they pointed to the rigorous process that must be followed to change them, including requirements for public comment.

Zeldin acknowledged as much last month.

“I’m not going to prejudge outcomes with what will be a lot of rulemaking,” Zeldin said in April.

Virtually all the benefits from the rules come from restricting the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The fossil fuel industry was a heavy contributor to President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and Republicans overall. In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.

Calculating costs and benefits is contentious

Asked for comment on the AP findings, an EPA spokesperson said the agency’s plans would “roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden ‘taxes’ on U.S. families.”

“Unlike the Biden EPA attempts to regulate whole sectors of our economy out of existence, the Trump EPA understands that we do not have to choose between protecting our precious environment and growing our economy,” spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said.

Scott Segal, an attorney at Bracewell LLP who represents energy and manufacturing interests, suggested that EPA analyses under the Biden administration emphasized worst-case scenarios, inflated health benefit claims and missed the big-picture economic benefits of booming industry.

“If you only count lives saved by regulation, not lives harmed by regulation, the math will always favor more regulation,” Segal said. “This framing misses the larger point: public health isn’t just about air quality — it’s also about job security, housing, access to medical care, and heating in the winter.”

The EPA regulatory analyses are immense documents that numerous health and environment researchers and former officials say are grounded in science, not politics. For example, in January 2024, the EPA produced a 445-page analysis of tightening standards on dangerous particle pollution that cited more than 90 different scientific publications, along with scores of other documents. The Biden EPA presented four different regulatory scenarios and ultimately chose one of the middle options.

Two experts who reviewed AP’s work said the EPA documents that underpinned the analysis were themselves conservative in their estimates. University of Washington health and environment professors Kristi Ebi and Howard Frumkin said that’s because EPA looked at added heat deaths and air pollution mortality, but did not include climate change’s expected deaths from increased infectious disease, flooding and other disaster factors.

“This is a rigorous, compelling and much-needed analysis,” said Frumkin, who was appointed director of the CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health during George W. Bush’s administration. ”It makes clear that regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration will have major, direct consequences for health and well-being. Because of these regulatory rollbacks and funding cuts, Americans will die needlessly.”

That’s a sentiment echoed by two former Republican EPA administrators, William Reilly and Christine Todd Whitman, who served in the George Bush and George W. Bush administrations respectively.

“This administration is endangering all of our lives — ours, our children, our grandchildren,” said Whitman, who led EPA under George W. Bush.

How regulations helped clear the air

A visit to Evansville, Indiana, helps show how EPA regulations have made a difference.

The city of about 115,000 lies where the state’s southwest tip meets Kentucky at the curving Ohio River. Industry lines the banks and coal barges float past carrying loads destined to fuel power plants.

Kirt Ethridge, 30, grew up in Evansville and still lives there. As a child, he recalls looking down from high ground into the bowl-shaped valley where the heart of the city lies and seeing a haze of pollution atop it. He thought that was normal.

He didn’t think much of the looming smokestacks of the coal-fired power plants and factories that ringed the city, nor the line of inhalers waiting on a bench before he and his classmates ran the mile. He suffered asthma attacks in class, sometimes more than once a week, that sent him to the nurse’s office. Once, he was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

“It’s a very scary feeling, particularly as a kid, to not be able to get enough air in your lungs,” he said, describing it as like “breathing through a straw.”

In southwestern Indiana, coal-fired power plants were to blame for between 19,000 and nearly 23,000 deaths from 1999 to 2020, according to work by Zigler published in the journal Science that examined death rates among Medicare recipients and modeled where plants’ pollution would spread.

Nationally, he and his team found a sharp decline in air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants after the mid-2000s, from an average of 43,000 a year to just 1,600 a year in 2020, with a similar cut in particle pollution. That’s when two different forces came into play: Cheaper and less polluting natural gas pushed aside dirtier and costlier coal, while at the same time stricter regulations required more pollution control devices such as scrubbers.

Duke Energy operates its biggest power plant near Evansville — Gibson Station, which can power about 2.5 million homes. Emissions have declined significantly as the company installed scrubbers that pull unwanted chemicals out of smokestacks, along with other pollution control technology. Duke Energy spokeswoman Angeline Protegere said the scrubbers were a response to “regulations over the years as well as market factors.”

Put simply, the air got cleaner around places like Evansville. Vanderburgh County and neighboring counties violated national annual air standards for fine particles from 2005 to 2010, but no longer do, even as standards have tightened.

The same is true across the United States. The amount of tiny airborne particles in the last 10 years nationwide is one-third lower than 2000-2009, EPA statistics show. Smog pollution is down nearly 15% and sulfur dioxide has plunged 80%.

“The Clean Air Act, the EPA’s founding legislation, has been a powerful engine for improving public health as our air has grown visibly clearer and cleaner,” said Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA under President Barack Obama and served as Biden’s White House climate adviser. “Millions of Americans have avoided illnesses, hospital visits, and premature deaths thanks to EPA’s cleaner car and truck standards in concert with rules that limit industrial pollution.”

Five rules saving more than $200 billion a year

Five rules together were estimated to have more than $200 billion a year in net benefits, based on EPA documents that estimated reduced illnesses and deaths and the costs for companies to comply.

Three rules dealt with cars and trucks. The “clean car rule” is a tightening of EPA emission standards for vehicles that was supposed to take effect for 2027 model years and eventually have annual net benefits of more than $100 billion a year, according to the agency’s 884-page regulatory analysis. The EPA estimated that over the next three decades this rule alone would prevent 7.9 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, 8,700 tons of particulate matter and 36,000 tons of nitrogen oxides.

Two other proposed rules — one that deals with car models from 2023 to 2027 and another aimed at heavy trucks and buses — are estimated to save nearly $38 billion a year combined through reduced health problems from air pollution, according to EPA’s own detailed calculations.

EPA plays up costs, plays down benefits of targeted rules

Almost none of those benefits are to be found in 10 fact sheets the EPA produced in conjunction with Zeldin’s announcement. Nine make no mention of benefits from the rules, while eight mention the costs.

In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.

For example, Biden’s proposed power plant rule was designed to save more than $24 billion a year, prevent about 3,700 annual premature deaths and 3 million asthma incidents from fossil fuel-powered plants, according to EPA documents last year and work by the Environmental Protection Network. Under Trump, the EPA’s fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.

Another rule the EPA updated last year sets standards for pollution permitted in the air, called National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The update, required by the Clean Air Act, cuts allowable soot particles by 25% to reflect new science on the harms from such pollution. The EPA in Biden’s time calculated the change would annually save as much as $46 billion, 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 asthma incidents.

But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.

“The human body count and human health toll of particulate matter alone is just absolutely massive,” said K. Sabeel Rahman, a Cornell law professor who was a top federal regulatory officer from 2021 to 2023. “Literally tens of thousands of people will lose their lives” if the standard is rolled back, he said.

A penguin-shaped nebulizer

In southwest Indiana, many people have noticed a positive difference from the EPA regulations. And they’re concerned about changes.

In Bloomfield, Jessica Blazier’s 11-year-old son Julian has multiple health conditions that make him more sensitive to air quality, including nonallergic rhinitis, which inflames his nasal passage and makes breathing “feel like a knife sometimes,” in his words. Jessica Blazier said the proposed EPA rule rollbacks are “almost adding insult to injury in our particular circumstance.”

In Evansville, Ethridge is now raising kids of his own, including a 5-year-old daughter who was born early and doesn’t tolerate respiratory illnesses well. Whenever Eliza gets sick, she uses a children’s nebulizer that is shaped like a penguin and stored in an igloo-shaped case.

“I want to raise my kids in Evansville,” he said. “I don’t want to raise my kids in a bowl of pollution.”

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports that renewables are now 10 times more efficient than new nuclear at CO2 mitigation; 92.5% of all new power capacity added worldwide in 2024 was from renewables, with new nuclear virtually nowhere; new nuclear builds are vastly over-cost and over-time; large reactors on offer are the same ones offered 25 years ago – no new designs have been developed this century; since all small modular reactors are in the design stage, industry forecasts must be treated with scepticism; and waste, proliferation and siting problems are all deeply unresolved.

New nuclear has limited operational need and a poor business case. Even for the couple of hundred hours per year of dunkelflaute (low wind and low sun), it is possible to sustain a reliable power system by expanding renewable energy, rapid growth and modernisation of the electricity grid, faster interconnection, using electricity far more efficiently, smart energy management and deployment of today’s cost-effective storage technology.

And, by the way, it turns out that Sizewell C new nuclear station would be almost entirely cut off by climate-driven storm-surge floodwater at least once a year by the time it’s built.

But let’s be clear: The dual prospect of cuts to federal clean energy investments and the imposition of tariffs could threaten the gains we’ve seen across Arizona’s clean energy sector in recent years.

Transferable clean energy tax credits are allowing companies to build now and save later, resulting in more private investment to the tune of $12 billion since 2022 in Arizona. That growth has led to 30 projects in the clean energy sector and created more than 18,000 jobs across the state, much of it along the Interstate 10 corridor between Phoenix and Tucson.

For instance, LG Energy Solutions is already hiring for its $5.5 billion electric vehicle (EV) battery plant in Queen Creek, a project that expects to create more than 2,500 jobs. Cirba Solutions is opening a battery recycling plant in Eloy. JA Solar has a $60 million solar panel fabrication facility in Phoenix, creating over 600 jobs locally.

Outside the I-10 corridor, Gunnison Copper is implementing clean tech at its facility in Cochise County in southeast Arizona. Near Wellton, EVelution Energy is building a $300 million facility to process cobalt, a critical mineral in lithium-ion batteries that power EVs.

Consumers are also reaping rewards. Tax credits for energy-reducing appliances are making many household upgrades more affordable. Arizonans who upgrade their windows, skylights and insulation are eligible for tax credits to help them reduce the cost of improvements that will lower their energy needs going forward, creating a win-win for homeowners. Solar energy tax credits are reducing the cost of rooftop solar panel installation for Arizonans by 30%. Small businesses, nonprofit organizations and houses of worship are eligible for the same tax credits.

Fortunately, Arizona leaders on both sides of the aisle recognize how important these investments are for Arizona’s economy and the household budgets of Arizona consumers. While some Republican members of Congress are trying to phase out these tax credits, they haven’t been able to do so. We need our congressional delegation to keep advocating clean energy tax credits as they benefit both business owners and consumers.

Proposed tariffs under the current administration could bring significant short- and long-term challenges to Arizona’s clean energy businesses. Arizonans know Mexico is our largest trading partner, and our shared border with Mexico attracts investment because manufacturers tap into both supply chains. A 25% tariff on Mexico — as well as tariffs on Arizona’s other major international trading partners, Canada and China — threatens our standing as a major player in clean energy manufacturing and undermines businesses that are already here. Beyond the impact on businesses, tariffs drive up costs for consumers across the board.

Arizona’s economic growth in recent years puts us on the forefront of the clean energy transition, and our leaders understand that to remain competitive, we must keep growing and creating new jobs. Arizona’s congressional delegation needs to make the case to the president and other national leaders that clean energy tax credits are good for consumers and good for business, but tariffs threaten the future that Arizonans are working so hard to build.

One of the largest manufacturing investments in Ohio’s history has transformed cornfields in a rural county into a battery factory that could soon have thousands of employees.

The plant, a joint venture of Honda and LG Energy Solution, is part of a wave of new factories developed across the country following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, most of them in states and counties that usually vote Republican.

So what happens now, when the tax credits that support this plant and others like it are under threat in Washington as Congress and President Donald Trump try to find a way to pay for large tax cuts?

The answer, so far, is unsatisfying. The debate over the budget reconciliation measure that its authors call “One Big Beautiful Bill” has included little discussion of the manufacturing and energy tax credits as Republicans and Democrats place more emphasis on the parts of the bill that deal with tax cuts and Medicaid.

Midwest utilities face challenges from extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and the need to integrate renewable energy while maintaining grid reliability. Regulatory pressures to decarbonize add complexity, as utilities transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives. They also grapple with supply chain issues, labor shortages, and cybersecurity risks. Balancing modernization efforts with affordable pricing, especially in both urban and rural areas, remains a significant challenge for the region.

A new regional DISTRIBUTECH event, DTECH Midwest, provides a unique opportunity to dive into the specific challenges of the region, as well as tailored content for municipal and cooperative utilities.

If enacted as currently written, the bill would lead to a more rapid phaseout of a tax break for battery production and other manufacturing, and it would eliminate a consumer tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicles.

I am based in Ohio and have heard little outcry from business leaders or state officials here about provisions in the bill that would severely harm the battery plant, which is near the village of Jeffersonville. An exception is the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, whose president, former Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Stivers, wrote an op-ed praising the manufacturing tax credits and urging their retention.

“Each manufacturing job supports an entire ecosystem in the local economy—restaurants, retailers, housing, and small businesses all benefit from manufacturing growth,” he wrote. “Communities once facing economic uncertainty now see renewed vitality.”

Honda referred questions about the reconciliation bill to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group for auto manufacturers.

“We believe the consumer credits are critical for automakers to achieve current federal and state emissions standards,” said Brian Weiss, a spokesman for the group, in an email.

Let’s take a step back and remember some of the politics around the passage of the IRA. It was a party-line vote, with every Republican voting against, but the authors wrote the bill in a way that would encourage manufacturing investment everywhere. They knew that much, if not most, of the investment would be in Republican-leaning areas, based on which places have open land for new factories and the larger trends of rapid development in the Southeast.

Part of the idea was that by spreading the benefits, the IRA would gain bipartisan support. It would transform rural portions of Ohio, Georgia, South Carolina and other states and show how government policies could bring manufacturing jobs back to this country and make the United States more competitive with China and others.

Was this idea wrong? I don’t think so, despite what’s now happening in Washington.

To help explain, I got in touch with Jigar Shah, a longtime energy entrepreneur who served as director of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office during the Biden administration.

He is skeptical of any attempt to connect the IRA to a hypothesis about U.S. politics and thinks it would have little to do with the current budget debate except for the fact that it has dollars that can be redirected to tax cuts.

“The IRA just happens to have a large bill because it was so damn successful,” he said. “The IRA wouldn’t have any cost associated with it at all if we didn’t have 1,000 new manufacturing plants that got announced during the last four years.”

Shah is relieved that the cuts to the manufacturing tax credit are not deeper. The House bill ends the credit in 2031 instead of a phaseout that concludes in 2032, as specified in the IRA, and it adds new restrictions to the credit’s transferability and places other limits that could reduce its use.

The more immediate cuts are to consumer-facing credits for climate-conscious acts such as buying rooftop solar and EVs.

Shah sees opportunities for the Senate, which is now working on the bill, to change some of the most onerous parts of the House bill. One easy fix, he said, would be to throw out or revise a provision that could be read to mean that a manufacturing project is ineligible for credits if it has even one component from a “foreign entity of concern,” such as China.

Let’s get back to Ohio.

President Barack Obama won Ohio’s electoral votes in 2012 largely because he painted Mitt Romney as someone who bought up companies and laid people off, Shah said.

“The IRA understood that people wanted stuff to be built in Ohio and that’s exactly what was inspired in communities that haven’t seen these types of investments in more than a half century,” he said.

He pointed to a database from the U.S. Department of Energy showing that Biden-era policies led to announcements of 11,684 new jobs and $12.5 billion in investment in Ohio.

The IRA was a large step forward, but it’s still in an early stage. The Honda plant has hired about 450 employees in anticipation of starting battery production by the end of this year.

It’s nowhere close to the 2,200 jobs that would be there if the plant was running at full capacity. The same is true of many other projects that benefit from IRA incentives and are still ramping up hiring.

Most of the employees and family members who would be calling their members of Congress to defend the tax credits haven’t been hired yet.

So, when environmental advocates and others wonder why there isn’t more of an outcry from places like Ohio in the budget debate, I think they may misunderstand the extent to which IRA benefits have arrived. This law needs more time for its constituency to grow.

We will learn, maybe within weeks, whether it will get that chance.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LG-Energy-Solution-Honda-Battery-Plant.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:30:27.124124

For two days now, the tech titan has been posting — and reposting — on X about the bill's impact on the debt. Multiple independent forecasters have said that the version of the bill passed by the House last month would add more than $2 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.

Musk has taken to calling it the ""Debt Slavery Bill,"" said the bill is at odds with the goals of DOGE, exhorted his followers to call members of Congress about to get them to oppose it, and repeatedly urged Republicans to scrap the bill and start anew.

He also posted a promotional photo from the 2003 thriller ""Kill Bill.""

Republicans' response has been muted. Trump has yet to publicly weigh in on Musk's ongoing post-storm, while GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill are largely dismissing it.

House Speaker Mike Johnson visibly rolled his eyes when reporters asked him about Musk's call for a new bill on Wednesday.

""We don't have time for a brand new bill,"" Johnson said. ""And I want Elon and all my friends to recognize the complexity of what we've accomplished here.""

Some Republicans have also insinuated that Musk may be upset about the fact that the bill phases out tax credits for electric vehicles that Congress passed under President Joe Biden. NBC News reported that Musk lobbied to keep those tax credits in place, and Johnson even brought up the credits when he initially responded to Musk's criticism on Tuesday.

""I know that has an effect on his business, and I lament that,"" Johnson said.

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

All of this comes after Musk's departure from the White House last week, which followed a media blitz in which he expressed disappointment about public perceptions of DOGE and the backlash faced by his companies, including Tesla.

His criticism of the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" has been greeted warmly by Republicans who share his concerns about the deficit, but so far, his comments don't seem to have changed the overall dynamic within the party on the bill.",https://i.insider.com/6841a592c19ab3675c10b3b0?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 08:23:28.671459

The stock’s decline follows reports that Musk is now actively opposing the Biden-era EV tax credit framework after initially lobbying to preserve it.

At the center of the market reaction is a new report from Bloomberg suggesting Musk has pivoted his strategy, now aiming to dismantle the $7,500 EV tax credit after failing to sway lawmakers in Tesla’s favor. Musk criticized the proposed budget bill, claiming it “negates all the cost savings supposedly achieved by the DOGE [Tesla’s discount program] at great personal cost and risk,” implying the legislation would harm Tesla’s competitiveness.

While the exact outcome remains uncertain, political winds in Washington signal trouble for the EV credit. Senate Republicans, particularly those from red states with major EV manufacturing hubs, have been reluctant to fully strip the credits. But increasing pressure from House GOP leaders makes it likely that at least some elements of the tax benefit — especially for higher-income buyers — could be rolled back or eliminated.

That spells particular concern for Tesla, which may have more at stake than rivals. Though the $7,500 credit is limited by income thresholds for direct purchases, leased vehicles can still qualify for the full credit without such restrictions. According to Experian, about 50% of all EVs in the U.S. are leased — and Tesla’s numbers are likely even higher. In Q4 of last year, the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y topped the list of most-leased EVs, accounting for 12.2% and 9.1% of all leased electric vehicles, respectively.",https://financialbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cropped-Financialbuzz-Logo-symbol2-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-06 08:23:34.178733

As the REINS Act makes progress in North Carolina, opponents are speaking out.
In addition to Louisiana and North Carolina, Ohio lawmakers are also on the cusp of passing REINS Act legislation.
What’s more, REINS Act legislation is primed for further expansion next year in South Carolina, Montana, Missouri, and a host of other states.","Earlier this week, U.S. Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced a formal rescission of “18 obsolete or redundant Bureau of Land Management regulations.” The June 3 DOI statement announcing the recission called it “a decisive move to advance America’s energy independence and economic vitality.”

“This effort embodies our dedication to removing bureaucratic red tape that hinders American innovation and energy production,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “By rescinding these outdated regulations, we are not only reducing costs and streamlining processes but also reinforcing our commitment to energy independence and national prosperity — all while maintaining the highest standards of environmental stewardship.”

While the Trump administration continues to pursue reforms that reduce the federal regulatory burden, which now exceeds the combined cost of personal and corporate income taxes, governors and state lawmakers across the country are making progress this year when it comes to taming state regulatory burdens, namely by passing state-level versions of the REINS Act. The federal REINS Act, which would subject new regulations whose cost exceeds $100 million to congressional approval, is still awaiting consideration on Capitol Hill. In the meantime, the number of states with their own version of the REINS Act is continues to grow.

Eric Bott at Americans for Prosperity, which has been a driving force behind the nationwide expansion of the REINS Act, notes there has been a more than three-fold increase in the number of REINS Act states since Governor Scott Walker (R-Wisc.) signed legislation in 2017 making Wisconsin only the second state to have enacted this reform, with Florida being the first. Going into 2025 three states (Wisconsin, Kansas, and Florida) had a state-level REINS Act on the books, subjecting state regulations that exceed a specified cost to legislative approval. In three other states — Indiana, West Virginia, and Idaho — lawmakers had already approved reforms installing mechanisms similar to REINS, but with slight variations. New Hampshire has such a comparatively weak governor with so many checks in place, Bott explains, that the need for a REINS Act almost isn’t applicable in the Granite State.

“Florida has had REINS in the form of legislative rules ratification in place since 2010, and the process has earned the praise of regulators, legislators, and even the Florida Bar Journal,” notes Jon Sanders of the John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina-based think tank. “It causes regulators to work with legislators when they perceive the need for a costly regulation. This produces the coexistence between legislators and regulation that best serves people.”

Thus far in 2025, lawmakers in Kentucky, Wyoming, Utah, and Oklahoma have enacted REINS Act legislation. At least three more state legislatures are likely to pass a REINS Act this summer. REINS Act legislation introduced in Louisiana, Senate Bill 59, is now working its way toward Governor Jeff Landry’s (R) desk, with the Louisiana House passing SB 59 on June 2.

“Louisianans face multiple legal and regulatory barriers to starting and running a business,” said Daniel Erspamer, CEO of the Pelican Institute for Public Policy, a Louisiana-based think tank. “SB 59 by Senator Reese will empower legislative oversight committees to review, and approve or reject rules promulgated by agencies that will have a $200K per year or $1M impact over five years on regulated individuals or companies.”

On June 4, two days after the Louisiana House unanimously passed SB 59, the North Carolina Senate Regulatory Reform Committee held a hearing advancing HB 402, REINS Act legislation approved by the North Carolina House in April. The next stop for HB 402 is the Senate Rules Committee and then, supporters hope, the Senate floor.

As the REINS Act makes progress in North Carolina, opponents are speaking out. The Southern Environment Law Center, for example, testified against HB 402 during the North Carolina Senate Regulatory Reform Committee hearing this week, as did a representative for Democracy Out Loud, an organization that describes itself as a “peaceful activist community works together for a democracy that improves people’s lives.”

“We have regulatory agencies,” the Democracy Out Loud representative told lawmakers during the June 4 hearing. “You appoint people to the regulatory agencies. You have some control over major rules that come. You don’t need this law to take over.”

The irony of a pro-democracy group opposing a reform that would give democratically-elected officials final say on the costliest regulations, rather than unelected bureaucrats who are not accountable to voters, was not addressed during the June 4 hearing. It could, however, come up in the Rules Committee.

In addition to Louisiana and North Carolina, Ohio lawmakers are also on the cusp of passing REINS Act legislation. In a joint letter to Ohio legislators, a coalition of conservative organizations wrote that enactment of the REINS Act “will establish the necessary checks and balances by requiring legislative approval for new rules or regulations that impose a significant fiscal burden, ensuring that such decisions are made by elected representatives rather than unelected bureaucrats.”

If lawmakers in Ohio, North Carolina, and Louisiana enact the pending REINS Act bills in the coming weeks, as many expect, nearly a quarter of all states will have a REINS Act on the books going into 2026.

""Living shorelines are not the answer to save the coasts but they are a potential action toward reimagining future coastal resilience,"" Kocher concluded.","Amid rising sea levels, people in coastal communities may need to change the way they deal with the relentlessly advancing waters.

What's happening?

It would behoove North Carolinians to alter their approach and work with nature rather than against it, Duke University marine biology student Ava Kocher wrote for the North Carolina Coastal Federation's Coastal Review.

She said residents were fighting a losing battle to maintain their properties along the state's coast, warning that seawalls and bulkheads were a waste of money and suggesting that living shorelines can help shift ""this combative approach"" as ""a step in the right direction.""

The Tarheel State's coastal marshes are shifting as rising global temperatures melt ice and expand seawater. These ecosystems are able to retreat with this slow onslaught — unless they are blocked by concrete or another human-made structure.

Alyson Flynn, an environmental economist at the North Carolina Coastal Federation, told Kocher that the construction of such infrastructure on individual properties has forced neighbors to put up the same walls, as their land was eroding faster without it. ""They felt like the only way to protect their property was to also put up a seawall,"" she said. ""And so then it had this barricading effect across the whole shoreline.""

Why is this important?

North Carolina will lose 98,000 acres of salt marsh by 2100, Coastwatch magazine reported last year. This is because rising sea levels are accelerating and outpacing land elevation gains.

The results include a higher water table and more frequent and severe floods — and all the problems that come with those symptoms of the rapidly overheating planet, such as increasing fatalities, property damage, and insurance costs from extreme weather events such as hurricanes.

""Sea level rise, that might be like your allergies … and then comes a hurricane,"" Christine Voss, a retired research associate at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's Institute of Marine Sciences, told Kocher. ""And because you may have been worn down by your allergies, when the cold or the pneumonia or the flu comes by, you're actually more susceptible.""

Instead of hardening land in an impossible bid to ward off the sea, however, living shorelines — featuring plants, sand, or rock — can help mitigate risk and buy time, as one Havelock family showed. Kocher noted that homeowners Vernon and Michele Kelly chose this route instead of replacing a worn-out bulkhead.

""Minnows seem to have figured out, 'Hey, we've got a sort of … haven here.' I've seen an increase of blue crabs in that sill area. And I actually had one oyster starting to grow,"" Vernon Kelly said.

""What we've done, it'll save it for my lifetime, maybe my kids. But if Mother Nature really decides she wants to do something, we can't stop her,"" he added.

What's being done about sea level rise?

As Vernon Kelly noted, this may be a long-term solution compared to a human lifespan, but it's actually temporary.

Because the warming of Earth is caused primarily by the burning of dirty energy sources, the solution is to transition to cleaner forms of power, such as solar and wind. Swapping personal vehicle trips for public transit rides, making your next car an electric vehicle, and shopping at thrift stores help cut down the production of heat-trapping pollution — and will save you money.

""Living shorelines are not the answer to save the coasts but they are a potential action toward reimagining future coastal resilience,"" Kocher concluded. ""Relinquishing the ideal of a manicured waterfront is the start of embracing an alliance with the ecosystems we inhabit. Starting in backyards like Kelly's, there is an opportunity to recognize the value of wetlands and begin to dissolve the walls, physical and philosophical, built between humans and the sea.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sea-level-riseimage-recw5FD8I1e8ilYF7-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:34:14.835561

That was not his job, Mr. Lynch says he answered, predicting that the Germans would eventually persuade themselves of the benefits.
Mr. Lynch argues that Europe will inevitably accept that it would benefit from the ability to increase Russian gas flows.
Undersea blasts in 2022 damaged both strands of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, and one of the two strands of Nord Stream 2.
European officials and analysts have been confused by the Trump administration’s ambiguous position on Russian gas for Europe, in part because it would undercut more expensive liquefied natural gas shipped from the United States.","European leaders are maneuvering to ensure the region doesn’t return to dependence on cheap Russian gas, worried about the leverage it would give the Kremlin.

Their recent moves come amid a push by an American investor and donor to the Trump campaign, who is betting that Europe will change its mind — and that the United States will be interested.

In a meeting last month with German economic officials, the investor, Stephen P. Lynch, proposed buying a much-criticized Russian undersea pipeline, called Nord Stream 2, to eventually deliver natural gas to Germany. He had already made the pitch to the Trump administration, figuring that the United States would want Americans controlling a pivotal piece of energy infrastructure.

The German officials were skeptical, Mr. Lynch recalled in an interview with The New York Times. And Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who is meeting with President Trump at the White House on Thursday, will reiterate his opposition to using Nord Stream 2 if the issue comes up, his spokesman said this week.

The position of the Trump administration on such a deal is unclear, though the American president, in his re-engagement with President Vladimir V. Putin, has said he wants to do business deals with Russia. American officials in April outlined a potential peace framework for Ukraine that included possibly resuming U.S. energy cooperation with Russia, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks.

The geopolitical jockeying over the pipeline shows how the future of Europe’s energy supply is once again emerging as a source of tension and vulnerability.

When Russia first mobilized for war, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. vowed that, if Moscow invaded, “there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.” He imposed sanctions on the state-controlled company that owned it, while Germany refused to allow the newly completed pipeline to begin operation.

After the invasion, European businesses and governments sharply reduced their dependence on Russian gas, trying to punish Moscow economically even though the effort came at considerable cost to themselves.

In his May 6 meeting in Berlin, Mr. Lynch recalls, German officials asked how he intended to persuade them to allow Russian gas to flow through the pipeline, which was partially sabotaged in 2022. That was not his job, Mr. Lynch says he answered, predicting that the Germans would eventually persuade themselves of the benefits.

Mr. Merz declared last week that Germany would do “everything we can” to ensure that Nord Stream 2 “cannot be put back into operation.” The European Union said last month it was considering sanctions to “dissuade any interest, and notably interest from investors, in pursuing any activity on Nord Stream.”

“For Europe, it looks like Trump is still trying to make a separate peace with Putin,” said Sergey Vakulenko, an energy analyst at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “Europe is doing all it can to show that they won’t go along with it.”

The German Economy Ministry, where Mr. Lynch held his May 6 briefing at what he said was the ministry’s request, declined to comment for this article. The German news outlet Die Zeit reported earlier that Mr. Lynch had met with ministry officials.

The new European push to choke off future use of Nord Stream 2 comes as American and Russian officials suggest that their two countries could team up, rather than compete, in selling fossil fuels to Europe. The activities of well-connected investors like Mr. Lynch who see ways to profit from a warmer relationship between Washington and Moscow have added to the urgency.

Mr. Lynch argues that Europe will inevitably accept that it would benefit from the ability to increase Russian gas flows. Having Nord Stream 2 owned by an American entity would increase Western oversight over Russian gas sales, he contends, and it would allow Europe to avoid doing business directly with Russian entities and people under Western sanctions.

“When they decide that they need gas from Russia — which they will — we’ll be there,” Mr. Lynch said in an interview in London last week. “Eventually the European leadership will change their posture.”

Mr. Lynch, who spent two decades living in Moscow and is now based in Miami, describes his specialty as the “de-Russification” of Russian assets.

In 2022, the Treasury Department granted him approval to buy the Swiss subsidiary of the sanctioned Russian state bank Sberbank. He faced criticism for playing into the Kremlin’s hands in 2007 when buying up remnants of a Russian oil company whose main owner, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, had run afoul of Mr. Putin.

He unsuccessfully lobbied the Biden administration last year for a license that would have allowed him to negotiate for Nord Stream 2.

He renewed his push after Mr. Trump’s inauguration and in February filed a new application with the Treasury Department to deal with some Russian businesses and people under U.S. sanctions, according to a person close to Mr. Lynch who requested anonymity to speak about the ongoing process.

Mr. Lynch has donated more than $700,000 to Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign and other Republican causes since last year, Federal Election Commission filings show. Mr. Lynch added that he’d argued to U.S. officials that Nord Stream 2 “can be a geopolitical tool to align Russia with the West.”

“Absolutely no gas would flow until there is peace” in Ukraine, Mr. Lynch said.

The $11 billion pipeline, which is owned by the Russian energy giant Gazprom and was financed by a who’s who of European energy companies, has been going through debt restructuring proceedings in a Swiss court. Mr. Lynch says that if granted a license to negotiate for it, he would line up other investors to join him and would expect to buy it at a steep discount. Any funds earmarked for Russia would be held in escrow until the Ukraine war ends, he says.

Mr. Putin began hinting at the idea in January, when he said after Mr. Trump’s inauguration that Moscow and Washington could work together to keep energy prices not “too high” and not “too low.” In March, the Russian president said that if “the United States and Russia agree on cooperating in the energy field, then a gas pipeline to Europe can be ensured.”

The head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev, has discussed the idea of U.S. companies working with Russia to increase Russian gas sales to Europe with the White House envoy Steve Witkoff, according to former officials in Moscow and Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.

Undersea blasts in 2022 damaged both strands of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, and one of the two strands of Nord Stream 2. Germany would have to certify the safety of the pipelines before they could be used.

The European Commission declined to comment when asked whether new sanctions, now under development, against the Nord Stream pipelines would prevent companies and nations from buying fuel sent through them if they were American-owned.

European officials and analysts have been confused by the Trump administration’s ambiguous position on Russian gas for Europe, in part because it would undercut more expensive liquefied natural gas shipped from the United States.

But analysts say it could appeal to Mr. Trump if reduced European demand for American gas is seen as keeping U.S. energy prices in check.

Mr. Vakulenko, the Carnegie scholar, has described a Nord Stream 2 deal as a “viable prospect,” given the geopolitical advantages for Washington and because “German industry would benefit significantly from Russian gas.” But he warned in an interview that it would be a “bad” deal for Europe and for Ukraine, because from their perspective, “it’s making a deal behind their back.”

Germany was Europe’s biggest buyer of Russian gas before the Ukraine invasion, but it has since reduced its direct imports of Russian pipeline gas to zero. While Mr. Merz has taken a hard line against Nord Stream, some voices in his center-right party — not to mention in Germany’s Russia-friendly far left and far right — are urging a different tack.

“Production costs are too high,” Michael Kretschmer, the center-right governor of the eastern German state of Saxony, said in an interview published May 25 on the news outlet Zeit Online. He urged the government to reconsider its opposition to Nord Stream.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/03/multimedia/00russia-trump-energy-kmqb/00russia-trump-energy-kmqb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:34:18.814280

As the demand for renewable energy grows, the role of tax incentives in shaping our energy future is becoming increasingly important. More and more companies in the United States are seeking to meet their power needs with emissions-free electricity. To support this shift, tax incentives, along with legislation and policy, play a key role in determining energy prices and how quickly we are able to adopt clean energy technologies.

At Constellation, our advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C. ensure these credits support the continued operation and growth of nuclear energy — the nation’s largest source of carbon-free power. These incentives make clean energy projects more affordable and also drive innovation and sustainability efforts across the energy industry. Understanding how these policies work and their potential impact is essential for any business that wants to get on the path to a more sustainable future.

Benefits of Tax Incentives

Tax incentives have been significant in encouraging businesses to adopt clean energy generation. By reducing the financial burden, more businesses are likely to invest in clean energy projects because they fit within their budgets. One key part of these incentives is tech-neutral tax credits, which ensure that all types of clean energy technologies get equal support. This approach helps drive innovation and diversification in the clean energy industry, creating a competitive environment that moves us forward.

For example, the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) have played a large role in the growth of solar and wind energy in the United States. These credits have helped lower the cost of renewable energy projects, making them more competitive with traditional energy sources. The recently enacted production tax credit for existing nuclear plants has assured the continued operation of highly reliable nuclear units, the nation’s largest source of clean energy.

Tech-neutral tax credits are essential because they don’t favor one clean energy technology over another. This allows businesses to implement the most efficient and effective solutions for their operations. It also encourages innovation and the adoption of a wide range of clean energy solutions, from solar and wind to emerging technologies like advanced nuclear and carbon capture.

Impact on Electricity Prices

Tax incentives significantly influence electricity prices by lowering the cost of clean energy generation, which can stabilize and reduce prices for consumers. However, if these tax credits were removed, the cost of generating clean energy could rise, leading to higher electricity prices. This would negatively impact consumers and also slow down the transition to a cleaner energy grid. Therefore, it’s important to keep supportive policies in place to ensure clean energy remains affordable and accessible, benefiting both the economy and the environment.

Future Federal Policy Considerations

Looking ahead, it’s important to take a balanced approach to federal policy. Policymakers need to focus on the long-term goal of creating a self-sustaining market for clean energy. This means not only maintaining existing incentives but also looking into advancing manufacturing credits and other innovative policy measures. By doing so, we can support the growth of the clean energy industry and support a more stable economy.

Advanced manufacturing credits can play a significant role in this transition by supporting the development and implementation of new technologies. These credits can lower the cost of manufacturing clean energy technologies, making them more competitive with traditional energy sources. Future federal policies should also focus on creating a stable and predictable regulatory environment, which is key to attracting investment and fostering innovation.

Texas’ ERCOT market has the most to lose with 128 GW of clean energy capacity expected to come online in 2028 or later.
“With the stroke of a pen, Congress could put an end to the clean energy boom that has transformed the country over the last decade.","After the House passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” in May, the Solar Energy Industries Association released the report, America’s solar industry is under threat that found the bill could jeopardize the buildout of domestic manufacturing and lead to the loss of planned solar projects.

Cleanview, a clean energy market intelligence company based in Boulder, Colorado corroborates this in its report, Repealing the IRA puts 600 GW of clean energy capacity at risk.

An earlier iteration of the bill presented by the House Ways and Means Committee proposed a gradual step-down in tax credits, but the House bill, which is now with the Senate for possible changes and a vote, has a much more stringent process for qualifying for tax credits. For example, in order for developers to qualify for 45Y Production Tax Credit and 48E Investment Tax, construction must begin within 60 days of the President signing the bill into law and the projects must be placed into service by the end of 2028.

In addition, rules around foreign entities of concern (FEOC) would deny tax credits to owners of projects that use materials and equipment from companies in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.

Cleanview commented on the fact that a project will lose its credit entirely if it is not operational by the end of 2028, stating that it creates “much more risk for a project developer who has little control over whether a local county issues their permit or if a 100-year pandemic wreaks havoc on global supply chains.”

While projects may be planned and ready for development, American Clean Power finds that clean energy projects experience delays in permitting or supply chain issues of 16 months. With supply chain problems at risk of getting worse due to recent tariffs, “these compressed timeframes put a huge portion of planned utility-scale solar, wind and battery projects at risk,” according to Cleanview. “Developers will essentially have to rush to begin work within a two-month window and achieve completion within ~3.5 years.”

Cleanview estimates that 223 GW of solar projects are at risk.

Storage projects face the highest risk with 265 GW of capacity planned for 2028 and beyond, according to the report. Cleanview finds that 136K of storage is planned to come online in 2028, with 127K expected to come online after 2028.

Energy storage faces high risk in part due to its incredible success. “In recent years, developers have planned hundreds of gigawatts of storage capacity, thanks to falling costs and the IRA’s unprecedented policy support,” Michael Thomas, Cleanview founder and CEO told pv magazine USA. “That’s led it to be disproportionately represented in the interconnection queues.”

In states with notoriously slow permitting timelines, like California, projects face an even higher risk. Cleanview projects that 183 GW (or 79%) of projects in California’s CAISO face the highest risk.

Texas’ ERCOT market has the most to lose with 128 GW of clean energy capacity expected to come online in 2028 or later. The report authors acknowledge that this may overstate the amount of capacity at risk in the Texas market because of the speed at which Texas has granted permits in the past.

To generate the figures for the report, Cleanview used its project tracker to quantify how many projects that could lose tax credits are at risk of cancellation given how important the incentives are to project viability. Cleanview looked at how much capacity is expected to come online between 2028 and 2035 across the major RTOs and ISOs because any coming online in 2029 or later would not qualify for tax credits.

Cleanview said revision and/or passage of the Bill represents a pivotal moment for America’s energy future. “With the stroke of a pen, Congress could put an end to the clean energy boom that has transformed the country over the last decade. In doing so, they could put many national priorities, shared by Democrats and Republicans alike, at risk.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/BLM-e1590101643259.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:26:17.610638

“We say, act where science is clear,” said François Houllier, a member of the committee and president and managing director of Ifremar, a French ocean research institute that co-organized the scientific summit.

Ocean Conference here next week, scientists are urging them to take action to combat a dual climate and biodiversity crisis plaguing marine ecosystems, and base their decisions on the best available science.

To guide them, the International Scientific Committee of the One Ocean Science Congress unveiled a list of comprehensive recommendations for ocean recovery its members hope can be transformed into actionable policy.

“We say, act where science is clear,” said François Houllier, a member of the committee and president and managing director of Ifremar, a French ocean research institute that co-organized the scientific summit.

The 18-member committee spent the last year developing the list of recommendations and included insights from some of the 2,000 scientists in attendance at the four-day congress in the French Riviera.

“This is our responsibility to clearly tell what we know,” said Houllier.

The list of recommendations are organized around 10 topics that will be discussed during next week’s conference, which will be co-hosted by France and Costa Rica and bring together not only heads of state and government, but also financial institutions, NGOs, civil society groups, Indigenous peoples and philanthropists.

The main objective of the summit will be to implement one of the U.N.’s 17 sustainable development goals—Goal 14 or Life Below Water—aimed at managing the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, marine biodiversity and resources.

Historically, many scientists at the congress said, this goal has been overlooked and underfunded. On average, nations dedicate less than 2 percent of their research budgets to ocean science, which is significantly less than what they spend on other areas of research, according to UNESCO.

But they’re paying the price.

The global ocean is warming at an alarming rate. Coral reefs, which support more than 25 percent of all marine life, are bleaching en masse due to repeated and long-lasting marine heatwaves.

Overfishing and illegal fishing are contributing to fish stock declines, particularly in some of the most populated parts of the world that depend on seafood as a main source of protein. As temperatures continue to rise, so do sea levels and the intensity of more frequent catastrophic storms.

“You cannot deal with the crisis of the climate without also dealing with the crisis of the ocean and vice versa,”said John Kerry, the former U.S. secretary of state, during a live-streamed video speech he gave Thursday to scientists.

The ten recommendations made by the congress address both. Some reiterate what scientists have been calling for for decades— a “strong and urgent phase out of fossil fuel use” in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, for instance.

Efforts to end marine plastic pollution entangling sea turtles, whales and other marine species must be made by investing in new technologies that can produce alternatives to plastic. Recently, some companies have begun to use seaweed for such purposes, said Houllier.

Likewise, governments should end illicit, unreported and unregulated fishing by eliminating harmful government subsidies that incentivise overfishing in international waters.

“Many nations are subsidizing the fishing industry, which leads to too large a number of boats,” said Jean-Pierre Gattuso, an oceanographer and research director of the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), a French organization that co-organized the congress with Ifremar. He is also a member of the scientific committee that developed the recommendations. While the fishing industry has grown significantly since 1950, he said, “there is no increase in the amount of fish that is available.”

The first recommendation promotes a newer and more inclusive marine conservation approach by encouraging a shift from humanity’s extractive relationship with the sea to one that promotes “responsibility, respect and reverence,” according to the first recommendation titled “Inspiring Ocean Stewardship.”

Inspiring Ocean Stewardship

To do this, the list of recommendations recognizes the importance of integrating Indigenous and other traditional knowledge systems in marine policy and encouraging their collaboration with scientists. It also recognizes the intrinsic rights of marine life and states: “We advocate for legal personhood initiatives for marine ecosystems to advance conservation and raise awareness.”

Other recommendations promote a precautionary and equitable approach to utilizing marine resources. The fourth recommendation asks leaders to pause harmful activities in the deep ocean such as oil and gas extraction, deep sea mining and destructive fishing practices like bottom trawling. Instead, it suggests more robust efforts be made to understand deep ecosystems better through vigorous research in this largely unexplored realm.

Proceeding With Caution

The second recommendation aimed at promoting safe and equitable ocean-based climate solutions encourages decision makers to explore marine carbon dioxide removal from the ocean with caution.

“It is a hot topic because there is an urgency to decrease the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere,” said Gatusso. “All eyes are turning to the ocean,” as sequestration of carbon on land proves difficult.

Capturing and storing carbon dioxide in the ocean relies on various techniques, including cultivating or sinking seaweed, ocean alkalinity enhancement and nutrient fertilization. Some estimates, according to the World Resources Institute, show that billions of tons of carbon could be stored in the ocean each year by midcentury. “There are also some risks,” said Houllier. “Here we say, please let us continue to do research before taking decisions that could be harmful.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OceansNice.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:27:25.552320

Large-scale biomass plants, including Drax Power Station, are an important part of the U.K.’s renewable energy mix. Current government support for large-scale biomass power plants ends in 2027.

The DESNZ in February announced plans to move forward with a short-term support mechanism for large-scale biomass generators. The extended subsidies aim to both support the move to BECCS and support the U.K.’s energy security. Biomass currently supplies approximately 5% of U.K. electricity generation.

The U.K. government has indicated that transitional support for biomass power will be for lower volumes of generation than under current subsidies and will be designed to maximize energy security benefits. The transitional support will be offered as a contract for difference (CfD) with a generation collar. The new subsidies will be limited to biomass generators that have a minimum electricity export of 100 megawatts (MW). Eligible generators will also have to meet biomass sustainability criteria. In addition, the government has set a greenhouse gas (GHG) threshold at t 36.6 gCO2e/MJ, which aligns with the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED III).

According statements issued by Drax earlier this year, the transitional subsidies will be available for all four biomass units at Drax Power Station with an aggregate collar of c.6TWh pa (and a minimum of c.5TWh pa). The subsidies will be available from April 2027 through March 2031.

The SAU is an agency that assists public authorities by providing independent non-binding reports in relation to subsidies or subsidy schemes that meet certain statutory requirements.

In its June 4 announcement, SAU said it will prepare a report evaluating DESNZ’s assessment of whether the proposed subsidy complies with subsidy control requirements. The report is scheduled to be published by July 10.

Additional information is available on the SAU website.

The spectacular blow-up between the president of the United States and the world’s richest man played out on their respective social media platforms after Trump first broached the topic in a White House meeting with Germany’s new leader.

WATCH: Trump says he’s ‘very disappointed’ in Elon Musk after criticism of president’s budget bill

The rancorous breakup happened less than a week after they appeared together at the White House and Trump thanked Musk for his brief but tumultuous time in the U.S. government.

Trump had largely remained silent as Musk stewed over the last few days on his social media platform X, condemning the president’s signature tax cuts and spending bill. But Trump clapped back Thursday in the Oval Office, lamented their frayed relationship and said he was “very disappointed in Musk.”

Musk responded on social media in real time. Trump ratcheted up the stakes when he turned to his own social media network, Truth Social, and threatened to use the U.S. government to hurt Musk’s bottom line with his internet company Starlink and rocket company SpaceX.

“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his social media network. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”

“This just gets better and better,” Musk quickly replied on X. “Go ahead, make my day.”

The deepening rift unfurled much like their relationship started — rapidly, intensely and very publicly.

It also quickly hit Musk financially, even before Trump’s threat.

After Trump started speaking about Musk, shares of his electric vehicle company Tesla fell 9%, their latest notable move since the election. The shares doubled in the weeks after Trump was elected, gave back those gains and more during Musk’s time at DOGE and then rallied after he vowed in April to focus much more on Tesla and his other companies.

Musk later offered up an especially stinging insult to a president sensitive about his standing among voters: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” Musk retorted. “Such ingratitude,” Musk said in a follow-up post.

Politicians and their donor patrons rarely see eye to eye. But the magnitude of Musk’s support for Trump, spending at least $250 million backing his campaign, and the scope of free reign the president gave him to slash and delve into the government with the Department of Government Efficiency is eclipsed only by the speed of their falling out.

Musk announced his support for Trump shortly after the then-candidate was nearly assassinated on stage at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally last July. News of Musk’s political action committee in support of Trump’s election came days later.

Musk soon became a close adviser and frequent companion, memorably leaping in the air behind Trump on stage at a rally in October. Once Trump was elected, the tech billionaire stood behind him as he took the oath of office, flew with him on Air Force One for weekend stays at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, slept in the White House’s Lincoln Bedroom at the president’s invitation and joined his Cabinet meetings wearing a MAGA hat (sometimes more than one).

“I’ll be honest, I think he missed the place,” Trump said Thursday. “He got out there, and all of a sudden he wasn’t in this beautiful Oval Office.”

Musk bid farewell to Trump last week in a subdued news conference in the Oval Office, where he sported a black eye that he said came from his young son but that seemed to be a metaphor for his messy time in government service.

Trump, who rarely misses an opportunity to zing his critics on appearance, brought it up Thursday.

“I said, ‘Do you want a little makeup? We’ll get you a little makeup.’ Which is interesting,” Trump said.

The Republican president’s comments came as Musk has stewed for days on social media about Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” warning that it will increase the federal deficit. Musk has called the bill a “disgusting abomination.”

“He hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that will be next,” Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office. “But I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.”

Observers had long wondered if the friendship between the two brash billionaires known for lobbing insults online would flame out in spectacular fashion. It did, in less than a year.

“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said.

The president said some people who leave his administration “miss it so badly” and “actually become hostile.”

“It’s sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it,” he said.

He brushed aside the billionaire’s efforts to get him elected last year, including a $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes in Pennsylvania. The surge of cash Musk showed he was willing to spend seemed to set him up as a highly coveted ally for Republicans going forward, but his split with Trump, the party’s leader, raises questions about whether they or any others will see such a campaign windfall in the future.

Trump said Musk, the CEO and founder of Tesla, “only developed a problem” with the bill because it rolls back tax credits for electric vehicles.

“False,” Musk fired back on his social media platform as the president continued speaking. “This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!”

In another post, he said Trump could keep the spending cuts but “ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.”

The bill would unleash trillions of dollars in tax cuts and slash spending but also spike deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade and leave some 10.9 million more people without health insurance, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, which for decades has served as the official scorekeeper of legislation in Congress.

Besides Musk being “disturbed” by the electric vehicle tax credits, Trump said another point of contention was Musk’s promotion of Jared Isaacman to run NASA.

Trump withdrew Isaacman’s nomination over the weekend, days after Musk left his government role.

“I didn’t think it was appropriate,” Trump said, calling Isaacman “totally a Democrat.”

Musk, reverting to his main form of political activity before he joined forces with Trump, continued slinging his responses on social media.

He shared some posts Trump made over a decade ago criticizing Republicans for their spending, musings made when he, too, was just a billionaire lobbing his thoughts on social media.

“Where is the man who wrote these words?” Musk wrote. “Was he replaced by a body double!?”

Electric vehicle battery companies in SC among the latest to hit speed bumps But the lag in growth has led to multiple setbacks for the fledgling industry, with canceled investments both nationally and in the Palmetto State.","A battery cell maker is pausing work on its manufacturing plant under construction in the Pee Dee, delaying its pledge of 1,600 new jobs for South Carolinians.

Envision Automotive Energy Supply Co. (AESC) announced the work stoppage Thursday, two years after breaking ground on the facility near Florence.

“AESC has informed the state of South Carolina and our local partners that due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” spokesman Brad Grantham said in a statement. “We anticipate being able to resume construction once circumstances stabilize.”

The Japanese-headquartered firm already has invested more than $1 billion into the Florence facility, Grantham said.

He said the company “fully intends to meet our commitments to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs in the coming years,” but did not indicate what the new timeline might be. The company declined to provide further comment.

Gov. Henry McMaster, while speaking to reporters, pointed to uncertainty in Washington, D.C., as a reason.

“We hate to see that happen, but a pause is OK,” he said, noting a temporary suspension last week at Volvo’s Lowcountry plant.

The staunch supporter of President Donald Trump said “there’s no doubt” that changes must be made to international trade policy, while recognizing the administration’s roller coaster tariff announcements will have an effect.

“The tariffs are going up and down, and some of those are being paused,” McMaster said.

He also addressed the uncertainty of what Republicans’ massive bill on taxes and spending will do for the electric vehicle industry. As passed by the U.S. House, the bill would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits, both for people who purchase new or used electric vehicles and those who install EV charging stations at their homes or business. It’s unclear what the Senate will do.

Regardless, McMaster said he’s confident that South Carolina’s economy, “despite all the ups and downs, is still going up, up, up.”

He said he’s communicating with South Carolina’s delegation, company officials, and the White House.

“Let things play out, because all of these changes are taking place,” the governor said. “So, I’d say, relax if you can. … We believe that, give it some time, and it’ll work out.”

The industry already wasn’t meeting early growth expectations before Trump took office.

However, electric vehicle sales have continued to rise, both nationally and globally.

Electric vehicle battery companies in SC among the latest to hit speed bumps

But the lag in growth has led to multiple setbacks for the fledgling industry, with canceled investments both nationally and in the Palmetto State. Automakers have also eased away from goals of going all-electric in favor of a mix of electric and plug-in hybrids.

A repeal of consumer tax credits could further slow progress.

AESC’s pause comes just four months after the battery cell manufacturer pulled back on earlier plans to expand the plant beyond its original scope.

BMW contracted with AESC to produce battery cells for the German auto giant’s U.S. manufacturing facilities in the Upstate. The automaker has already invested $700 million dollars in its own battery plant in Woodruff, planning to place the cells it receives from AESC into the batteries it assembles there.

BMW spokesman Steve Wilson said those battery assembly plans are still on schedule to begin in 2026.

Between the initial announcement in 2022 and March 2024, AESC rolled out three separate rounds of investment and promises of jobs in Florence. In addition to supplying BMW’s Spartanburg County assembly plant, the company made plans for a second building that was supposed to produce battery cells for a BMW plant in Mexico.

But in February, AESC told the state the first factory would be enough to meet the demand for both of BMW’s facilities. It pulled out of plans for a second, $1.5 billion building, along with the 1,080 jobs that came with it.

In turn, South Carolina withdrew its offer of $111 million in state funding for that particular phase.

The incentives claw back was a rare move for the state. But even with the pull back, AESC’s remaining plant had still been on track to become the largest economic development deal in the Pee Dee region, according to the state Department of Commerce.

The remaining $121 million in bonds and $135 million in grants Commerce offered as an initial incentive to lure AESC to South Carolina are so far unaffected by the shutdown, Commerce spokeswoman Alex Clark.

“South Carolina is fully and unequivocally committed to supporting existing companies, including AESC,” Clark said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47658/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/governor_secretary_aesc_edited_photo-1024x6831749181296.png?h=199d8c1f&itok=i0QKsF1v,N,,2025-06-06 08:24:15.241340

» MORE: After West Texas fire, lawmakers approve ban on outdoor chemical storage facilities near homes — Travis Bubenik, Marfa Public Radio","After 140 days at the Capitol in Austin, the Texas Legislature has just wrapped up its 89th session.

This year, state lawmakers passed over 1,200 bills. Among them were several important pieces of legislation focused on energy and the environment. Barring a veto from Gov. Greg Abbott, these will soon become law in Texas.

Here's a breakdown of some of those measures.

A push for water security and wildfire resilience

Abbott opened this year's legislative session by naming water as one of his top priorities.

""We will make the largest investment in water in the history of Texas,"" said Abbott in his State of the State address. ""We will tap into new water supplies and repair pipes to save billions of gallons of water each year.""

The numbers back up the need: According to the Texas Water Development Board, groundwater availability is expected to drop by 25% by 2070. Supply will be decreasing even as demand is expected to double – possibly much sooner.

Across the Texas Plains and Panhandle, farmers rely heavily on groundwater for irrigation, putting enormous pressure on the state's aquifers. But that's also changing in Texas.

""Our municipal demand is steadily increasing and will surpass the irrigation,"" said L'Oreal Stepney, chairwoman for the Texas Water Development Board, before lawmakers earlier in the session.

""Municipal is going to be the number one user, and it'll be here before we know it,"" she added.

A new bill, Senate Bill 7, would pump $1 billion each year into the Texas Water Fund. The money will go toward developing new water sources and shoring up old infrastructure — a lifeline for both farmers and growing cities.

Meanwhile, the Panhandle, still reeling from the state's largest-ever wildfire last year, saw movement on another front. Lawmakers passed SB 34, aimed at strengthening rural firefighting capacity — most of which relies on volunteers. The bill boosts potential grant funding and support for those departments.

Both the water and wildfire bills are now on Gov. Abbott's desk.

Lawmakers say no to renewable energy limits – but yes to grid investment

One of the big questions this session: would Texas put the brakes on renewable energy?

Proposals like Senate Bill 715 and Senate Bill 388 sought to limit the growth of wind and solar – or at least make them more expensive to develop. Supporters argued that would help stabilize the grid. Critics warned it would only drive up costs.

In a rare alliance, environmental, business and renewable energy groups pushed back and both bills failed. Bryn Baker, senior policy director for Texas Energy Buyers Alliance, was among those leading the opposition.

""This is about cost and reliability. Full stop. And if you're talking about making things more expensive – you've got a whole bunch of folks interested and concerned,"" Baker said.

Instead, lawmakers approved a major expansion of the Texas Energy Fund: $5 billion more to help build new power plants and fund grid resilience projects.

Keeping chemical storage away from homes

Texas lawmakers have approved a ban on certain types of outdoor chemical storage facilities being located close to homes, a response to an Odessa-area industrial fire nearly a year ago that allegedly filled a neighborhood with ""black sludge.""

State Rep. Brooks Landgraf (R-Odessa) proposed the ban after the massive fire in July 2024 at Permian Basin Containers, a facility where a mix of oil industry-related chemicals and liquids were stored in stacked piles of large plastic tubs.

People living right next door to the facility said in a resulting lawsuit that the fire flooded their neighborhood with a mysterious sludge that seeped into homes and cars. The neighbors also reported a strong, noxious odor in the wake of the fire. Landgraf also raised concerns about the potential for groundwater contamination from the incident.

Tesla Inc.’s shares sank as Elon Musk and President Donald Trump’s simmering feud devolved into a public war of words between two of the world’s most powerful people.

Trump on June 5 said that he was “very disappointed” by the Tesla CEO’s criticism of the president’s signature tax policy bill. Musk fired back in several social media posts, saying in one that “without me, Trump would have lost the election.”

The president later floated terminating federal contracts and subsidies extended to Musk’s companies and said he had asked the Tesla and SpaceX leader to leave his administration, which Musk said was a “lie.” Musk went a step further late in the day, saying he would decommission a SpaceX craft used by the U.S.

Tesla’s shares dropped 14% on June 5 in New York, the stock’s biggest decline since March 10. The rout erased about $150 billion from the electric vehicle maker’s market value. The stock fell another 2.2% as of 4:39 p.m. in post-market trading.

The spectacle of the world’s richest person and the leader of the free world lobbing insults toward one another on social media marks a stunning breakup of a once formidable political alliance.

Musk spent more than $250 million to help secure Trump’s return to the White House. Trump in turn deputized Musk to lead a sweeping effort to slash government spending and reshape the federal bureaucracy before the mercurial billionaire stepped back from that role last week.

Ross Gerber, the CEO of Tesla shareholder Gerber Kawasaki, sharply criticized Musk’s behavior in a Bloomberg TV interview, saying it could lead to lawsuits from the automaker’s investors and cut the value of SpaceX in half.

“Elon isn’t functioning to the benefit of his shareholders,” said Gerber, whose firm has substantially reduced its Tesla holdings over the last few years. The meltdown is leading to the “dismantling of the Musk empire in real time.”

The conflict raises the specter of Trump wielding government powers to retaliate against Musk’s companies, similar to actions the president has taken to attack other perceived enemies, such as Harvard University.

It also injects doubts about whether Trump’s administration will deliver key policy changes Musk has sought, namely a framework that would liberalize deployment of autonomous vehicles that Musk has said are critical to Tesla’s future and its market value.

RELATED: Tesla Targets June 12 Rollout of Robotaxi Service in Austin

Already, policies being advanced by Trump and Republican lawmakers are putting billions of dollars at risk for Tesla, which is by far Musk’s largest business.

Trump’s massive tax bill would largely eliminate a credit worth as much as $7,500 for buyers of some Tesla models and other electric vehicles by the end of this year, seven years ahead of schedule. That would translate to a roughly $1.2 billion hit to Tesla’s full-year profit, according to JPMorgan analysts.

RELATED: House Backs Electric Vehicle, Hybrid Fees in Budget Bill

After leaving his formal advisory role in the White House last week, Musk has been on a mission to block the president’s signature tax bill that he described as a “disgusting abomination.” The world’s richest person has been lobbying Republican lawmakers — including making a direct appeal to House Speaker Mike Johnson — to preserve the valuable EV tax credits in the legislation.

Separate legislation passed by the Senate attacking California’s EV sales mandates poses another $2 billion headwind for Tesla’s sales of regulatory credits, according to JPMorgan.

Taken together, those measures threaten roughly half of the more than $6 billion in earnings before interest and taxes that Wall Street expects Tesla to post this year, analysts led by Ryan Brinkman said in a May 30 report.

Tesla didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The House-passed tax bill would aggressively phase out tax credits for the production of clean electricity and other sources years earlier than scheduled. It also includes stringent restrictions on the use of Chinese components and materials that analysts said would render the credits useless and limits the ability of companies to sell the tax credits to third parties.

Tesla’s division focused on solar systems and batteries separately criticized the Republican bill for gutting clean energy tax credits, saying that “abruptly ending” the incentives would threaten U.S. energy independence and the reliability of the power grid.

The clean energy and EV policies under threat were largely enacted as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. The law was designed to encourage companies to build a domestic supply chain for clean energy and electric vehicles, giving companies more money if they produce more batteries and EVs in the U.S. Tesla has a broad domestic footprint, including car factories in Texas and California, a lithium refinery and battery plants.

With those Biden-era policies in place, US EV sales rose 7.3% to a record 1.3 million vehicles last year, according to Cox Automotive data.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-06/Musk-Trump-1200.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:24:19.202656

Getting federal approval for permits to build bridges, wind farms, highways and other major infrastructure projects has long been a complicated and time-consuming process. Despite growing calls from both parties for Congress and federal agencies to reform that process, there had been few significant revisions – until now.

In one fell swoop, the U.S. Supreme Court has changed a big part of the game.

Whether the effects are good or bad depends on the viewer’s perspective. Either way, there is a new interpretation in place for the law that is the centerpiece of the debate about permitting – the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, known as NEPA.

Taking a big-picture look

NEPA requires federal agencies to document and describe the environmental effects of any proposed action, including construction of oil pipelines, renewable energy and other infrastructure projects.

Only after completing that work can the agency make a final decision to approve or deny the project. These reports must evaluate direct effects, such as the destruction of habitat to make way for a new highway, and indirect effects, such as the air pollution from cars using the highway after it is built.

Decades of litigation about the scope of indirect effects have widened the required evaluation. As I explain it to my students, that logical and legal progression is reminiscent of the popular children’s book “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,” in which granting a request for a cookie triggers a seemingly endless series of further requests – for a glass of milk, a napkin and so on. For the highway example, the arguments went, even if the agency properly assessed the pollution from the cars, it also had to consider the new subdivisions, malls and jobs the new highway foreseeably could induce.

The challenge for federal agencies was knowing how much of that potentially limitless series of indirect effects courts would require them to evaluate. In recent litigation, the question in particular has been how broad a range of effects on and from climate change could be linked to any one specific project and therefore require evaluation.

With the court’s ruling, federal agencies’ days of uncertainty are over.

Biggest NEPA case in decades

On May 29, 2025, the Supreme Court – minus Justice Neil Gorsuch, who had recused himself – decided the case of Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, the first major NEPA dispute before the court in 20 years.

At issue was an 85-mile rail line a group of developers proposed to build in Utah to connect oil wells to the interstate rail network and from there transport waxy crude oil to refineries in Louisiana, Texas and elsewhere. The federal Surface Transportation Board reviewed the environmental effects and approved the required license in 2021.

The report was 637 pages long, with more than 3,000 pages of appendices containing additional information. It acknowledged but did not give a detailed assessment of the indirect “upstream” effects of constructing the rail line – such as spurring new oil drilling – and the indirect “downstream” effects of the ultimate use of the waxy oil in places as far flung as Louisiana.

In February 2022, Eagle County, Colorado, through which trains coming from the new railway would pass, along with the Center for Biological Diversity appealed that decision in federal court, arguing that the board had failed to properly explain why it did not assess those effects. Therefore, the county argued, the report was incomplete and the board license should be vacated.

In August 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed and held that the agency had failed to adequately explain why it could not employ “some degree of forecasting” to identify those impacts and that the board could prevent those effects by exercising its authority to deny the license.

The railway developers appealed to the Supreme Court, asking whether NEPA requires a federal agency to look beyond the action being proposed to evaluate indirect effects outside its own jurisdiction.

A resounding declaration

Writing for a five-justice majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh delivered a ringing, table-pounding lecture about courts run amok.

Kavanaugh did not stop to provide specific support for each admonition, describing NEPA as a “legislative acorn” that has “grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development.” He bemoaned the “delay upon delay” NEPA imposes on projects as so complicated that it bordered “on the Kafkaesque.”

In his view, “NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents.” He called for “a course correction … to bring judicial review under NEPA back in line with the statutory text and common sense.” His opinion reset the course in three ways.

First, despite the Supreme Court having recently reduced the deference courts must give to federal agency decisions in other contexts, Kavanaugh wrote that courts should give agencies strong deference when reviewing an agency’s NEPA effects analyses. Because these assessments are “fact-dependent, context-specific, and policy-laden choices about the depth and breadth of its inquiry … (c)ourts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.”

Second, Kavanaugh crafted a new rule saying that the review of one project did not need to consider the potential indirect effects of other related projects it could foreseeably induce, such as the rail line encouraging more drilling for oil. This limitation is especially relevant, Kavanaugh emphasized, when the effects are from projects over which the reviewing agency does not have jurisdiction. That applied in this case, because the board does not regulate oil wells or oil drilling.

And third, Kavanaugh created something like a “no harm – no foul” rule, under which “even if an (environmental impact statement) falls short in some respects, that deficiency may not necessarily require a court to vacate the agency’s ultimate approval of a project.” The strong implication is that courts should not overturn an agency decision unless its NEPA assessment has a serious flaw.

The upshot for the project at hand was that the Supreme Court deferred to the board’s decision that it could not reliably predict the rail line’s effects on oil drilling or use of the oil transported. And the fact that the agency had no regulatory power over those separate issues reinforced the idea that those concerns were outside the scope of the board’s required review.

A split court

Although Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote that she would have reached the same end result and upheld the agency permit, her proposed test is far narrower.

By her reading, the federal law creating the Surface Transportation Board restricted it from considering the broader indirect effects of the rail line. But her finding would be relevant only for any federal agencies whose governing statutes were similarly restrictive. By contrast, Kavanaugh’s “course correction” applies to judicial review of NEPA findings for all federal agencies.

Though the full effects remain to be seen, this decision significantly changes the legal landscape of environmental reviews of major projects. Agencies will have more latitude to shorten the causal chain of indirect effects they consider – and to exclude them entirely if they flow from separate projects beyond the agency’s regulatory control.

Now, for example, if a federal agency is considering an application to build a new natural gas power plant, the review must still include its direct greenhouse gas emissions and their effects on the climate. But emissions that could result from additional gas extraction and transportation projects to fuel the power plant, and any climate effects from whatever the produced electricity is used for, are now clearly outside the agency’s required review. And if the agency voluntarily decided to consider any of those effects, courts would have to defer to its analysis, and any minor deficiencies would be inconsequential.

That is a far cry from how the legal structure around the National Environmental Policy Act has worked for decades. For lawyers, industry, advocacy groups and the courts, environmental review after the Eagle County decision is not just a new ballgame; it is a new sport.

Stock prices in the electric vehicle company dropped 47 points by the end of trading, down from its midday peak of 335.53.

Why It Matters

A growing division has emerged between Musk and Trump since the former left the White House at the end of May, with the president's ""big, beautiful bill"" becoming a major point of contention between the two former allies.

What To Know

During a White House meeting on Thursday, Trump said that he had been disappointed in Musk's criticism of the budget bill, suggesting that the billionaire opposed it because it removed electric vehicle tax credits.

""I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people,"" Trump told reporters. ""All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to to cut the EV mandate.""

""Whatever,"" Musk shot back on X, formerly Twitter, in what began a flurry of furious posts aimed at the president.

He later claimed that Trump would have lost the election without his support, adding ""such ingratitude.""

Trump responded with his own post on Truth Social, suggesting that the government should ""terminate"" Musk's federal subsidies and contracts.

The war of words has already taken a toll on Tesla, which saw a double-digit percentage drop. Forbes estimates the drop wiped $17.2 billion from Musk's previous $400 billion fortune.

Tesla stock had begun to rally last month, jumping 22 percent after Musk announced he was leaving the Department of Government Efficiency and would focus on his role as Tesla's CEO. The electric car company has suffered since Musk joined the Trump administration, with protests at dealerships and a rapid decline in sales and stock prices.

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday: ""Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore.""

Elon Musk, on X: Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. Such ingratitude.""

President Donald Trump posted on social media: ""Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!""

What Happens Next

Trump and Musk continued to spar online through Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, the president has given senators until July 4 to pass the bill.

As passed by the U.S. House, the bill would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits, both for people who purchase new or used electric vehicles and those who install EV charging stations at their homes or business.
However, electric vehicle sales have continued to rise, both nationally and globally.
In turn, South Carolina withdrew its offer of $111 million in state funding for that particular phase.
“South Carolina is fully and unequivocally committed to supporting existing companies, including AESC,” Clark said.","A battery cell maker is pausing work on its manufacturing plant under construction in the Pee Dee, delaying its pledge of 1,600 new jobs for South Carolinians.

Envision Automotive Energy Supply Co. (AESC) announced the work stoppage Thursday, two years after breaking ground on the facility near Florence.

“AESC has informed the state of South Carolina and our local partners that due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” spokesman Brad Grantham said in a statement. “We anticipate being able to resume construction once circumstances stabilize.”

The Japanese-headquartered firm already has invested more than $1 billion into the Florence facility, Grantham said.

He said the company “fully intends to meet our commitments to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs in the coming years,” but did not indicate what the new timeline might be. The company declined to provide further comment.

Gov. Henry McMaster, while speaking to reporters, pointed to uncertainty in Washington, D.C., as a reason.

“We hate to see that happen, but a pause is OK,” he said, noting a temporary suspension last week at Volvo’s Lowcountry plant.

The staunch supporter of President Donald Trump said “there’s no doubt” that changes must be made to international trade policy, while recognizing the administration’s roller coaster tariff announcements will have an effect.

“The tariffs are going up and down, and some of those are being paused,” McMaster said.

He also addressed the uncertainty of what Republicans’ massive bill on taxes and spending will do for the electric vehicle industry. As passed by the U.S. House, the bill would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits, both for people who purchase new or used electric vehicles and those who install EV charging stations at their homes or business. It’s unclear what the Senate will do.

Regardless, McMaster said he’s confident that South Carolina’s economy, “despite all the ups and downs, is still going up, up, up.”

He said he’s communicating with South Carolina’s delegation, company officials, and the White House.

“Let things play out, because all of these changes are taking place,” the governor said. “So, I’d say, relax if you can. … We believe that, give it some time, and it’ll work out.”

The industry already wasn’t meeting early growth expectations before Trump took office.

However, electric vehicle sales have continued to rise, both nationally and globally.

Electric vehicle battery companies in SC among the latest to hit speed bumps

But the lag in growth has led to multiple setbacks for the fledgling industry, with canceled investments both nationally and in the Palmetto State. Automakers have also eased away from goals of going all-electric in favor of a mix of electric and plug-in hybrids.

A repeal of consumer tax credits could further slow progress.

AESC’s pause comes just four months after the battery cell manufacturer pulled back on earlier plans to expand the plant beyond its original scope.

BMW contracted with AESC to produce battery cells for the German auto giant’s U.S. manufacturing facilities in the Upstate. The automaker has already invested $700 million dollars in its own battery plant in Woodruff, planning to place the cells it receives from AESC into the batteries it assembles there.

BMW spokesman Steve Wilson said those battery assembly plans are still on schedule to begin in 2026.

Between the initial announcement in 2022 and March 2024, AESC rolled out three separate rounds of investment and promises of jobs in Florence. In addition to supplying BMW’s Spartanburg County assembly plant, the company made plans for a second building that was supposed to produce battery cells for a BMW plant in Mexico.

But in February, AESC told the state the first factory would be enough to meet the demand for both of BMW’s facilities. It pulled out of plans for a second, $1.5 billion building, along with the 1,080 jobs that came with it.

In turn, South Carolina withdrew its offer of $111 million in state funding for that particular phase.

The incentives claw back was a rare move for the state. But even with the pull back, AESC’s remaining plant had still been on track to become the largest economic development deal in the Pee Dee region, according to the state Department of Commerce.

The remaining $121 million in bonds and $135 million in grants Commerce offered as an initial incentive to lure AESC to South Carolina are so far unaffected by the shutdown, Commerce spokeswoman Alex Clark.

Businesses have cancelled or delayed more than $14 billion of investments in US clean energy projects so far this year, reflecting their uncertainty and pessimism over federal support amid President Donald Trump’s climate policy retreat, industry analysts reported Thursday.

The sector still is showing resilience—at least $4.2 billion in new renewable energy, grid, electric vehicle and battery projects were announced over the same time period, from January through April, according to the tracking report by the nonprofit group Environmental Entrepreneurs, or E2, and its research partner, Atlas Public Policy.

Some 10,000 jobs are expected to be created by these newly announced projects—including an electric truck assembly plant that the Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Auto said it would site in Warsaw, Indiana. That’s equal to the estimated number of job losses from all the clean energy projects that have been abandoned so far this year. Nevertheless, it’s a sharp reversal of trends E2 tracked in the sector over the previous three years, when $127.7 billion in new clean energy project announcements outpaced cancellations at a rate of nearly 50-to-1.

Officials at E2, a nonpartisan group of clean energy business leaders and investors, said it was an ominous sign as the Senate prepares to take up Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the House-passed tax and spending cut package that would eliminate most of the clean energy tax credits Congress passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director for E2. “Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the report.

The biggest of the cancellations that E2 tracked came in April. The United Auto Workers announced that Stellantis would not go forward with a $3.2 billion battery plant it planned to add to a giant shuttered assembly facility it is reopening in Belvidere, Illinois. And global energy giant RWE announced it was shuttering its US offshore wind operations “for the time being” due to “the political environment” in the United States. RWE had invested $1.1 billion to develop wind projects offshore of New York, Louisiana and California.

While E2 tracks public announcements of new projects and cancellations, other efforts at tracking what’s happening in the clean energy sector provide a more detailed picture—and in some senses, a more optimistic one.

The Clean Investment Monitor, a project of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the consulting firm Rhodium Group, tracks actual capital spending in the quarter of all projects that have broken ground, and also includes investment in decarbonization projects at energy and industrial plants as well as consumer spending—for example, on EVs, rooftop solar and efficiency upgrades. For the first quarter of 2025, Clean Investment Monitor reported $67.3 billion in spending, a 6.9 percent increase from the same period in 2024. However, it was a 3.8 percent falloff from the previous quarter, and the second consecutive quarterly decline after an unbroken record of quarterly expansion that began in 2021.

Retail purchases of clean energy technology by households and businesses clearly were the driving force in investment in early 2025, the Clean Investment Monitor reported. Its analysis, like that of E2, noted the cancellation of a number of big clean energy projects over the quarter. And it warned of the headwinds for the clean energy supply chain, not only due to uncertain federal policy but the escalation of tariffs and broader macroeconomic pressures.

The American Clean Power Association (ACPA), which tracks utility-scale electricity projects, also put out its first quarter report Thursday, showing that developers installed 7.4 gigawatts of solar, wind and storage capacity, marking the second-strongest start to a year on record. (The strongest start on record was 2024, when 8 gigawatts came on line.) That brings total utility-scale clean power capacity to more than 320 gigawatts, which the association estimates is enough to power nearly 80 million US homes. Of course, that electricity is not only powering homes but also businesses, where power demand is rising sharply due to data centers.

It was a record-setting quarter for battery storage capacity, which surpassed 30 gigawatts, a 65 percent increase from last year. Indiana quadrupled its energy storage capacity in just one quarter, with the help of a big system owned by the energy company AES that opened in April at the site of a former coal power plant.

Texas continued to lead the nation in both utility-scale solar and land-based wind capacity, with its total clean energy portfolio reaching more than 80 gigawatts, a 20 percent increase from a year ago, ACPA said. In all, eight of the top 10 states for clean power additions in the quarter voted Republican in the 2024 presidential election.

The association also saw continuing growth in the project development pipeline, with a 12 percent year-over-year increase in projects under construction or in the advanced stages of development. If all are built, it would add up to $328 billion in investment, said the group’s CEO, Jason Grumet.

“Clean power is shovel-ready at scale,” he said, while echoing E2’s concerns about the retreat from federal support for the sector in Washington.

“With unprecedented demand growth for electricity, we must send consistent investment signals across the energy sector,” Grumet said. “The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2025/06/03/54362410944_c919e831e3_b.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:25:59.200558

Yet this will not be enough for the country’s clean tech firms to dodge the tariff bullet, for a simple reason.
Most of the measures that damage green energy prospects look set to remain in place.
A closer look at EV batteries shows how tariffs will hit the U.S. clean tech sector hard.
One small consolation for clean energy advocates could be last week’s executive orders to boost nuclear energy, although those efforts will take many years to come online.","On May 22, the Republicans controlling the U.S. House of Representatives passed their “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill. Among many other measures, the bill rolls back tax credits and other subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Biden administration’s flagship legislation to support U.S. clean technology firms, including those involved in renewable energy, battery production, and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing.

Combined with U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff plans, the IRA repeal will hit green energy businesses hard. Tariffs on imported components will raise the prices of U.S. clean tech products to such highs that they will struggle to compete both domestically and in international markets. Meanwhile, the repeal of IRA tax credits adds insult to injury by dampening private sector investment in the industry, undermining the United States’ long-term ability to play a leading role in the global green energy landscape.

Tariffs on China make a great starting point to understand how Trump’s policies will harm U.S. clean tech firms. Granted, the United States has made great strides to relocate the production of such goods to U.S. soil in recent years, with manufacturing capacity now close to meeting domestic demand for EV batteries and solar panels.

Yet this will not be enough for the country’s clean tech firms to dodge the tariff bullet, for a simple reason. To source the inputs that they need to assemble green energy gadgets—such as polysilicon wafers for solar panels and cathodes for EV batteries—U.S. firms rely on China, the hegemon of clean tech. Analysts from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, for instance, estimate that Chinese companies produce around 70 percent of the global supply of most of the components that go into finished clean tech goods.

If you thought that the current legal circus around tariffs might provide relief, think again. Most of the measures that damage green energy prospects look set to remain in place.

A closer look at EV batteries shows how tariffs will hit the U.S. clean tech sector hard. Thanks to a recent IRA-fueled investment boom, U.S. firms now have the capacity to build enough American-made batteries to meet domestic demand. Yet the United States remains a long way off from full self-sufficiency: The country’s battery makers import roughly 85 percent of the materials that they use on their production lines, mostly from China.

Trump’s willingness to impose tariffs on just about the entire world (except Russia) means that turning to countries other than China is not a viable option. Alternative suppliers of EV batteries, such as South Korea, also face the prospect of U.S. tariffs come early July. The upshot? Economists reckon that Trump’s tariff salvos could translate into a 17.5 percent rise in the price of U.S.-made batteries by 2026.

But higher prices for U.S.-made clean tech gadgets could soon raise tricky questions. At a time when the global clean tech sector is facing a glut of supply (mostly because of Chinese overproduction), the rationale for onshoring has less to do with economics than with national security. From that perspective, Washington has every interest in creating China-proof supply chains for clean tech in order to limit reliance on Chinese firms and boost the United States’ energy independence.

Tariffs, however, make this easier said than done. It is hard to imagine that U.S. green energy firms could thrive if tariffs fuel the manufacturing costs of their goods to such highs that they are not competitive abroad. What’s more, Chinese clean tech firms could soon choose to cut prices to cement their global market shares (particularly in big markets like Europe or Japan), further weighing on the export competitiveness of U.S.-made green goods.

The United States has—or rather, had, given the likely IRA repeal—a way out of this competitiveness conundrum: subsidizing private investment in domestic production to such an extent that these products could compete against foreign-made goods at home and abroad. Beyond job-creation purposes, this was the point of the IRA tax credits. The legislation envisioned trying to make the United States a leading player in the clean tech sector at a time when China dominates the field.

To the Biden administration’s credit, the United States registered some success in the field: From the adoption of this legislation in the third quarter of 2022 through the first quarter of this year, private investments in electric vehicle, battery, solar, and wind projects totaled $664 billion, a 89 percent rise compared to the same period preceding the Inflation Reduction Act. However, such largesse is over. The high likelihood of a significant IRA repeal has shown that hopes to see the federal government subsidize clean tech firms under Trump are vain.

The cancellation of IRA tax credits would likely have a deep impact on the U.S. clean tech sector at a time when investors have already become cautious. Recent data paints a stark picture. In the first quarter of 2025, U.S. clean tech projects worth $7.7 billion were canceled—the highest level on record and more than four times the total of all cancellations in 2024.

Things could soon get worse: Analysts predict that a repeal of the IRA could threaten the development of around $500 billion in clean tech projects. (Some researchers think this figure could top $1 trillion by 2035; estimates vary greatly since the amount depends on private investment plans.) Amid a bleak outlook, the only silver lining for green energy firms could come from the state level: Some U.S. states mandate the use of renewable sources in the energy mix, offering a lifeline to the sector. In California, for instance, utility providers will need to source 50 percent of power sales from clean energy sources by 2030.

Financial considerations are not the only factor dampening private investment in U.S. clean tech projects. Under Trump 2.0, the climate has become toxic for green energy firms as the administration ramps up criticism of environmentally friendly policies; true to form, Trump calls the IRA the “Green New Scam.”

The fate of Norwegian energy company Equinor’s $5 billion Empire Wind offshore wind project near New York City illustrates this. In April, the secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior ordered an immediate halt to the construction of this project following a January executive order mandating a pause in future wind projects and a government review of current ones. Construction restarted after a month, but the saga sent chilling vibes to potential investors. In turn, many firms are now adopting a wait-and-see approach—possibly for Trump’s entire term.

The impact of a dent in U.S. investments in clean tech projects looks set to outlive Trump. Even if his policies were to be reversed on the day he leaves the White House, the next three and a half years will probably be lost for the sector. This could prove especially true for projects to develop next-generation technologies such as green hydrogen, direct air carbon capture, or geothermal power—the only green energy fields where the United States is a major global player on a par with China.

The green hydrogen sector—still far from commercial viability and thus particularly dependent on government subsidies—could be hit especially hard; analysts reckon that the end of IRA tax credits could lead to the cancellation of 95 percent of green hydrogen projects. To make matters worse, the Energy Department is considering shutting down its Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, potentially cutting roughly $9 billion in funding to develop nascent green technologies.

The U.S. clean tech sector faces a perfect storm as it braces for the combined impact of tariffs and the loss of IRA tax credits—two policies that look set to have an impact on the country’s ability to play a leading role on the global green energy landscape well beyond Trump’s term. Perhaps MAGA-inclined voters will find this is well and good—and that the country’s focus should solely be on a policy of “drill, baby, drill” for fossil fuels, as Trump put it.

One small consolation for clean energy advocates could be last week’s executive orders to boost nuclear energy, although those efforts will take many years to come online. But 93 percent of new capacity added to the U.S. electrical grid so far this year has been coming from renewable sources. Even if that capacity is not always available because of the weather, it is not clear how the White House will manage to keep the lights on without green tech amid a boom in electricity demand fueled by power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.

As Europe, Japan, and other developed economies double down on clean energy investments, that makes the United States an outlier. Trump’s energy strategy (or lack thereof) is yet another item on the growing list of his shortsighted plans.",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trump-climate-green-tech-GettyImages-2154228971-e1749135474696.jpg?w=1000,N,,2025-06-06 08:26:02.413234

OAK RIDGE, Tenn., June 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Orano USA and more than 100 federal, state, business, and regional leaders recently marked a major milestone for Project IKE, the company's development of America's new multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility, with a ceremonial ribbon-cutting opening the company's office in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

""Oak Ridge is where history meets the future,"" said Jean-Luc Palayer, CEO of Orano USA.

Project IKE, the single largest investment in Tennessee's history, will advance America's low carbon energy future by producing enriched uranium to power today's nuclear reactors and next-generation designs, bolstering U.S. energy independence and national security.

""Oak Ridge is where history meets the future,"" said Jean-Luc Palayer, CEO of Orano USA. ""Today, we stand on historic ground—where American ingenuity first unlocked the power of the atom. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has correctly said that Artificial Intelligence is the Manhattan Project of our time. But we only lead in AI if we can power AI. With that in mind and with Project IKE here in Oak Ridge, we step forward on a new mission of equal consequence. We are developing an American enrichment facility that will fuel not just reactors, but the future—powering new technologies that will define the next century.""

The event included speeches marking the milestone by Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn, Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Stuart McWhorter, State Senator Ken Yager, and Oak Ridge Mayor Warren Gooch.

The enrichment facility's development is in line with President Trump's recent executive orders regarding nuclear energy, which are intended to revitalize and expand the U.S. nuclear industry, aiming to quadruple nuclear electricity production by 2050.

""The announcement of a major global enrichment company opening its office in Oak Ridge, paired with President Trump's strong movement forward in nuclear energy, is about to change the world and change the world for the better,"" Governor Lee said. ""Tennessee will lead this change.""

Palayer emphasized that applying Orano's 60 years of nuclear expertise in America and its proven centrifuge technology can enable a quicker ramp up for production of advanced nuclear fuels, including high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) and low-enriched uranium (LEU/LEU+).

""America needs new nuclear power,"" said Palayer. ""The world needs new nuclear power. And new nuclear power needs Tennessee and Project IKE in Oak Ridge.""

Located less than 10 miles from Orano's selected Project IKE site near the Oak Ridge Horizon Center Industrial Park, this first group of office employees, including engineers, project managers, and licensing personnel, is in addition to the 300-person workforce expected to operate Orano's uranium enrichment facility.

The new Oak Ridge office joins Orano's 15 other sites in the United States including manufacturing facilities in North Carolina, canister operations in Kentucky, nuclear medicine research in Texas, and headquarters in Maryland.

Later this year, Orano is celebrating 60 years in the United States as one of the longest operating nuclear energy companies in the nation. For more than 40 years, Orano has reliably produced and supplied American reactors with enriched uranium. Orano's Project IKE is designed to continue this performance from an American facility to provide a reliable, significant, domestic nuclear fuel supply for U.S. advanced reactors and the existing reactor fleet.

Orano's planned uranium enrichment center in Oak Ridge is designed as a multi-structure commercial production site covering approximately 750,000 square feet, making it one of the largest in America.

Depending on federal funding and customers' support, the facility will produce LEU/LEU+ to fuel existing commercial nuclear energy reactors and, potentially, HALEU to help develop and power advanced reactors.

Orano has already taken active steps to support the American market and foster energy independence by launching a 30% uranium enrichment capacity expansion at its operating Georges Besse 2 facility in France.

Through its SUSTAINera Circular Economy division, the automaker has teamed up with Enel and Aeroporti di Roma (ADR) to support the PIONEER project, Italy’s largest second-life battery energy storage system. The project utilizes old EV batteries to store solar energy and power Rome Fiumicino Airport, one of Europe’s busiest travel hubs.

Launched back in 2022, the partnership also includes Enel X, system integrator Loccioni, and the scientific support of Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute. Their goal? Take EV batteries from Stellantis vehicles—specifically from B-segment models built on the eCMP platform—and give them a new job after they’re no longer fit for driving.

Instead of sending these used batteries straight to recycling, SUSTAINera contributed 78 second-life packs, each capable of storing 50 kWh of energy. That’s enough to add up to 3.9 megawatt-hours (MWh) of capacity, all integrated into a larger 10 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) powered by a massive 31 GWh solar farm operated by ADR.

The result? A smart, sustainable setup that’s expected to eliminate 16,000 tons of CO₂ emissions over the next decade.

This PIONEER project is a major win for Stellantis, and it’s only the beginning. It’s part of a broader effort by the company to establish a circular economy around electric vehicles, where batteries are reused, repaired, remanufactured, and ultimately recycled when they are no longer viable.

Through its Free2move eSolutions joint venture with NHOA, Stellantis is now also developing test units that explore how second-life batteries can support homes, businesses, and industrial sites right here in the U.S. The aim is to build scalable energy storage systems from batteries originally meant for cars—reducing waste and helping the electric grid in the process.

It’s all part of Stellantis’ long-term strategy to be a more sustainable carmaker. And with EV adoption on the rise, the ability to reuse and repurpose old batteries could become just as important as building new ones.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PIONEER_SecondLifeBatteriesenergystorage.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 08:30:20.604108

From solar-powered elementary schools to heat-mitigation projects in disinvested communities, we have become an example of what real, local climate solutions can look like.

But now, as Congress works to advance President Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill,” this momentum is under attack — fueled by partisan politics, disinformation and a deliberate effort to derail federal investments designed to protect our current and future health, environment and economy.

As the vice mayor and representative of Tucson’s Ward 1, I see firsthand how clean energy investments are not abstract policy — they’re already improving lives in our communities.

At Manzo Elementary, a school rooted in Barrio Hollywood, solar panels not only lower utility bills but also power classrooms and help teach the next generation what environmental stewardship looks like. Recognized as a national leader in place-based sustainability education, Manzo integrates aquaponics, school gardens, composting, rainwater harvesting and outdoor learning spaces to make climate education hands-on and culturally relevant. These efforts build climate literacy and leadership from the ground up. Manzo is a model for what community-rooted climate solutions can be: locally led, accessible and built for the future. Investments from the Inflation Reduction Act help schools like Manzo thrive, not just survive rising energy costs.

But here in the desert, we’re up against more than utility hikes — we’re facing deadly heat. Every summer, Tucson sets new records for heat-related emergency room visits. In neighborhoods like mine, where many families live in older homes without modern cooling systems, heat can be a public health emergency. The clean energy investments under threat aren’t just about grid resilience — they’re about saving lives.

What’s at stake couldn’t be clearer. Just this spring, Tucson lost over $7 million in federal funding after Republicans began targeting what they’ve called “green new scam” programs — money that would have gone to community-led climate resilience projects right here in Ward 1. That includes shade infrastructure at 20 high-use bus stops, battery storage upgrades at public-serving facilities, and transforming asphalt heat islands into green stormwater harvesting sites like the South 12th Avenue Greenway. These weren’t abstract ideas — they were shovel-ready plans that would have made our streets safer, cooler and more livable for families already on the frontlines of extreme heat. Now, they’re stalled. We can’t afford to let partisan attacks derail solutions our communities have been building for years.

To make matters worse, the current GOP budget bill being considered in Congress uses the tax dollars “saved” by gutting these critical investments to instead help pay for nearly $4 trillion in tax cuts for corporations and the rich. They want to take from communities like ours and reward Wall Street and the very wealthiest Americans.

Cities like Tucson have used IRA funding to advance clean transportation, invest in urban greening, and build neighborhood cooling solutions in areas most affected by extreme heat. Rather than gutting these programs, we should be expanding them. Imagine what we could do with continued support: more shaded bus stops across our cities, solar panels on every school, green jobs for youth, heat preparedness and home weatherization programs to protect our most vulnerable.

I urge all of Arizona’s elected leaders in Washington to put Arizona first and vote no on stripping these critical investments from communities like ours that rely on them.",https://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2023/04/KellerSolar2-WEB.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:27:44.301640

The OBBBA is currently in the Senate for consideration, and changes are likely; thus, the actual fiscal impact of the legislation is likely to change as it moves through Congress.

Introduction

The House recently passed its fiscal year (FY) 2025 reconciliation legislation: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) score of the OBBBA estimates that it would increase primary (non-interest) budget deficits by $2.4 trillion over the fiscal year (FY) 2025–2034 budget window. Including interest costs, the legislation would increase budget deficits by $3.0 trillion and boost the national debt to 124 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of FY 2034, compared to 117 percent of GDP under current law.

A Closer Look at the Provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act

The FY 2025 budget resolution adopted by the House and Senate included reconciliation instructions to 11 House committees to allow up to $3.3 trillion of primary deficit increases over the FY 2025–2034 budget window (the budget resolution instructs the Senate to craft measures that would increase primary deficits by up to $2.0 trillion). CBO’s score of the House-passed OBBBA estimates that the 11 committees’ reconciliation measures and the interactions between them would increase primary budget deficits by $2.4 trillion through FY 2034, which is the net effect of $4.2 trillion of gross costs that is partially offset by $1.7 trillion of gross savings. After including the $551 billion in higher interest costs that would come from the additional borrowing, the OBBBA would increase budget deficits by $3.0 trillion through FY 2034. While CBO scores the OBBA as increasing budget deficits over the next decade, the Administration has argued the revenue from the tariffs it’s imposed through executive action will effectively offset this cost. In fact, CBO recently estimated that the administration’s tariffs will reduce budget deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.

The two companies signed a strategic collaboration agreement under which MSP will store carbon dioxide captured at Southern Energy’s biomass-to-methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant, scheduled for construction in Louisiana.

This $1 billion facility, projected to begin production in 2028, will use biomass sourced from the Southern Wood Basket— a region considered the largest timber and biomass producer in the United States.

The groundbreaking plant will utilize the biomass to produce biofuel like methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), generating carbon removal credits to be rolled out on the voluntary carbon market and qualifying for 45Q tax credit benefits.

To permanently store the CO2 captured at Southern Energy’s Louisiana facility, MSP will leverage its Class VI storage site, expected to come online in 2027.

MSP is driven by a professional team that relies on carbon credit expertise from DevvStream to deliver solutions for companies looking to decarbonize and generate environmental assets value.

Adam Farris, CEO of Monroe Sequestration Partners, shared that the company is thrilled to partner with Southern Energies, calling this collaboration “a powerful alignment of technology, infrastructure, and purpose.”

He commented, “This partnership is exactly the kind of collaboration we envisioned when forming MSP—to connect strategic industrial emitters with carbon storage solutions that are both technically sound and commercially viable.”

“Our work with Southern Energy represents a shared commitment to climate innovation, and we’re proud to be part of a project that will help define the future of low-carbon fuel,” he added.

Farris goes on to note that Louisiana is positioning itself as the carbon capture capital of the U.S., adding that MSP is proud to be part of that transformation.

Deep South Center for Environmental Justice v. EPA, No. 24-60084 (5th Cir. 2025).

The groups, Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, Healthy Gulf, and Alliance for Affordable Energy, filed a petition in February 2024 with the Fifth Circuit requesting that the court “hold unlawful, vacate, and set aside” EPA’s final rule that approved Louisiana’s 2021 application for Class VI Primacy. Several intervenors in the suit, including the State of Louisiana and oil and gas trade associations, disputed the groups’ ability to establish standing. To rebut the intervenors’ standing argument, the groups alleged a number of economic, aesthetic, and recreational injuries, among others, resulting from EPA’s approval of Louisiana’s primacy application.

However, the Fifth Circuit found that the groups’ alleged injuries associated with the grant of primacy to the State of Louisiana for permitting Class VI wells were too hypothetical and rested on a “highly attenuated chain of possibilities.” The groups’ expenditures to oppose the Class VI buildout, the chance that EPA’s approval of the Louisiana program would increase energy costs to consumers, and the potential injuries of group members should a Class VI well be permitted and experience some mishap were all held to be too speculative to establish the standing required to challenge EPA’s grant of primacy. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the groups’ petition for review for a failure to demonstrate standing.

This decision, of course, does not foreclose the ability of a citizen or group to challenge an individual Class VI permit given the right set of facts to establish standing in that particular case.

NuScale Power two years ago formed a research partnership with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory on economically and technically assessing its SMRs’ ability to provide cost-effective steam heat augmentation.
In fact, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a $900 million funding solicitation for Gen III+ SMR nuclear startups.","The opening of the latest NuScale E2 Center follows a series of positive moves for the SMR industry as a whole. Those steps forward include last month’s U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval of NuScale’s 77-MW US460 SMR reactor design, partially based on the company’s US600 approved two years ago by the NRC.

The NRC also has recently agreed to review construction permits for SMR projects involving Dow and X-energy, as well as a separate application by the Tennessee Valley Authority. Nuclear energy offers baseload, high-capacity factor and carbon-free power as the nation’s looks to meet a future challenge of exponential data center and electrification load growth.

Virginia is home to several conventional nuclear power plants. It’s also holds more data centers per area than any state in the U.S.

""With this investment alongside world-class higher-education partners at George Mason and cutting-edge industry leaders at NuScale, we're ensuring Virginia has the energy to power our thriving economy and the expertise to continue leading the nation in innovation, education, and opportunity.""

With the opening of the George Mason E2 Center, NuScale now has E2 facilities at 11 schools or research sites worldwide. The others are at Idaho State University, Ohio State, Oregon State, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Texas A&M, Nevada-Los Vegas, South Carolina State, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Ghana Atomic Energy Commission and Seoul National University in South Korea.

“The opening of NuScale’s E2 Center at George Mason reinforces our mission to drive innovation in nuclear energy and inspire the next generation of leaders,” said John Hopkins, NuScale President and CEO. “Together, we are shaping a skilled nuclear-ready workforce and fostering a more informed public, providing a strong foundation for the future of clean, reliable energy in Virginia and around the world.”

The NRC approval for NuScale’s 77-MW US 460 is only a preliminary safety approval. SMR developers would still have to seek construction permit approvals to move forward with physical projects.

“The US460 design continues to use natural 'passive' processes such as convection and gravity in its operating systems and safety features,” reads the NRC official release about the design approval. “The US460’s six modules, producing a total of approximately 460 megawatts of electricity, are all partially immersed in a safety-related pool built below ground level.”

Many industrial product manufacturers and data center companies see SMR nuclear as path forward for both resilient and sustainable power in the coming decades. Tech firms which have sought SMR or conventional nuclear partnerships include Microsoft, Meta, Google, Oracle and Amazon Web Services.

NuScale Power two years ago formed a research partnership with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory on economically and technically assessing its SMRs’ ability to provide cost-effective steam heat augmentation.

The path to commercialization for NuScale’s SMR design hit a costly and potentially devastating roadblock nearly two years ago when it and partner Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems mutually agreed to terminate the so-called Carbon Free Power Project. The CFPP was going to be an SMR plant built in Idaho, pegged as the first commercially operational facility, but it was killed because not enough customers would sign on to make the multi-billion projects financially viable.

Since then, however, SMR nuclear’s momentum has revived with successful research collaborations for X-energy, Natura Resources, Aalo Atomic, Oklo and others.

In fact, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a $900 million funding solicitation for Gen III+ SMR nuclear startups. The program was a rare Biden-era initiative reissued by the Trump DOE to promote new nuclear capacity for the future.

No SMR projects have yet been built in the U.S. Work on similar reactors is moving forward in Canada, Russia and China.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/06/6841e9835b07b7fd413c734f-nuscale_e2_center_at_george_mason.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-06-06 08:26:25.035906

AUSTIN, Texas — Today, three prominent state-based environmental organizations offered their assessment of the 89th Texas Legislature, which concluded on Monday, regarding environmental issues. The organizations highlighted advancements in energy, renewable investments, building codes, water management, wildfire response, and other key areas.

Still, the groups warned against viewing this year’s session as a sea change for a state legislature that is too often on the side of corporate profits at the expense of the environment. For example, misinformation about renewable energy sources persisted, and too little was done about air quality; lawmakers were also willing to hand even more power to the world’s richest man.

Key wins for the environment include:

Clean Energy: SB 819, SB 388, SB 715, and other anti-renewable energy bills that would have imposed costly fees and discriminatory requirements on clean energy producers all failed. Meanwhile, it’ll be easier and cheaper for Texans to install solar panels and home batteries thanks to SB 1202, which streamlines the permitting process for backup power.

Wildfire prevention: The legislature passed a package of bills that includes HB 143 and HB 144 in response to the February 2024 Panhandle Wildfires, the worst in the state’s history

Protecting urban transit, including Austin’s Project Connect and Dallas Area Rapid Transit, and bike infrastructure investments from harmful state interference.

Enacting the “Right to Repair” law (HB 2963): Gives Texans more freedom to fix their electronics and appliances and reduce waste.

Improved Energy Codes for New Construction: SB 783 allows the State Energy Conservation Organization to move forward with rulemaking to update the minimum state energy codes for new residential and commercial construction, as well as high-performance energy and water conservation codes for public universities and state agencies.

Energy Waste Advisory Committee: HB 5323 requires eight Texas state agencies that deal with the “demand-side” of energy to collaborate, design programs to help make our Texas grid more reliable, and report back to the Legislature on ways to optimize energy savings and demand reduction programs.

Leaky Pipe Water Audits and Action Plans for Major Cities: HB 29 requires the six largest public utilities to conduct additional water audits, comparing them against a threshold set by the TWDB for water loss, and design mitigation plans to conserve water.

Decreased impact fees for water conservation and higher efficiency programs: SB 1253 requires cities to lower water and wastewater impact fees if new developments install water conservation or high-efficiency appliances that go beyond required codes, providing an incentive to use less water.

Better transparency and protection of consumer costs from new electricity demand (large loads): SB 6 addresses large loads interconnecting to the grid, requires interconnection standards and new demand management tools, and necessitates a review of how transmission costs are allocated to consumers.

Major investment in water infrastructure: While somewhat of a mixed result, SB 7 and HJR 7, combined with money from the “supplemental” budget bill, will set aside $2.5 billion for new water infrastructure over the next two years, and another $1 billion per year if voters approve the constitutional amendment. While the original versions of the bills could have set aside up to 80% for ‘new water supply” like conveyance systems, produced water, or marine desalination, the final versions include 50% for new water supply and projects funded by SWIFT, a program which includes water reuse and water conservation, lessening the impact of potentially dangerous projects.

The legislature also failed to take significant positive steps or passed harmful bills in the following areas:

SpaceX Giveaway: Despite stopping multiple versions of bills that would have allowed SpaceX and its new city of Starbase to proceed, a coalition of stakeholders opposed, the Legislature snuck an amendment into the Conference Committee Report of HB 5246 at the 11th hour that allows a new Space Commission working with Starbase to close the highway and beach. The legislature also added $300 million for grants to Space companies.

Water Quality Issues and Protections for Bays and Estuaries: Bills intended to address plastics, highly saline brine, and PFAS, which directly impact our most precious resources, including our bays and estuaries, had hearings but never even made it out of committee, as powerful industrial interests opposed them.

Concrete batch plants: Legislation to protect Texans from the fine particulate matter generated by these facilities stalled

Liability protection for oil and gas companies: HB 45 provides broad liability protection for oil and gas producers of “produced” water, wastewater that results from the hydraulic fracturing process. While the bill improved slightly during the process, it still ultimately could leave Texans and the state holding the bag if pollution results from the treatment and discharge of produced waters.

Nuclear energy: The legislature approved bills that will hand $350 million to developers of unproven small modular reactors in a costly, time-consuming bid to address rising energy demand. They also added $120 million to one company through a budget rider, bringing the total handout to $470 million.

Energy Efficiency and Building Codes: Despite a few positive bills making it to the Governor’s Desk, a myriad of other good bills passed one chamber but never made it to the floor of the other, including Energy Savings Goals (SB 2994), Low-Income Payment Assistance (HB 1359), Raising Overall Minimum Building Codes (HB 871), Energy Use Reporting and Planning for Major Cities, Universities and State Agencies (HB 3732), Energy Efficiency Grants through the Texas Energy Fund (HB 5623), and the Energy Efficiency Council (HB 3826).

And the legislature also considered harmful legislation that stalled, including:

Bad preemption bills that would have undermined city action on health, safety and environmental progress, including HB 4313 and HB 4314 by Cecil Bell, and SB 2858 and SB 3016 by Creighton.

A bad constitutional amendment (HJR 138) that would have prevented Texas from implementing a climate fee and dividend or carbon tax.

The groups issued the following statements about the 89th legislative session:

“It was encouraging to see some of the worst legislation stall out or face opposition so overwhelming that it made passage much more difficult,” said Adrian Shelley, Texas director of Public Citizen. “This legislature is not, by any means, prioritizing air quality, a just transition to wind and solar energy, or accountability for corporate polluters.”

“Every session, our first goal is simple: stop any backsliding on environmental progress,” said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. “This year, we not only fended off a wave of anti-renewable energy and anti-transit bills—we also helped win meaningful progress on clean energy, water, and conservation.”",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:32:18.251321

The Energy Choice Act protects market competition, preserves consumer choice, and promotes energy affordability and reliability.
The Energy Choice Act will provide certainty, security, and assurance for much-needed permitting reform and energy infrastructure development.
The Energy Choice Act limits states’ permitting requirements and promotes a more resilient energy infrastructure.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, Congressman Nick Langworthy (NY-23) and Senator Jim Justice (R-WV) introduced the bipartisan, bicameral H.R. 3699, the Energy Choice Act(link is external)toprohibit states or local governments from banning an energy service's connection, reconnection, modification, installation, or expansion based on the type or source of energy to be delivered. Congressman Langworthy, who serves as a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and as a member of the Energy and Environment subcommittees, has made protecting Americans’ energy choices a top priority.

“Governor Hochul and Democrats in Albany have waged an extremist crusade against natural gas that’s sent home energy costs through the roof, crippled our energy supply, and left New York teetering on the edge of an energy crisis—all to satisfy the radical fantasies of the far-left climate cult. New York has been ground zero for the Green New Deal, where common sense goes to die and working families get stuck with the bill,”said Congressman Langworthy.“That’s why I’ve introduced the Energy Choice Act—to slam the brakes on these reckless, ideological mandates and restore sanity to America’s energy policy. People deserve the freedom to choose energy that is affordable, reliable, and proven—not be forced into rolling blackouts to please eco-activists who don’t live in the real world. I thank Senator Justice for introducing this bill in the Senate and urge its swift action.”

“I am an energy guy from an energy-rich state. I know how important freedom of energy production is - which is why I’m proud to introduce Energy Choice Act of 2025. President Trump has stated the need to unleash American energy, and this bill helps facilitate just that. We have too great an energy crisis in this country, and we don’t have the luxury of picking the winners and losers when it comes to energy production. Americans ought to have the right to choose what is best for their energy needs,” said Senator Jim Justice.

The full text of the bill can be found here(link is external). Original cosponsors of this legislation include Representatives Michael Baumgartner (R-WA), Jack Bergman (R-MI), Mike Bost (R-IL), Robert Bresnahan Jr. (R-MI), Ken Calvert (R-CA), Mike Carey (R-OH), Jeff Crank (R-CO), Chuck Edwards (R-NC), Jake Ellzey (R-TX), Brad Finstad (R-MN), Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Lance Gooden (R-TX), Pat Harrigan (R-NC), Clay Higgins (R-LA), Jeff Hurd (R-CO), Darin LaHood (R-IL), Michael Lawler (R-NY), Ryan Mackenzie (R-PA), Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), Tracey Mann (R-KS), Tom McClintock (R-CA), Addison McDowell (R-NC), Mark Messmer (R-IN), Dan Meuser (R-PA), John Moolenaar (R-MI), Tim Moore (R-NC), Dan Newhouse (R-WA), August Pfluger (R-TX), John Rose (R-TX), Michael Rulli (R-OH), Jefferson Shreve (R-IN), Elise Stefanik (R-NY), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), GT Thompson (R-PA), David Valadao (R-CA), Beth Van Duyne (R-TX), Tony Wied (R-WI), Roger Williams (R-TX), Ryan Zinke (R-MT).

Original cosponsors in the Senate include Senators Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV).

“Democratic-controlled states like New York are waging an all-out attack on domestic energy production, undermining Americans' right to choose their preferred energy source. The Energy Choice Act combats these authoritarian regulations by preventing state and local governments from banning specific energy sources. To achieve true energy independence, we must ensure Americans have access to a full range of options, including natural gas,""said Congresswoman Tenney.

“Montanans know the value of reliable, affordable energy, especially during winters when access to natural gas, coal, and other traditional fuels isn’t just a convenience, it’s a necessity,” said Congressman Zinke. “Heavy handed policies from places like Albany and Sacramento don’t reflect the realities of rural America, where energy diversity is vital. The Energy Choice Act is common sense legislation that defends our right to choose the energy sources that work best for our homes and businesses, and I am happy to co-sponsor it again.”

“In order to achieve American energy dominance, we must utilize an all-of-the-above energy strategy that prioritizes affordability and reliability. By prohibiting states and local governments from banning a service based on the source of the energy, we can ensure that families and small businesses are not being forced to utilize more costly energy sources. I thank Rep. Langworthy for his leadership as we work to make energy more affordable and reliable for our constituents,” said Congressman Newhouse.

“Energy freedom is essential to both our economy and national security,” said Congressman Mike Rulli. “Efforts by state governments to ban natural gas and other traditional energy sources not only hurt working families through higher costs but also jeopardize grid reliability - especially in regions with harsh winters like ours. I’m proud to support the Energy Choice Act and thank Congressman Langworthy for putting consumers first and ensuring that no American is forced into an energy system that doesn’t work for them or their community.”

“Strengthening America’s energy independence requires an all-of-the-above energy strategy that ensures consumer demand and industry experts, not bureaucrats and extreme environmentalists, lead the expansion and delivery of energy services. Banning certain types of energy, like California and New York have tried to do, only raises prices for Americans,” said Congressman Chuck Edwards (NC-11). “The Energy Choice Act will safeguard the diversification of energy sources in our nation and make sure that Americans have access to reliable and affordable energy.”

At a time when families are recovering from record high inflation, the last thing we need are misguided state and local policies that eliminate affordable heating options. The Energy Choice Act protects market competition, preserves consumer choice, and promotes energy affordability and reliability. We urge Congress to pass this common-sense legislation without delay.”

“NAHB commends Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-N.Y.) for championing the Energy Choice Act, legislation that prohibits state and local governments from banning or limiting access to natural gas, electricity, and other energy sources. A gas ban would exacerbate the housing affordability crisis by increasing costs on new homes and placing added stress on the nation’s electrical grid. With more than 40 million U.S. households relying on natural gas for heating, cooking, and hot water, preserving access to this affordable and reliable energy source is vital for American families,”said Buddy Hughes, Chairman, National Association of Home Builders.

“On behalf of millions of AFP’s grassroots activists across the country, we applaud Rep. Nick Langworthy for introducing the Energy Choice Act to ensure energy freedom throughout the United States. Regardless of where Americans live, they shouldn’t be forced to endure energy poverty. The Energy Choice Act will provide certainty, security, and assurance for much-needed permitting reform and energy infrastructure development. Rep. Langworthy’s legislation will ensure American dominance in energy and lower costs for consumers while embracing an “all-of-the-above” approach on the federal level,” said Brent Gardner, Chief Government Affairs Officer, Americans for Prosperity.

“The Energy Choice Act represents a critical step in protecting consumer access to clean, affordable, and reliable energy sources like propane,”said Stephen Kaminski, President and CEO of the National Propane Gas Association. “NPGA commends Rep. Langworthy and Sen. Justice for their leadership in introducing this legislation to defend energy diversity and empowering Americans to choose the energy solutions that best meet their needs. This bill safeguards consumers from rising energy costs driven by overreaching government mandates.”

“The American Public Gas Association (APGA) strongly supports Representative Langworthy’s Energy Choice Act. This important legislation will safeguard American consumers’ right to choose the energy that best meets their household and budget needs. Access to affordable, reliable, and efficient natural gas is essential to the success of American families, businesses, and communities. APGA applauds the bill’s sponsors for their leadership in protecting consumer choice and promoting energy affordability,” said Dave Schryver, President & CEO, APGA.

“The refusal of certain state and local governments to consider policies that provide a more sustainable transition to a less carbon-intensive future, coupled with the economic burdens placed on the American people through restrictions or bans on fossil fuel heating sources, necessitates federal preemption to ensure homeowners can continue to afford living in their homes while having robust options for maintaining home comfort. The Energy Choice Act provides that recourse and PHCC supports its immediate passage,” said Dan Callies, President, Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors, National Association.

“Passage of this important legislation is a no brainer. We encourage House lawmakers to pass the bill immediately to restore consumer choice and support small business energy marketers across the country,”said Rob Underwood, Energy Marketers of America President.

“At a time when no New Yorker is immune to statewide affordability challenges, having the freedom to choose energy solutions that work best for their homes, businesses, and communities is critical to keeping costs manageable for everyday people. The Energy Choice Act ensures we are taking an all-of-the-above approach to meeting energy needs — opening opportunities to tap into existing solutions like biofuels that advance clean energy goals, while also fostering continued innovation to build a more secure, affordable energy future. We support this commonsense legislation, thank Congressman Langworthy for his leadership, and urge House lawmakers to pass the Energy Choice Act to deliver real energy solutions for all Americans and support the small business energy marketers who help power our communities,”said Kris DeLair, Executive Director of the Empire State Energy Association.

“GPA Midstream appreciates Representative Langworthy taking action to introduce legislation to protect consumer choice. New Yorkers and all Americans deserve the right to choose the energy source, such as natural gas or propane, that is reliable and best fits their budget needs,”said Stuart Saulters, VP of Federal Affairs, GPA Midstream Association.

""Americans deserve reliable, affordable energy without bureaucratic roadblocks or special interests getting in the way. This bill protects consumer choice and energy innovation by ensuring that no state or local government can block access to energy sources based on political agendas or bad politics. This bipartisan bill is a common-sense step toward securing our energy future, protecting American energy jobs, and most importantly protecting the pockets of working class Americans who should not have to pay more for energy. The LIBRE Initiative is grateful for Rep. Langworthy’s leadership on this important issue,” said Helder Toste, Government Affairs Liaison, The LIBRE Initiative

""Concerned Veterans for America wholeheartedly endorses Rep. Nick Langworthy’s Energy Choice Act on behalf of the members of our country’s largest veteran-led grassroots advocacy organization. This bill will ensure energy freedom in every state and protect hardworking citizens from high energy costs created by special interests at the state level. Veterans served so that Americans are free to benefit from our nation’s ingenuity and natural abundance, and are free to live their unique American Dreams.

The Energy Choice Act limits states’ permitting requirements and promotes a more resilient energy infrastructure. Rep. Langworthy’s legislation will ensure continued American domestic energy availability and lower costs for consumers while embracing a free market approach to energy development across the country,” said John Vick, Executive Director, Concerned Veterans for America.",https://langworthy.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-06 08:34:57.289945

“Nearly all the growth in coal investments in 2024 came from China and India to meet domestic demand,” according to the report.
Capital flows to all energy industries are set to rise 2% to $3.3 trillion this year, compared with 2024, the IEA report said.
“Investment in grids is struggling to keep pace with the rise in power demand and renewables deployment,” the IEA report said.
Spending on solar, both utility-scale and rooftop, is expected to reach $450 billion in 2025, making it the largest single recipient of the world’s energy investments.","China and India have approved the construction of the largest capacity of new coal-fired power plants in a decade, as the world’s two most populous nations seek to bolster energy security, according to the International Energy Agency.

China gave the green light to almost 100 gigawatts of new coal-fired plants in 2024, and India a further 15 gigawatts, pushing global approvals to their highest level since 2015, the Paris-based agency said.

“The capacity in coal is increasing,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in an interview as the agency published its annual World Energy Investment report. “But we also see that the capacity utilization rate in China is lower than in previous years, they are mainly using this when there are major challenges to meet the electricity demand.”

Investments in coal supply continue to tick upward with another 4% increase expected in 2025, a slight slowdown compared with the 6% annual average growth seen over the last five years, the IEA said. “Nearly all the growth in coal investments in 2024 came from China and India to meet domestic demand,” according to the report.

Trends in coal and other carbon-intensive sources may not be conducive to meeting global climate targets, but global investments in clean energy are set to be twice as much as spending on fossil fuels in 2025 for the second year in a row.

Capital flows to all energy industries are set to rise 2% to $3.3 trillion this year, compared with 2024, the IEA report said. This includes $2.2 trillion going to renewables, nuclear, power grids, storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency and electrification — twice as much as the $1.1 trillion going to oil, natural gas and coal.

Investments in electricity are set to reach $1.5 trillion in 2025, about 50% higher than the amount being spent on bringing oil, natural gas and coal to market. This trend is being shaped by the rapid rise in electricity demand for industry, cooling, electric mobility, data centers and artificial intelligence.

“Investment in grids is struggling to keep pace with the rise in power demand and renewables deployment,” the IEA report said.

Spending on solar, both utility-scale and rooftop, is expected to reach $450 billion in 2025, making it the largest single recipient of the world’s energy investments.

The bill provides critical clarification to ensure that both geothermal energy generation and geothermal-based energy storage are eligible for funding under the Texas Energy Fund (TEF)—a key financing mechanism for dispatchable electricity infrastructure. The TEF statute has long supported dispatchable generation projects but excluded “electric energy storage facilities” from eligibility. This created uncertainty around how geothermal technologies—which can both generate power and store thermal energy—fit into the framework.

SB 1762 directly addresses two key points:

- Geothermal energy qualifies as dispatchable under TEF guidelines, as it can reliably supply electricity on demand.

- Geothermal storage is distinct from battery storage and therefore is not excluded from eligibility.

These clarifications resolve prior ambiguity and ensure geothermal projects are fully recognized under the TEF program. Particularly, SB 1762 also amends the Texas Natural Resources Code to define geothermal energy conservation wells as “wells used for the retention of energy that may be used to provide a dispatchable generation of electricity for the power grid.” This is the commonsense conclusion the geothermal industry was hoping to clarify—geothermal power will be treated as a fully dispatchable energy resource under Texas law, including when used for storage.

Additionally, this classification places geothermal wells within the scope of the Texas Utilities Code provisions that require electricity generators to be dispatchable during periods of low grid reserves. For developers, this means geothermal projects must meet certain operational standards for grid reliability, requirements that geothermal energy is naturally suited to fulfill. While this may modestly raise compliance obligations, it also streamlines project approval, reinforces the resource’s value as a firm generation asset, and aligns geothermal development with the state’s broader reliability and grid stability objectives.

With statutory language now supporting both geothermal generation and storage, developers are in a stronger position to pursue TEF support and navigate regulatory requirements with greater certainty. While the loan application window under the TEF closed in July 2024, the completion bonus program remains active, offering:

- $120,000 per MW for projects interconnected before June 1, 2026; and

- $80,000 per MW for projects interconnected between June 1, 2026, and June 1, 2029.

As grid reliability becomes a higher legislative and regulatory priority, geothermal’s inclusion under the TEF positions it as a pivotal zero-carbon, dispatchable energy resource for Texas’ future.

SB 1762 is currently awaiting Governor Abbott’s signature, which is expected.

HB 4370: Geothermal Facilities Can Now Be Considered Public Improvement Projects.

House Bill 4370 amends the Texas Local Government Code to designate geothermal water conveyance facilities as Public Improvement Projects. This important classification opens the door for cities, water districts and local special-purpose districts to develop, operate and maintain geothermal infrastructure, and, more critically, to finance such projects through public bonds.

By granting geothermal facilities the same status as traditional public infrastructure, HB 4370 enables expanded public-private partnerships and provides new mechanisms for local governments to invest in geothermal energy systems, including thermal energy networks (TENs). These changes lay the foundation for a broader market for geothermal development in Texas, encouraging new investment in clean, dispatchable energy resources.

The legislation positions local communities to play a more active role in the state’s growing geothermal sector by giving them tools to plan, fund and manage geothermal projects at scale.

HB 4370 is currently awaiting Gov. Abbott’s signature, which is expected.

SB 879: Regulatory Relief for Closed-Loop Geothermal Projects

SB 879 delivers targeted regulatory relief for closed-loop geothermal systems, helping reduce development costs and simplifying permitting. The bill removes several oversight and fee requirements that previously applied to geothermal injection wells, further supporting geothermal’s role as a firm, dispatchable energy source in Texas.

Particularly, under SB 879, closed-loop geothermal wells are now exempt from certain Texas Railroad Commission regulations, reflecting their lower environmental and operational risk. In addition, reporting requirements for geothermal injection wells have been reduced, and injection well application fees have been eliminated.

These regulatory updates lower administrative and financial hurdles for developers, helping accelerate deployment of geothermal systems that provide reliable, dispatchable electricity. By easing the burden on closed-loop technologies, Texas continues to position itself as a leader in geothermal innovation and grid resilience.

SB 879 has been signed into law by Gov. Abbott and becomes effective September 1, 2025.

Taken together, these bills reflect a growing bipartisan commitment to unlocking Texas’s geothermal potential by lowering barriers to development, expanding financing tools, and clarifying regulatory treatment. With geothermal now formally recognized as a dispatchable energy source eligible for TEF incentives, and local governments empowered to treat geothermal infrastructure as public works, the stage is set for broader deployment of this clean, firm power source. While larger structural reforms remain on the horizon, the 2025 session delivered meaningful progress—offering developers greater certainty and signaling to investors that geothermal has a firm foothold in Texas’s evolving energy mix.",https://www.pillsburylaw.com/a/web/w3WwvjtoSP3zPZbw9BEDSF/arkWur/w3WwvjtoSP3zPZbw9BEDSF.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:32:20.983008

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A coalition of nearly 250 companies and business and labor groups on Thursday urged top U.S. Republican senators to preserve a credit for the emerging hydrogen fuel industry as they hash out President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill.

Oil and gas lobbying group the American Petroleum Institute, a local unit of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and DuPont urged Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senator Mike Crapo to extend the construction deadline to December 31, 2029 for hydrogen projects to receive a tax break.

The Senate is debating its version of the bill after the House of Representatives terminated the so-called 45V credit for any project which begins construction after the last day of 2025.

""If this course of action is adopted by the Senate, it will drive tens of billions of dollars in planned private sector investments out of the United States and into other countries,"" the groups said in a letter to the senators, dated June 5. ""Failing to act now by preserving 45V means ceding the future of hydrogen to China.""

The Business Council for Sustainable Energy and the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative also signed the letter.

House Republicans slashed the credits which had been included the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate legislation signed by former President Joe Biden, a Democrat. Under the IRA, hydrogen producers got tax credits for projects that began construction before 2033.

Industry analysts say clean hydrogen, or hydrogen produced from non-fossil energy sources, or natural gas paired with technology to capture carbon emissions and store them underground, is needed to decarbonize heavy industry and some vehicles.

The letter said clarity from lawmakers would spur tens of billions of dollars in private capital, boost domestic manufacturing, and create long-term employment in construction, operations, and technology.

Secret agreements Our research, reviewing nearly 50 public utility commission proceedings about data centers’ power needs across 10 states, uncovered dozens of secretive contracts between utilities and data centers.

Data center energy costs can also be shifted when data centers connect directly to existing power plants.","In the race to develop artificial intelligence, large technology companies such as Google and Meta are trying to secure massive amounts of electricity to power new data centers. Electric utilities see the prospect of earning large profits by providing electricity to these power-hungry facilities and are competing for their business by offering discounts not available to average consumers.

In our paper Extracting Profits from the Public, we explain how utilities are forcing regular ratepayers to pay for the discounts enjoyed by some of the nation’s largest companies and identify ways policymakers can limit the costs to the public.

Shifting costs

In much of the U.S., utilities are monopolists. Within their service territories, they are the only companies allowed to deliver electricity to consumers. To fund their operations, utilities split the costs of maintaining and expanding their systems among all ratepayers – homeowners, businesses, warehouses, factories and anyone else who uses electricity.

Historically, a utility expanded its system to meet growing demand for electricity from new factories, businesses and homes. To pay for its expansion − new power plants, new transmission lines and other equipment − the utility would propose to raise electricity rates by different amounts for various types of consumers.

Public utility commissions are state agencies charged with ensuring that the public gets a fair deal. These commissions monitor how much money the utility spends to provide electric service and how its costs are shared among various types of ratepayers, including residential, commercial and industrial consumers. Ultimately, the public utility commission is supposed to approve any rate increases based on its assessment of what’s fair to consumers.

Splitting the utility’s costs among all consumers made perfect sense when population growth and economic development across the economy stimulated the need for new infrastructure. But today, in many utility service territories, most of the projected growth in electricity demand is due to new data centers.

Here’s the problem for consumers: To meet data center demand, utilities are building new power plants and power lines that are needed only because of data center growth. If state regulators allow utilities to follow the standard approach of splitting the costs of new infrastructure among all consumers, the public will end up paying to supply data centers with all that power.

A big price tag

One particularly acute example is in Louisiana. A Meta data center under development in the northeastern corner of the state is projected to use, by our calculations, twice as much energy as the city of New Orleans.

Entergy, the regional monopoly utility, is proposing to build more than US$3 billion worth of new gas-fired power plants and delivery infrastructure to meet the data center’s energy demand. Rather than billing Meta directly for these costs, Entergy is proposing to include the costs in rates paid by all customers.

Entergy claims its contract with Meta will cover some portion of the $3 billion price tag and that will mitigate any increases in consumers’ bills. But Entergy has asked state regulators to keep key terms of the contract secret, and only a redacted version of its application is available online.

The public has no idea how much it might pay if the commission approves the contract. And if the Meta data center ends up using much less power than the company anticipates, the public does not know whether it would be on the hook to pay higher electricity rates for longer periods to guarantee Entergy a profit.

Secret agreements

Our research, reviewing nearly 50 public utility commission proceedings about data centers’ power needs across 10 states, uncovered dozens of secretive contracts between utilities and data centers. Unlike Louisiana, most states require utilities to submit to the public utility commission their one-off deals with data centers, but they allow utilities to conceal the pricing terms from the public.

In normal rate-review cases, numerous parties advocate for their interests in a public proceeding, including members of the public, industry groups and the utility itself. But as our paper finds, utility commission reviews of data center contracts are based on confidential utility filings that are inaccessible to the general public. Few, if any, outsiders participate, and as a result the commission often hears only the utility’s version of the deal.

Because the pricing terms are secret, it is impossible to know whether the deal that a utility is offering to a data center is too low to cover the utility’s costs of providing power to the data center, which would mean that the public is subsidizing the deal. History shows, however, that utilities have a long history of exploiting their monopolies to shift costs to the public, including through secret contracts.

Other public costs

Our paper also explores other ways that the public pays for data center energy costs. For instance, many high-voltage interstate transmission projects, which connect large power plants to local delivery systems, are developed through regional planning processes run by numerous utilities. These alliances have complex rules for splitting the costs of new transmission lines and equipment among their utility members.

Once a utility is charged its share, it spreads the costs of new transmission projects among its local ratepayers. Because some regions are building new transmission capacity to accommodate data centers, our analysis finds that the public has been forced to pay billions of dollars for data center growth.

Data center energy costs can also be shifted when data centers connect directly to existing power plants. Under what are called “co-location” deals, the power plant stops selling energy to the wider public and just sells to the data center. With less supply in the overall market, prices go up and the public faces higher bills as a result.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/671379/original/file-20250530-56-5o928q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C505%2C6058%2C3029&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-06 08:26:32.951391

Curtis Tate spoke with Sean Gallagher, vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association, about the economic consequences of the House bill, statewide and nationwide.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tate: What does the House reconciliation bill put at risk?

Gallagher: We’re in an era where we have increasing energy demand, and solar power and energy storage powered by solar is the resource that’s available on the timeline that we need it to meet the rising energy demand from things like data centers and new manufacturing facilities. By putting the brakes on solar energy installations, the House bill poses a real threat to America’s energy future, to our country’s economic stability and to our global competitiveness, and frankly, it threatens to sort of throw the whole AI race to China, the very opposite of what I think the president wants to accomplish.

Tate: The Trump administration is pushing to keep older coal and gas power plants in operation longer. Will that be enough?

Gallagher: I do think we may see some more of that sort of thing with older power plants being asked to stay online longer. But that’s not going to be sufficient to meet the increased energy demand we need to meet that increased energy demand to power the data centers that are going to enable the artificial intelligence that’s coming quickly. Those new sources of energy, as you note, are broadly speaking, going to be solar power and storage. Natural gas turbines simply aren’t available in sufficient quantity in the timeline that’s required. New nuclear, new advanced geothermal are coming along, probably in the 2030s, but on the order of 75% of the power that’s available to be put online in the next five years is solar and energy storage.

Tate: What’s the jobs impact?

Gallagher: We’d lose about 330,000 solar jobs by 2028 including about 94,000 manufacturing jobs. There’s about 900 or close to 1,000 solar jobs lost in West Virginia by 2030. We’ve seen in the last three years a renaissance in solar and energy storage manufacturing here in the United States, largely in Republican districts and in Republican-led states. And we could see as many as 330 factories close down or factories that are in the planning and construction stages now never open. So that would be a real loss for those communities.

Tate: Would this affect homeowners who’d like to install rooftop solar as well?

Gallagher: 100%. The bill, as passed, would basically terminate the availability of the residential tax credit at the end of this year, and that would dramatically reduce the economics of rooftop solar for homeowners and lead to devastating losses in that sector, and also to reduce the ability of homeowners to control their energy bills, and to contribute to grid stability and reliability. It would also result in very large increases in energy prices to consumers across the country if the bill were to be enacted as it’s currently written, because, among other things, it would reduce the amount of power that comes online. And when supply fails to keep up with demand, prices go up. That’s economics 101.

If the Republican-dominated House of Representatives has its way, the Inflation Reduction Act will die a slow and impactful death. Cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act will take the wind out of the Biden–Harris administration’s clean energy plans, as popular programs like incentives for solar panels and electric vehicles will be eliminated.

Some — but not all — Senators are eager to fully repeal the IRA, because to do so would reportedly reduce the GDP by $1.1 trillion. It would also please the self-anointed King of the United States, who is tied to Big Oil and the financial endorsements of oil companies and oil billionaires.

There are a number of consequences to canceling the Act: slowing the transition to a less polluted nation, killing investments in factories and reducing future investments, reducing current and future green jobs, and raising consumer energy bills will be by-products of the IRA’s loss.

Cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act will diminish many current investments in manufacturing, and a lot of those investments have been located in red states where labor and land costs tend to be cheaper. The amount of total investments has been substantial: $321 billion in new private investment across 2,369 domestic clean-energy facilities, representing 4.7% of all US private investment in the first quarter of 2025. An additional $522 billion of outstanding investment is in jeopardy: 2,217 facilities, with 680,000 operational and construction jobs.

The Rhodium Group outlines how an “often-stated goal of these changes is to bring costs down for American households. We find that repealing the energy tax credits has the opposite effect, increasing household energy costs by $95-290 in 2035—a 2-7% increase in costs that year.”

Jobs and investment: The IRA has sparked more than 400,000 new jobs and $600 billion of private investment in clean energy. Repealing it, says Energy Innovation, will force consumers to pay more for energy and will cost US jobs. Doing so will:

increase cumulative household energy costs by $32 billion from 2025–2035;

cost America nearly 790,000 jobs in 2030 and more than 700,000 jobs in 2035;

decrease GDP more than $160 billion in 2030 and nearly $190 billion in 2035; and,

increase climate pollution by more than 530 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2035, equal to adding 116 million cars to the road.

Households and clean energy: The Residential Clean Energy Credit currently gives households a federal tax break worth 30% of the price of installing solar panels, batteries, geothermal heat pumps, and other energy-producing and energy-saving systems. Its value is uncapped, but in 2023, the more than 1.2 million US families who claimed the credit received an average of roughly $5,000. These upgrades more than pay for themselves over the appliance’s lifetime, according to Rewiring America.

Clean energy production: Clean electricity production and investment tax credits will be eliminated as early as 2026. Moreover, highly restrictive and administratively complex limits on sourcing of components, subcomponents, and critical materials used at a facility will accompany the loss. Both red and blue states are currently struggling to meet the energy needs of their citizens.

Solar: The House bill as it is eliminates a 30% federal tax credit for residential solar systems at the end of the year. Solar array renters will see their premiums jump as companies lose their tax credit for leasing systems to homeowners. Shares of Sunrun Inc., America’s biggest rooftop-solar company, fell as much as 42% on May 22 — the most ever in intraday trading, according to Bloomberg. Equipment provider SolarEdge Technologies Inc. slid as much as 27%. NextEra Energy Inc., the biggest US developer of wind and solar projects, slid as much as 10.7%, the most since October 2023.

Heat pumps: Replacing an oil hot water heater with a high-efficiency electric heat pump through a $2,000 federal tax credit for the devices won’t be available after the end of the 2025.

Electric vehicles: The $7,500 federal tax rebate for new electric vehicle purchases no longer would have an end date of 2032 — it would end in December 2025. And there’s pain for those of us who already own an EV: the House bill adds a $250 charge to registration fees for electric vehicles and a similar $100 charge to registration of hybrid vehicles. Supposedly, this value tax assuages lost gasoline tax revenue for non-internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs).

“Notably, updates to the Inflation Reduction Act more than doubled the amount of owners who indicated they received a federal tax credit/rebate,” JD Power wrote, “and more than half of BEV buyers cited tax credits as a reason for purchasing their vehicle, which is among the most influential purchase drivers.”

Emissions: And the repercussions of cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act go deeper than just financial considerations. Emissions could increase anywhere between at least 500 million metric tons and more than a gigaton in 2035.

Carbon capture: Cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act actually will have one good consequence. Eliminating $3.7 billion in funding previously earmarked by the Department of Energy (DOE) for carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen fuels, synthetic fuels, and a variety of other industrial decarbonization technologies is the right move, albeit an accidental one.

Hope Springs Eternal that Cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act Won’t Be as Devastating

Not every Senator is hot to implement cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act. Several Republican senators seem to have questions about the phaseout of incentives, including for clean electricity.

Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), who is up for reelection next year in the purple state, was one of four Senate Republicans who signed an April letter urging a targeted approach to reforming renewable energy tax incentives rather than a wholesale repeal. The letter emphasized “the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development.” The Senators agreed that “fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code” were appropriate, they also cautioned “against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

The other signatories to the April letter were Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry Moran of Kansas, and John Curtis of Utah.

Canary Media describes the extent of clean energy in NC: “a leader in the emerging electric vehicle supply chain, with lithium mines, Toyota’s massive battery plant in Randolph County, and EV factories all in the works.” The state has over 109,000 clean energy jobs, the ninth most in the country.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that the Senate plans to write its own version of the bill. Nonetheless, renewable energy stocks are on a downward spiral, even as some Wall Street analysts concur that the final Senate bill isn’t likely to be as damaging to the industry as the House version would be.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DALL·E-2023-12-21-10.35.51-A-panoramic-metaphorical-image-showcasing-a-giant-heat-pump-massively-outweighing-a-smaller-scale-building-efficiency.-The-scene-is-set-in-a-balanced-800x457.png,N,,2025-06-06 08:31:30.348073

Reduced federal enforcement – coupled with potential cuts in EPA funding for state environmental programs, if enacted – will likely create more opportunities for these private citizen enforcement cases.
EPA's Brownfields Program would face a 50 percent cut ($12.9 million reduction from $25.7 million), with various state brownfield assistance grants being slashed or eliminated entirely.

Reduced federal enforcement may also lead to increased citizen suits and more aggressive state enforcement actions, creating different enforcement priorities and approaches in some states compared to traditional federal enforcement patterns.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) budget proposal for fiscal year (FY) 2026 fundamentally reimagines the federal government's role in environmental policy and regulation. If enacted by Congress, EPA's budget would be cut from $9.14 billion in FY 2025 to $4.16 billion in FY 2026 – a roughly 54 percent reduction without precedent in the last 50 years. EPA's workforce would be capped at 12,856 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions – the lowest staffing levels in 40 years, down from FY 2025 levels (14,130 FTE).

The proposed budget frames these changes as signaling ""a return to common sense environmental policy"" and emphasizes ""a back-to-basics approach that will lower the cost of living, remove unnecessary barriers for business and industry, empower states, and return the Agency to administering core statutory obligations as Congress intended.""

The budget proposal recognizes that states, Tribes and local governments ""are best positioned to address the unique environmental challenges facing their communities"" while concluding that ""many programs are mature or have accomplished their purpose"" with previous federal funding. The emphasis for the remaining funding shifts to Tribal capacity building with a goal of ""encouraging greater independence from federal oversight."" If enacted, the significantly reduced federal funding could present barriers for states and local governments in their budget processes and regulatory compliance efforts, particularly as they seek to build or repair critical infrastructure.

EPA's Five Priority Pillars

The budget outlines five priorities for 2026, titled as follows:

Ensure Clean Air, Land, and Water for Every American

Restore American Energy Dominance

Permitting Reform, Cooperative Federalism and Cross-Agency Partnership

Make the United States the Artificial Intelligence Capital of the World

Protecting and Bringing Back American Auto Jobs

Infrastructure and State Grant Eliminations

The budget makes dramatic cuts to programs supporting state and local environmental infrastructure, representing the largest dollar reductions. Water infrastructure funding faces cuts of nearly 90 percent: Clean Water State Revolving Fund would be cut by $1.5 billion from $1.64 billion (90.5 percent reduction), Drinking Water State Revolving Fund by $976.1 million from $1.13 billion (87 percent reduction), and Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act funding by $64.3 million from $72.3 million (89 percent reduction). All but three categorical grants to states would be eliminated entirely, with only Underground Injection Control, Tribal General Assistance Program and Tribal Air Quality Management grants left in place (and at approximately FY 2025 levels). The largest categorical grant eliminations include State and Local Air Quality Management ($235.6 million), Pollution Control Section 106 grants ($225.4 million), Nonpoint Source Section 319 grants ($174.3 million), Public Water System Supervision ($115.8 million) and Brownfields ($46.2 million), with categorical grants totaling approximately $1 billion in cuts.

Additional major program eliminations include Atmospheric Protection ($108.4 million), Resource Recovery and Hazardous Waste Grants ($101.4 million), Environmental Justice ($100 million) and the Diesel Emissions Reduction Grant Program ($90 million), among other programs totaling $557.1 million. The proposal would also cut more than $83 million from regional water quality ""geographic programs,"" with the largest reductions affecting San Francisco Bay (76 percent cut), Lake Pontchartrain (54 percent cut), Puget Sound (47 percent cut) and Lake Champlain (37 percent cut).

Air and Climate Programs

The budget proposal reflects EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin's announced intentions to significantly restructure the agency's Office of Air and Radiation by eliminating the Office of Atmospheric Protection (OAP) and Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), along with restructuring their components into two new offices: Office of State Air Partnerships and Office of Clean Air Programs. The budget proposal would result in substantial cuts in numerous air and climate programs, including several areas slated for 100 percent elimination, including State and Local Air Quality Management Categorical Grants ($235.6 million), Atmospheric Protection Program ($100 million) and Diesel Emissions Reduction Act Grant Program ($90 million), among others. Additional areas are slated for major decreases, such as the proposed 65 percent cut to air quality research (from $96 million to $33 million).

The proposed budget would increase funding for a few key priorities:

Stationary Source Deregulatory Actions. The budget highlights and indirectly opines on multiple Clean Air Act rules EPA intends to reconsider, including greenhouse gas requirements for power plants, methane rules ""throttling"" the oil and gas sector, and Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) requirements that ""improperly target"" coal-fired power plants. The administration proposes to set aside funding to support its efforts to reconsider these and other Clean Air Act rules.

State Implementation Plan (SIP) Backlog. The budget proposal sets aside funding within the Federal Support for Air Quality Management Program ""to address and resolve the backlog of SIPs,"" despite an overall $18.7 million reduction to this program. This reflects the administration's previously stated priority to clear the backlog of SIPs awaiting EPA action. Extra funding and resources devoted to this issue could help ensure that as the agency works to clear this backlog, it does so not only swiftly but in a durable and legally defensible way.

Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS). The administration also proposes to increase funding and staffing for programs aimed at reducing ODS under the Clean Air Act.

Enforcement Transformation

The budget reflects EPA's enforcement approach, with the agency stating it will ""focus[] enforcement on clear and substantial violations of the law that cause significant harm and that cannot be addressed by states."" Major cuts include a 30 percent reduction in civil enforcement (cutting $61.1 million from $201.3 million), 49 percent cut to criminal enforcement (cutting $29.6 million from $60 million), 35 percent reduction in compliance monitoring (cutting $38 million from $107.1 million) and complete elimination of enforcement funding for environmental justice purposes.

The agency states it ""will target enforcement and compliance assurance on pollution, ensuring a fair approach to environmental remediation"" and ""focus on critical national security actions"" such as illegal imports.

The proposed cuts reinforce signals of a clear federal retreat from enforcement activities. Unlike regulatory actions subject to statutory deadlines, EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) have enormous discretion regarding enforcement cases. The administration has already shifted and narrowed enforcement priorities simply by aligning them with its own directives and executive orders, regardless of congressional action on the proposed budget. However, most of the major EPA-enforced statutes also include citizen suit enforcement provisions, often allowing private actors to sue over alleged environmental violations in federal court. Reduced federal enforcement – coupled with potential cuts in EPA funding for state environmental programs, if enacted – will likely create more opportunities for these private citizen enforcement cases.

Superfund and Cleanup Programs

Congressional appropriations for the Superfund remedial program would be eliminated entirely, with the administration arguing that renewed Superfund taxes from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act can fund the program. The program would gain 45.7 new full-time positions while transitioning entirely to tax-based funding to ""conduct critical pre-construction projects, continue ongoing construction projects, and initiate new remedial work at National Priority List (NPL) sites to address contaminants including lead and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).""

EPA's Brownfields Program would face a 50 percent cut ($12.9 million reduction from $25.7 million), with various state brownfield assistance grants being slashed or eliminated entirely.

Enhanced Economic Analysis and Permitting Reform

The budget includes funding for ""a more detailed employment analysis"" of rulemakings that would account for ""regulatory job displacement, including through offshoring of production,"" focusing on electric power, oil, gas and auto manufacturing sectors. This suggests the administration is intent on not just advancing abstract legal arguments, but also building a robust economic justification to support its deregulatory agenda. Those factual considerations could prove important as courts continue to defer to agencies on discretionary, technical details even though no longer deferring to agency statutory interpretations.1

Despite overall cuts, EPA proposes $8 million for an Integrated Environmental Strategies Program to improve permitting and environmental review processes while promoting economic growth. The budget specifically calls for ""data tracking, analysis, and problem-solving to support permitting reform initiatives such as implementing a continuous improvement project to reduce the time it takes for EPA to issue Class VI well permits and standardize EPA's Class VI permitting process across regions.""

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementation would receive a 6 percent increase ($1.2 million additional funding from $19.9 million), reflecting the administration's focus on permitting reform and making environmental reviews ""faster, and more cost effectively while building capacity and improving testing on innovations.""

Next Steps

During the first Trump Administration, Congress ultimately did not support similarly focused proposed cuts to EPA's budget following advocacy from those who would be adversely impacted by them. However, even if Congress acts to reject most or all of the projected reductions in funding when it acts on the FY 2026 budget, significant staffing reductions that have already taken place and are expected to continue to progress will likely slow activities such as permit reviews, chemical and pesticide reviews and approvals and rulemaking processes. The departing staff are expected to include some of EPA's most experienced senior scientists and other personnel, representing a wide range of expertise in administering EPA programs. This expertise will be very difficult to replace.

Companies face immediate compliance considerations as regulations remain in effect even if federal enforcement thereof diminishes, and personnel reductions could lead to longer-than-expected delays in any planned regulatory repeals or adjustments. The combination of reduced federal oversight, slowed rulemaking efforts and potential increases in state-level regulations creates regulatory uncertainty since states may pursue alternative approaches or standards that don't require federal approval, potentially creating a patchwork of requirements.

Reduced federal enforcement may also lead to increased citizen suits and more aggressive state enforcement actions, creating different enforcement priorities and approaches in some states compared to traditional federal enforcement patterns.

The FY 2026 budget proposal represents a shift toward deferring to state agencies while also proposing to dramatically reduce federal support for those state agencies, all while EPA is also making significant reductions to the numbers of personnel who would typically be charged with writing new regulations and providing support in federal oversight or enforcement efforts. Companies should monitor congressional appropriations processes closely, prepare for increased state-level regulatory activity and potential citizen suit enforcement actions, and consider how voluntary compliance agreements might provide certainty in an uncertain regulatory environment.

Currently, tracking how much carbon is produced from electricity use relies on broad, outdated averages that don't reflect exactly when or where the power was used.

A new ""consumed emissions"" dashboard, launched by Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Singularity Energy, is tackling the issue of tracking energy and creating near-real-time, location-specific data on the carbon footprint of electricity usage across a 15-state region, from Louisiana to North Dakota.

The tool was developed to solve a longstanding blind spot in U.S. emissions tracking: the inability to measure the carbon intensity of electricity consumption in real time and at a granular, location-specific level.

Since 2022, MISO has shared public dashboards showing past power plant pollution, and this new consumed emissions dashboard adds updates that show how much pollution is being created and which fuels are causing it.

Greg Miller, research and policy lead at Singularity, told Canary Media, ""This may be for only one region in the U.S. But it proves it's possible to calculate this data — and other grid operators can do it too, if this data were required more broadly in accounting standards.""

The dashboard provides hour-by-hour carbon data at the state and county level, which enables utilities, companies, and regulators to see the environmental impact of power on the grid. That level of specificity matters because electricity generation is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions globally, and decarbonizing the grid requires data on major sources of emissions.

The tool helps reduce inefficiencies by providing details on power plant emissions and how electricity flows across the grid, and it can be used to prevent double-counting resources. Clarity about energy consumption ensures emissions reductions are real, not just estimates.

In previous years, the grid's inefficiencies have cost ratepayers over $20 billion. With better emissions visibility, states can plan infrastructure investments more wisely, avoid costly overbuilds of gas-fired power plants, and focus instead on low-emission solutions like solar or wind energy.

Also, as utilities reduce emissions in energy production, they also reduce pollutants produced from burning fuel that currently kill about 100,000 Americans each year.

Republicans and Democrats alike are less likely to support renewable energy than they were five years ago, according to a survey released Thursday by the Pew Research Center.

The results mirror growing pockets of opposition to solar farms, reignited political support for coal plants and moves by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to kill federally funded clean energy projects.

This shift in opinion dates back to before Democratic President Joe Biden took office, said Brian Kennedy, Pew senior researcher and one of the study’s authors. “This isn’t a new trend,” he said.

Still, Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment, was surprised.

“I see this shift … as a successful effort to link climate change and renewable energy to broader culture war issues,” Gillingham said. He added that in the past, “prominent” Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as “disloyal” to Trump.

The survey of 5,085 U.S. adults taken April 28 to May 4 revealed that while 79% of Americans favored expanding wind and solar production in 2020, that number has dropped to 60%. And 39% of Americans today support expansion of oil, coal and natural gas — almost double the 20% that supported it in 2020.

Combustion of fossil fuels — in transportation, energy generation and industrial production — is the No. 1 cause of climate change.

Much of the change in opinion is driven by Republicans, whose support of oil and gas grew from 35% in 2020 to 67% today. But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.

While many results reflect Trump’s policies opposing most renewables and boosting fossil fuels, Pew found a few notable exceptions: 69% of all respondents favor offshore wind — a technology Trump has specifically targeted.

Both Democrats and Republicans indicated stronger support for nuclear power, with Republicans’ favorable opinions increasing from 53% in 2020 to 69% in 2025. Democrats’ support rose from 37% to 52%. The Trump administration has signaled support for a nuclear renaissance, despite its high cost.

There were wide partisan splits on several topics. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would scale back environmental regulations. Pew asked whether it was possible to do that and still protect air and water quality: 77% of Republicans said yes and 67% of Democrats said no.

Pew didn’t ask the respondents why their attitudes have shifted. But Kennedy said in Pew’s past surveys, Republicans have expressed concern about the economic impacts of climate change policies and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant and electric vehicle backer, said when the environmental benefits of clean technologies are touted, it polarizes Republicans. Instead, Murphy said messages should be about pocketbook issues — like lower fuel costs — and jobs.

“It’s hard for pro-climate people to understand,” said Murphy, who has advised dozens of state and national GOP campaigns including John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid. “(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate. The key is you want to talk about jobs and national security and other events that naturally resonate a lot more with right-of-center people.”

That’s what Murphy’s groups, the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance are trying to do to depoliticize electric vehicles. “Whenever electric cars are seen through a climate lens,” Murphy said, “their appeal narrows.”

It’s a strategy also being used by the Electrification Coalition, a left-of-center pro-EV group. Ben Prochazka, the coalition’s executive director, echoed Murphy’s strategy, adding that EVs have “become overly politicized and caught in the culture wars, impacting markets and ultimately hurting our ability to realize their many benefits for all Americans.”

Prochazka noted that once introduced to EVs, consumers support them: “EV drivers love their vehicles, with more than eight out of ten reporting that their next car will also be electric.”

Perhaps those practical messages are getting through. In the Pew survey, electric vehicles were the one item that saw an uptick in support – 4 percentage points in the past year.

But popular support might not be enough to stop Congress from killing a $7,500 electric vehicle credit, which Murphy said would be “policy disaster.”

Republicans, he said, are in a “real squeeze,” because “they don’t have enough money for the tax cuts the president has promised.”

Said Murphy: “It’s easier for Republicans to cut Biden electric cars … than it is for them to cut more Medicaid.”

Gillingham is still optimistic that solar, wind and other greenhouse gas-reducing technologies will move forward — because they are the cheapest.

“The continued decline in the price of renewable energy and battery technologies, as well as other new technologies, is a reason to continue to have hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be addressed,” he said.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/offshore_wind_turbines-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:26:45.166285

Voluntary conservation practices help farmers and ranchers better steward the land and should remain in the next farm bill, Texas Farm Bureau President Russell Boening told a Congressional subcommittee this week.

“Voluntary conservation practices have become a cornerstone of modern agricultural operations,” Boening said. “Our family implements conservation practices to improve water quality, soil health and wildlife habitat while keeping our land productive. We are not unique. Farmers across Texas and the country are seizing the opportunity to utilize conservation programs.”

Boening testified Thursday, June 5, before the U.S. House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Research and Biotechnology, helping lawmakers understand how conservation efforts drive sustainability and why continued support is essential.

From planting cover crops and rotating livestock to restoring native grasses and managing water use more efficiently, farmers and ranchers are using science-based strategies to protect natural resources without sacrificing yields.

Programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program and the Regional Conservation Partnership Program have helped farmers execute these on-farm conservation practices.

But continued success, Boening said, requires Congressional support and practical improvements.

“All of these programs have become increasingly oversubscribed, with demand consistently surpassing available funding,” Boening said. “The greatest challenge for producers is gaining entry. For Texans, EQIP is of utmost importance given the 50% set aside for livestock operations.”

He urged the subcommittee to increase funding and raise payment rates so that implementing conservation practices is more financially feasible. He emphasized the need to simplify application processes and reduce paperwork burdens.

Boening also called for more flexibility in program design and expanded technical assistance, noting that many farmers struggle to access help due to agency staffing shortages.

“Farmers often express concern about the shortage of technical service providers available to assist with conservation practices, as this lack of support can delay or limit their ability to implement these programs,” Boening said.

The shortage is especially challenging in rural or underserved areas, where access to trained professionals is already limited. Boening noted expanding and better supporting the trained service professionals is essential to ensure farmers can navigate the programs and achieve conservation goals.

“We challenge members of this subcommittee to work toward reauthorizing the farm bill to ensure that farmers have access to conservation programs that promote environmental stewardship,” Boening said.",https://texasfarmbureau.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Boening-Testimony.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:32:27.108906

Excerpts from the Chairman’s Speech

Comparing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to the Inflation Reduction Act

“Let’s do a comparison and contrast with our Democrat colleagues when they had control of both chambers and the White House. They too used the tool of budget reconciliation to advance what was their partisan Democrat agenda. They spent over the last four years, under the Biden-Harris administration and Democrat control, they added $8 trillion to the national debt. They did it by expanding the federal government, offering Obamacare to people making hundreds of thousands of dollars, price-fixing in the drug markets and having premiums go up on seniors. They did it by expanding the IRS by 80,000 IRS agents and by offering tax subsidies to green energy corporations to the tune of $850 billion dollars. So, when they had the tool of budget reconciliation and unified Democrat leadership, that’s what they offered to the American people: more spending, more debt, more government and less freedom.

We have the tool and the unified Republican control of both chambers and we’re investing in border security and defense because we believe the safety and security of the American people is job number one. Providing the common defense is the first and most important job of the federal government.

Secondly, we’re spending money to allow hardworking American families to keep more of their money and to incentivize investment, growth, job creation, wage increase because we have been sputtering along because of the failed economic policies of the failed economic policies of my Democrat colleagues and the Biden-Harris administration and their unbridled reckless spending.

So, there’s your comparison. One gives you more government, with more spending and debt and the other has a completely offset [approach], with a modest reduction in deficit spending, a ten-point reduction in debt to GDP. And we have the largest tax cut, the largest spending cut, the largest investment in border and defense in the history of this country… [It’s] the most significant commitment to unlocking American energy resources in our nation’s history.”

Setting the Record Straight on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s Growth Assumption

“In defense of some of the myths and false claims that [have] propagated, [like suggestions] this bill will somehow increase the debt — [that] is totally false and is using a baseline CBO score with a growth assumption based on the policies and laws of the last four years.

I think 1.8% growth is actually generous considering the last four years and the economic policies of our Democrat colleagues. What we did was we assumed a growth rate not based on CBO or JCT or any other predictive modeling. We said the best way to predict future achievement is past performance. What did President Biden have as an annual average growth rate? What did President Trump achieve? On average, Biden was at 2.7 percent if you control for COVID. If you control for COVID, then Trump had a 2.8 percent annual average. Since World War II, the annual average has been a little over 3 percent. We picked a conservative number, but we know we’ll outperform it with good energy policies, work incentives, deregulation, America First trade, and locking [in] low taxes from TCJA. Well, that 2.6 percent annual average, that conservative growth assumption, will yield $2.5 trillion over the ten-year budget window.

If you stack the spending reforms— which by the way, are the deepest cuts by two times in our nation’s history—[and] you add the two, you totally offset the cost of border, of defense, and any cost associated with reducing taxes. So, it’s fiscally responsible. It will do the two things that you primarily need to do in order to restore the fiscal health of this country and put it on a stable path, and prevent or stave of a debt crisis of some magnitude. It grows the economy; it deals with economic growth which brings revenue to the Treasury. One percent growth over the projections of CBO is $3 trillion against the deficit and it starts to bend the curve on deficit spending.”

But on a cloudless, breezy day in April, Agmed Weber, operations manager for the Walnut Creek plant—which handles more than half of the sewage here in Texas’s booming capital city—is an enthusiastic tour guide. He marvels at the foresight of those who built the jumbo plant a half-century ago, when Austin was a third of its current size. “They were really thinking about the future,” he says. Weber feels a similar pressure—to prepare for not only continued population growth, but also a hotter future. Austin is “in a tight space where we need to think ahead,” he says.

The plant is dominated by vast outdoor pools in which microbes chew through waste until it is clean enough to return to rivers. But in one corner sit two large tanks and a series of purple pipes that route some of the treated wastewater back to the city to water lawns or flush toilets. Based on a climate study that predicts more severe droughts in Austin’s future, the city is planning, by 2050, to increase the amount of reused wastewater by more than 10 times, as part of a $1 billion expansion of the plant. “That program is going to grow exponentially,” Weber says.

Like many cities around the world, Austin is now facing questions about how to build and adapt for a changing climate. A growing number of these cities—as well as insurance companies, home builders, and farmers—are turning to climate modelers for answers. But despite decades of effort, forecasting how global warming will play out on a local scale remains a stubborn challenge, riven with uncertainty. There is little agreement on how best to convert climate models, which simulate the entire world at coarse resolutions, into the detailed local forecasts of temperature and rainfall that planners crave. Different methods lead to drastically different projections, especially in terms of rainfall—even when using the same climate model. “It really is a mess right now,” says Alex Hall, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The problem has become more pronounced with the discovery that global climate models, good at the big picture, often miss local impacts that are already painfully evident. For example, despite nailing the overall pace and intensity of global warming, models did not predict the more frequent heat waves that are plaguing Europe. In order to make local forecasts, modelers must not only do the global-to-local conversion, but also adjust for these model biases. Tiffany Shaw, a climate dynamicist at the University of Chicago, calls this “the other climate crisis.” “The cat’s going to get out of the bag, and the question will be, what value does this information have?”

While scientists fret about the limitations of their models, others are not as cautious. Dozens of firms have sprung up selling climate risk products, often promising unrealistic levels of detail, down to a city block. “It’s unfortunately closer to a Wild West scenario right now,” says David Lafferty, a climate scientist at Cornell University. “There is a real need to evaluate those products.”

But there is little time. City by city, county by county, decisions must be made about the capacity and resilience of infrastructure in a fast-approaching future that humanity has never experienced. Deep in the heart of Texas, reservoirs need to be built and pipes need to be laid.

Located in the dry Texas Hill Country, Austin has always depended on the Colorado River for its water. Not that Colorado River, but rather the Texas Colorado River, which slashes nearly 1400 kilometers through the state before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. The Colorado was a source of life, but also of hardship when it flooded or dried up. Finally, in the late 1950s, the state built a series of dams, creating reservoirs. One sits astride Austin’s downtown: a long placid lake lined with boardwalks, running trails, and the reflections of newly built high-rises.

The reservoirs made Austin more resilient but not impregnably so. From 2008 to 2016, the city suffered its worst drought since the 1950s. Reservoir levels dropped by two-thirds. Residents faced severe water-use restrictions, and farmers downstream lost billions of dollars’ worth of crops. It was a scary time, says Marisa Flores Gonzalez, who leads water resources planning at Austin Water, the city’s utility. “When you’re in the middle of a drought that’s very severe, you don’t know where the bottom is.”

Prompted by that drought, Flores Gonzalez and her colleagues wondered how much lower the bottoms might be in a warmer future. “We are a land of extremes,” she says. “We have to be prepared.” At the state level, Texas does not factor climate change into assessments of future drought risk, a policy that may reflect the dominance of climate-skeptical Republicans in its government. But Austin, the state’s leading Democratic stronghold, is under no such restriction.

Flores Gonzalez had studied the Texas landscape from an early age. As a teen, she helped her father with his small business, which used geographic information systems (GIS) tools to help energy and water utilities plan infrastructure. In college at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin, she first pursued an English degree. “I was going to be the next great Mexican American writer,” she says. Then the 2008 recession hit, and she switched to geography. “I knew utilities. I knew GIS. And so I adjusted my plans.”

She joined Austin Water just as the city kicked off a study of its future water supply, an effort it calls Water Forward. The scientists who contributed to the first report followed standard practice at the time. They took the outputs from 20 different global climate models (using only the most severe greenhouse gas emissions scenario—one now seen as implausible). They took temperature and rain measurements from local weather stations and adjusted them based on the projected climate change signal. Then they used those forecasts to estimate the key factor for water infrastructure: future flows in the Colorado near Austin.

In some ways, the projections that ended up in the 2018 report weren’t surprising: Austin would have more dry days, and on days when it did rain, it would rain more, reflecting the ability of warmer air to hold more water. Overall, annual flows on the Colorado in the last 2 decades of the century would be 30% lower than today’s.

But a few outliers among the 20 models suggested that, because of extreme rainstorms, annual flows in some years could end up seven times today’s annual average—an Amazonian prediction that didn’t sit right with Flores Gonzalez and made her question the whole modeling process. Austin was preparing to be drier. But should it really prepare to be wetter, too?

When you hear the phrase “climate model,” it’s tempting to think researchers have created a silicon simulacrum of the planet, down to the finest detail. But because of computational constraints, most climate models simulate the planet coarsely, dividing the atmosphere and oceans up into gridlike boxes 100 kilometers wide or more. Using the equations of fluid dynamics, the models calculate how the atmosphere evolves as energy and moisture flow from box to box in discrete time steps.

Big picture, the models get a lot right: They’ve precisely charted the nearly 1.5°C rise in temperatures the world has experienced since the 1800s, along with accelerated warming in the Arctic and over the continents. “The basic physics is sound,” says Timothy Palmer, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. But they do have stubborn biases, particularly when it comes to how winds and moisture flow around the planet. Those biases often emerge not from the equations of fluid dynamics, but rather the empirical codes used to handle processes, such as cloud formation, that the models can’t simulate directly.

Until recently, Shaw says, “we were making predictions of worlds we couldn’t see.” But with the warming so strong now, and with several decades of observations in hand, climate scientists can now identify model flaws by comparing their predictions with what has transpired in the real world.

Last year, Shaw co-led a workshop that confronted the problem head on, leading to a paper this year in Science Advances that ran through a laundry list of the models’ failures. Not only did they fail to predict heat waves in Europe, but they also missed a cooling in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. They overlooked the strengthening of the North Atlantic jet stream in winter, which increases rain and snow in Northern Europe, and they also missed the more frequent occurrence of stalled high-pressure systems over Greenland, which bring sunny days and rapid ice melt. They failed to capture a cooling in the Southern Ocean, and they predicted that arid regions would get moister when they didn’t. “I really think this is a time of reflection and maturation,” Shaw says.

Given the models’ limitations, many climate scientists eschew regional projections and think the even harder task of making hyperlocal predictions is a fool’s errand.

But a whole field nevertheless arose to do just that. Like investigators in a crime procedural show who magnify a telling detail in a photo, somehow increasing its pixel density in the process, these approaches aim to wring local detail from a coarse global picture.

One way to do this “downscaling and bias correction,” as it is known, is by taking the output from a global climate model and feeding it into another model that covers a smaller area at high resolution. Such models can capture the details of storms and the way mountains affect weather, but because they still rely on input from the global models, they inherit biases that must be accounted for. And they are computationally expensive to run: A supercomputer that can run a global model would not have the power to simulate Texas alone at a resolution of 10 kilometers.

A more common—and computationally cheaper—method was pioneered several decades ago by Andy Wood, a hydrologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. He took daily, local records of temperature and precipitation, averaging them together to match the grid size of a global climate model and its monthly cadence. He could then compare the historical records with the climate model to gauge the magnitude of the model’s bias. Finally, after adjusting the local records based on the model’s forecast for the region, he undid the averaging imposed at the start to create new high-resolution climate projections.

By now, these techniques have proliferated into a whole cottage industry of ever more complex statistical matching. But the complexity hasn’t brought certainty. Even when the same climate model is used for the exact same region, the adjustments can produce widely varying results, as Wood and others laid out in a study in Environmental Research Letters (ERL) in April. For example, one method predicts the Pacific Northwest should expect 90 millimeters of summer rain by 2100; under another, that projection drops in half. For other parts of the United States, like the Rocky Mountain West, the choice of method can mean the difference between expecting more rain than the present—or less.

The adjustments can also wipe out any trends predicted by a climate model. Last year, Auroop Ganguly, a climate scientist at Northeastern University, and his colleagues applied a widely used downscaling and bias correction method to two different outputs: real climate model data and random noise. To their shock, the results were statistically indistinguishable. Every lesson from the model was lost, they found in a study published in ERL. “All the science that goes into building these earth system models was rendered meaningless,” Ganguly says. Adaptation planners and scientists in developing countries use the technique, so its shortcomings could have practical consequences. “The implications are really serious,” Ganguly says.

Wood has grown frustrated as downscaling methods have gotten more elaborate. “We still have no real confidence to determine that one downscaling method is better than another” at projecting future climate, he says. “At some point it becomes unpalatable. It, to some extent, destroys confidence in the results.”

He also wonders whether the projections from global models, however coarse and unreliable, are good enough for practical purposes. “It may get you to the same decision for your infrastructure as if you went through that increasingly unpalatable process,” he says.

The first Austin Water Forward report was a tremendous learning experience for Flores Gonzalez, who now comfortably drops climate science jargon like “CMIP”—the acronym for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, of course. When city officials began planning a second report in 2018, they wanted the best possible projections. They created an advisory group to provide real-time peer review of the process. And this time the city hired climate scientists at UT, including Zong-Liang Yang and his graduate student at the time, Sabiha Tabassum.

Yang and Tabassum made several changes at the start. First, they used projections for high-, medium-, and low-emission futures, representing a broader spread in possibility. Second, knowing the different biases that existed, they didn’t treat every climate model as equally valid. Rather, they sifted through 35 climate models and found the ones that best captured the Texas climate. This filtering led them to five models, from South Korea, Australia, and Europe. “We have high confidence they are giving the right results for the right reasons,” Yang says.

All too often, local climate projections skip this step, says Douglas Maraun, a climate scientist at the University of Graz. “The key aspect is model evaluation.” Often researchers use the model they are most comfortable with, whatever it says—or they use a global suite of data that has already been downscaled. Such global data sets are particularly problematic, as rarely does one model handle everywhere in the world well, says John Nielsen-Gammon, the state’s climatologist at Texas A&M University. “The users of downscaled information typically do not know what the strengths or weaknesses are.”

The UT team converted the models’ output into a regional forecast using standard downscaling and bias correction methods. But because the models tracked the region so well, Yang says, the corrections were relatively minor. After that, the data were converted into Colorado River flow, the numbers that mattered for Austin.

The results looked more plausible than before. The number of dry days increased, while rain grew concentrated into more severe storms. “But those extreme flows were less prevalent in this round than the last one,” Tabassum says. After integrating these projections with others, such as population growth, the team found that, in half of the scenarios considered, the city would begin to run out of water in 2070.

The new Water Forward report, approved by the Austin city council late last year, includes strategies to forestall that future. The city should drastically expand its use of reclaimed water in its distinctive purple pipes. It should encourage its residents to use less water. It should explore storing water in a dedicated underground aquifer for use during drought; it should add a backup reservoir, an existing lake previously used by a power utility; and it should study the possibility of desalinating groundwater. Finally, the report said, the city should prepare for true emergency scenarios where treated water from its sewage plant would be fed back into a reservoir and reused as drinking water.

In short, it said: The future is drier—and riskier—but still livable.

The next time Austin—or any other city—sets out to forecast its climate future, it may have better tools. Last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration funded a project co-led by Benjamin Kirtman, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami, to pit different downscaling techniques against each other, applying them to different climate models and seeing how the results diverge. “Do this over and over again and you can ultimately assess how well they work,” he says. His ultimate aim is to help develop the underpinnings of a climate projection service for wide use by local governments.

Later this year, Berkeley Earth, a California climate nonprofit previously known for its focus on historical climate records, will debut another approach, which it calls its Climate Model Synthesis. The project will take 40 global climate models and, for each region in the world, find the ones that best match historical observations. It will then use a machine-learning algorithm informed by Berkeley Earth’s high-resolution temperature record to downscale the results. The end result should be local, reasonably accurate projections that reflect “the breadth of uncertainty and expertise represented by the models,” says Robert Rohde, Berkeley Earth’s chief scientist.

Another route is to forgo downscaling and bias correction and instead build global climate models at superhigh resolutions. That’s the drive at Destination Earth, an EU initiative costing more than €300 million that has now run prototype global models at a 5-kilometer resolution, using some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. “The idea is to operationalize climate projections for the first time” by regularly updating these projects, says Irina Sandu, its director. “It’s creating a globally consistent map of downscaled information.”

But even with all its computing power, the team has only been able to complete projections out to 2040. And running the models multiple times to capture the spread of possibilities is prohibitively expensive. That’s why Sandu and others believe they will need to take advantage of the promising ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to emulate climate models and repeat their runs quickly—an approach that is already catching on for ordinary weather forecasting, with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the world’s leading forecaster, pioneering it.

ECMWF and Google, among others, have teams looking at how to use such advanced AI to entirely replace the downscaling done by high-resolution regional climate models. After training on a climate model, Google’s AI substitute proved particularly good at capturing compound extremes such as high heat and winds. “It allows us to really sample all the possible states of the atmosphere,” says Ignacio Lopez-Gomez, who led a Google study published in April in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. And the limited computation needed to run it could make its power widely available.

Early one morning back in downtown Austin, Boyce Freitag descended into an underground concrete cistern the size of a large rowhouse. From a balcony, he looked onto the dark pool below. Light from a hole in the ceiling illuminated the grimy patina of the cistern’s walls. “Hope spiders don’t give you the skeevies,” he says. Originally built for a defunct power plant, the cistern found a purpose again last decade when Austin built its new central library next door. “This is where the magic happens,” adds Freitag, the library’s building manager.

The cistern collects rainwater from neighborhood storm drains, which is then pumped to the gleaming library to flush toilets. It’s just one example of where the city is going, Flores Gonzalez says. After the first Water Forward report, the city rolled out leak-detecting smart water meters to nearly every resident. And now new, large commercial buildings will be required to incorporate water reuse into their plans from the start.

Austin Water’s collaboration with the UT researchers will continue. Flores Gonzalez takes pride in their analysis of Austin’s future, but they still have more to do: They want to better understand just how much river flow could increase in future years when a warmer atmosphere delivers exceptional rainfall, for example. But Austin knows enough to act, she says. “The next 10 years are going to be some of the most important years in Austin Water’s history.”

The adaptation can’t come soon enough. Several years ago, the city once again plunged into drought. And its bottom is still unknown.",https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zmq4rob/abs/_20250605_nf_fuzzy_atmosphere_drought.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:32:31.735261

Garza, Cameron County Commissioner for Precinct 3.","As Cameron County Commissioner for Precinct 3, I am committed to preserving our natural environment while promoting responsible land stewardship. I support thoughtful and strategic development, particularly projects that enhance ecotourism—provided they maintain environmental integrity and deliver lasting benefits to our communities. My vision is one of balance: protecting our region’s ecological assets while fostering sustainable economic growth.

Throughout my tenure, I have consistently championed nature-based solutions to improve flood protection, preserve critical watersheds, restore native habitats, and enhance regional resilience. My leadership is grounded in science-based planning, strong community partnerships, and a steadfast commitment to protecting natural ecosystems for future generations.

Environmental Initiatives

• Bahía Grande Restoration and Dust Control Initiative:

Launched in 2001, the Laguna Madre Area Dust Control Committee was established to address air quality issues and electrical disruptions caused by dust on AEP transmission lines. The Bahía Grande Restoration Project, including the expansion of the Carl “Joe” Gayman Channel, restored vital tidal flows, revitalized degraded wetlands, and reduced dust pollution. These efforts have significantly improved quality of life for surrounding communities such as Port Isabel, Laguna Vista, and South Padre Island—culminating in the largest wetlands restoration project in the United States.

• South Texas Ecotourism Center (STEC):

I proudly supported the creation of the South Texas Ecotourism Center in Laguna Vista, in collaboration with the Cameron County Commissioner’s Court, the Town of Laguna Vista, and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. This regional hub promotes conservation education, native habitat awareness, and sustainable ecotourism. STEC showcases the ecological richness of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and provides the public with opportunities to engage in environmental stewardship and water conservation.

• Cameron County Nature Resiliency Department:

Recognizing the growing threat of flooding and erosion in our region, I led the effort to establish a dedicated county department focused on nature-based resiliency. The department oversees coastal restoration, supports the development of green infrastructure, and advances watershed protection initiatives. These projects promote both ecological integrity and community resilience.

• Green Infrastructure Vision:

The Cameron County Green Infrastructure Vision, developed through The Nature Conservation Fund’s Green Infrastructure Program, serves as a foundation for sustainable development in the region. It complements the Cameron County Transportation Corridor Plan and aims to conserve and connect the area’s rich ecological and cultural resources while supporting economic resilience. This science-driven plan was created through the collaboration of more than 40 stakeholders, including local governments, federal and state agencies, conservation organizations, academic institutions, and community leaders—ensuring it reflects regional priorities and diverse perspectives.

• Wildlife and Habitat Safeguards at County Facilities:

My leadership has extended to integrating habitat protection and flood prevention into county-managed lands. Notable initiatives include restoring habitat for the endangered Northern Aplomado Falcon near the Port Isabel–Cameron County Airport and implementing shoreline stabilization at Adolph Thomae Jr. County Park. These projects help preserve ecological function, reduce flood vulnerability, and strengthen the Cameron County Parks System on South Padre Island.

Closing Statement

My vision of environmental stewardship is grounded in balance—ensuring that Cameron County grows with purpose, safeguards its natural beauty, and builds long-term resiliency for the benefit of both current and future generations.

But overall, the changes (outlined below) will negatively impact the development of renewable energy projects in the U.S. Electric vehicle manufacturers and buyers are hard hit by the early termination of popular consumer credits. The solar energy sector will lose a tax credit incentivizing the purchase of solar panels by homeowners, and both solar and battery manufacturers could lose access to key manufacturing credits well before their termination date if they use components or critical minerals imported from certain foreign countries, including China. Another provision accelerates the phase-out of a tax credit for the production of nuclear power to 2032 – earlier than any new projects are expected to come online. That is bad news for technology companies investing in nuclear plants that could provide clean power to meet the needs of high-energy-demand data centers. Oil and gas companies that have invested in green energy might also be disadvantaged by that change and by early termination of the tax credit for hydrogen production. Utilities developing renewable energy say that proposed limits on the transferability of certain tax credits will result in higher customer bills. And foreign investors in U.S. green energy facilities could be impacted by provisions that restrict access to certain credits by entities from foreign adversary nations.

The energy title of the House draft would rescind over $3 billion in unobligated funds from IRA programs under the Department of Energy’s (DOE) State-Based Energy Efficiency Grants and other DOE offices. But it includes several provisions intended to accelerate the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects in the U.S., including a provision to fast-track permitting for certain fossil fuel and pipeline project applicants for a fee equivalent to the lesser of 1 percent of the expected cost of the applicable construction or $10 million. And it includes a provision to fast track the export of natural gas from the U.S. to non-free trade agreement (FTA) countries or to import natural gas from a non-FTA country for a $1 million application fee.

Another provision in the natural resources title of the bill would attempt to streamline federal permitting for U.S. infrastructure projects, including energy projects. That language would allow entities seeking National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review to pay for the cost of the required environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA) plus an additional 25 percent for a guaranteed completion of the review process within six months (for an EA) or a year (for an EIS). The EIS or EA would not be subject to judicial review under NEPA.

The House will amend the draft, including provisions relating to IRA tax credits, before voting on it. And the Senate almost certainly will make additional changes when the bill goes to that chamber for consideration. Barnes and Thornburg’s Government Relations team can provide regular legislative updates to help guide impacted clients’ business planning and assist with strategic engagement in the legislative process.

The decision is part of a broader $1.7 billion investment in BMW’s North American manufacturing operations. Of that, $1 billion will be used to upgrade the Spartanburg plant for EV production, and $700 million will go toward building a new battery assembly facility in nearby Woodruff, SC. The new facility will produce sixth-generation cylindrical battery cells developed in partnership with Envision AESC.

Spartanburg, BMW’s largest production site globally, will serve as the hub for electrified versions of its X-series lineup. In addition to the iX5 and iX7, the plant already produces plug-in hybrid variants and is expected to manufacture at least six fully electric models in the U.S. by 2030.

The iX5 will be offered alongside gasoline, diesel, and plug-in hybrid versions, maintaining BMW’s multi-powertrain strategy. The electric SUV will feature dual-motor xDrive configurations, including a high-performance iX5 M70 variant and a hydrogen-powered fuel cell version scheduled for 2028.

Lucid’s latest move expands on a 2024 agreement with Graphite One to supply synthetic graphite from the same Ohio site and follows another partnership with Syrah Resources, which will deliver natural graphite active anode material processed in Vidalia, Louisiana, starting in 2026.

The shift toward domestic sources comes amid growing geopolitical tensions and the potential for additional tariffs under the Trump administration, which has prioritized reshoring strategic materials. Lucid’s leadership believes that domestic production is not only a supply chain solution but also a key to scaling the U.S. graphite industry.

“The automotive industry can provide the critical scale that you need to make those mines profitable,” Marc Winterhoff, Lucid’s interim CEO, told Bloomberg. “We need so much of it.”

Winterhoff also emphasized the strategic importance of localizing resources: “A supply chain of critical materials within the United States drives our nation’s economy, increases our independence against outside factors or market dynamics, and supports our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our vehicles.”

Graphite is an essential component of lithium-ion batteries, playing a major role in high-performance and fast-charging electric vehicles. Both synthetic and natural graphite materials are used in battery anodes, and securing these resources from within the U.S. aligns with broader national goals for clean energy and industrial independence.

Graphite One CEO Anthony Huston called the agreement historic, adding that it builds momentum for a fully domestic graphite supply chain to “meet market demands and strengthen U.S. industry and national defense.”

Between 2025 and 2030, the amount of solar PV power generation is expected to accelerate due to the construction of new, large solar power plants.
Do you have any ideas for charging your EV with solar power?","Are electric vehicles coal powered? The honest answer is, that in some cases, to a small extent, yes. The good news is that, according to Morningstar, about half of U.S. power generation will be renewable energy by 2032. Because the cost of renewable energy is dropping, its proportion of power generation will likely continue to increase. If you own an EV, you don’t need to wait around for this to happen. You can take matters into your own hands. One idea recently posted on Reddit spurred a string of interesting comments.

“I have this power station with some solar panels and I can charge my car with it. The fact that this is even possible in the first place is what fascinates me. The fact that the energy transition allows me to generate and store my own power, making me independent from oil and gas companies is just wonderful. I get why big oil dumps so much anti-EV propaganda on the net. If everyone does this, we're no longer dependent on them!”

If building your own solar EV charger isn’t your thing, on another Reddit thread, r/electricvehicles discusses a clever, manufactured rooftop solar charger built by GoSun.

“While this makes zero sense for your typical commuter, it could make sense for someone camping or leaving their car parked for more than a few days. For example, at a trailhead or an airport.”

According to the GoSun website, you can generate up to 20 miles per day with solar self-charging. Their compact rooftop carrier contains eleven hundred watts of solar power and has an estimated price of $3,000 and may be eligible for a 30% tax credit.

Further down the thread, someone posted some interesting calculations:

“A 7x4ft 500w panel could give 1.5 -to- 2 miles per hour. The Average one-way commute in the US is around 15 miles. So if you drive 15 miles, park for 8 hours outside the office, and drive back 10-15 miles, it’s near perfect.

Even if it only averaged 8 miles a day for the year, that’s 3,000 miles. Thats 1/4 of the driving done by the average American.

That’s on the low-end worst-case scenario for efficiency. Someone in the southwest could probably average 15 miles a day, which would be more than half of their annual driving.

It’s not a bad idea to have it as an option for people who can’t install solar at home or those that park outside.”

Let’s Get Back to the Electricity Coming Out of Your Wall

When it comes to traditional out-of-the-wall power, the amount of your electricity that is generated by renewable sources depends on where you live. Electricity in the United States is generated from a variety of sources including petroleum, natural gas, renewables, and coal. Coal accounts for less than 10%. Renewable energy includes wind, solar, hydroelectric and nuclear. However, the amount of electricity generated from renewables varies wildly by state.

Solar Photovoltaics Are About One Third Cheaper Per Megawatt Hour Than Coal

The small solar power systems shown above are pretty cool, but did you know that solar photovoltaics (PV) is set to become the largest source of renewable energy by 2030? It’s being driven by good old capitalism, as the cost of solar panels has steadily fallen over the past few decades. From 2018 to 2023, global solar capacity has tripled. Early solar PV generation was mostly from rooftop installations on households and companies.

Between 2025 and 2030, the amount of solar PV power generation is expected to accelerate due to the construction of new, large solar power plants. So where does that leave the future for coal? For that, we can once again turn to capitalism. It is now more expensive to keep running coal-fired power plants than it is to build new solar operations. On average, the cost to add one additional megawatt hour from coal production is $36, whereas the cost to add an additional megawatt hour of solar PV production is about $24.

EVs Are About Two and a Half Times More Efficient Than Gas-Powered Vehicles

Another really important point to remember is that electric vehicles are much more efficient than ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. Even if your electric vehicle is recharged 100% by electricity generated from fossil fuels, its electric motors are much more efficient at transforming the energy stored in their batteries into motion. Efficiency is a measure of how much energy you get from fuel put into a vehicle (gasoline or electricity) compared to how much you get out to power your wheels and move you forward. The US Department of Energy found that EVs convert more than 75% of the energy received from the electrical grid to power at the wheels. Typical ICE vehicles only convert 12% to 30% of the energy stored in gasoline to power at the wheels. This makes EVs about two and a half times more efficient than ICE vehicles. That means less money spent per mile, and much less damage to the environment.

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Dig down about a mile or two in parts of the United States and you’ll start to see the remains of an ancient ocean. The shells of long dead sea creatures are compressed into white limestone, surrounding brine aquifers with a higher salt content than the Atlantic Ocean.

Last summer, ExxonMobil sponsored weeklong camps to teach grade school students from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi about the virtues of these aquifers, specifically their ability to serve as carbon capture and sequestration wells, where oil, gas, and heavy industry can bury harmful emissions deep underground. In one exercise, students were given 20 minutes to build a model reservoir out of vegetable oil, Play-Doh, pasta, and uncooked beans. Whoever could keep the most vegetable oil (meant to represent liquified carbon dioxide) in their aquifer, won.

This kind of down-home carbon capture boosterism is a relatively new development for the oil and gas giant. Over recent years, ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel companies have spent millions lobbying for government support of what they see as industry-friendly green technology, most prominently carbon capture and storage, which many scientists and environmental activists have argued is ineffective and distracts from eliminating fossil fuel operations in the first place. According to Exxon’s website, it’s evidence that they are leading “the biggest energy transition in history.”

Now that Congress has turned its attention to rolling back government spending on renewable energy, it appears that most of the climate “solutions” being left off the chopping block are the ones favored by carbon-intensive companies like Exxon. Corporate tax breaks for carbon capture and storage, for instance, were one of the few things left untouched when House Republicans passed a budget bill on May 22 that effectively gutted the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration’s signature climate legislation. What remained of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits were incentives for nuclear, so-called clean fuels like ethanol, and carbon capture.

When the IRA was passed in 2022, there was immediate backlash against the provisions for carbon capture. “Essentially, we, the taxpayers, are subsidizing a private sewer system for oil and gas,” said Sandra Steingraber, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Science and Environmental Health Network.

The tax credits for nuclear power plants, which produce energy without emitting greenhouse gases, are meant to spur what President Donald Trump hopes will be an “energy renaissance,” bolstered by a flurry of pro-nuclear executive orders he issued a day after the budget bill cleared the House. Projects will be able to use the tax credits if they begin construction by 2031; wind and solar companies, however, will lose access to tax credits unless they begin construction within 60 days of Trump signing the bill, and are fully up and running by 2028.

That the carbon capture tax credit was never in danger of being revoked is a testament to its importance to the oil and gas industry, said Jim Walsh, the policy director at the nonprofit Food and Water Watch. “The major beneficiaries of these tax credits are oil and gas companies and big agricultural interests.”

The carbon capture tax credit was first established in 2008, but the subsidies were more than doubled when it was tacked on to the IRA in order to get former senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia’s vote. Companies now receive $60 for every ton of CO2 captured and used to drive oil out of the ground (a process known as “enhanced oil recovery”) and up to $85 for a ton of CO2 that is permanently stored. As roughly 60 percent of captured CO2 in the United States is used for enhanced oil recovery, detractors see the tax credit as something of a devil’s bargain, a provision that props up an industry at taxpayer expense.

How much carbon is actually captured by these projects is also a matter of debate. The tax credit requires companies that claim it to self-report how much CO2 they inject to the Internal Revenue Service. The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, is in charge of tracking leaks. There are tax penalties if captured carbon ends up leaking, but those penalties only apply if the leaks occur in the first three years after injection. Holding companies accountable is made more complicated by the fact that tax returns are confidential, and Walsh cautions that there is very little communication between the EPA and the IRS. Oversight is “very, very minimal,” added Anika Juhn, an energy data analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a research firm.

“You can keep some really played out oil fields going for a long time, and you can get the public to pay for it,” said Carolyn Raffensberger, the executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network, explaining the potential impact of the budget bill. “So the argument is, ‘This is a win for the climate, it’s a win for energy dominance.’ [But] it’s really a budget buster with no guardrails at all.”

Existing carbon-capture facilities have been plagued by technical and financial issues. The country’s first commercial carbon capture plant in Decatur, Illinois, sprung two leaks last year directly under Lake Decatur, which is the town’s main source of drinking water. When concentrated CO2 hits water it turns into carbonic acid, which then leaches heavy metals from rocks within the aquifer and poisons the water.

Although a certain level of public health concerns come with many emerging technologies, critics point out that all of this risk is being taken for a technology that has not been proven to work at scale, and may actually increase emissions by incentivizing more oil and gas production. It could also strain the existing electrical grid—outfitting a natural gas or coal plant with carbon capture equipment can suck up about 15 to 25 percent of the plant’s power.

The tax credits exist “to pollute and confuse people,” said Mark Jacobsen, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, who has argued that there is essentially no reasonable use for carbon capture. They “increase people’s [energy] costs and do nothing for the climate.”

But the technology does have its defenders among scientists. The 2022 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called an increase in carbon capture technology “unavoidable” if countries want to reach net-zero emissions. Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, an umbrella organization of fossil fuel companies, unions, and environmental groups, contends that arguments like Jacobsen’s unnecessarily set the technology against renewables. “We need all the solutions in the toolkit,” she said. “We’re not saying don’t deploy these other technologies. We see this very much as a complementary and supportive piece in the broader decarbonization toolkit.”

Stolark said that carbon capture didn’t make it out of the budget process entirely unscathed, as the bill specified that companies could no longer sell carbon capture tax credits. So-called “transferability”—the ability to sell these tax credits on the open market—has been invaluable to small energy startups that have struggled to secure financing in their early stages, according to Stolark. The Carbon Capture Coalition is urging lawmakers to restore transferability now that the bill has moved from the House to the Senate.

Still, the kinds of companies likely to claim carbon capture tax credits—often major players in oil and gas, ammonia, steel, and other heavy industries—are less likely to rely on transferability than more modest companies (often providers of renewable energy), whose smaller tax bills makes it harder for them to realize the value of their respective tax credits.

“A lot of the factories, the power plants, the industrial facilities deploying within the next ten years or so, are expected to be these really big [facilities] with the big tax burdens,” said Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovations, a clean energy think tank based in San Francisco. “They’re not the type of smaller producers—like small solar companies—that are reliant on transferability in order to monetize the tax credit.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250605_CCS-Well_2000px.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-06-06 08:31:41.887348

This week’s meeting was to “provide intelligence” to the White House about the project, James told Reuters.
Penn LNG will need to obtain state and local permits, as well as federal permits, to go forward.","Penn America Energy Holdings (PAE) has met with White House officials to sound out the Trump Administration’s support for a project to develop an LNG export facility on Pennsylvania’s Delaware River, the company’s chief executive, Franc James, told Reuters this week.

PAE has been seeking for years to advance a project to build an LNG plant on the Delaware River, to export 7.2 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually.

Penn LNG would be close to the vast, low-cost Marcellus natural gas resources, and, when compared to U.S. Gulf Coast projects, it offers shorter shipping distances to Europe and other key LNG markets, Penn America Energy says. Moreover, the Delaware River ship channel has been deepened to enable the region’s full participation in global marine commerce.

While such a project could take advantage of the abundant natural gas resources and production close to Pennsylvania, the need for more pipelines and local opposition has stymied progress in the initial stages of the project.

This week’s meeting was to “provide intelligence” to the White House about the project, James told Reuters.

“Developing a project in the Northeast is quite different than the Gulf Coast, Louisiana and Texas, so it requires a great deal of support, not only politically in the state, but also with communities ... in terms of pipeline -transmission as well as ... along the Delaware River,” the executive said.

Support needs to be found not only on the federal level, which could be readily available with the Trump Administration’s pledge to unleash America’s energy resources and LNG exports. Penn LNG will need to obtain state and local permits, as well as federal permits, to go forward.

The company is still considering which site to pick for a potential LNG terminal, James told Reuters.

Analysts say the project faces challenges in obtaining permits amid opposition from local communities and the state.

Meanwhile, developers of U.S. LNG export projects have started taking final investment decisions on new facilities this year, with several plans expected to be added in 2025 to Woodside’s Louisiana LNG approval, despite rising construction costs due to President Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs.

Cyrus Reed with the Sierra Club Texas says there were many missed opportunities when it comes to grid reliability.
""It was a big, big session for water,"" Reed said.
""As environmental advocates, we see a direct link between climate change, hotter temperatures, and more severe droughts, and extended wildfire seasons,"" Shelley said.
""Within the small measuring stick we use, this was a marginal session,"" Shelley said.","As the dust settles on the 89th Legislative Session, environmental groups in Central Texas came together Wednesday morning to celebrate the bills that passed and mourn those that didn't.

Adrian Shelley with Public Citizen says, despite attempted attacks on clean energy this Legislative session, many of the bills they were most concerned about ended up dying.

""It ended up, on the whole, a net positive for the environment, is my take,"" Shelley said.

Luke Metzger with Environment Texas says it remains a thriving industry.

""We are producing, every year, record amounts of wind, solar, and battery storage, which is helping reduce pollution, saving consumers money, and keeping our grid stable,"" Metzger said.

One of those bills was Senate Bill 819, which would have imposed additional fees and requirements on renewable energy generation facilities in favor of the rights of nearby private properties. It passed the Senate 27-to-4, but never even made it to committee in the House.

We reached out to author Senator Lois Kolkhorst, but did not hear back. Before its final passage in the Senate back in April, she said the bill was about balance.

""The people questioned what they could do about 600-foot towers in probably the most gorgeous part of Fayette County and perhaps one of the prettiest parts of Texas,"" Kolkhorst said on the floor. ""It only applies to 10 megawatts or more. We were just talking, I think 10 megawatts can power 7,200+ homes.""

Cyrus Reed with the Sierra Club Texas says there were many missed opportunities when it comes to grid reliability. However, he is celebrating the creation of an eight-member energy waste advisory committee.

""[The committee will] look at ways to optimize energy efficiency savings programs and funding, demand reduction programs, and come back to the Legislature with a report,"" Reed said. ""And that's going to be important.""

Then there was water. One of Governor Abbott's top priorities, the package created an annual $1 billion funding stream, a compromise on new versus recycled water sources, and new incentives for developers who go above and beyond on water conservation.

""It was a big, big session for water,"" Reed said. ""In addition, the bill had good language around what can be funded with that money, in terms of things like leaky pipes, water reuse, and wastewater treatment. Overall, maybe not the bill Sierra Club would have written, but overall we think it's a good result.""

Shelley says he was also glad to see bipartisan action on efforts to mitigate extended wildfire seasons, such as a new state requirement for wildfire mitigation plans.

""As environmental advocates, we see a direct link between climate change, hotter temperatures, and more severe droughts, and extended wildfire seasons,"" Shelley said. ""Our lawmakers haven't acknowledged the relationship between climate change and wildfires, but we can credit them for taking good action this year.""

The environmental groups would have liked to see more to combat air pollution. Particularly as it came to bills which failed, such as one looking to curtail a rock crushing plant in Burnet and another looking for action on fine particulate matter in the air.

""When there are powerful economic interests that don't want you to study stuff or look at things, it's hard to accomplish those things in this Legislature,"" Reed said.

Overall, the three agree they'll take their wins and get ready to fight again in 2027.

""Within the small measuring stick we use, this was a marginal session,"" Shelley said. ""We beat back the worst things, there were a few small things. At best, we're cautiously hopeful about what happened.""",https://cbsaustin.com/resources/media2/16x9/551/986/3x0/90/59fea1ac-b87b-4152-af4a-8099188b3a7b-dome.png,N,,2025-06-06 08:32:43.757563

“Our state is growing fast, and American manufacturers are eager to open up plants in North Carolina instead of shipping those jobs overseas,” said Arp.
Several prominent organizations voiced support for the bill during the public comment period, including the North Carolina Chamber, North Carolina Electric Cooperatives, ElectriCities, and the American Petroleum Institute.
“If there are blackouts like we have seen in other states, they’re not going to be coming to North Carolina.
And if our energy is not affordable, they’re not going to be coming to North Carolina.”","A major energy reform bill that would repeal North Carolina’s interim goal of cutting carbon emissions 70% by 2030 is now advancing in the state House after passing the Senate last month. Supporters say the move, part of a broader package, will help save electricity customers nearly $15 billion by reducing construction and compliance costs tied to future power generation.

The Power Bill Reduction Act (SB 266) was introduced in the House Regulatory Reform Committee on Wednesday. Rep. Dean Arp, R-Union, called it a collaborative effort between utilities, manufacturers, and consumer advocates to refine the legislative goals to save ratepayers money.

“Our state is growing fast, and American manufacturers are eager to open up plants in North Carolina instead of shipping those jobs overseas,” said Arp. “Simply meeting the current demand – and including residential, industrial, and the tens of thousands of new manufacturing jobs coming to North Carolina – requires new, reliable energy at lower costs.”

The bill’s centerpiece is the repeal of the 2030 interim carbon reduction target originally set in House Bill 951. It retains the long-term 2050 carbon neutrality goal but removes the earlier benchmark that state regulators now estimate would add $13 billion in costs for new power infrastructure.

The bill will reduce consumer electricity costs by a total of $15 billion through the policy changes, which also include a financing requirement that reduces the cost of constructing new natural gas and nuclear plants by about 5%. It also protects consumers from rate hikes and unnecessary and unexpected costs associated with fuel costs, legislators explained during the committee meeting.

The legislation, which now heads to the House Rules Committee, is being fast-tracked with no formal opposition from major stakeholders.

“It’s very rare that you get all the power companies and all the customers to agree on legislation, and yet, that’s what this bill does,” said Arp.

Several prominent organizations voiced support for the bill during the public comment period, including the North Carolina Chamber, North Carolina Electric Cooperatives, ElectriCities, and the American Petroleum Institute. They emphasized the bill’s role in ensuring reliable, affordable energy to meet the state’s growing economic and industrial demands.

Donald Bryson, CEO of the John Locke Foundation, expressed support for the bill and described it as “energy policy grounded in reality and responsible governance.”

“If North Carolinians and lawmakers want to continue to meet long-term emission goals by the 2050 target without driving up costs and undermining reliability, then we must give utilities and regulators flexibility to use the least-cost, technology-neutral strategy,” said Bryson. “It removes an arbitrary interim carbon deadline, strengthens cost recovery tools for baseload generation, and authorizes the prudent use of securitization…This bill enables a rational energy transition that balances environmental goals with economic growth and ratepayer protection.”

Ryan Minto, managing director of government affairs at Duke Energy, pointed to estimates that show an eightfold increase in the demand for energy in North Carolina.

“With this legislation, you will ensure that the energy component of our state’s competitive advantages continues well into the future with affordable, reliable power for businesses and residents,” Minto said.

Rep. Neal Jackson, R-Moore, commented on the recent news that Amazon is investing $10 billion in a new high-tech cloud computing and artificial intelligence Innovation Campus in Richmond County. With Amazon planning to employ 2,000 construction workers for eight to ten years, Jackson said the power grid’s reliability and affordability are crucial for the state’s business appeal.

“Here’s what I say for all of my colleagues, these companies would not be coming to North Carolina unless our energy is reliable,” Jackson said. “If there are blackouts like we have seen in other states, they’re not going to be coming to North Carolina. And if our energy is not affordable, they’re not going to be coming to North Carolina.”",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/piedmont_employees_2-e1749145779884-768x560.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:26:54.843778

“Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. … He had no problem with it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

“All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars,” he added.

Musk’s car company was a major beneficiary of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which expanded and extended $7,500 tax credits for consumers who purchased EVs as they became more affordable and accessible for many Americans.

Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which was passed by the House last month and now awaits action in the Senate, axes those tax credits.

It also seeks to overturn a Biden administration regulation that is expected to require automakers to shift toward more electric fleets, or purchase credits from companies like Tesla that outperform the regulations.

Musk, who headed up the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, has claimed that his company does not need the consumer incentive.

In response to Trump’s comments on Thursday, Musk wrote “Whatever.” in a post on social media.

“Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,” he added.

Musk has launched a barrage of criticism at the legislation since leaving the Trump administration. He has talked not only about its moves to axe EV and solar energy incentives, but also its potential to add to the federal deficit.

Hydrogen Goes Global: A Market on the Rise The global green hydrogen market is growing fast.","Element Resources has received approval to build the Lancaster Clean Energy Center, a $1.85 billion green hydrogen plant in California. Once finished, this facility will be North America’s biggest green hydrogen plant. It can produce 22,000 tons of green hydrogen every year.

The project aims to meet the rising demand for clean energy. It will also help the United States shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources.

Sun-Powered and Self-Sufficient: A Hydrogen First

The Lancaster Clean Energy Center stands out for its commitment to sustainability and innovation. The facility will run on 100% solar energy, using over 650 megawatts (MW) of solar power. Also, long-duration battery storage systems will support it. This setup lets the plant run 24/7 without needing grid electricity or fossil fuels. This way, hydrogen production stays clean and emission-free.

The plant will use advanced electrolyzers. These machines split water into hydrogen and oxygen with electricity. The hydrogen produced is called “green” because it comes from renewable energy sources.

Traditional methods, on the other hand, burn fossil fuels and release greenhouse gases. The facility will produce gaseous and liquid hydrogen. It will distribute them with zero-emission fuel cell trucks.

The Project’s Environmental and Community Benefits

Reducing Carbon Emissions:

One of the main goals of the Lancaster Clean Energy Center is to reduce carbon emissions. If the plant produces 22,000 tons of green hydrogen each year, it can replace diesel or natural gas in transport and industry.

This switch could cut carbon dioxide emissions by over 200,000 tons annually, helping California reach its climate goals. These goals aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.

Improving Air and Water Quality:

Using green hydrogen instead of fossil fuels also improves air quality. Hydrogen fuel produces only water vapor as a byproduct, which helps lower local air pollution and benefits public health.

The Lancaster plant will use groundwater from a nearby aquifer. It will only take 15–20% of the water that was used for farming on the same land. This change will ease the pressure on local water resources and promote sustainable development.

Supporting Local Communities

The project will create jobs during construction and operation. This includes roles for contractors, engineers, electricians, and plant workers. Local businesses that provide equipment and services will benefit too. This will help boost the regional economy.

The growth of green hydrogen plants also comes from tax incentives and state programs. One key program is California Jobs First. It promotes clean energy and boosts economic growth in the area.

The Role of Green Hydrogen in the Energy Transition

Green hydrogen is viewed as a vital solution for cutting carbon emissions in hard-to-electrify sectors. This includes heavy-duty transportation, shipping, and steelmaking.

Green hydrogen is different from fossil fuels. It doesn’t release harmful gases when used. This makes it important for countries and regions aiming to meet strict emissions targets.

Making hydrogen from renewable sources also boosts energy security. It lowers the need for imported oil and gas.

The Lancaster Clean Energy Center is part of a larger trend toward adopting green hydrogen across North America. The market for green hydrogen is growing rapidly, with projections showing that it could meet up to 22% of the world’s energy needs by 2050.

In the United States, government incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act are boosting major projects. They also speed up the shift to clean energy.

Here are three notable green hydrogen plants in the U.S.:

SoHyCal (California): The largest operational green hydrogen plant in North America, producing up to three tons daily using solar power, supporting hydrogen refueling stations. It could fuel up to 210,000 cars or 30,000 city buses annually once fully operational by mid-2025.

Sauk Valley (Illinois): Operated by Invenergy, this plant produces about 40 tons annually, using solar energy to supply hydrogen for industrial and power generation uses.

St. Gabriel (Louisiana): A joint venture by Plug Power and Olin, under construction to produce 15 tons daily, aiming to reduce CO₂ emissions and create jobs. Operation can start by the end of 2025.

Hydrogen Goes Global: A Market on the Rise

The global green hydrogen market is growing fast. It is set for major expansion in the next ten years.

Estimates say the market, worth about $7.98 billion in 2024, might grow to between $25 billion and $60 billion by 2030, depending on the source. The annual growth rates could range from around 22% to almost 39% from 2025 to 2030. This growth comes from more government support, new technology, and higher demand in many industries.

RELATED: Indian Government Announces Massive New Green Hydrogen Project

Government initiatives worldwide are critical drivers. Countries like India, Japan, Germany, and the United States are pushing hard on hydrogen. They have started strong strategies and funding programs. Their goal is to boost green hydrogen production and build the needed infrastructure.

For example, India aims to produce 5 million metric tons annually by 2030, while Japan targets 20 million tons by 2050.

These policies support global goals from the Paris Agreement. They position green hydrogen as a key way to cut emissions in hard-to-electrify areas like steelmaking, heavy transport, and chemical manufacturing.

New technology is lowering the costs of electrolyzers and renewable energy. This makes green hydrogen production cheaper and more practical. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, work with electrolyzers to create clean hydrogen. This method ensures steady hydrogen production, which helps with energy storage and keeps the grid stable.

Also, infrastructure investments are growing worldwide. This includes hydrogen production plants, refueling stations, and distribution networks to meet rising demand.

From Lancaster to the World: A Blueprint for Clean Hydrogen

Looking ahead, green hydrogen could supply up to 24% of global energy needs by 2050, with the market potentially reaching $700 billion by 2040. Asia-Pacific, Europe, and parts of the Middle East and Latin America have many renewable resources. These regions are becoming leaders in green hydrogen development.

North America, especially states like California, is quickly embracing hydrogen technologies. They aim to achieve bold climate goals and build clean energy economies.

The Lancaster facility could set a new standard for large-scale green hydrogen production in North America. As more areas and companies aim for net-zero carbon goals, projects like this show how useful and efficient green hydrogen can be.

The plant’s output will help with transportation, public transit, port operations, and aviation. This will aid in decarbonizing many sectors and will inspire more investment and growth in the sector.

The Element Resources initiative represents a major step forward for green hydrogen in North America. As the largest green hydrogen plant on the continent, it will serve as a model for future projects and play a crucial role in the transition to a sustainable energy future.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Element-Resources-to-Build-Americas-Largest-1.85B-Green-Hydrogen-Plant-in-California.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 14:23:59.646685

But the Tesla CEO shot back on X, the social media platform he owns, that he doesn’t care if the GOP scraps tax credits and other policies favoring EVs.

Trump said he was “very surprised” and “very disappointed” with Musk’s opposition in recent days to the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

The billionaire has said his opposition stems from the trillions of dollars the bill could add to the federal deficit. The president and other some Republican lawmakers see other motives.

“Elon’s upset because we took the EV mandate — which, you know, was a lot of money for electric vehicles … they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,” Trump told reporters in an Oval Office appearance with visiting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

The comments were the latest dustup in a growing feud between Musk and Republican leaders. Musk until last week was a top adviser to Trump and launched the U.S. DOGE Service, also known as the Department of Government Efficiency.

The spat threatens to derail the bill’s passage through the Senate and again through the House, especially after Musk has threatened to work to unseat lawmakers who vote for it.

Musk brushed off Trump’s comments. “Whatever,” he wrote on X. He said Republicans can “Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill,” but “ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK.”

In recent days, however, Tesla has publicly called for Republicans to keep at least some clean energy incentives. And Musk on Thursday repeated a complaint that “no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!).”

Trump said Musk had been closely involved in talks that led to the House passing the megabill last month. “I’m very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. Better than you people,” the president said, referring to top administration officials.

“He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it,” Trump said. “All of the sudden, he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out we were going to have to cut the EV mandate. Because that’s billions and billions of dollars.”

Musk denied that. “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it,” he wrote on X.

Trump compared Musk to other officials in his administration who have left and made negative comments about him.

“Some of them actually become hostile. I don’t know what it is. It’s sort of Trump Derangement Syndrome, I guess they call it,” Trump said, deploying a term he and his supporters use to mock his opponents.

,Indiana American Energy ,2025-06-05 17:41:24+00:00,US News & World Report,Trump EPA Moves to Roll Back Rules Projected to Save Billions of Dollars and Thousands of Lives,Associated Press,,,,,https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2025-06-05/trumps-epa-targets-environmental-rules-projected-to-save-billions-and-many-thousands-of-lives,"“More people will die,” said Cory Zigler, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University who has studied air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants.
In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.
In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.
Under Trump, the EPA's fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.
But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.","When the head of the Environmental Protection Agency announced a wide-ranging rollback of environmental regulations, he said it would put a “dagger through the heart of climate-change religion” and introduce a “Golden Age” for the American economy.

What Lee Zeldin didn’t mention: how ending the rules could have devastating consequences to human health.

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated; they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

But experts say the numbers are conservative and that even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

“More people will die,” said Cory Zigler, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University who has studied air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants. “More of this type of pollution that we know kills people will be in the air.”

What went into AP’s examination of the pollution rules

The AP set out to look at what could happen if all the rules were eliminated, by first examining exhaustive assessments the EPA was required to produce before the rules were approved. Though the agency’s priorities can change as presidential administrations change, the methods for the assessments have been largely standard since Ronald Reagan’s presidency and are deeply rooted in peer-reviewed scientific research.

The AP used those and eight different government and private group databases for its estimate of financial costs, some death estimates and analysis of pollution trends. AP performed additional analysis of potential deaths by drawing on peer-reviewed formulas and scientific research on the impacts of increased heat and pollution. And AP vetted its work with multiple outside health experts, who said it is scientifically justified, but likely an undercount.

Multiple experts say the science behind the rules is strong, and they pointed to the rigorous process that must be followed to change them, including requirements for public comment.

Zeldin acknowledged as much last month.

“I’m not going to prejudge outcomes with what will be a lot of rulemaking,” Zeldin said in April.

Virtually all the benefits from the rules come from restricting the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The fossil fuel industry was a heavy contributor to President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and Republicans overall. In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.

Calculating costs and benefits is contentious

Asked for comment on the AP findings, an EPA spokesperson said the agency’s plans would “roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden ‘taxes’ on U.S. families.”

“Unlike the Biden EPA attempts to regulate whole sectors of our economy out of existence, the Trump EPA understands that we do not have to choose between protecting our precious environment and growing our economy,” spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said.

Scott Segal, an attorney at Bracewell LLP who represents energy and manufacturing interests, suggested that EPA analyses under the Biden administration emphasized worst-case scenarios, inflated health benefit claims and missed the big-picture economic benefits of booming industry.

“If you only count lives saved by regulation, not lives harmed by regulation, the math will always favor more regulation,” Segal said. “This framing misses the larger point: public health isn’t just about air quality -- it’s also about job security, housing, access to medical care, and heating in the winter.""

The EPA regulatory analyses are immense documents that numerous health and environment researchers and former officials say are grounded in science, not politics. For example, in January 2024, the EPA produced a 445-page analysis of tightening standards on dangerous particle pollution that cited more than 90 different scientific publications, along with scores of other documents. The Biden EPA presented four different regulatory scenarios and ultimately chose one of the middle options.

Two experts who reviewed AP’s work said the EPA documents that underpinned the analysis were themselves conservative in their estimates. University of Washington health and environment professors Kristi Ebi and Howard Frumkin said that’s because EPA looked at added heat deaths and air pollution mortality, but did not include climate change’s expected deaths from increased infectious disease, flooding and other disaster factors.

“This is a rigorous, compelling and much-needed analysis,'' said Frumkin, who was appointed director of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health during George W. Bush's administration. ”It makes clear that regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration will have major, direct consequences for health and well-being. Because of these regulatory rollbacks and funding cuts, Americans will die needlessly.""

That's a sentiment echoed by two former Republican EPA administrators, William Reilly and Christine Todd Whitman, who served in the George Bush and George W. Bush administrations respectively.

“This administration is endangering all of our lives — ours, our children, our grandchildren,” said Whitman, who led EPA under George W. Bush.

How regulations helped clear the air

A visit to Evansville, Indiana, helps show how EPA regulations have made a difference.

The city of about 115,000 lies where the state's southwest tip meets Kentucky at the curving Ohio River. Industry lines the banks and coal barges float past carrying loads destined to fuel power plants.

Kirt Ethridge, 30, grew up in Evansville and still lives there. As a child, he recalls looking down from high ground into the bowl-shaped valley where the heart of the city lies and seeing a haze of pollution atop it. He thought that was normal.

He didn’t think much of the looming smokestacks of the coal-fired power plants and factories that ringed the city, nor the line of inhalers waiting on a bench before he and his classmates ran the mile. He suffered asthma attacks in class, sometimes more than once a week, that sent him to the nurse’s office. Once, he was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

“It’s a very scary feeling, particularly as a kid, to not be able to get enough air in your lungs,” he said, describing it as like “breathing through a straw.”

In southwestern Indiana, coal-fired power plants were to blame for between 19,000 and nearly 23,000 deaths from 1999 to 2020, according to work by Zigler published in the journal Science that examined death rates among Medicare recipients and modeled where plants' pollution would spread.

Nationally, he and his team found a sharp decline in air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants after the mid-2000s, from an average of 43,000 a year to just 1,600 a year in 2020, with a similar cut in particle pollution. That's when two different forces came into play: Cheaper and less polluting natural gas pushed aside dirtier and costlier coal, while at the same time stricter regulations required more pollution control devices such as scrubbers.

Duke Energy operates its biggest power plant near Evansville — Gibson Station, which can power about 2.5 million homes. Emissions have declined significantly as the company installed scrubbers that pull unwanted chemicals out of smokestacks, along with other pollution control technology. Duke Energy spokeswoman Angeline Protegere said the scrubbers were a response to “regulations over the years as well as market factors.”

Put simply, the air got cleaner around places like Evansville. Vanderburgh County and neighboring counties violated national annual air standards for fine particles from 2005 to 2010, but no longer do, even as standards have tightened.

The same is true across the United States. The amount of tiny airborne particles in the last 10 years nationwide is one-third lower than 2000-2009, EPA statistics show. Smog pollution is down nearly 15% and sulfur dioxide has plunged 80%.

“The Clean Air Act, the EPA’s founding legislation, has been a powerful engine for improving public health as our air has grown visibly clearer and cleaner,” said Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA under President Barack Obama and served as Biden's White House climate adviser. “Millions of Americans have avoided illnesses, hospital visits, and premature deaths thanks to EPA’s cleaner car and truck standards in concert with rules that limit industrial pollution.”

Five rules saving more than $200 billion a year

Five rules together were estimated to have more than $200 billion a year in net benefits, based on EPA documents that estimated reduced illnesses and deaths and the costs for companies to comply.

Three rules dealt with cars and trucks. The “clean car rule” is a tightening of EPA emission standards for vehicles that was supposed to take effect for 2027 model years and eventually have annual net benefits of more than $100 billion a year, according to the agency’s 884-page regulatory analysis. The EPA estimated that over the next three decades this rule alone would prevent 7.9 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, 8,700 tons of particulate matter and 36,000 tons of nitrogen oxides.

Two other proposed rules — one that deals with car models from 2023 to 2027 and another aimed at heavy trucks and buses — are estimated to save nearly $38 billion a year combined through reduced health problems from air pollution, according to EPA’s own detailed calculations.

EPA plays up costs, plays down benefits of targeted rules

Almost none of those benefits are to be found in 10 fact sheets the EPA produced in conjunction with Zeldin's announcement. Nine make no mention of benefits from the rules, while eight mention the costs.

In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.

For example, Biden’s proposed power plant rule was designed to save more than $24 billion a year, prevent about 3,700 annual premature deaths and 3 million asthma incidents from fossil fuel-powered plants, according to EPA documents last year and work by the Environmental Protection Network. Under Trump, the EPA's fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.

Another rule the EPA updated last year sets standards for pollution permitted in the air, called National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The update, required by the Clean Air Act, cuts allowable soot particles by 25% to reflect new science on the harms from such pollution. The EPA in Biden's time calculated the change would annually save as much as $46 billion, 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 asthma incidents.

But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.

“The human body count and human health toll of particulate matter alone is just absolutely massive,” said K. Sabeel Rahman, a Cornell law professor who was a top federal regulatory officer from 2021 to 2023. “Literally tens of thousands of people will lose their lives"" if the standard is rolled back, he said.

A penguin-shaped nebulizer

In southwest Indiana, many people have noticed a positive difference from the EPA regulations. And they're concerned about changes.

In Bloomfield, Jessica Blazier's 11-year-old son Julian has multiple health conditions that make him more sensitive to air quality, including nonallergic rhinitis, which inflames his nasal passage and makes breathing “feel like a knife sometimes,"" in his words. Jessica Blazier said the proposed EPA rule rollbacks are “almost adding insult to injury in our particular circumstance.”

On Thursday, May 22, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a Joint Statement of Interest (the “Joint Statement”) in a lawsuit led by the State of Texas against three large investment companies (the “Asset Managers”).1 The lawsuit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, has been joined by 10 other states (the “Plaintiff States”) and accuses the asset managers of using their positions in climate-focused investment initiatives to manipulate coal markets, driving up the cost of energy and resulting in higher energy prices for American consumers. This action, as the DOJ publicly notes, is the first formal statement by the Agencies in federal court on the antitrust implications of common shareholdings.2

This Joint Statement strongly endorses the Texas-led lawsuit. The Joint Statement further affirms that asset managers and institutional investors may be held liable under Section 7 of the Clayton Act when they use their stock holdings in multiple competitors to achieve anticompetitive outcomes. The Joint Statement signals further potential enforcement on the horizon. The agencies urged the district court to reject several of the arguments advanced by the asset managers in their dismissal motion, including that the alleged conduct falls under a safe harbor exemption for passive investors.

Key takeaways

By filing this Joint Statement, the FTC and DOJ signal an interest in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. These types of cases were pursued under the first Trump administration, and it appears ESG could be a focus of this U.S. administration as well.

This lawsuit, now joined by both U.S. federal competition enforcement agencies, raises the stakes for the case that will test how freely Asset Managers may act with the wealth they manage for investors.

The FTC and DOJ re-affirm their interest in promoting competition in America’s energy markets as a top priority of the U.S. Administration under Trump.

Shareholders who abandon passive investment strategies and bring about a substantial lessening of competition will likely no longer enjoy a safe harbor under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.

In more detail

Case Background

In November of 2024, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced the launch of a lawsuit against three large investment companies, joined by 10 other states. The lawsuit alleges that the Asset Managers artificially reduced output of the U.S. coal in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The Complaint notes that Defendants collectively hold substantial shares in major coal companies, including more than 30% stakes in two Midwest mining companies, which together account for approximately 30% of the coal produced in the U.S. With these large holdings in place, the suit alleges that the firms violated the Clayton Act, which prohibits the acquisition of shares of companies in which “the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition.”3

The Complaint details how the Asset Managers used the influence of their ownership shares in U.S. coal companies to reduce production in the relevant coal markets—dramatically increasing the price of coal. These actions occurred while privately held coal companies, in which Defendants have no ownership stake, scrambled to increase production and capture larger market shares.4

The Complaint identified two relevant product markets. First, the market for South Powder River Basin Coal. Defendants own 30.43%, 34.19%, and 32.87% of the three publicly traded companies that produce South Powder River Basin Coal. Those companies control 63.5% of this relevant market. Second, the market for Thermal Coal. Defendants own between 8.3% and 34.19% of the eight publicly traded companies that produce Thermal Coal. These companies control 46% of the market in Thermal Coal. Plaintiff States allege that each Defendant’s ownership of the Coal Companies creates the sort of anticompetitive arrangement that Section 7 forbids.

The Arguments of the Joint Statement

The Joint Statement supports the Texas-led lawsuit and criticizes the arguments of both the Defendants and the amici in the case. It takes aim at a number of the dismissal arguments asserted by Defendants.

First, the Joint Statement refutes that the Fund Manager’s investments are protected by the “solely for investment” exemption in Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The DOJ and FTC argue that Plaintiff States have alleged conduct far beyond mere investment—that any investment or ownership stake have been used to lessen or harm competition—which is not protected by any exemption. The Joint Statement explains that allegations in this case, that the Asset Managers used their investments to influence or pressure management of the target firms to reduce production, create conduct fully subject to Section 7.

Second, the Joint Statement argues that minority stakes in companies are still not subject to antitrust scrutiny because they allow the Asset Managers to influence business decisions. The Joint Statement further argues that plaintiffs do not need to link competitive harm to specific stock acquisitions, as argued by Defendants in the case. As such, the scope of Section 7 is not merely limited to controlling interests in companies.

Third, the Joint Statement provides assurances that these legal interpretations of Section 7 do not inhibit beneficial practices like passive investing and corporate governance. The DOJ and FTC clarify that they are not seeking to interfere with typical asset manager behavior.

Fourth, the DOJ and FTC explain the general principle that concerted action subject to antitrust scrutiny includes arrangements, including invitations to participate in a plan, that can establish an unlawful conspiracy under the Sherman Act. This applies even where there is no explicit prior agreement but where an invitation contemplates concerted action and where the Defendants’ behavior demonstrates acceptance. The Joint Statement notes that good intentions, such as environmental or climate protection, do not validate concerted anticompetitive behavior like the output restrictions alleged in this case.

Finally, the Joint Statement refutes the Defendants’ position that increases in coal production are a defense from the alleged behavior. The relevant test is whether the concerted behavior resulted in production that was lower than it would otherwise would have been—likely resulting in higher prices than the but-for world where the anticompetitive conduct did not occur.

Significance of the Joint Statement

Companies were already on notice that there has been an interest by the U.S. Administration under Trump on ESG. This Joint Statement is an indication of potential future enforcement, and could embolden private litigants to bring more anticompetitive ESG claims across the country. The Joint Statement also highlights the importance of the energy sector for the U.S. Administration. “The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater.5 The Antitrust Division’s leader declared in her public statement: “We will not hesitate to stand up against powerful financial firms that use Americans’ retirement savings to harm competition under the guise of ESG.”6

The FTC and DOJ clarify the applicability of the Clayton Act to investment behavior that is taken to lessen competition or result in anticompetitive harm. Here, the agencies are concerned about conduct in the energy sector that reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance.7

This Joint Statement, along with subsequent public statements by FTC and DOJ leadership, indicates potential changes in enforcement action by the U.S. Administration within the energy sector as well as wealth management companies that focus on ESG policies. Safe harbor exceptions may also be subject to further scrutiny.

One example is a proposed update to existing EPA emissions standards for vehicles that’s aimed at jump-starting electric cars.
Fact sheets that cite all the costs and (almost) none of the benefits Under Trump, the EPA has created fact sheets that emphasize the costs but not the benefits of the rules.
In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses that AP examined, the estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.
Changing the rules requires following a process The Trump administration has not said how far the targeted rules would be rolled back.","The Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump has served notice it wants to back away from at least 30 major rules that seek to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change. The agency’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, says doing so would mean a new “golden age” for America.

It’s not certain the rules will go away. They can’t be changed without going through a demanding federal rulemaking process.

But an examination by The Associated Press found that gutting the rules would come with high costs in both money and lives.

Here are some takeaways from AP’s work:

Hundreds of billions of dollars in costs, thousands of deaths

The AP examination found that the targeted rules are estimated to save at least $275 billion a year and more than 30,000 lives annually. Those figures were built in part on regulatory impact reports prepared by the EPA itself to factor in things such as reduced illnesses and deaths, as well as how much it would cost companies to comply with the rules. AP also worked with research by the Environmental Protection Network of former agency employees.

AP found about 10,000 American lives were expected to be saved as the rules cut traditional pollutants such as soot, smog and heavy metals like mercury and lead. AP also calculated that doing away with the rules entirely would mean rising greenhouse gas emissions that would in turn drive deadly heat that would account for 25,000 more deaths each year around the world. That calculation also relied on a think-tank report and scientific studies that calculate deaths per ton of emissions.

What some of the rules look like

Some of the rules have been in place for years, while others were written under President Joe Biden and have not yet taken effect because of court challenges or because they are designed to kick in during later years.

One example is a proposed update to existing EPA emissions standards for vehicles that’s aimed at jump-starting electric cars. It’s supposed to take effect for 2027 model years. The EPA’s own analysis estimated net annual benefits of more than $100 billion a year.

Another rule sets the level of traditional pollutants allowable in air that’s deemed clean. The Clean Air Act requires that it be updated every few years. Public health and experts say one type of traditional pollution, particulate matter — better known as soot — is the most deadly in America, with severe consequences when reaching a person’s lungs. In 2024, the Biden administration cut by 25% the amount of particulate matter that states are allowed to emit into the air.

The EPA calculated a net benefit from that rule of as much as $46 billion a year, and the prevention of 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 asthma incidents annually.

Fact sheets that cite all the costs and (almost) none of the benefits

Under Trump, the EPA has created fact sheets that emphasize the costs but not the benefits of the rules.

Nine of 10 fact sheets make no mention of benefits at all. But eight of the fact sheets cite costs.

For example, a fact sheet for one rule that would require newer coal-powered plants to cut or capture carbon emissions by as much as 90% noted that it would cost nearly $1 billion. But that sheet made no mention that the rule was estimated to save more than $24 billion a year.

In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses that AP examined, the estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.

Changing the rules requires following a process

The Trump administration has not said how far the targeted rules would be rolled back. And Zeldin has vowed to follow federal law.

Experts say the targeted rules were the product of rigorous impact analyses that got close scrutiny from the EPA and other federal agencies.

Such rules cannot be undone without presenting scientific justification through a federal rulemaking process that can take years to complete and includes requirements for public comment.

There’s no question that so far, 2025 is a seller’s market for the automotive industry. On top of that, President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to spark high economic uncertainty.

The combination of high prices and a deteriorating labor market makes this an especially difficult time for automakers that primarily deal in expensive vehicles, such as Tesla (TSLA) . But a new company in the space recently revealed something positive for consumers.

As car prices surge, a little-known startup may provide relief

Even as car prices rise, electric vehicle (EV) demand isn’t slowing down. While Industry leader Tesla TSLA has reported declining sales across multiple markets, a report from Cox Automotive shows that EV sales rose more than 11% year-over-year (YOY) in Q1 2025.

Part of Tesla’s problem has been its inability to sell the Cybertruck, its futuristic electric truck that hasn’t been as popular as the company initially estimated. Photos have shown Cybertrucks sitting idly in parking lots across the country. Some drivers who did buy them have attempted to trade them in, despite high value depreciation.

For anyone seeking a fuel-efficient truck, though, a company described as the “Anti-Tesla” is working hard to provide a much more affordable alternative. A Jeff Bezos-backed startup called Slate Automotive is turning heads with its electric pickup trucks, described as “affordable, deeply customizable, and very analog” with no infotainment screen.

Slate’s small, sleek, traditional-looking trucks even come with manual windows, harking back to a previous manufacturing era. In other words, its vehicles are a stark contrast to the highly priced, futuristic Tesla Cybertruck.

As The Street reports, so far, demand for these vehicles has been high, with the number of pre-reservations exceeding 100,000 as of early May. While those figures aren’t sales yet, they indicate that many consumers are interested in owning a Slate truck.

Now the company may be about to add even more prospective buyers to that list. Jeff Jablansky, Slate’s head of public relations, recently revealed that even without EV tax credits, the company’s new trucks will be priced in the “mid-$20,000s,” making them more affordable than many used vehicles.

“When [consumers] turn to something that is more affordable, it usually has higher miles, probably is older, the condition is not as great,” he states. “So we’re working in that framework.”

Musk initially promised that the Cybertruck would cost only $40,000 before raising its price to $100,000. However, Jablansky adds that Slate won’t budge on keeping its prices below $30,000. He also believes that the company will be able to deliver on the range it has promised, something else that Tesla did not do.

Slate Automotive isn’t worried about tariffs, either

Trump’s tariffs have raised some concerning questions for U.S. automakers, as companies brace for rising production costs and supply-chain constraints. But since Slate’s trucks are being built at the company’s facility in Indiana, Jablansky sees the company as shielded from the impact of these policies.

“The next year and a half, pretty much till delivery, we’re refining what we’ve done. We’re not making big engineering decisions — those have been done already. At this point, we’re testing, evaluating, refining,” he says.

If Slate is indeed more protected than its larger peers from the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the company will likely be able to deliver on its promise to keep prices low as its trucks move from the production line to the road.

Additionally, if new vehicle prices continue rising, consumer incentive to buy a new brand of truck for less money is likely to remain high. Slate’s strategy of creating an affordable electric truck for workers that reintroduces basic design features could be poised to pay off.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE0NzE2NzI2OTk3MTY1ODYw/elonmuskteslademandproblem.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:37:54.025689

Sustainability Goals: Hyperscalers have ambitious renewable energy and net-zero goals, which are becoming harder to meet as their total energy consumption skyrockets.
As to whether or not nuclear power plants are going to have a resurgence, I am not sure.
Relabeling nuclear as” clean energy,” might match up to all the other reversals of rules going on these days.","When I first read the headline from the Guardian, Meta has signed a 20-year deal with Constellation for nuclear power in Illinois. Illinois helps subsidize Constellation Energy’s nuclear plant, the Clinton Clean Energy Center, with a ratepayer-funded zero-emissions credit program that awards benefits for the generation of power virtually free of carbon emissions. With Meta’s power purchase agreement, it will provide the plant with an unspecified amount of money to help with relicensing and operations.

I discovered this is actually the third time a power arrangement like this had been reached in the U.S. Google had previously secured power to supply its data centers from Kairos and its reactors in California, and Microsoft made a deal with Constellation to start up Three Mile Island Unit 1again (Unit 2 is the one that had the accident).

Artificial intelligence is partially responsible for the hyperscalers looking to secure “clean” electricity as U.S. power demand rises significantly. to supply its data centers.

Hyperscalers like AWS, MSFT, Google, etc.) are facing immense power challenges for their massive, centralized data centers due to:

Explosive Growth of AI: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) require unprecedented computational power, leading to a massive increase in server rack density and overall power consumption. GPUs, especially, are far more power-hungry than traditional CPUs.

Grid Strain: Existing electrical grids in many regions are struggling to provide enough power to meet the demand from new hyperscale data center builds. This leads to delays in bringing new capacity online and can strain local grids.

Sustainability Goals: Hyperscalers have ambitious renewable energy and net-zero goals, which are becoming harder to meet as their total energy consumption skyrockets. Sourcing enough clean, firm power (24/7 renewable energy) is a significant hurdle.

Transmission and Distribution Limitations: Even if generation capacity exists, the physical infrastructure (transmission lines, substations) may not be sufficient to deliver that power to concentrated data center campuses.

In addition to the concerns that have led to these deals for the hyperscalers come the concerns of the power companies themselves, which is why 20-year contracts have been put in place by Constellation.

“We’re definitely having conversations with other clients, not just in Illinois, but really across the country, to step in and do what Meta has done, which is essentially give us a backstop so that we could make the investments needed to relicense these assets and keep them operating,” said Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation.

Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, explained that, “One of the things that we hear very acutely from utilities is they want to have certainty that power plants operating today will continue to operate.”

Conclusion:

It’s no doubt the demand is real and going to drive a lot of commitment between power companies seeking “a backup” while the hyperscalers seek a dedicated resource that they can rely on now and in the future.

As to whether or not nuclear power plants are going to have a resurgence, I am not sure. Relabeling nuclear as” clean energy,” might match up to all the other reversals of rules going on these days. I personally will find it ironic that the people who attended “no nukes” rallies are going to have to rethink their positions or give up their favorite social media platforms.

In justifying climate rollbacks, the president says many of his predecessor’s policies have hurt rather than helped the American people.","BOSTON (TNS) — Electric car subsidies are heading for the chopping block. A tax bill recently passed by House Republicans is set to stop billions in taxpayer cash from being spent on electric vehicle purchases.

If embraced by the Senate and signed into law by President Donald Trump, the bill would gut long-standing government handouts for going electric.

The move comes on the heels of another climate policy embraced by Republicans. Earlier this year, Trump announced plans to roll back burdensome rules that effectively force American consumers to buy electric, rather than gas-fueled, cars. The Environmental Protection Agency has called that move the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.”

Not everyone sees it that way. Jason Rylander, legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, assailed Trump’s efforts, noting that his “administration’s ignorance is trumped only by its malice toward the planet.”

Other similarly aligned groups have voiced similar sentiments arguing that ending these rules would “cost consumers more, because clean energy and cleaner cars are cheaper than sticking with the fossil fuels status quo.”

Backtracking on EV purchasing mandates seems to have hit Trump haters particularly hard. That mandate — established by President Joe Biden — would have pushed U.S. automakers to sell more EVs. Millions more. Electric cars currently account for 8% of new auto sales. Biden ordered— by presidential fiat — that figure to climb to 35% by 2032. If you believe the hype, the result would be an electric nirvana, one defined by cleaner air and rampant job creation.

I’m not convinced. For one thing, cleaner air courtesy of electrification requires that EVs replace gas-powered autos. They’re not. In fact, study after study suggests that the purchase of EVs adds to the number of cars in a household.

And two-thirds of households with an EV have another non-EV that is driven more — hardly a recipe for climate success given that EVs must be driven (a lot) to deliver climate benefits. Fewer miles driven in an EV also challenges the economic efficiency of the billions Washington spends annually to subsidize their purchase.

Claims of job creation thanks to EVs are even more questionable. These claims are predicated around notions of aggressive consumer demand that drives increased EV manufacturing. This in turn creates jobs.

A recent Princeton University study noted, “Announced manufacturing capacity additions and expansions would nearly double U.S. capacity to produce electric vehicles by 2030 and are well sized to meet expected demand for made-in-USA vehicles.”

Jobs would be created if there were demand for EVs. Except that’s not what’s happening. Rather, consumer interest in EVs has effectively cratered. In 2024, 1.3 million EVs were sold in the United States, up from 1.2 million in 2023. This paltry increase is even more worrying given drastic price cuts seen in the EV market in 2024. Tesla knocked thousands of dollars off its best-selling Model 3 and Model Y. Ford followed suit by cutting prices on its Mach-e. So did Volkswagen and Hyundai.

Despite deep discounts, consumer interest in electrification remains — to put it mildly — tepid at best. So, when people equate electrification with robust job creation, I’m left wondering what they are going on about.

Even if jobs were created, EV advocates are coy about how many of those jobs would benefit existing autoworkers. Would all these workers — currently spread across large swaths of the Midwest — be guaranteed jobs on an EV assembly line? If not, how many workers should expect to receive pink slips? For those who do, will they be able to find new jobs that pay as much as their old ones? Touting job creation for political expediency is one thing. Fully recognizing its impact on hardworking American families today, another.

Some Americans may decry Trump’s actions on climate, but they have only themselves to blame. Many of the pro-climate policies enacted, particularly during the Biden era, deliver little in the way of climate benefits (or any benefit for that matter) while making a mockery of the real economic concerns businesses and consumers have about climate action.

No more. In justifying climate rollbacks, the president says many of his predecessor’s policies have hurt rather than helped the American people. He’s right and should be commended for doing something about it.

While Bollinger Motors will live on, questions have been raised around Mullen's own troubled financial situation and ability to support the truck maker going forward.","Oak Park electric truck maker Bollinger Motors Inc. will live on after it emerged from receivership this week with a new CEO and ownership structure.

A federal judge early last month had ordered the company to be overseen by the independent third party amid recent financial woes that had halted production and were affecting its ability to pay employees and make rent payments. The order came as part of a lawsuit filed by Robert Bollinger, the company's founder and former CEO, who said the truck maker owed him about $10 million. It appeared the once high-flying EV startup's decade-long run was coming to an end with its assets distributed to creditors.

But now court records and company statements from Bollinger and its parent Mullen Automotive Inc. say the receiver has been removed and the case involving Robert Bollinger's outstanding $10 million loan settled.

California-based Mullen said it as acquired an additional 21% stake in Bollinger, bringing its ownership to 95%, with Mullen's CEO David Michery now also taking over as head of Bollinger. A spokesperson said Bryan Chambers, the former CEO, is no longer with the company.

“Our investment in acquiring the vast majority of remaining shares and resolving certain significant outstanding debt demonstrates our belief in and continued commitment to Bollinger's vehicle lineup and future,"" Michery said in a statement.

Bollinger started making an electric chassis cab truck called the B4 last year, and a larger version, the B5, was scheduled for release in 2026.

A Mullen statement on the case's resolution said that Bollinger would continue to operate as an ""independent majority subsidiary, maintaining its own brand identity and focus."" It added current and future Bollinger customers should expect ""business as usual.""

Court records say Mullen agreed to fund the expenses of the receiver, Gene Kohut, and recent payroll costs during the receivership as it resolved the company's $10 million outstanding loan from Robert Bollinger.

While Bollinger Motors will live on, questions have been raised around Mullen's own troubled financial situation and ability to support the truck maker going forward. It has racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in losses over the last year, U.S. Securities and Exchange filings show. At a Detroit court hearing last month, Bollinger company executives said as the company faced increasing strain and ran low on cash in recent months, majority-owner Mullen had not provided sufficient support or direction to avoid issues that included halts to its production, missed payments to suppliers and landlords, and problems making 401(k) contributions to employees.

Then-CEO Chambers also said in early May that the company had sold two of its trucks in the prior month, with about 40 in inventory.

“In the past several weeks our message to customers and dealers is that we are open for business, focused on our customers and optimistic about our future,” Jim Connelly, chief revenue officer for Bollinger Motors, said in a statement. “The market for commercial EVs is full of opportunity and we continue to deliver world-class vehicles to help customers meet their fleet electrification needs.”

Michery told Crain's Detroit Business this week that he wants production of the company's Class 4 trucks to resume in 8 to 10 weeks, and promised to eventually grow its current Detroit-area staff of about 85 people. He was not immediately available for an interview Thursday.

DETROIT — The automotive industry is experiencing unprecedented disruption and uncertainty when it comes to regulations, electric vehicles, software innovations and competition from China.

Such disruptions have been years in the making, but many of the issues are coming to a head sooner rather than later, causing chaos for automakers and their plans for new vehicles.

""The unprecedented EV head-fake has wreaked havoc on product plans,"" Top Bank of America Securities analyst John Murphy said in the firm's annual ""Car Wars"" report. ""The next four+ years will be the most uncertain and volatile time in product strategy ever.""

The proprietary ""Car Wars"" report predicts future products and plans over the next several years. The thesis of the report is that replacement rate (or the percentage of vehicles that are expected to be replaced by newer models) drives showroom age, which drives market share, which drives profits and stock prices.

Automakers above an industry average replacement rate of 16% over the next four years include Tesla (22.4%), Honda Motor (16.9%), Hyundai Motor/Kia (16.5%) and Ford Motor (16.1%), according to Car Wars. At the bottom end of the analysis are Nissan Motor (12.3%), Toyota Motor (13.7%) and traditional European automakers (15.2%). General Motors is at 15.7%, while Stellantis is at 15.4%.

Aside from the replacement rates, Murphy on Wednesday made several predictions about the auto industry. Here are five investors should know about:

EV write-downs

Murphy expects the roughly $1.9 billion in expenses and write-downs Ford announced last year due to the termination of a planned all-electric three row SUV will be the first of many such losses for automakers regarding EVs.

""There's a lot of tough decisions that are going to need to be made,"" he said Wednesday during an Automotive Press Association event in suburban Detroit. ""Based on the ['Car Wars'] study, I think we're going to see multibillion-dollar write-downs that are flooding the headlines for the next few years.""

Automakers rushed to spend billions of dollars in recent years for EVs in anticipation of a market that hasn't developed as quickly as expected.

Return to core

Amid the EV uncertainty, many automakers have pivoted to ""customer choice,"" which means significant investments in other technologies such as hybrids and plug-in hybrid vehicles, as well as in traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE).

Due to that volatility and uncertainty, Murphy said automakers must lean heavily into their core products, including internal combustion engines, to generate capital.

Toyota

""Really, everybody is leaning back into their into their core over the next four years in very uncertain times,"" Murphy said, noting that cash ""is going to be critically important"" for automakers in the years ahead.

The title of this year's ""Car Wars"" investor note underscores that change: ""The ICE Age Cometh as EV Plans Freeze.""

China industry collapse

Industry uncertainty isn't exclusive to the U.S. The Chinese auto industry — the world's largest car sales market — is in the midst of a price war and stalling sales.

""What you're seeing in China is a bit disturbing because there is a lack of demand; there's extreme price cutting, and there's a lot of export that's rising, particularly over the last four or five years. Essentially net neutral to over 7 million units last year,"" Murphy said.

The top BofA analyst described this as the Chinese market beginning to ""implode on itself"" due to the price war, which is expected to cause mass consolidation of China's hundreds of automotive brands.

In China, the average car retail price has fallen by around 19% over the past two years to around 165,000 yuan ($22,900), according to a Nomura report this week, citing industry data from Autohome Research Institute.

Price cuts were far steeper for hybrid or range-extension vehicles, at 27% over the last two years, while battery-only cars saw prices slashed by 21%, the report said. It noted that traditional fuel-powered cars saw a below-average 18% price cut.

While very few exports come to the U.S., Murphy said it's expected Chinese brands will eventually compete in the market. However, he cautioned it might be best to shield the U.S. market from Chinese brands in the near-term to avoid such issues domestically.

""I don't think just from a technology or geopolitical perspective, that you really want to wall off the U.S. from China. It may be just simply that massive excess capacity you want to protect the U.S. market from until it works itself out and we see massive consolidation in the Chinese market,"" he said, adding there's good reason for massive tariffs on Chinese car imports.

Product shifts

""Car Wars"" predicts there will be a shift in new vehicle introductions during the second half of this decade, as automakers refocus product lineups and slow replacement rates in the near term.

A major shift is in crossover vehicles — which have a combination of SUV and car characteristics — that have significantly grown in popularity in past decades.

BofA reports the crossover ""surge is done."" For the first time nearly 20 years, Murphy said crossovers underrepresented versus the launch gains for the past 10 to 20 years.

""What's wild this year is that we expect 159 models to be launched over the next four years. Last year was over 200; traditionally, it's over 200,"" Murphy said. ""We have never seen this kind of change before.""

Part of the shift comes as the Detroit automakers — major producers of such vehicles — have focused on updating or redesigning their highly profitable full-size pickup trucks.

Japanese automakers have also had an uncharacteristically volatile product cadence, with a focus on cars, according to the report.

Auto growth area?

Investors have been skeptical of many auto stocks in recent years as expected growth areas have faltered.

But Murphy believes there's still notable potential for automakers as well as their retailers in software — a focus area for companies as of late that also has not grown as much as initially expected.

""In the near term, it's leveraging the connectivity, going after what we know is a very lucrative part of the value chain,"" Murphy said. ""They've been somewhat shut off from lack of attention to the consumer and a dealer body that needs to be reworked to some degree in a significant way, will create a real, real opportunity.""

The aftermarket industry and business at dealerships, including sales and service, represents $2.4 trillion in revenue, Murphy said. Of that $1.2 trillion captured by dealers, they generate about $53 billion in profits. He argues there's another $1.2 trillion that's escaping automakers, with $133 billion in profitability that could be gained through vehicle connectivity.

""It is vision critical that you get the dealers on board with this and drive this,"" Murphy said regarding getting customers into dealerships instead of non-franchised repair shops.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108138834-1746032874620-IMG_8425.JPG?v=1746033011&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-06-05 14:25:59.813018

The Campbell unit was scheduled to retire at the end of May 2025.
Electricity markets like MISO already have a process for ensuring units stay online for reliability, known as Reliability Must Run (RMR).
MISO did not request to keep Campbell online.
It doesn’t help reliability—MISO itself didn’t make that claim—and it distorts price signals.","The Department of Energy (DOE) is requiring MISO to keep Michigan’s 1,560 MW Campbell coal-fired unit online after reviewing the capacity prices from MISO’s latest auction. The Campbell unit was scheduled to retire at the end of May 2025. This kind of federal directive is virtually unheard of in wholesale energy markets. MISO—regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)—should reject DOE’s order. It sets a troubling precedent.

Electricity markets like MISO already have a process for ensuring units stay online for reliability, known as Reliability Must Run (RMR). In MISO, the equivalent designation is called System Support Resource (SSR). These SSR contracts are time-limited, cost-based, and must be filed with FERC. MISO only pays the operating costs necessary to keep the plant online until a transmission or non-wires alternative is in place.

What DOE is doing here bypasses that process. MISO did not request to keep Campbell online. News reports quote MISO as confirming this. The State of Michigan also did not request DOE intervention. So we have a situation where the market doesn’t need the unit, the state supports its retirement, and yet DOE is forcing its continued operation. That’s a clear overstep.

At any given point in time, MISO has “unplanned” generation outages. During the course of the year, on average MISO has 15,750 MW on these unplanned outages. So, does MISO really need a 1,560 MW unit to maintain reliability?

DOE justifies this decision by citing NERC’s 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment, which flagged an “elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand or low resource output” in MISO, particularly in August. DOE’s order claims that the Campbell retirement would “further decrease available dispatchable generation” and that “additional dispatch of the Campbell Plant is necessary to best meet the emergency and serve the public interest”.

DOE points to high capacity prices in the recent MISO auction—but these prices are the result of MISO and its Independent Market Monitor moving away from the old vertical demand curve. That previous curve did not provide efficient locational price signals because prices were either flat or spiked to the Cost of New Entry (CONE), with no granularity in between. MISO sought FERC’s approval to shift to a Reliability-Based Demand Curve (RBDC), which FERC accepted. That’s why prices are higher now—not because of a sudden, urgent need for one specific coal plant.

MISO’s own 2025-26 Planning Resource Auction report clearly stated that capacity was sufficient overall, but highlighted that “new capacity additions were insufficient to offset…retirements” in some areas. Importantly, MISO still did not designate Campbell as a System Support Resource despite these findings.

High capacity prices are a signal. They can be addressed through supply (e.g., new generation), demand response, storage, or other solutions. It’s not MISO’s job—or DOE’s—to pick a preferred technology like coal. Resource adequacy is the responsibility of individual states in MISO. If a state like Indiana wants to offer incentives for retiring coal units to stay open, that’s its prerogative. That’s how a multi-state ISO should work—allowing diverse state policy preferences to feed into a unified market structure.

MISO has long respected these variations. Its market algorithm balances generation and load across the region to find the least-cost solution to serve the next megawatt. That’s how renewables are able to operate in MISO today, supported by state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and policies—like those in Minnesota and Iowa—that require transmission buildout. MISO’s first Multi-Value Projects (MVP) portfolio was a direct response to these policies.

DOE’s order overrides this entire market-based approach. It directs MISO to “take every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant,” and compels Consumers Energy to comply with MISO’s orders regarding the plant’s availability. This is the first known use of Section 202(c) to override a planned retirement not deemed essential by the RTO itself.

Forcing a coal unit to stay online despite no SSR designation undermines the market. It doesn’t help reliability—MISO itself didn’t make that claim—and it distorts price signals. That’s bad policy and bad economics.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/5282775793_cc38f2f84d_z-1.webp,N,,2025-06-06 08:38:02.198504

These credits had been central to the Biden administration’s climate agenda, offering incentives for electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and industrial decarbonization.

The House-passed version of the bill would eliminate the majority of these subsidies, as Republican leaders continue to falsely frame the IRA as the Green New Deal. According to Heatmap, Senate Republicans have so far preserved most of the House’s repeals, though the Finance Committee has yet to weigh in on the most contentious element — the IRA’s tax credits, which are now a flashpoint among Republicans as backlash grows in red districts that have reaped the law’s economic benefits.

That intraparty tension stems from a geographic and economic reality: Many of the IRA’s largest beneficiaries are Republican districts. According to a June 2024 CNN analysis of Rhodium and MIT data, nearly 78% of IRA-linked clean energy investments, totaling $268 billion, have gone to GOP-held districts, fueling EV plants, solar factories, and battery storage facilities across the South and Midwest. With repeal now on the table, some Republicans are hedging, criticizing the Biden-era law rhetorically while quietly working to safeguard the economic gains in their own districts.

This tension was highlighted during the June 4 episode of CNN's Inside Politics, when chief climate correspondent Bill Weir walked through the political risk Republicans face.

Featured: Fiduciary Future

The ugly details of the Big Beautiful Bill’s damage to US clean energy competitiveness. Cuts to Medicaid and other health programs in the current version of the Republican tax and budget bill now before the US Senate could lead to more than 51,000 deaths annually, according to researchers at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania, President Trump’s alma mater. More than three million people would lose access to SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps. And the $2.4 trillion the bill would add to the national debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office, caused even Trump’s one-time First Buddy Elon Musk to slam it as “a disgusting abomination.”

And then there’s the damage the GOP budget, known officially as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, would wreak on the roll out of clean energy capacity and the reshoring of key supply chains that was just gaining traction. “There is nothing beautiful about the current budget bill’s obstruction of US clean energy progress and American economic competitiveness,” Danielle Fugere and Diana Myers of As You Sow, the nonprofit shareholder advocacy organization, write in a Fiduciary Future guest post on ImpactAlpha. “Pulling the plug on these crucial investments weakens the innovation ecosystem that historically fueled America’s economic leadership, putting the US at a competitive disadvantage with geopolitical rivals like China.”

Making the case. Should the budget bill pass the Senate in its current form, it would slash funding for critical research and development in technology and clean energy, and abruptly repeal key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, despite its success in driving $321 billion in new private investment across 2,369 domestic clean-energy facilities. Impact and climate fund managers descended on Capitol Hill this week to try and stem the damage. “To keep capital flowing and projects moving forward, investors need stable, predictable policy,” said Mike Reynolds of Ultra Capital, a Philadelphia-based growth equity investor. “We encourage the Senate to continue its support of the energy tax credits, which will help to unlock more private investment and fuel America’s energy dominance.” Reynolds was part of a delegation from Impact Capital Managers that met with members of the Senate Finance Committee this week.

Second thoughts. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she would have voted against the bill in the House over the section that would strip states’ ability to regulate artificial intelligence for at least a decade – she said she hadn’t read the full bill. Musk, who once supported cuts to clean energy investments and EV credits, has also changed his tune. Tesla has reportedly spent some $240,000 on lobbying to keep the EV credits, among other issues. Tesla faces an even bigger threat, if California is forced to end its zero-emission vehicle mandate. Tesla has padded its bottom line by $11 billion over the past decade by selling compliance credits to other auto makers that don’t meet the state’s emission regulations and federal fuel standards. The Senate has voted to end California’s waiver of federal regulations it needs for the emissions regulations. JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman estimated in January that Tesla would lose $1.2 billion a year from the repeal of the EV tax credits and another $2 billion in profits from proposed changes to California’s credit program. In this year’s first quarter, Tesla would have reported a loss without the $442 million in revenues from regulatory credits.

How the Mission Driven Bank Fund is tackling wealth inequalities in US communities. Microsoft and Truist answered a call from the US government’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation four years ago to create a pooled investment fund to finance mission-driven banks in underbanked US communities. The corporations helped launch the Mission Driven Bank Fund with an initial $120 million, which also included an anchor commitment from Warner Brothers Discovery. The private investment fund sought to raise $500 million to offer flexible, below-market-rate capital and technical assistance to FDIC-insured, mission-driven banks as well as federally designated minority depository institutions and community development financial institutions. It has raised just over $70 million in additional funds. The Mission Driven Bank Fund (unaffiliated with Mission Driven Finance) has secured commitments from banks including Enterprise Bank and Trust, Hancock Whitney Bank, Banner Bank and Lake City Bank.

Community Finance. The fund has backed 10 mission-driven banks to date, including Grand Bank for Savings, or Grand.bank, a minority depository institution and federal savings bank in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Grand.bank has a goal to improve the financial wellbeing of more than a million people in the state’s underserved communities by 2030. The community bank hopes to do so through “affordable homeownership” products like down-payment assistant loans and seller-financed mortgages for first-time home buyers. “The financial and technical services support of the Mission Driven Bank Fund will help us reach that goal,” said Grand.bank’s Chris Sawyer. Mission Driven Bank declined to disclose the investment amount. Other banks in Mission Driven Bank’s portfolio include American Bank, an MDI in Texas, and FNBC Bank, a CDFI that operates in Arkansas and Missouri’s underserved communities.

Bridging wealth gaps. Mission Driven Bank, co-managed by Black-led asset management firm Elizabeth Park Capital Management and impact investor Calvert Impact, has a pipeline of 300 mission-driven MDI and CDFI banks the managers believe could make a dent in the racial wealth gap by expanding the financial capacity of local banks to finance homeowners and small businesses. Misperception of risk and other racial biases in lending from national lenders have also played a key role. Just 142 of the approximately 4,500 banks and savings institutions the FDIC insures qualify as minority depository institutions with 51% or more of the voting stock owned by minority individuals.

Altérra commits $56.3 million alongside I Squared Capital for Italian solar and battery storage projects. The UAE’s $30 billion private climate investment fund Altérra, via its Altérra Acceleration Fund, committed €50 million ($56.3 million) to Absolute Energy, an Italian developer of small to medium-scale solar projects. American infrastructure-focused private equity firm I Squared Capital, which acquired a 95% stake in Absolute Energy in 2023, was a co-investor in the deal. The funding will support the development of 1.4 megawatts of solar and battery storage projects, as part of a larger 6 megawatt pipeline. I Squared Capital’s Sadek Wahba said the two investors shared a “commitment to deploying capital with urgency and impact.”

Capital mobilization. Altérra invests in large-scale projects via its $25 billion acceleration fund and provides risk mitigation capital for emerging markets via its $5 billion transformation fund. It has committed $6.5 billion since its launch at COP28 in 2023, either directly or via various climate transition funds managed by TPG, Brookfield and BlackRock. Its investments span wind, solar, battery storage and waste management projects in India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, France, Australia, the UK and other countries. Altérra also partnered with the Global Energy Alliance for People And Planet or GEAPP and the Rockefeller Foundation last year, to mobilize public, private and philanthropic capital for clean energy transition projects in emerging markets.

‘Triple dividends’ of climate resilience investments are highest in health and disaster management. Each dollar invested in climate adaptation and resilience yielded more than $10 dollars in benefits over the course of a decade, according to the World Resources Institute. The nonprofit calculated the returns from 320 such investments across a dozen countries totaling $133 billion, and found potential returns of $1.4 trillion, for an average annual return of 27%. The highest returns came from health projects, which had an annual rate of return of 78.5%. The high returns from health projects “is not surprising since the value of avoided losses, measured in terms of mortality and morbidity is very high,” write the authors of the report, “A Triple Dividend Approach.” The triple dividend refers to risk reduction from losses avoided due to climate disasters, economic growth from job creation, improved yields and overall social and environmental health that encompasses health and biodiversity improvement.

Resilient infrastructure. The Kenya Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Program, for example, was launched with a total project cost of $458 million to provide climate-resilient water and sanitation services. WRI estimated the project to have a net present value of $2.57 billion. In Bangladesh, the $129 million Weather and Climate Services Regional Project, funded by the World Bank, had a net present value of $414 million. The project aims to strengthen the ability to deliver reliable weather, water, and climate information in the flood-prone country. In South Africa, the C40 Cities Finance Facility supported Transformative Riverine Management in the eThekwini Municipal Area. The nature-based solution aims to tackle flooding in the region, alongside creating jobs and improving transportation. WRI places its net present value at $2 billion, nearly six times its original cost.

Grid rules developed during periods of relatively slow growth aren’t equipped for the demands of Silicon Valley’s investment in artificial intelligence, extreme weather shocks, and deep national and state political divisions over energy and climate policy, grid operators told members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

“AI is going to change our world,” said Manu Asthana, CEO of the PJM Interconnection, grid operator for 67 million customers in all or parts of 13 Eastern states and the District of Columbia.

“In our forecast between 2024 and 2030, currently we have a 32-gigawatt increase in demand, of which 30 is from data centers,” Asthana said. “We need to stabilize market rules and find that intersection between reliability and affordability that works both for consumers and suppliers, and that intersection is getting harder and harder to find.”

Lanny Nickell, CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, PJM’s counterpart in a band of Great Plains states, said extreme weather threats and the increasing role of weather-dependent wind and solar power put outages at 125 times more likely to happen than eight years ago. “As if this wasn’t challenging enough,” he said, “we are now projecting our peak demand to be as much as 75 percent higher 10 years from now, and that’s largely driven by electrification and data center growth.”

Jim Robb, CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the architect of transmission grid standards, said grid operators need “much deeper insight” into future electricity supply and demand and the probabilities of extreme storms and heat waves that could push power demand to new peaks. Limited real-time information about the effect that dangerous storms have on gas pipeline deliveries to electric turbines is also an area of concern that has been left unresolved by the broader energy industry.

Current industry risk analysis cannot do the job, Robb said in comments filed for a two-day conference at FERC’s Washington headquarters.

“This will require stronger modeling of fuel and capacity performance to assess reliability risk,” Robb said. The industry needs to establish an agreed-upon profile of the likely risks operators face, like the “design basis” accident scenarios that nuclear power plant operators are required to defend against.

Susan Bruce, counsel to a group of industrial power customers, said her coalition shares “serious concerns” about regional grid reliability and the ability to add enough new electric generation to keep pace with demand, particularly from “unprecedented but undefined” growth of data center and cryptocurrency mining operations.

“There is a lack of trust that even very high prices” in grid markets “can move the needle” to get new nonrenewable generation in service, she said in remarks filed with the commission.

“New rules of the road are necessary,” she said.

‘States leaning on other states’

Sharp divisions at national and state levels over climate policies is apparent inside PJM, said FERC Chair Mark Christie.

Christie told PJM’s Asthana, “You’ve got 13 states plus the District, you’ve got widely divergent policies from New Jersey to West Virginia, from Indiana to Maryland.

“It puts you in an impossible position,” Christie continued. “How can you guys balance these incredibly divergent political goals and try to run a market … that fits the economic textbooks?”

One answer, broached by Christie and several state regulators at the conference, was to push more responsibility on states to meet grid reliability challenges. Panelists at the FERC conference debated whether electricity reliability and affordability would be helped if states ordered utilities to purchase part of the generation they expect to need in the future, rather than relying on PJM’s competitive energy markets to deliver supply.

“How do we make it work without the states having a much larger role?” Christie asked.

“We acknowledge that the states need a role because we are responsible for resource adequacy,” said Jacob Finkel, deputy secretary for policy for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), who has led a challenge to PJM policies by Democratic governors in its region. “We have a responsibility to our ratepayers for affordability.”

“It’s easy to throw darts at PJM,” said Kelsey Bagot, a member of the Virginia State Corp. Commission. “To the extent we want a larger role in the process, we have to demonstrate that as a group of states with very different regulatory structures and very different goals and policies, that we can actually function as a collaborative body and make decisions.

“I think that challenge has been handed to us,” Bagot said.

Dennis Deters, a member of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, sided with Bagot, a fellow red-state regulator. “We are reactive,” he said. “Too many states are relying on [PJM] to provide resource adequacy.

“I do shudder to think of injecting more politics into an engineering effort,” he added.

Michael Richard, a member of the Maryland Public Service Commission, said the divisions were over principle rather than politics. “You know, Maryland policymakers, we believe the science on climate change.”

Christie several times pressed panelists for opinions on whether states should be held accountable if their utilities aren’t building enough generation to meet reliability needs, which, in his calculation, means generation that can operate around the clock, not renewables. “If you don’t build enough, maybe you need to pay a penalty. Clearly, there are states leaning on other states,” he said.

“The states have the ability to do a lot of direct contracting and direct support for their policies,” PJM’s Asthana said. “We have seen the state of New Jersey, for example, directly support offshore wind. We have supported them in that pursuit, and that can work.”

Gordon van Welie, president of ISO New England, said that states can lose control. “We know from experience that it’s very hard building fossil resources in New England,” he said. A key part of the region’s answer was investment in offshore wind. Now the Trump administration has thrown up barriers to that option, he added.

“So that puts us in a very difficult place as we enter 2030,” he said. “Something’s got to give in that equation. Otherwise we have trouble.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2f/13/14c1db8e45ee91be9bd57760dd2b/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/506185902,N,,2025-06-06 08:36:37.398128

President Donald Trump’s proposed budget, released Friday, would reduce federal funding for waste and recycling activity. The budget is for fiscal year 2026, which begins Oct. 1, and is Trump's opening offer before negotiations take place with Congress on the final budget.

The proposal includes wide-ranging cuts, including to the U.S. EPA. It would cut the Superfund program’s appropriated funds by about 47%. It would also cut the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery's budget by 42%.

The cuts are the administration's latest efforts to shrink or otherwise curtail federal action on a range of environmental issues. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has characterized those moves, which include staff cuts, as essential to operating as efficiently as possible.

Dive Insight:

The Trump administration has halted or attempted to rescind funds that were allocated through grant programs during the Biden administration, calling them wasteful. That’s caused temporary disruptions in funding for Recycling Education and Outreach grant recipients and canceled Community Change Grant contracts which would have supported composting.

The agency has also sought broad authority to dismiss federal employees. Earlier this week, Zeldin said he wanted to return the EPA to Reagan-level staffing levels. Since Jan. 1, the EPA has lost an estimated 733 staffers, according to The Hill. The total rate of attrition could be higher, as that number reportedly does not include employees who took a buyout or are probationary and may have been dismissed, pending court cases.

The budget proposal anticipates staffing cuts alongside changes to program office funding. It would cut funding across RCRA activities. Within the program office, corrective action funding would decline roughly 35% to about $25.1 million; waste management funding would decline roughly 44% to about $40.4 million; and waste minimization and recycling funding would decline by 56% to about $4.3 million. The proposal did not give an explanation of those cuts.

The Superfund office's budget reflects ""the need for efficiencies and operational improvements"" across the EPA, according to Trump's proposal. It also reflects a proposal to fund the office's remediation program through annual income from recently reinstated excise taxes, rather than through general appropriations. The taxes, which expired in 1995 but were revived by the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act, add fees to certain chemicals, substances and petroleum products. Trump's budget anticipates $1.6 billion in funds collected in FY 2025 available for the upcoming fiscal year.

The plan for the office would add 45.7 full-time employees while zeroing out appropriated funding, which totaled $187.8 million in the FY 2025 budget.

Of the total funding requested, $6.8 million and 812.8 full-time employees are for Superfund enforcement-related activities. That represents a cut of about $10 million year over year.

The agency's civil enforcement division would also take a hit through the proposal. Trump proposed slashing the division's budget by $61 million while cutting 180.8 full-time employees. In its explanation, the proposal states: ""EPA will return to reasonable enforcement actions and refocus efforts toward areas with significant noncompliance issues and where enforcement can address the most substantial impacts to human health and the environment.""

The agency proposed revisiting its enforcement priorities — which in recent years has included a focus on landfill emissions and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — the same day it announced dozens of regulatory rollbacks.

The budget requests $5 million to administer the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grants program, which has handed out tens of millions of dollars in funding in recent years. In April, the EPA said it was still working to approve about $78 million in grants through the program.

Other grant programs are on the list of cuts. The budget would eliminate Resource Recovery and Hazardous Waste Grants, which totaled more than $101 million in FY 2025. It would also eliminate a categorical grant program for brownfield remediation, while reducing a related State and Tribal Assistance Grant program by $18 million.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-8h5nd1HCb53sxIqgtEzMp7qIT7zdJ1DsDsXH54EFyU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfODkwMS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-06-05 14:25:22.546018

Dive Brief:

Meta and energy producer Constellation Energy announced a 20-year nuclear power purchase agreement on Tuesday that will give the social media and tech conglomerate access to zero emissions power for its artificial intelligence goals and help keep an Illinois facility online.

The agreement will give Meta 1,121 megawatts of nuclear energy beginning in June 2027 from Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. The PPA will also support the relicensing and continued operations of the Illinois power plant when a state zero emissions energy tax credit expires in 2027.

Meta is among a growing number of tech giants who have turned to nuclear to help offset growing data center energy needs driven by artificial intelligence. The company previously released requests for proposals seeking up to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear energy generation capacity to support its “AI innovation and sustainability objectives.”

Dive Insight:

Meta’s deal will also allow Constellation to expand the facility to generate an additional 30 megawatts of power during the 20-year extension of operations, which will also preserve more than 1,000 jobs and deliver an estimated $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the June 3 release.

The Clinton Clean Energy Center had previously been saved by a state zero emissions tax credit program, after it was slated for closure in 2017. Meta’s power purchase agreement is designed to replace that credit and support the continued operations of the plant “without ratepayer support,” according to Constellation.

Meta Head of Global Energy Urvi Parekh said in the release that in addition to ensuring the long-term operation of the plant and preserving jobs, the deal demonstrates that “this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.” The deal will also aid the global tech and social media conglomerate in its goal to reach zero emissions across its supply chain by 2030.

“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Parekh said.

Constellation said it is also exploring strategies that would extend an existing early site permit at the plant or approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop either an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor at the Illinois site.

This deal marks the second high-profile nuclear power purchase agreement Constellation has signed with a tech giant, following Microsoft’s 20-year agreement with the energy producer last fall. This deal will restart operations for a nuclear generator at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island facility in 2028.

Constellation CEO and President Joseph Dominguez said that after its plans to restart the Three Mile Island facility became national news, Meta questioned why “such a valuable plant” would be allowed to close in the first place, then “figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy.”

Meta — along with fellow tech giants Google and Amazon — was among a group of “large energy users” who signed a pledge to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050 at S&P Global’s CERAWeek conference in March. Google recently announced a deal with Elementl Power to advance the early stage development of three advanced nuclear energy projects.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/TPehPRs8AWvOZJWpiR6PZZfFa7-leXXYlInZNZu3Lb4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DbGludG9uX0NsZWFuX0VuZXJneV9DZW50ZXJfY291cnRlc3R5X0NvbnN0ZWxsYXRpb24uanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-05 14:22:14.999790

Since then, the IEA said that continuously growing investment in renewable energy has been driven by “technologies that are increasingly mature and cost-competitive.” While emissions reductions are a major factor driving investment and supportive policies, the IEA said the economic and energy security benefits of renewable energy are increasingly driving investment decisions.
This trend holds true across much of the developing world, which has lagged significantly behind wealthier nations in electrification and carbon reduction investment.
Even India, one of the leading markets for solar PV and renewable energy investments and one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, has issues around the cost of capital for utility-scale renewables projects.
The IEA report said: “India’s cost of capital for grid-scale renewable energy is one of the lowest among its emerging market and developing economy counterparts.","The World Energy Investment 2025 report did caveat this growth, saying that the prospects for new projects (rather than existing ones) are less certain:

“Open questions about the economic and trade outlook mean that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new project approvals, but we have yet to see significant implications for spending on existing projects,” the report said.

The biggest sectors for investment are renewable energy (predominantly solar and wind), and energy efficiency and end-use investments, with US$780 billion and US$773 billion, respectively.

The figures continue the growth which began in the post-pandemic era, with government recovery packages and efforts to increase energy independence in China, the EU and India. Since then, the IEA said that continuously growing investment in renewable energy has been driven by “technologies that are increasingly mature and cost-competitive.”

While emissions reductions are a major factor driving investment and supportive policies, the IEA said the economic and energy security benefits of renewable energy are increasingly driving investment decisions.

Some broad and familiar trends hold true in the new report. Grid infrastructure is failing to keep pace with growing power demand and increased renewable energy penetration across the world; current investment will need to double if the world is to meet the COP28 commitment to triple renewables capacity by 2030; renewable energy technologies (like solar modules and energy storage systems) are trending downwards in cost.

R&D shifts

The makeup of the top firms for research & development (R&D) has shifted dramatically in the last ten years, the IEA said.

Where in 2015, the top 20 R&D firms were “dominated by US and European automotive companies and oil and gas players”, just three state-owned fossil fuel firms are in the 2024 list: Petrochina, Sinopec and Saudi Aramco.

They have been replaced by electric vehicle companies BYD and Tesla, and Chinese pure-play battery manufacturer CATL.

Global distribution

The IEA also said that reductions in the cost of capital for clean energy investments in the developing world “need to be the cornerstone” of efforts to reach COP29 targets to mobilise US$1.3 trillion for low-emissions projects in developing economies by 2035.

“Scaling up climate finance to developing countries requires targeted policy action to address a variety of real and perceived risks impeding investments in clean energy that are driving up the cost of financing in these countries,” the report said.

This trend holds true across much of the developing world, which has lagged significantly behind wealthier nations in electrification and carbon reduction investment.

Even India, one of the leading markets for solar PV and renewable energy investments and one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, has issues around the cost of capital for utility-scale renewables projects.

The IEA report said: “India’s cost of capital for grid-scale renewable energy is one of the lowest among its emerging market and developing economy counterparts. However, it is still 80% higher than in advanced economies. Higher financing costs affect the financial viability of projects, leading to higher energy prices. Furthermore, real and perceived risks affect the attractiveness of projects to investors.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lightsource-bp-utility-scale-solar-PV-plant.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 14:22:20.119660

Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee and co-chair of the Senate Climate Change Task Force, today released the following statement after Senate Republicans released the Environment and Public Works portion of their reconciliation bill text.

“Time is revealing Senate Republicans’ willingness to abandon communities nationwide and put Oil Above All —above the law, above the economy, and above the health and wallets of working families. Their proposed cuts would eliminate the safeguards and funding needed to reduce harmful air pollution and environmental health risks. Their cuts would also destroy the $20 billion climate bank I secured in the Inflation Reduction Act, which was already at work creating jobs, lowering Americans’ energy costs, strengthening our energy independence, and combating the climate crisis.

“Republicans have no interest in bringing down costs or helping everyday Americans. Instead, they are picking winners and losers to deliver a big bonus to Big Oil and Gas. Republicans want to cut funding for clean energy, community resilience, and pollution reduction, all while giving polluters a golden ticket to skirt any meaningful reviews to get their projects permitted – rubberstamping dangerous polluting infrastructure.

“These Republican cuts will ensure frontline and fenceline communities continue to bear the burden of disproportionate levels of pollution. Ripping away the tools needed to curb methane and reduce carbon and hazardous pollutants will only make Americans sicker while the rich get richer. We must say no to these dangerous cuts and stop this big billionaire sell-out once and for all.”

Senator Markey secured numerous provisions in the historic Inflation Reduction Act, including the creation of a $27 billion national climate financing network based on his National Climate Bank Act with Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (MI-06). He also secured historic environmental justice funding for air quality monitoring, environmental inequity mapping, and addressing extreme heat.

Senator Markey has been a champion of vehicle emission standards that would be rolled back by the Senate reconciliation text, which would increase pollution and force drivers to pay more at the pump. He has also long championed a robust National Environmental Policy Act, which the Senate Republican bill undermines with an opt-in fee for project sponsors to pay to expedite their project’s environmental review and avoid judicial review – rubberstamping potentially harmful infrastructure.

The rollout of the Rivian-made electric trucks at the Florence shipping hub is part of a company-wide effort to reduce pollution. The cost of these upgrades has totaled over $1 billion and added 20,000 electric vehicles to its U.S. fleet.

This is being complemented by a rollout of electric semi trucks for long-distance delivery. Investment in solar energy generation, plastics research, and packaging reduction are just a few other avenues the retail behemoth is taking in sustainability.

Electric vehicles are a big part of the future of transportation. Medium- and heavy-duty trucks generate about 23% of U.S. transportation emissions. Cutting gas out of the equation means reducing the incidence of destructive weather patterns, ocean warming, and loss of sea ice.

""You don't hear anything. It's very quiet. And in the other vans, it would be very bumpy and rough sounds,"" said driver Hannah Jones of the new vehicles, per Spectrum News 1.

Despite the environmental benefits of electric truck deployment, Amazon still faces challenges. Its massive data centers tap into polluting energy sources, and it has relied on offsets rather than renewable power to meet its net-zero commitments.

Amazon also enables the sale of just about any physical good someone could need. Manufacturing generates a large chunk of global pollution, but Amazon's Scope 3 reporting only includes goods made under its brand. Meanwhile, other retailers include outside manufacturing in their accounting. Even for its own products, Amazon is being hit with a class action lawsuit for falsely claiming its branded toilet paper is eco-friendly.

Still, Amazon's staff take its net-zero goals seriously.

""We're obviously a big company and we have very big goals,"" said Florence site lead Bryan Dzialo, per Spectrum News 1. ""One of those is to be net zero carbon emissions by 2040, and given the scale of our kind of logistics operation, that's a big undertaking. So having the EVs roll out is a big part of that.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Amazon-electric-trucksimage-recVyN9amdoWOlpoP.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 14:27:36.723639

Editor's note: The original version of this report incorrectly stated that Bollinger Motors exited bankruptcy when it should have said receivership.","Electric truck startup Bollinger Motors has exited court receivership thanks to more financial aid from parent Mullen Automotive Inc., whose chief has ambitious plans for a rebound set in Michigan.

California-based Mullen acquired an additional 21% of Bollinger, bringing its ownership stake in the Oak Park-based company to 95%, Mullen announced Monday as it executed its second reverse stock split in as many months to stay compliant with Nasdaq rules on share prices.

In tandem with Mullen’s transaction, Bollinger was discharged from receivership Monday and the case dismissed with prejudice, according to a filing in U.S. District Court Eastern District of Michigan.

Mullen Automotive CEO and Chairman David Michery said the company paid $11 million to Robert Bollinger, who in March sued the company he founded, claiming it was broke and seeking to recover his loan.

Mullen, which has faced a host of financial issues beyond Bollinger, is all-in on the EV startup, Michery said Wednesday in a sit-down interview with Crain’s Detroit Business and affiliate publication Automotive News. Bollinger Motors — despite the spat with its namesake — will persevere as a brand that “will outlast everyone,” Michery vowed at the startup’s Oak Park headquarters.

“You can’t blame Bollinger for the current market, you can’t blame Bollinger for tariffs, you can’t blame Bollinger for the disruption that occurred with Robert filing this frivolous lawsuit,” Michery said. “That hurt the company.”

Now, Mullen is putting its chips on Bollinger Motors to weather the storm. Michery said production of Class 4 trucks would resume in 8-10 weeks and its staff of about 85 in metro Detroit would soon swell in line with a predicted increase in demand — though that remains in question with a stagnant market.

Mullen will close its engineering base in Irvine, Calif., and consolidate it to the company’s tech center in Troy, where 40-50 employees will be added, Michery said.

“I want all engineering, all manufacturing, everything in the state of Michigan,” he said.

While Michery serves as CEO of Bollinger Motors, the company’s daily operations will be overseen by James Taylor, who will return to the company as a consultant after departing in March.

Another priority is cleaning up the company’s supply chain. Bollinger Motors has been sued by several suppliers claiming they were being stiffed by the startup. Michery said he is in the process of paying debts, including to Livonia-based contract manufacturer Roush, which makes the Class 4 trucks for Bollinger.

Mullen’s earnings reports to the SEC seem to indicate big financial trouble. It lost $162 million on revenue of $7.9 million in the first quarter; it posted a $115 million loss on revenue of $2.9 in the prior quarter.

The company lost its 675,000-square-foot former AM General factory in Mishawaka, Ind., last month to settle a financial dispute with GEM Yield Bahamas Ltd.

However, Michery said the company has ample liquidity, including a $150 million equity line allowing the company to use its stock as currency — an instrument approved by the SEC and shareholders.

“Picture a credit card,” he said. “Mullen has a $150 million credit card that it can use at will.”

Mullen’s 1-for-100 reverse stock split executed Monday was designed to bring its stock price above $1 per share to meet Nasdaq requirements.

Birmingham-based financial adviser Alex Calderone said the move is window dressing and does not solve underlying business performance issues.

“I would not surmise that would impact company valuation at all or shareholder rights at all,” Calderone said. “It just appears to be a cosmetic change to be able to adjust the share price. … It’s like if I traded you a hundred-dollar bill for a hundred singles.”

On Wednesday, Mullen’s stock shot up to above $16 per share, tripling its value over the course of the day, as Michery pointed out after pulling up the market summary on his phone.

“They knew we were coming out here to put Bollinger back in business,” he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump lashed out on Thursday against Elon Musk, saying he was ""disappointed"" by the billionaire's public opposition to the sweeping tax-cut and spending bill that is at the heart of Trump's agenda.

""Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""He said the most beautiful things about me, and he hasn't said bad about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm, I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot.""

Trump also asserted that Musk's days of blistering attacks on the bill were motivated by the proposed elimination of consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. Musk, the CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla, has said he opposes the bill because it will increase federal deficits.

Trump suggested that Musk, who received a praise-filled sendoff from Trump last week after overseeing his federal bureaucracy cost-cutting campaign, was upset because he missed working for Trump.

""He's not the first,"" Trump said. ""People leave my administration ... then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile.""

As Trump was speaking, Musk wrote on X, ""Slim Beautiful Bill for the win,"" a reference to the bill's official title, the ""Big Beautiful Bill Act.""

Musk followed that up with another post, saying he was fine with the cuts to electric vehicle credits as long as Republicans removed what he called a ""mountain of disgusting pork"" in wasteful spending from the bill.

Places the U.S. Government Warns Not to Travel Right Now

Musk came into the government with brash plans to cut $2 trillion out of the federal budget. He left last week having achieved far less than that, having cut about half of 1% of total spending.

Musk has been a powerful Trump ally, spending nearly $300 billion to boost Republicans in the 2024 election and then overseeing Trump's Department of Government Efficiency.

His work eliminating thousands of federal jobs and cutting billions of dollars in foreign aid and other programs caused disruption across federal agencies while prompting widespread protests at Tesla outlets in the U.S. and Europe.

Shares of Tesla extended losses after Trump's criticism of Musk. The stock was lately down nearly 6%; it was off by 3% before Trump spoke.

Global energy investment is forecast to reach US$3.3tn, 2% higher in real terms than in 2024, with clean technologies continuing to dominate the landscape.

However, the report also warns of persistent structural imbalances, especially in grid capacity and support for developing economies.

Clean energy overtakes fossil fuels

The report states that clean energy will attract US$2.2tn in 2025, twice the projected US$1.1tn for fossil fuels.

This includes spending on renewables, nuclear, electricity grids, battery storage, energy efficiency, low-emissions fuels and electrification.

“Amid the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that are clouding the outlook for the energy world, we see energy security coming through as a key driver of the growth in global investment this year to a record US$3.3tn as countries and companies seek to insulate themselves from a wide range of risks,” explains Fatih Birol, IEA Executive Director.

“The fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects.”

The share of clean energy in total investment has grown steadily over the past five years, driven not only by climate goals, but by economic recovery efforts, industrial policy and national energy security agendas.

Electric mobility, particularly EVs, has become a significant area of investment.

Many EV models are now cost competitive with internal combustion engines in markets such as China, highlighting the rapid commercialisation of electrified transport.

Which regions and sectors are driving investment in renewable energy?

Crucially, 70% of this growth has come from net fossil fuel importers such as China, Europe and India.

In the United States, increased spending is being shaped by strategic competition with China in clean technology supply chains.

Investment in the electricity sector is expected to reach US$1.5tn in 2025, now 50% more than total fossil fuel supply spending.

“It’s encouraging to see growing global investment in the energy transition. We’re getting closer to the US$3.5 trillion annual capital needed between now and 2050 to achieve net zero, but there’s still more to be done,” says Frederic Godemel, EVP Energy Management, Schneider Electric.

“We cannot let geopolitical uncertainty or economic headwinds derail our progress, after all the climate crisis doesn’t abide by our political or economic cycles.

“We must move beyond cautious optimism.

“With many clean energy projects still stalling, we need to double down on demand-side solutions, which are half of the solution to net zero.

“We have the technologies to decarbonise today, now it’s about scaling Electricity 4.0– the combination of electric and digital- to drive immediate progress.”

A decade ago, fossil fuel investment outpaced electricity-focused investment by 30%, a complete reversal.

Today, the main drivers of electricity demand growth include electrified transport, industry, cooling, data centres and artificial intelligence.

Solar power for the win

Low emissions power generation spending has nearly doubled over the past five years.

Solar PV remains the dominant force, with projected investment reaching US$450bn in 2025, making it the single largest energy investment category globally.

Storage infrastructure is growing in parallel, with US$66bn earmarked for batteries supporting power sector flexibility.

China is also increasing its influence in solar exports to the developing world.

In 2024, Pakistan alone imported 19 GW of solar modules, equivalent to nearly half its grid-connected capacity.

The rise of nuclear and coal power

Nuclear power investment will exceed US$70bn in 2025, representing a 50% increase over five years.

Interest in small modular reactors is rising and new gas-fired capacity is being pursued in the US and the Middle East.

However, the fossil fuel landscape remains complex.

While upstream oil investment is forecast to fall by 6% in 2025, the largest drop since 2016, coal supply and approvals are increasing, particularly in Asia.

China and India alone approved nearly 115 GW of new coal capacity in 2024, the highest since 2015.

By contrast, no new coal-fired steam turbines were ordered in advanced economies in 2024, an unprecedented development.

“When the IEA published the first ever edition of its World Energy Investment report nearly ten years ago, it showed energy investment in China in 2015 just edging ahead of that of the United States,” says Fatih.

“Today, China is by far the largest energy investor globally, spending twice as much on energy as the European Union and almost as much as the EU and United States combined.”

Grids and infrastructure lag behind

Annual investment in electricity grids stands at around US$400bn, compared to US$1tn for generation assets.

Grid investment is failing to keep pace with the rollout of renewables.

Barriers include protracted permitting processes, transformer and cable shortages, and weak utility balance sheets, especially in developing markets.

The IEA’s 2025 forecast confirms that clean energy is now the main destination for global energy investment, backed by falling technology costs, growing policy support and rising electricity demand.

However, coal expansion in Asia, insufficient grid upgrades and weak support for developing nations continue to challenge global climate ambitions.

Investment in mature clean technologies is not always driven by emissions goals but often by economics, security and industrial strategy.

For the global transition to succeed, investment must not only increase, but flow more equitably.

The next phase of progress hinges on stronger infrastructure, better financing mechanisms and a more inclusive approach to energy development.

""Without me, Trump would have lost the election,"" Musk soon after tweeted.
""Elon knew this from the beginning,"" Trump said, referring to the elimination of the tax credits in the bill for electric vehicles.
""I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people.","The alliance between President Donald Trump and mega-billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk dramatically fractured Thursday over the president's major tax bill, which is pending in the Senate.

Trump said that Musk — who until recently was one of his top advisors — opposes the budget package because the Tesla CEO is ""upset"" about the elimination of electric vehicle credits in the bill, and the Republican president nixing his pick to run NASA.

""I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot,"" Trump told reporters at the White House, where less than a week ago he lauded Musk's work on the DOGE project to cut federal spending and employee headcount.

""Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore,"" Trump said.

Musk quickly and dismissively fired back at Trump in a post on his social media site X.

""Whatever,"" wrote Musk, who has criticized bill because it will increase federal deficits.

""Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill. In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful.""

""Without me, Trump would have lost the election,"" Musk soon after tweeted.

""Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,"" added Musk, who was the biggest financial backer of Trump's 2024 campaign, spending more than $250 million on that effort.

""Such ingratitude,"" he wrote.

Musk launched a poll on X, asking users, ""Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?""

Tesla shares slid by more than 8% as the feud erupted between the EV-maker's CEO and the Republican president.

Trump's analysis of Musk's motivation came after days of the billionaire condemning what Trump calls his ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" over concerns it will blow out federal deficits.

Musk on Tuesday called the bill, which is being considered by the Senate, a ""disgusting abomination.""

""Elon is upset because we took the EV mandate, and you know, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles,"" Trump said. ""And you know, they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles, and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy.""

""Elon knew this from the beginning,"" Trump said, referring to the elimination of the tax credits in the bill for electric vehicles. ""He knew it ... a long time ago.""

""I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it.""

""All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that's billions and billions of dollars, and it really is unfair,"" Trump said.

The president also said, referring to Isaacman, ""I'm sure [Musk] respected him, but to run NASA ... I didn't think it was appropriate.""

""You happen to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat,"" Trump said of Isaacman. "" And I say, you know, look, we won. We get certain privileges. And one of the privileges we don't have to appoint a Democrat. NASA is very important.""

Trump suggested Musk's pivot to becoming a critic is part of a pattern he has seen with others who previously served his administration.

""People leave my administration, and they love us. And then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is,"" Trump said.

"" It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it. But we have it with others too.

""Look, Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""I don't know if we will anymore.""

Trump told reporters that Musk's criticism of the bill likely stemmed primarily from the phase-out of the electric vehicle tax credit, which would likely impact his company, Tesla.

""You know, Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate… which was a lot of money for electric vehicles,"" Trump said. ""And they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles.""

""Elon knew this from the beginning,"" Trump added.

Musk fired back minutes later, saying that while he thought the EV phase-out was unfair, he was more concerned about the ""MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.""

He later wrote on X that without him, Trump would have lost the election, Democrats would have gained control of the House, and Republicans would've had a smaller majority in the Senate.

""Such ingratitude,"" wrote Musk, who spent nearly $300 million to elect Trump and other Republicans last year.

The tech titan first unleashed on the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which is set to serve as the centerpiece of Trump's legislative agenda, on Tuesday. He's kept up his criticism ever since.

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,"" Musk wrote on X on Tuesday. ""This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.""

Musk main criticism has been of the bill's projected impact on the federal deficit. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that in its current form, the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, while the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has said that number would be $2.5 trillion.

After facing the threat of cancellation, the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Safer Choice program, which supports the use of environmentally friendly and low-toxicity consumer product ingredients, will live on, though with less independence than it had.

Under a new structure at the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, the Safer Choice program will go from being independent to operating as part of the office’s New Chemicals division. The program has a staff of about 10 people who may have their time split between Safer Choice activities and new chemical approvals.

The Project 2025 report, a small-government policy framework published during the most recent election cycle by allies of now-president Donald J. Trump, named Safer Choice as one of many federal programs and services that should be cut. In early May, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced the redeployment of more than 500 EPA scientists away from research and efforts related to climate change and toward new chemical reviews.

The Safer Choice group was part of that reorganization, says Joel Tickner, executive director of Change Chemistry, a nonprofit promoting green chemistry. “Safer Choice was in Project 2025, and the agencies are pretty much following it like a Bible,” he says. “So there was an expectation that in the reorganization, Safer Choice would be eliminated.”

Tickner credits Safer Choice’s reprieve in part to a vigorous campaign this spring by chemical manufacturers, consumer product makers, retailers, and public advocacy groups. “Other than Energy Star, I can't think of another program at EPA that has such broad-ranging support, where you can get BASF and moms against toxics on the same letter,” he says.

Energy Star and WaterSense, related EPA programs promoting energy and water efficiency in consumer appliances, did not survive the changes at the agency. Tickner attributes the difference to Energy Star’s connection to climate change—though the program predates widespread climate concerns and has focused mostly on saving consumers money—and Trump’s long-standing animosity toward low-flow showerheads.

Though Safer Choice was spared, it is not out of danger. Tickner says the new organizational structure makes it easier for EPA leadership to whittle away at the program by shifting staffers from it and toward new chemical approvals, for example. The EPA didn’t respond to a request for comment about the new structure.

Blake Nanney, director of government affairs at the American Cleaning Institute, a cleaning industry organization, says his group is advocating against privatization of Safer Choice or delegation of its duties to US states. Privatization could present a threat to confidential business information such as formulas and suppliers, he says, and a state-level approach would be hard for manufacturers to comply with and consumers to keep track of.

“We are awaiting further details from the administration regarding any next steps for Safer Choice. However, we are communicating directly with EPA at this time and reiterating our members' desire for the program to remain intact,” he says.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/LN---Safer-Choice-is-safe-for-now---93201?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2",N,,2025-06-05 14:25:27.932836

While this is true for all of North America, it is particularly true of the energy trade relationship between the United States and Mexico, which has massively expanded in recent decades.
“I don’t think the tariffs will impact bilateral energy trade because at this point, we’ve seen the U.S. threaten tariffs on Mexico several times,” Guadarrama told Natural Gas Intelligence.
What is more, maintaining energy trade relations with Mexico is paramount to the United States’ own energy strategy, which is moving away from global supply chains and toward friend-shoring and near-shoring.
The United States’ plans for nearshoring its energy supply chains – moving their lines of production closer to home – feature Mexico prominently.","Tariff whiplash under the Trump administration has raised a lot of concerns about the United States’ relationship with its first- and second-largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. This is especially true for energy trade, which all members of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) depend on to keep their economies healthy. Experts contend that recognizing the vital role of energy trade for all parties, and strengthening those relationships, is critical in these volatile times.

While this is true for all of North America, it is particularly true of the energy trade relationship between the United States and Mexico, which has massively expanded in recent decades. In January of this year, pipeline exports of natural gas from the United States to Mexico reached a whopping 199.2 billion cubic feet. That marks a more-than ten-fold increase since 2012, and a nearly 200-fold increase since 1990. This rapid growth has made the two economies more inextricably interlinked than ever before.

Because of the scale and rapid expansion of this relationship, the United States and Mexico both need a healthy energy trade relationship for their respective economic well being, according to experts. “For Mexico, reliable access to competitively priced U.S. energy is essential to sustaining economic growth, enabling industrial competitiveness and stabilizing the electric grid,” states a recent opinion piece from The Hill, written by Duncan Wood. “At the same time, for the U.S., Mexico has become an indispensable customer, so much so that any downturn in Mexican demand would ripple through U.S. refineries, gas producers and the infrastructure companies that have built pipelines and terminals to serve the southern market,” Wood continues.

This means that tariffs could pose a major threat to what is a foundational piece of the continental trade agreement and economy. But it could also mean that the tariffs never really stood a chance. In April of this year, Carlos Guadarrama, a senior energy consultant at the World Bank, said that energy trade between the two countries is so integrated and important that it is essentially shielded from tariffs, and implied that Trump’s tariff rope-a-dope with Mexico is founded on empty threats.

“I don’t think the tariffs will impact bilateral energy trade because at this point, we’ve seen the U.S. threaten tariffs on Mexico several times,” Guadarrama told Natural Gas Intelligence. “I think Trump is using the tariffs as a threatening mechanism so that the Mexican government complies with the U.S. on other requests and areas of interest beyond energy, and I personally don’t think they will have any effect in bilateral trade when it comes to energy,” he went on to say.

This means that the two new presidents of the United States and Mexico, Donald Trump and Claudia Sheinbaum, will need to maintain good relations and a high level of diplomacy if the United States wants to keep making money off of Mexico’s grid, and Mexico wants to keep growing its own economy using relatively cheap and abundant American energy imports.

What is more, maintaining energy trade relations with Mexico is paramount to the United States’ own energy strategy, which is moving away from global supply chains and toward friend-shoring and near-shoring. Around this time last year, the Atlantic Council reported that cooperation between the two new regimes in the United States and Mexico would be critical for loosening trade reliance on China. The United States’ plans for nearshoring its energy supply chains – moving their lines of production closer to home – feature Mexico prominently.

At that time, when the potential outcome of the United States election was still the subject of much debate, the Atlantic Council advised that “The United States should seize the opportunity to work with the incoming Sheinbaum administration to strengthen the Mexican energy sector, thereby enabling supply chain security gains through nearshoring.” So far, Trump has worked against Mexico as much as with them. But with such complementary mutually beneficial energy market needs, he may just be blowing smoke.

Lucid Group, Inc. is making significant moves to strengthen its American supply chain for electric vehicle (EV) battery components. The company recently announced a new multi-year supply agreement with Graphite One for US-sourced natural graphite. This initiative is part of Lucid’s broader strategy to increasingly utilize raw materials mined and processed within the United States for its advanced EVs, aiming to bolster domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign sources.

Key Highlights:

Lucid has signed a multi-year agreement with Graphite One for natural graphite to be sourced from Alaska, with production expected to start in 2028.

This new deal complements a 2024 agreement with Graphite One for US-produced synthetic graphite from its Ohio facility, also beginning in 2028.

Syrah Resources is set to supply Lucid with natural graphite active anode material (AAM) from its Louisiana facility, starting in 2026, under a three-year term.

These agreements underscore Lucid’s commitment to establishing a localized US supply chain for critical minerals essential for EV batteries.

Graphite, in both natural and synthetic forms, is a vital component in lithium-ion batteries, crucial for their performance and fast-charging capabilities.

The latest agreement with Graphite One will provide Lucid and its battery cell suppliers with natural graphite sourced from the Graphite Creek deposit north of Nome, Alaska, with production anticipated to commence in 2028. This partnership builds upon a previous announcement from 2024, where Graphite One committed to supplying Lucid with American-made synthetic graphite. This synthetic material will be produced at Graphite One’s proposed active anode material facility in Warren, Ohio, also with an expected start date of 2028.

Marc Winterhoff, Interim CEO at Lucid, highlighted the strategic significance of these domestic partnerships. “A supply chain of critical materials within the United States drives our nation’s economy, increases our independence against outside factors or market dynamics, and supports our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our vehicles,” stated Winterhoff. “These partnerships are another example of our commitment to powering American innovation and manufacturing with localized supply chains.”

Echoing this sentiment, Anthony Huston, CEO of Graphite One, remarked on the continued collaboration. “This agreement complements the deal we struck with Lucid in 2024 – which marked the first synthetic graphite agreement between a U.S. graphite developer and a U.S. EV company,” Huston said. “We made history then – and we’re continuing to make history now as we build momentum for our efforts to develop a fully domestic graphite supply chain, to meet market demands and strengthen U.S. industry and national defense.”

In addition to the Graphite One agreements, Lucid is also set to receive natural graphite AAM from Syrah Resources beginning in 2026. Under their agreement, Syrah will collaborate with Lucid or its battery suppliers to provide these materials over a three-year period. Syrah’s natural graphite AAM will be sourced from its vertically integrated AAM production facility in Vidalia, Louisiana.

Collectively, these strategic agreements for both natural and synthetic graphite demonstrate Lucid’s determined focus on building a resilient and US-based supply chain. By securing domestic sources for critical minerals like graphite—a major component of lithium-ion batteries essential for optimal performance and fast-charging—Lucid aims to enhance its manufacturing capabilities and contribute to American industrial strength.",https://theevreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lucid_Gravity_Lucid_Air.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:42:42.171459

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator John Curtis (R-UT) last week toured Fervo Energy’s Cape Station geothermal project, a next-generation clean energy initiative located in Beaver County, Utah. He was joined by company leaders, project engineers, and Bill Gates, founder of Breakthrough Energy, for a firsthand look at one of the most ambitious geothermal developments in the nation.

“Utah is at the forefront of energy innovation, and the Cape Station Geothermal project in Beaver is a powerful example of that progress,” said Senator Curtis. “I believe America’s energy future can be affordable, reliable, and clean—and geothermal will be a critical part of making that vision a reality. This project highlights what’s possible when private investment is matched with government collaboration to provide the right tools for success. I’m hopeful it will drive new opportunity, strengthen rural communities, and showcase the kind of results that come from pairing innovation with Utah’s work ethic. It was a privilege to tour the site and meet the exceptional team leading this effort.”

“Fervo’s Cape Station project is what happens when great science, smart policy, and American entrepreneurship come together,” said Bill Gates. “Enhanced geothermal is one of the most promising solutions for delivering reliable, low-carbon power, especially as demand for affordable energy grows. Breakthrough Energy Ventures invested in Fervo early because we believed in this vision, and it’s exciting to see that potential becoming reality here in Utah.

“Geothermal isn’t a technology of the distant future; it’s scaling today, and Cape Station is proof of that,” said Tim Latimer, CEO and co-founder of Fervo Energy. “This project represents years of hard work by engineers, policymakers, and local partners who believe in the power of innovation to generate solutions. We’re proud to be building this in Utah, creating full-time jobs, and setting a new standard for what geothermal can achieve at scale. With Cape Phase I coming online next year, this is only the beginning for Fervo, for Utah, and for geothermal.”

Background:

Senator Curtis has long championed a responsible and practical approach to clean energy development. He has led bipartisan efforts to modernize permitting, reduce bureaucratic duplication, and accelerate the deployment of geothermal resources. In the 118th Congress, he advanced the GEO Act, legislation to update the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 and streamline the application process for new geothermal projects.

Cape Station is one of the nation’s most advanced geothermal projects. Developed by Fervo Energy, the facility broke ground in June 2023. Once fully operational, the first two phases will provide 500 megawatts of clean, baseload power—enough to support hundreds of thousands of homes. Initial production is slated for 2026, with full-scale operations expected by 2028.

The economic impact for Utah is significant. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s jobs estimation tool, during construction, Cape Station will support approximately 6,600 jobs and generate more than $437 million in earned wages. The project will sustain around 160 high-quality, full-time jobs once operational, bolstering the local economy and reinforcing Beaver County’s role in the future of American energy.",https://ironcountytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-04-102137.png,N,,2025-06-05 14:22:30.377593

More than 10 million acres of land will be needed to meet America's renewable energy goals by 2050, with 80% of this development slated to occur on agricultural lands. At the same time, solar development can create opportunities for farm families to build generational viability and keep land in agriculture. AFT, a national non-profit organization that focuses on protecting farmland, promoting sound farming practices, and keeping farmers on the land, is a national leader in agriculturally compatible solar development. Through this partnership, AFT and Doral seek to further solutions that help build long-term farm viability while scaling up domestic energy generation. AFT's Smart Solar principles will help guide this work, which seeks to accomplish three equally important goals: (1) safeguard land well-suited for agriculture, (2) strengthen farm viability, and (3) accelerate solar energy development.

""Since day one, Doral Renewables' number one principle was to ensure long-term commitment to supporting farmers and communities nationwide by providing farmer-friendly energy development that maximizes their land-use, diversifies their revenue stream, drives economic development and allowing them to return to heritage farming practices by focusing on food production in their farms,"" said Ed Baptista, Vice President of Development and Agrivoltaics. ""Partnering with AFT only seemed like a natural step forward as we scale up our dual-use operations across our development pipeline and continue our efforts to support farmers in their quest to make the most out of their farming land and strengthen farm viability while advancing affordable and sustainable energy solutions.""

Agrivoltaics, the intentional combination of agriculture and solar energy generation on the same piece of land for the life of a project, can be an important method for solar sites to continue producing food and fiber while improving soil carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Through the duration of the partnership, AFT will advise Doral on their Smart Solar principles, including the implementation of agrivoltaics systems and best practices for engaging with agricultural communities.

""American Farmland Trust's partnership with Doral Renewables is an exciting step forward with an industry leader with a significant presence nationwide,"" said Ethan Winter, AFT's National Smart Solar Director. ""America needs renewable energy and productive, resilient farms and ranches. Partnerships such as these are crucial for investing in the future of agrivoltaics and long-term farm viability""

Doral and AFT are excited to work together to continue building networks that will help allow solar energy and agriculture to thrive together for the benefit of the planet, farmers, and farming communities.

Article content

Tesla’s shares fell as much 9.2% to an intraday low as the two traded barbs. The spat highlights how policies advanced by Trump and Republican lawmakers put billions of dollars at risk for Tesla.

Article content

Trump’s massive tax bill would largely eliminate a credit worth as much as $7,500 for buyers of some Tesla models and other electric vehicles by the end of this year, seven years ahead of schedule. That would translate to a roughly $1.2 billion hit to Tesla’s full-year profit, according to JPMorgan analysts.

Michigan, home to GM’s headquarters, accounts for nearly 28,000 robots — approximately 12% of the nation’s total.
This high concentration of automation has contributed to a dramatic shift in GM’s workforce composition over decades.
In 1979, GM employed 468,000 American hourly workers, representing 76% of its U.S. workforce.
The Nvidia partnership positions GM to remain competitive in an increasingly technology-driven automotive landscape.","These digital simulations enable GM to test and refine new production processes without disrupting existing vehicle manufacturing, a critical advantage as the company balances production of both traditional combustion engines and electric vehicles.

The partnership extends to training robotics platforms for operations such as material handling, transport and precision welding. Through a combination of AI and machine learning, GM has developed systems that can identify potential issues in manufacturing, such as leaks in battery packs, allowing for quick repairs and supporting quality control.

The automotive industry, led by companies like GM, remains the largest user of industrial robots in America. According to Brookings Institute data, nearly half of the 233,305 industrial robots in the United States are employed in auto manufacturing. Michigan, home to GM’s headquarters, accounts for nearly 28,000 robots — approximately 12% of the nation’s total.

Detroit, in particular, stands out as the robot capital of America, with more than three times the number of industrial robots compared to other metropolitan areas. By 2015, the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn area had 15,115 industrial robots in place, or 8.5 per 1,000 workers, a significant increase from 5,753 robots in 2010.

This high concentration of automation has contributed to a dramatic shift in GM’s workforce composition over decades. In 1979, GM employed 468,000 American hourly workers, representing 76% of its U.S. workforce. By 2021, that number had dropped to just 45,000 American hourly workers, or 46% of the company’s domestic workforce.

GM’s innovation hub, the Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, employs approximately 24,000 people with an average annual salary of $120,000. This facility has become central to developing the company’s AI-driven manufacturing technologies.

Using both robotics and proprietary AI tools, GM has implemented systems to inspect welds and paint coats, identifying irregularities and anomalies that might affect vehicle quality. This technology not only improves product quality but also enhances workplace safety by automating potentially hazardous tasks.

“We’re using AI and advanced software to help our team minimize ergonomic stressors, enable workplace safety and enhance quality in our manufacturing plants,” notes Clausen. “Investing in our current and future workforce with better technology helps ensure that our teams have the skills and tools needed as we continue to evolve our manufacturing footprint to meet customer demand.”

GM’s automation advancements come at a critical time as the company navigates challenges in electric vehicle production. In October 2023, GM announced delays in the production of electric trucks, including the Chevy Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV, pushing the start date at its Orion Assembly plant from 2024 to late 2025.

The company cited the need to “align its capital investments with electric vehicle demand and implement vehicle engineering improvements to boost profitability” as reasons for the delay.

Despite production delays, GM maintains ambitious plans, projecting to have more than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America by the end of 2025 and to convert 50% of its North American assembly capacity to EV production by 2030.

While automation raises concerns about job displacement, GM emphasizes that AI is being implemented to enhance, not replace, its workforce. The company describes its approach as “people-centric,” using AI to help employees avoid ergonomic stressors and improve workplace safety.

“It’s not about automating everything or building more vehicles faster — our winning formula is driven by a combination of flexible manufacturing, advanced technology, and a talented workforce,” states Clausen.

Nevertheless, GM’s transformation from “automaker to platform innovator” suggests a continuing shift toward higher-skilled, technology-focused employment. In its presentation to investors titled “From Automaker to Platform Innovator,” GM projected that software and new business ventures would grow from $2 billion to $80 billion by 2030, indicating a future in which salaried professionals may increasingly outnumber traditional manufacturing workers.

The Nvidia partnership positions GM to remain competitive in an increasingly technology-driven automotive landscape. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder and CEO, emphasized the significance of the collaboration: “The era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we’re transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they’re made.”

GM plans to build next-generation vehicles on Nvidia DRIVE AGX, based on the Nvidia Blackwell architecture, delivering up to 1,000 trillion operations per second of high-performance compute. This technology will not only power manufacturing but also enhance future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin safety features.

As automotive manufacturing continues to advance, GM’s strategic investments in AI and robotics may provide a competitive edge. The company has maintained its position as the U.S. sales leader for three consecutive years through 2024, offering what it describes as “the broadest portfolio of electric vehicles in the industry,” with plans to expand to a dozen EV models by the end of 2025.

At the heart of the push is Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, a biofuel derived from sources like corn grain, municipal solid waste, wet waste, and agricultural residues. Though not yet widely used, SAF is gaining traction thanks to its lower emissions and growing interest from regional policymakers.

The aviation industry has yet to fully embrace the alternative fuel, largely due to the high cost of production and limited infrastructure for storage costs. But with international interest rising and U.S. climate policies shifting, local leaders remain hopeful that a wider transition is on the horizon.

In the first three quarters of 2024, U.S. production of SAF reached 30 million gallons — a sharp increase of just five million in 2021, according to recent data collected by the U.S. Department of Energy.

“I’m very optimistic about its ability to survive because it goes straight to the farmers, and it is really about American-made products,” said Ed Hubbard, general counsel and vice president of governmental affairs for the Renewable Fuels Association. “If you can fall within the framework of ‘American energy, greatness and dominance,’ I think that those are the aspects that survive throughout the process.”

Hubbard warned that if the Trump administration withdraws incentives for SAF, it would contradict its own America First Investment Policy — a doctrine designed to pressure companies into manufacturing domestically instead of overseas.

On Tuesday, Hubbard joined a panel discussion in Washington, D.C., focused on raising awareness about SAF. The event highlighted the formation of a working group, a directory of aviation-related associations, and plans for a traveling presentation aimed at engaging government and aviation leaders.

The panel was hosted by the Greater Washington Region Clean Cities Coalition (GWRCCC), which works to promote affordable, local transportation fuels, energy-efficient mobility systems, and other fuel-saving practices.

The federal government developed a strategy to encourage the commercial-scale production of SAF through a plan called the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge.

Under President Joe Biden’s administration, the initiative set primary goals to reduce costs, bolster energy security, and significantly increase the production and use of SAF. Key targets include achieving a 50% reduction in life cycle emissions compared to traditional fuels and meeting production milestones of three billion gallons annually by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 — enough to meet all domestic demand.

Given the significant impact of jet travel on the environment, advocates hope SAF can help mitigate the pollution it causes. In 2022, aviation accounted for 2% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and that share is expected to grow. The agency noted that aviation has experienced faster growth in recent decades than rail, road, and shipping.

“They pollute the environment, and the closer you live to those environments, the more negative it is on public health,” said Antoine Thompson, CEO and executive director for GWRCCC.

Data provided by GWRCCC at Tuesday’s meeting showed a combined 622 private and public airports between Maryland and Virginia.

Virginia began considering sustainability strategies at its airports earlier than other states. The commonwealth has a total of 406 public and private airports, 400 of which are privately owned.

In July 2016, the Virginia Department of Aviation (VDOA) commissioned the Virginia Airports Sustainability Management Plan — a voluntary guide for Virginia’s public airports to define their own sustainability priorities and needs.

Rusty Harrington, chief planner with VDOA, was one of the contributors to the plan.

“We have so many people that are working in parallel, and (the meeting) has been an opportunity for us to see what everyone else is working on and find some mutual common ground opportunities,” Harrington said.

Beyond SAF, Harrington noted that researchers also exploring advancements in engine technology, as well as the use of using electrification and hydrogen resources.

As for Virginia’s role in environmental stewardship, Harrington said the commonwealth is taking it very seriously.

“We want to protect the resources that we have, and we want to lessen our impacts in almost every activity we do — from design, construction, operation, maintenance of our airports — with the goal of securing and balancing the economic, the environmental and the social impacts of any of our actions,” Harrington said. “We like to think we’re doing a very good job of that because it’s inherent in whatever we do in airport development.”

""Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Trump spoke from the Oval Office earlier Thursday and said Musk was upset that EV credits were not included in the bill.

""Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""I was surprised.""

""Whatever,"" Musk fired back as the president spoke.

Musk, the world's richest man, in recent days has threatened to make lawmakers who vote for the bill face primary elections and called the bill a ""disgusting abomination,"" marking a significant shift in his comments about the administration.

The fall in shares comes after the EV maker saw a 22% rally in May despite weak sales numbers, with Musk wrapping up his time as head of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Shares are down nearly 18% this week as Musk has continued to rail against the budget bill. This year, shares are down nearly 30% and well off the high of $488.54 reached Dec. 18.

Since Musk's special government employee term ended Friday, he's appeared at odds with the Trump administration and gone on a full assault against the president's signature tax-cut bill.

""One of the things about Elon is when he goes all in, he goes all in,"" Walter Isaacson, author of a Musk biography, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday.

""He is somebody who's not exactly calibrated in these things and he is seriously upset,"" Isaacson said.

Musk, who also runs SpaceX and xAI, posted a stream of attacks against the Trump bill on X Wednesday.

NBC News reported that Musk had tried to convince Trump and other GOP members of the administration to change aspects of Trump's bill that would curtail EV and residential solar tax credits, which generate profits for Tesla.

The measure would also impose a new annual $250 fee on EV drivers.

Tesla is facing more fundamental problems, with plummeting sales of its electric vehicles in major markets in Europe and a declining brand reputation in the West.

Tesla is also under pressure to launch a long-delayed, driverless ride-hailing service this month in Austin, Texas.

Musk has said that Tesla is testing driverless vehicles in that market, but its primary competitor Waymo is already operating a major commercial robotaxi service there in partnership with Uber.

Isaacson said Thursday that Musk was also annoyed with members of the Trump administration who worked against the nomination of Jared Isaacman as head of space agency NASA.

""That, to Musk, was just infuriating because they were doing, they were going after Jared Isaacman ... to get at Musk,"" Isaacson said Thursday.

Isaacman's nomination was pulled over the weekend.

Hybrid vehicle owners would also face a new $100 annual fee under the bill.
If the $250 annual EV fee is approved, it would go into effect as soon as the bill is signed into law.
Elimination of EV tax credits The House bill would phase out the federal tax credit for new electric vehicles, worth up to $7,500, after 2026.
If the bill becomes law, current and future EV owners will face higher annual costs and lose access to federal purchase incentives.","If you already own an electric vehicle, you’re not alone — over 3.5 million people in the United States have registered EVs, with nearly 300,000 new ones sold in just the first quarter of 2025, as reported by Kelley Blue Book and Cox Automotive.

But now, proposed mega legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, from Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives could soon hit your wallet with a new annual federal fee to raise more than $800 million a year for the Highway Trust Fund.

Lawmakers say the fee is needed as more drivers opt for electric vehicles and gas tax revenues shrink.

Regarding the proposal, House Transportation Committee Chairman Sam Graves said in a statement: “For far too long, EVs have operated on our nation's roads without paying into the system. Plain and simple, this is a fairness issue, and it's time these roadway users pay their share for the use of the road.”

Worth noting: This idea isn’t new. Many states already charge annual fees for EV owners, typically ranging from $100 (like in California and Illinois) to $250 (e.g., in New Jersey).

Still, the proposed federal fee would match the highest in the U.S., and if approved, apply to all EV owners, regardless of when they purchased their vehicle. Hybrid vehicle owners would also face a new $100 annual fee under the bill.

Here’s more of what you need to know.

House GOP approves new $250 EV fee: What it means

A sweeping tax and spending bill recently passed by the House (now under consideration in the U.S. Senate) includes a new $250 annual federal fee for electric vehicle (EV) owners, regardless of when they bought their car.

As mentioned, the fee would be collected by the Federal Highway Administration and is intended to ensure EV drivers contribute to the Highway Trust Fund. That fund is traditionally supported by gas taxes paid by drivers of internal combustion vehicles.

However, consumer advocates point out that the proposed $250 fee is actually more than three times what a typical new gas-powered car owner pays in federal gas taxes each year.

The federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon and hasn’t changed since 1993. That means most drivers pay far less than $250 a year toward highway maintenance.

If the $250 annual EV fee is approved, it would go into effect as soon as the bill is signed into law.

However, the exact timing for when owners would begin paying the fee depends on how quickly the Federal Highway Administration finalizes the rules and sets up the payment system.

The bill instructs the FHWA Administrator to establish the process for collecting the fee after the law is enacted, so there may be a short phase-in period before owners are required to pay.

It’s also important to note that the House version of Trump’s ""big beautiful bill"" doesn’t stop at new EV fees. It includes two other major changes that, if approved, could impact the car market.

Elimination of EV tax credits

The House bill would phase out the federal tax credit for new electric vehicles, worth up to $7,500, after 2026.

However, for most vehicles, the credit would actually disappear at the end of 2025, since it would only remain for automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs.

Used EV credits, worth up to $4,000, would be eliminated outright at the end of 2025.

This marks a return to pre-Inflation Reduction Act rules and could significantly impact affordability for new EV buyers.

New car loan interest deduction

As Kiplinger has reported, the House GOP bill also introduces a temporary above-the-line deduction for car loan interest, capped at $10,000, for loans taken out on eligible vehicles in 2025 through 2028.

The deduction phases out for single filers earning over $149,000 and joint filers over $249,000, and only applies to loans for vehicles assembled in the United States.

While the deduction could provide relief for some buyers, it’s limited in duration and scope, and it’s not yet clear if it will apply to used cars as well.

For more information, see New GOP Car Loan Deduction: Which Vehicles and Buyers Qualify.

Elon Musk 'kill the bill' talk and Tesla stock

Tesla CEO Elon Musk (formerly of Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, fame) has recently been critical of the House GOP tax mega reconciliation bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination.”

The Congressional Budget Office says the bill will add $2.4 trillion to the deficit.

On X (formerly Twitter), Musk wrote, “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.”

Notably, Musk’s criticism comes as Tesla faces significant business headwinds.

Tesla’s stock has dropped nearly 18% year-to-date, and the company’s global sales have fallen.

May data showed a 36% year-over-year drop in Germany and a 15% decline in China.

Despite his recent criticism, Musk has previously seemed to support the Trump administration’s approach to EV policy.

While Musk has warned that ending the EV tax credit could “devastate” the broader EV market, he has also previously suggested that Tesla could ultimately weather the changes better than some competitors.

What’s next for EV owners and car buyers?

If the bill becomes law, current and future EV owners will face higher annual costs and lose access to federal purchase incentives. At the same time, only some buyers would benefit from the new car loan interest deduction if it's enacted.

For now, while the U.S. Senate considers the House GOP proposal, EV owners should prepare for the likelihood of new annual fees and the possible end of tax credits that have made electric vehicles more affordable for some in recent years.

Updating the Clean Electricity Playbook: Learning Lessons from the 100% Clean Agenda

06.05.25 | 6 min read | Text by Arjun Krishnaswami

Building clean energy faster is the most significant near-term strategy to combat climate change. While the Biden Administration and the advocacy community made significant gains to this end over the past few years, we failed to secure major pieces of the policy agenda, and the pieces we did secure are not resulting in as much progress as projected. As a result, clean energy deployment is lagging behind levels needed to match modeled cost-effective scenarios, let alone to achieve the Paris climate goals. Simultaneously, the Trump Administration is actively dismantling the foundations that have underpinned our existing policy playbook.

Adjusting course to rapidly transform the electricity sector—to cut pollution, reduce costs, and power a changing economy—requires us to upgrade the regulatory frameworks we rely upon, the policy tools we prioritize, and the coalition-building and messaging strategies we use.

After leaving the Biden Administration, I joined FAS as a Senior Fellow to jump into this work. We plan to assess the lessons from the Biden era electricity sector plan, interrogate what is and is not working from the advocacy community’s toolkit, and articulate a new vision for policy and strategy that is durable and effective, while meeting the needs of our modern society. We need a new playbook that starts in the states and builds toward a national mission that can tackle today’s pressing challenges and withstand today’s turbulent politics. And we believe that this work must be transpartisan—we intend to draw from efforts underway in a wide range of local political contexts to build a strategy that appeals to people with diverse political views and levels of political engagement.

This project is part of a larger FAS initiative to reimagine the U.S. environmental regulatory state and build a new system that can address our most pressing challenges.

Betting Big on 100% Clean Electricity

If we are successful in fighting the climate crisis, the largest share of domestic greenhouse gas emissions reductions over the next ten years will come from building massive amounts of new clean energy and in turn reducing pollution from coal- and gas-fired power plants. Electricity will also need to be cheap, clean, and abundant to move away from gasoline vehicles, natural gas appliances in homes, and fossil fuel-fired factories toward clean electric alternatives.

That’s why clean electricity has been the centerpiece of federal and state climate policy. The signature climate initiative of the Obama Administration was the Clean Power Plan. Over the past several decades, states have made the most emissions progress through renewable portfolio standards and clean electricity standards that require power companies to provide increasing amounts of clean electricity. Now 24 (red and blue) states and D.C. have goals or requirements to achieve 100 percent clean electricity. And in the 2020 election, Democratic primary candidates competed over how ambitious their plans were to transform the electricity grid and deploy clean energy.

As a result of that competition and the climate movement’s efforts to put electricity at the center of the strategy, President Biden campaigned on achieving 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. This commitment was very ambitious—it surpassed every state goal except Vermont’s, Rhode Island’s, and D.C.’s. In making such a bold commitment, Biden recognized how essential the power sector is to addressing the climate crisis. He also staked a bet that the right policies—large incentives for companies, worker protections, and support for a diverse mix of low-carbon technologies—would bring together a coalition that would fight for the legislation and regulations needed to make the 2035 goal a reality.

A Mix of Wins and Losses

That bet only partially paid off. We won components of the agenda that made major strides toward 100% clean electricity. New tax credits are accelerating deployment of wind, solar, and battery storage (although the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress are actively working to repeal these credits). Infrastructure investments are driving grid upgrades to accommodate additional clean energy. And new grant programs and procurement policies are speeding up commercialization of critical technologies such as offshore wind, advanced nuclear, and enhanced geothermal.

But the movement failed to secure the parts of the plan that would have ensured an adequate pace of deployment and pollution reductions, including a federal clean electricity standard, a suite of durable emissions regulations to cover the full sector, and federal and state policies to reduce roadblocks to new infrastructure and align utility incentives with clean energy deployment. We ran into real-world and political headwinds that held us back. For example, deployment was stifled by long timelines to connect projects to the grid and local ordinances and siting practices that block clean energy. Policy initiatives were thwarted by political opposition from perceived reliability impacts and blowback from increasing electricity rates, especially for newer technologies like offshore wind and advanced nuclear. The opposition to clean energy successfully weaponized the rising cost of living to fight climate policies, even where clean energy would make life less expensive. These barriers not only impeded commercialization and deployment but also dampened support from key stakeholders (project developers, utilities, grid operators, and state and local leaders) for more ambitious policies. The necessary coalitions did not come together to support and defend the full agenda.

As a result, we are building clean energy much too slowly. In 2024, the United States built nearly 50 gigawatts of new clean power. This number, while a new record, falls short of the amount needed to address the climate crisis. Analysis from three leading research projects found that, with the tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, the future in which we get within striking distance of the Paris climate goals requires 70 to 125 gigawatts of new clean power per year for the next five years, 40 to 250 percent higher than our record annual buildout.

Where do we go from here?

The climate crisis demands faster and deeper policy change with more staying power. Addressing the obvious obstacles standing in the way of clean energy deployment, like the process to connect power plants to the grid, is necessary but insufficient. We must also develop new policy frameworks and expanded coalitions to facilitate the rapid transformation of the electricity system.

This work requires us to ask and creatively answer an evolving set of questions, including: What processes are holding us back from faster buildout, and how do we address them? How can utility incentives be better aligned with the deployment and infrastructure investment we need and support for the required policies? How can the way we pay for electricity be better designed to protect customers and a livable climate? Where have our coalitional strategies failed to win the policies we need, and how do we adjust? How should we talk about these problems and the solutions to build greater support?

We must develop answers to these questions in a way that leads us to more transformative, lasting policies. We believe that, in the near term, much of this work must happen at the state level, where there is energy to test out new ideas and frameworks and iterate on them. We plan to build out a state-level playbook that is actionable, dynamic, and replicable. And we intend to learn from the experiences of states and municipalities with diverse political contexts to develop solutions that address the concerns of a wide range of audiences.

We cannot do this work on our own. We plan to draw on the expertise of a diverse range of organizations and people who have been working on these problems from many vantage points.

With federal COVID-19 funding expiring at the end of the year, the transit agencies are facing a $770 million dollar shortfall in 2026. Without new funding from the state, the agencies have warned of service cuts of up to 40%.

The Illinois Senate passed legislation that would impose a $1.50 tax on deliveries like Amazon, Grubhub, and Uber Eats, a 10% tax on rideshare trips, and add a new tax to charge electric vehicles to fund mass transit, but the Illinois House didn't take it up before adjourning their spring session.

Illinois state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-Chicago) said that's due to how late in the last day of session the Senate passed the bill, but he said there's time to get a deal done this year.

""CTA, Metra, Pace – they approve their budgets at the end of the year in December. They have not a July fiscal date like we do here in the state, but they have a January fiscal date.

While lawmakers could return to Springfield this summer or during their fall veto session to address mass transit funding, any laws passed after the end of May will need a three-fifths majority in both chambers to take effect before June 2026, making it more of a challenge to get the necessary votes to approve any potential deal.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/29/e4cd8cda-553a-4e2c-8193-d5ddbfe3ee48/thumbnail/1200x630/f24777c02262e9c12f72a71444a9e213/snapshot-2024-08-29t080223-844.jpg?v=8e774d26301ae5e7a27489083c0cf8b6,N,,2025-06-06 08:38:25.280334

The bad is that word “probably.”

PJM Interconnection, the organization that runs the regional power grid of which Virginia is a part, has warned that under “extreme scenarios” it may not have enough power this summer, and will need certain users to reduce their electricity usage.

This is the first time that PJM has issued such a warning. (See full statement below.)

In a more perfect world, none of us would ever know about PJM; it’s one of those things that operates in the background and we usually only hear about when something goes wrong. Increasingly, though, PJM is turning up in the news through no fault of its own: Thanks largely to the growth of data centers in Northern Virginia (but also the growth of data centers everywhere and our general desire to plug in more devices), we’re seeing power demand grow, both nationally and especially in Virginia.

Last year, the nation’s electricity usage grew 3%, the fifth-largest increase this century, according to the energy think tank Ember.

Virginia is already short of energy in one sense: We don’t produce enough of it, so we’re now the nation’s biggest importer of electricity. For those concerned about cost, this power tends to be more expensive than what we produce in-state. For those concerned about the environment, this imported power also tends to be from carbon-intensive sources. Both these things argue for Virginia to produce more power — and more clean power.

Meanwhile, the General Assembly’s research agency, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, has warned that the state’s electric demand will triple by 2040 if data center growth continues without restraint. Data centers probably won’t grow without restraint; we’re already starting to see some pushback, but not nearly enough for those who want to see more restrictions — so whether the tripling of power demand happens or not, everyone expects that we’ll see some fairly large amount of new power demand.

This is where things start to get complicated.

The state’s Clean Economy Act, passed in 2020, requires a carbon-free electric grid by 2050. That’s spurred a wave of solar development across rural Virginia — except now a growing number of rural localities are rejecting solar projects. Last year, for the first time, local governments turned down more megawatts than they approved, according to the Virginia Solar Database maintained by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia. It turns out that a lot of people in rural Virginia don’t see solar farms as beautiful sources of clean energy but rather as ugly blight that’s turning rural landscape into an unwanted industrial one. Those approval trends have reversed this year — with most projects getting the OK — but the overall trends have raised the question of whether Virginia can realistically meet its clean energy goals.

This past session of the General Assembly grappled with ways to encourage more solar development but failed to agree on a solution. Legislators representing rural areas (mostly Republicans but it was a Democrat who cast the key vote) want to avoid anything that seems like a mandate. Democrats representing suburban districts sponsored legislation to promote more rooftop solar, including putting solar over parking lots, but Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed those measures as “piecemeal changes to fix the discredited Virginia Clean Economy Act.” Of course, Democrats don’t think it’s discredited at all, so there’s a basic philosophical impasse over energy policy.

The result is that Virginia policy hasn’t changed but power demands have. The state still mandates a carbon-free power grid but is dependent on solar-skeptic localities to approve the details. We’ve also had situations where localities have approved power-guzzling data centers but rejected power-producing solar projects. That strikes some as hypocritical but also reflects the basic dynamics of local governments: Local governments are responsible for encouraging economic growth, generating tax revenue and keeping tax rates as low as they can. They have zero responsibility for energy policy. That’s somebody else’s problem.

Now we have more complications.

First, President Donald Trump wants to encourage the use of more artificial intelligence — which is very energy-intensive. Even if Trump didn’t encourage AI, the marketplace is embracing more AI anyway, and that will mean we will need even more power.

Trump has also declared an “energy emergency.” However, the “big, beautiful bill” moving through Congress would stifle the growth of the one form of energy that is a) the quickest to get up and running into the grid and b) accounted for 81% of the new energy added to the grid last year. We’re talking about solar.

Doing away with the energy tax credits as the House spending and tax bill proposes would have an immediate impact on the grid by slowing energy development — at a time when PJM is warning that we need every electron we can produce. Ben Norris of the Solar Energy Industries Association recently told the Virginia Commission on Electric Utility Regulation that the House bill would kill the development of enough solar to power the entire state of Pennsylvania.

Youngkin and other Republicans have traditionally touted an “all of the above” energy policy but Trump doesn’t believe in “all of the above.” He has no interest in renewables; he wants to see more fossil fuels — coal and natural gas — and more nuclear.

Let’s not get hung up on the climate arguments; let’s look just at development times.

Natural gas

Those of us in the western part of the state just saw that it took a decade to build the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which pumps natural gas from northwestern West Virginia to a transmission station in Pittsylvania County. Building an actual natural gas plant is a three- to five-year endeavor.

The New York Times recently reported that there’s a three- to four-year backlog for the giant turbines that make natural gas plants work. For that reason, and others, “by some estimates, it now costs two or three times as much to build a gas-fired power plant as it did a few years ago,” the Times reported. One consequence: “In some parts of the country, solar panels and batteries are likely to be cheaper, energy executives and consultants said.” And quicker.

Nuclear

It took 17 and 18 years respectively for the two most recent nuclear reactors at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia to go from permit application to operation. Trump would like to speed that up but we don’t know how much nuclear development can be sped up. The new species of reactors — small modular reactors — are supposed to be quicker (and cheaper) to build than the larger, conventional variety, but we also don’t know how long those will take to build. The only operational SMRs in the world are currently in China and Russia, probably not examples we want to emulate when it comes to safety. Canada currently has an SMR under construction, the first in North America. The utility broke ground in 2022; site preparation alone took three years and was just finished this year. Construction of the actual reactor began this year, with a projected completion date of 2030 — five years off.

Coal

Trump would like to see more coal but the market reality is that no utility is building new coal plants. Even Appalachian Power, a coal-heavy utility whose service area includes coal country, has said it has no interest in burning more coal because coal is more expensive than other fuels.

Wind

Trump doesn’t like wind. Environmentalists do, but wind also takes a long time to build. The Rocky Forge wind farm in Botetourt County — which would be Virginia’s first on-shore commercial wind farm — was proposed in 2014 but didn’t start construction until this year. It isn’t supposed to start generating power until late 2026. That’s a lag time of 12 years from start to finish. Trump has moved to block most development of offshore wind. That won’t affect Dominion Energy’s offshore wind project because it’s already under construction off the coast of Virginia Beach. However, the development time there is even longer than on-shore wind. Dominion began planning its offshore wind project in 2012 and it’s not expected to be fully operational until 2027 — a span of 15 years, which starts approaching the development time for a nuclear reactor. (Disclosure: Dominion is one of our donors but donors have no say in news decisions; see our policy.)

The point is that all these forms of energy take a long time to build, but we have growing energy demands now. The only form of energy that is quick to develop is solar, with a timeline usually measured in months or a little more than a year for most projects — yet that’s the form of energy that Congress is now moving to slow down. We used to think of natural gas as a “bridge fuel” between the retirement of coal and the large-scale deployment of renewables. However, those who want natural gas (or nuclear or whatever) may need to think of solar as the bridge fuel because it’s the only thing we can plug in quickly. Whether anti-solar people like it or not, solar is where the action is now. In its forecast, PJM said that “renewable resources will be more important than ever this summer to maintain reliability.”

In response to the PJM warning, the U.S. Department of Energy ordered a Pennsylvania utility that was planning to retire an oil and gas plant this summer to keep it open. However, keeping the same amount of energy is not the same as creating more of it, and that’s what we need. Think of this as ordering a product online (which also drives up some energy demands): The online store offers a variety of energy solutions. However, the one with the quickest delivery time is solar, which, if you order it now, you might have as early as next year. For gas, you might have to wait five years depending on where you are. For wind or nuclear, more than a decade. Coal is no longer available because the wholesaler (the utility) no longer wants to stock it. And other products you’ve read about — fusion and geothermal — aren’t on the market yet. So what’s it going to be? If we truly have an emergency and need the power now, the only immediate solution seems to be solar while we wait for whatever it is you really want.

If you’re a resident of rural Virginia who doesn’t want to look at a solar farm across the road, the end of those solar energy tax credits are a good thing — less pressure on Southside and elsewhere. If you philosophically think that we shouldn’t be favoring one form of energy over another, then doing away with those tax credits is also a good thing — more ideological purity. However, if you like the lights coming on, you may want to wonder why we’re trying to shut down an energy development boom now in hopes of some other energy source that might take years to get online.

That’s why Congress’ move to revoke a waiver for California under the federal Clean Air Act last month also jerked back Washington’s ability to mandate the sale of electric and hybrid cars by next decade.

In 2022, Washington lawmakers adopted a set of regulations, based on California’s, to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035 (and to transition away from gas-powered commercial vehicles). When Congress attacked the foundation of California’s policy, it pulled the rug out from under Washington as well.

Now the future of these electric vehicle mandates is uncertain.

Republican lawmakers carried the measure revoking the waiver in both the House and Senate, but Washington’s Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez crossed party lines with several others to vote alongside Republican Reps. Dan Newhouse and Michael Baumgartner, from the east side of the state, revoking the waiver.

The vote undercuts Washington’s ability to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from the country’s single largest source: Transportation. The end result, experts say, is a slower transition away from gasoline-powered cars and toward electric and hybrid ones.

Eyes are now turning to the courts, adding to the long list of Trump-era policies mired in the legal process.

How did we get here?

In 2020, California announced its plan to phase out gas-powered cars. This regulation would peak in 2035 with the state requiring that all cars sold in the state be electric or hybrid. Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (like semitrucks) still reliant on gas would have another decade before they could no longer be sold.

California was the first state to enact this type of electric vehicle mandate. It’s had the authority to set stricter clean air standards than the federal government since 1967 but needs waivers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in order to enforce them. Other state legislatures can adopt California’s stronger regulations as well, with their policies set on the foundation of those waivers.

But California’s electric vehicle mandate set off something of a political battle between Donald Trump and Joe Biden’s presidential administrations. The Democrat allowed for the waiver while the Republican didn’t.

Washington state followed in California’s footsteps in 2022, requiring that all new cars sold here be either electric or plug-in hybrid by 2035 (with lighter requirements for heavier-duty vehicles).

In all, sixteen other states, alongside Washington, D.C., adopted some form of California’s zero-emission vehicle standards and so their fates are tied to its waiver.

Maybe you can see where this is going. With each state basing its regulations on California’s and all of them dependent on that federal waiver, the federal government has a good deal of leverage in the matter.

So when Congress carried out President Trump’s wishes last month by revoking the waiver (and several others), the effects cascaded down the chain, crashing efforts across the nation to phase out gas-powered cars in the years ahead.

What’s the reaction so far?

Congress has never before revoked one of California’s waivers. So why now?

As soon as he moved back into the White House, Trump declared war on policies related to climate change, often calling it a scam or hoax. The revocation of California’s waiver is just one piece of a broader effort from the president and his allies to dismantle scientific efforts conflicting with their political worldview. It’s also another example of a growing effort to stop states from enacting policies that differ from Trump’s.

“They don’t really care about states’ rights,” said state Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Burien, chair of the House Environment and Energy Committee. “That’s a total smoke screen.”

Republicans in Congress who voted to revoke the waiver said they wanted to support consumer choices rather than backing a mandate for electric vehicles.

In a statement, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson called the move “brazenly out of step with the law, science, and public will.”

Ferguson promised to keep Washington moving forward on “building a healthier, cleaner future,” the statement said.

Others, however, felt differently. Sheri Call, president and CEO of the Washington Trucking Associations, said she was thrilled the waiver was revoked.

While Washington’s requirements for electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicles were substantially lower than passenger cars (the state required 40% EV sales by 2035 in that category), they were still unattainable, Call said. Switching to an electric car for a daily commute is one thing. But it’s something entirely different for a long-haul truck moving thousands of pounds of merchandise across the country with sparse charging infrastructure, she said.

“What they’re asking us to do is absolutely impossible,” Call said.

The trucking industry isn’t opposed to decarbonizing, Call said. But it needs more time and more options. She called on Ferguson to help her industry further and ease the transition.

Electric vehicle sales are generally growing across the automobile industry, even as Republicans in Congress target federal subsidies to make them more affordable and Trump doubles down on planet-warming fossil fuels. More than a fifth of the vehicles sold in Washington last year were plug-in hybrids or fully electric.

Requirements in California, Washington and other states for clean vehicles were aimed at speeding up that transition. Without that federal waiver, though, they can no longer require vehicle sales to move toward electric and hybrid options.

In the big picture, this means automakers lose some of their incentive to build more electric vehicles, said Matthew Metz, founder and executive director of Coltura, a Seattle-based nonprofit in favor of EV mandates.

“Left to their own devices, automakers want to build big, gas-guzzling SUVs,” Metz said. “That’s their moneymaking sweet spot.”

Why mandate electric cars in the first place?

The idea is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. At the same time, vehicle emissions cloud the air in cities, exacerbating heart and lung diseases, among other things.

Washington has taken major steps in recent years toward cutting greenhouse gas emissions across the board. The Clean Energy Transformation Act pushes utilities away from natural gas and coal in favor of renewables. The Climate Commitment Act requires top industrial polluters to pay for their emissions and reduce their output over the coming decades.

But transportation produces the most pollution in the state, about 40% of all emissions, said Joe Nguyen, director of the Washington State Department of Commerce.

To that end, state lawmakers adopted a first slate of clean-vehicle standards in 2021, requiring that a fraction of the cars sold in Washington be electric or hybrid by 2025.

The next year, lawmakers strengthened the regulations (based on the California standards), escalating that percentage each year until it reaches 100% in 2035. The regulation also requires commercial vans and trucks to move toward electric and hybrid options but doesn’t call for a full ban of gas-powered vehicle sales in those categories.

To be clear, these regulations apply to vehicle sellers, not individual consumers.

Transportation can be a particularly charged issue with regard to climate regulations. People are sensitive to volatile gas prices. Electric and hybrid vehicles can be expensive and difficult to find. And public transit alternatives can often prove unreliable or inaccessible.

At the same time, the sector has a lot of emission-cutting potential and options for lawmakers to offer subsidies or other transportation alternatives.

Where do we go from here?

Congress’ decision to revoke California’s waiver doesn’t bring Washington’s efforts to a screeching halt, Nguyen said, but it does hamper its efforts. Without an electric vehicle mandate, the state can continue to encourage the transition with things like rebates or expanding charging stations.

Fitzgibbon added that more access to public transportation or even reducing car tab fees for electric vehicles would also help. They’ll explore other options to speed up the shift away from gas.

“We’re not going to take this lying down,” Fitzgibbon said.

State lawmakers also planned for the possibility of losing the waiver.

Washington’s Clean Fuel Standard, passed in 2021, required fuel providers to cut the carbon intensity of their product 20% by 2038. Lawmakers increased that to a 45% reduction this year and built in a back door, Fitzgibbon said.

Should the electric vehicle mandate fall, the state Department of Ecology can increase the clean fuel standard to 55% in the years ahead, Fitzgibbon said.

If one regulation gets weaker, the other grows stronger, he said.

Losing the waiver isn’t a foregone conclusion, though. Trump hasn’t yet signed the bill, though he appears likely to do so in the coming days or weeks. Dispute is growing over whether Congress had the authority to revoke the document in the first place.

The facility, the last coal plant owned by Michigan-based Consumers Energy, includes three units and has a total summer generating capacity of 1,401 megawatts (MW).
And MISO has not been afraid to act: In 2022, it required Missouri-based Ameren to keep its 1,195MW Rush Island coal plant open for reliability reasons.
Then there is the issue of who will pay for keeping the Campbell plant open.
And generating power at the Campbell plant is likely to be costly for ratepayers.","The administration moved forward with a controversial market intervention last month, ordering the aging J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in Michigan to remain open through the summer. The plant had been slated for retirement on May 31, and the unprecedented move, relying on the administration’s previous declaration of an energy emergency, raises a host of questions about the operation of U.S. power markets, including who will pay the sizable cost of keeping it open.

The facility, the last coal plant owned by Michigan-based Consumers Energy, includes three units and has a total summer generating capacity of 1,401 megawatts (MW). Two of the units are old by coal plant standards: The 260MW Unit 1 came online in 1962 and the 356MW Unit 2 came online in 1967, both well past the average retirement age of 50 for U.S. coal plants since 2000. Unit 3, 785MW, came online in 1980.

Consumers Energy announced its plan to retire the coal facility in 2021, and MISO, the regional grid operator, approved that plan three years ago, in March 2022. MISO operates the electricity market and power grid for a 15-state region in the central U.S. that runs from Louisiana north to Minnesota and into the Canadian province of Manitoba.

Plant closures and adding new generation are not decisions that are made arbitrarily. The utility worked extensively with both the Michigan Public Service Commission and MISO to get the approvals needed to replace the power capacity of the aging generators and ensure the closure of Campbell did not affect grid reliability. As part of that effort, Consumers has brought online 502MW of wind generation since 2020, bought the 1,055MW Covert combined cycle gas plant in 2023, and is in the process of adding 515MW of solar generation to its system by 2027.

These capacity replacement moves were clearly enough for MISO. The system operator’s endorsement is critical, since it has the authority to require plants to continue operating if it believes grid stability or shortages could occur. And MISO has not been afraid to act: In 2022, it required Missouri-based Ameren to keep its 1,195MW Rush Island coal plant open for reliability reasons. The decision was upheld by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the plant remained open for two additional years. MISO found no similar problems with Consumers’ plan to close the Campbell plant, saying as recently as May 8 that the region has sufficient resources to meet projected demand this summer. Despite this, the Department of Energy said in its May 24 emergency order that it was directing MISO and Consumers to keep the plant open due to an expected “insufficiency of dispatchable capacity” during the summer.

The contrast between the long-term planning by Consumers, Michigan regulators and MISO to close the plant while maintaining reliable regional power supplies and the sudden federal order to keep the plant open could not be starker.

Then there is the issue of who will pay for keeping the Campbell plant open. The order says nothing about who will end up footing the bill, but Michigan ratepayers almost certainly will be forced to pay for these costs, which will total millions of dollars. For example, in a case in West Virginia in 2023, the utility First Energy told regulators that it would cost at least $3 million a month simply to keep the Pleasants coal plant, a smaller and newer facility, open and capable of operating—and that was without the costs of actually generating power.

And generating power at the Campbell plant is likely to be costly for ratepayers. Units 1 and 2, which are 63 and 58 years old, respectively, were already increasingly uncompetitive in the MISO market, meaning it cost more to generate electricity than what it could be sold for. According to data filed by Consumers at FERC, the operation and maintenance costs for the two plants totaled $45.80 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2023 (the most recent data available). That puts both units in the red almost all the time in MISO: S&P data shows that the monthly around-the-clock price at the Michigan hub has been above $40/MWh just twice in the past two years, and never during the summer. In other words, the plant would lose money on virtually every MWh generated if past prices hold this summer, costs that could add up to many more millions of dollars if the units at Campbell are run for any substantial amount of time.

And there are other costs to consider, such as securing the coal supplies needed to operate the plant. With permanent closure just days away and the plant’s coal contracts set to expire, Consumers would have been trying to burn up the very last of its remaining coal stockpile. Without coal or contracts, the company could be facing some significant and potentially expensive challenges in resupplying the plant, given the volume of coal it had been using and the lead times usually associated with coal deliveries. These include possibly paying a higher price for coal without a contract, and paying the railroads for coal trains and delivery schedules on short notice to bring the fuel to the plant.

In 2024, Campbell burned more than 3.7 million tons of coal, all of it delivered by rail from the Powder River Basin (PRB) in northern Wyoming. That is an average of 12,700 tons of coal a day — roughly equivalent to a one-mile-long coal unit train a day, a substantial amount. Two of the PRB’s biggest mines provided that coal: Arch Resources’ Black Thunder Mine, which delivered 2.25 million tons, and Peabody Energy’s North Antelope Rochelle Mine, which delivered 1.47 million tons. For Arch Resources, the loss of the Campbell plant as a customer is significant since it accounted for more than 5 percent of the mine’s total output in 2024.

Additionally, any coal it does buy will have to be burned up by the new closure date in August, even if the utility loses money in the process.

The DOE order also says nothing about the operational challenges associated with running the aging plant, particularly Unit 1, which was not designed to ramp its power output up and down on a regular basis. An IEEFA analysis shows that Unit 1essentially ran at full power in 2024; if it operates in a similar fashion this summer, it will almost certainly force cheaper sources of power out of the market and raise power prices for Consumers’ ratepayers.

These cost concerns were stressed by Michigan PUC Commissioner Dan Scripps: “The unnecessary recent order from the U.S. Department of Energy will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the Midwest.”

Finally, there is the question of staffing. Utilities have a solid history of reassigning workers from retiring units to other facilities within their systems; other long-time workers may have planned their retirements. Given the lateness of the DOE order, those reassignments probably have been made at the Campbell plant as well, raising the question of whether Consumers will have the staffing needed to operate Campbell safely and reliably this summer, and what it will cost to do so.

DOE’s intervention In the MISO power was clearly unwarranted. MISO and Consumers have planned carefully for Campbell’s closure and the administration should not be trying to undo those decisions. If the order stands, Consumers and Michigan regulators should submit the bill for keeping the plant open to DOE; the utility’s ratepayers should not be on the hook for this unjustified, costly action.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-06/2025-05-29%20IEEFA%20Campbell%20coal%20plant%20map%20452x236%20v2.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 14:24:32.423094

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, offered tax credits and incentives to boost domestic battery production.

In 2024, global battery demand surpassed 1 terawatt-hour, equal to powering 100 million homes for an hour, according to the International Energy Agency. But while demand is booming, the infrastructure to meet it — especially in the U.S. — is still catching up.

The U.S. Push for Battery Independence

For years, the U.S. has relied heavily on foreign sources for battery components and materials. Now, with geopolitical tensions rising and clean energy goals looming, policymakers are trying to change that. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, offered tax credits and incentives to boost domestic battery production. It also introduced restrictions to limit reliance on adversarial nations.

“These policies, as well as support from state and local governments, have significantly accelerated battery manufacturing in the U.S.,” said Matt McDowell, a mechanical engineering and materials science professor at Georgia Tech and Carter N. Paden Jr. Distinguished Chair for Innovation in Material Science and Metals Processing. “But we’re still in the early stages of building a truly resilient supply chain.”

Gleb Yushin, a professor at Georgia Tech and chief technical officer of battery materials company Sila, agrees. “The IRA’s FEOC restrictions sent a timely, much-needed market signal to spur demand for battery materials made outside of China and, in turn, investments by cell makers into local suppliers,” he said.

Still, reshoring production is no small feat. “It’s been great to see increased domestic production of graphite and other components,” McDowell added. “This will result in more robust battery supply and lower prices in the long-term.”

How New Materials Are Changing the Game

While policy is one piece of the puzzle, innovation is another. For decades, graphite has been the go-to material for battery anodes. But researchers have long eyed silicon as a more powerful alternative — one that can store up to 10 times more charge.

The problem? Silicon swells dramatically during charging, which can damage the battery. “It expands by 300%,” Yushin explained. “That’s compared to just 7% for graphite.”

After years of research, Sila developed Titan Silicon™, a silicon-carbon composite that solves the swelling issue. “It offers 25–35% more energy density, over two times faster charging, and can be dropped into any production line,” Yushin said. “Now, the challenge lies in scaling this technology for mass production while staying ahead of market pressures.”

Solid-state and lithium-sulfur batteries are also gaining attention for their potential to improve safety and performance. But while McDowell is excited about these technologies, he cautions that they’re not yet ready for prime time. “A key focus is developing scalable manufacturing processes to compete with lithium-ion batteries,” he said.

Yushin is more skeptical of the benefits. “Solid-state batteries require entirely new supply chains and infrastructure,” he said. “Silicon is a perfect replacement for lithium metal — it’s stable, reversible, and compatible with existing infrastructure.”

What It Will Take to Compete and Lead

The IRA initially generated over $115 billion in clean energy investments, with $69 billion directed toward battery manufacturing. But with parts of the law now under threat of repeal, the future is uncertain.

“Now that most of the IRA stands to be repealed, we will see if a tariff approach can spur the same results,” Yushin said. “There’s a lot of capital waiting on the sidelines. But without long-term certainty, it’s hard to justify the risk.”

He also pointed to deeper structural issues. “Capital intensity and the cost of borrowing are primary inhibitors of investment,” he said. “Firm purchasing of goods is required to secure financing, but uncertainty over tax credits has cooled demand for local supply.”",https://news.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/hg_media/2025-05/AdobeStock_647691237.jpeg,N,,2025-06-05 14:23:28.262290

In protest over Musk’s activities, some Tesla drivers, including celebrities, began selling or getting rid of their vehicles.
The price of a used Tesla Model S and Model Y each dropped by about 16% in February from a year earlier.
“Many people, I think including Musk himself, have realized that the current business model is pretty much played out,” Brauer said.
Finding a time and place to charge is an obstacle for many Tesla drivers and limits the range of customers Tesla can reach.","After a tumultuous months-long period by President Trump’s side, Elon Musk is turning his attention back to his companies, including the stumbling electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc.

Musk announced on X last week that his time as a special government employee was over.

Tesla investors welcomed the news, hoping that Musk’s departure from Washington would boost his car company’s reputation and lagging performance.

Since Musk began his role leading the White House advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency in January, Tesla’s stock has fallen roughly 12%. On Tuesday, the shares closed at $332, down 3.5%.

The Austin, Texas-based company — which has a significant manufacturing operation in Fremont, Calif., and is the dominant EV company in the state — has been the subject of protests and vandalism as Musk, the company’s chief executive, aligned himself with Trump and made controversial spending cuts on behalf of the federal government. The brand damage spread outside the U.S. to Europe, where monthly sales in 32 countries fell nearly 50% in April.

“It was very important for Musk to end this chapter and start working on Tesla’s next stage of growth,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said. “Now he can get back to what he’s supposed to be doing.”

As the executive shifts his focus back to Tesla, here are four challenges experts say he must tackle:

Rebuilding Tesla’s reputation

By associating himself with the president and the Trump administration’s erratic actions, Musk alienated a large swath of his customers. Many Tesla drivers are liberal-leaning, industry analysts said, and were drawn to the company’s environmental mission to take gas cars off the road.

In protest over Musk’s activities, some Tesla drivers, including celebrities, began selling or getting rid of their vehicles. Others sported new bumper stickers that said, “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy.”

In February, Tesla topped the list of brands that lost the most resale value year over year, according to data provided by Karl Brauer, an analyst with iSeeCars.com. The price of a used Tesla Model S and Model Y each dropped by about 16% in February from a year earlier.

“Price is a reflection of supply and demand,” Brauer said. “So it could be that nobody wants to buy them anymore, or that there’s a massive influx of them available, or both.”

Now that he’s left Washington, Musk will have to prove that his attention is on Tesla and that he isn’t prioritizing political agendas. Ives estimated that about 5% to 10% of the brand damage sustained during Musk’s stint in the capital will be permanent.

“Tesla has become a political symbol around the world and that’s not a good thing,” said Ives, who has an “outperform” rating on Tesla’s stock. “But there are much brighter days ahead now that Musk is no longer in the White House.”

Delivering on autonomous driving technology

Musk has made lofty promises for years about the capabilities of Tesla’s self-driving technology and plans for a robotaxi service. Though he has often over-exaggerated his progress, Musk has taken important steps toward commercializing autonomous driving technology.

The future of his company depends on whether he can follow through, experts said.

“Musk’s top priority should be autonomy and robotics,” Ives said. “With these technologies, I believe Tesla’s market cap could reach $2 trillion.” The company is currently valued at just over $1 trillion.

According to claims Musk has made, Tesla drivers will one day be able to sleep in their car as it drives them across the country. Tesla’s robotaxis will roam city streets, and humanoid robots dubbed Optimus will perform everyday tasks.

Brauer compared the emergence of autonomous driving technology to a change on the scale of the internet or smartphones. But it’s still far off, he said. Although the driverless taxi company Waymo is already operating in a few cities including Santa Monica, it could take 10 to 15 years for the technology to become widely accessible and integrated into society, Brauer said.

Keeping up with competition

Tesla remains the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, but rapidly increasing competition from traditional carmakers and other EV manufacturers have thinned sales, Brauer said.

Major manufacturers including Ford and Chevy have released lines of their own electric vehicles, while promising startups such as Irvine-based Rivian have cut into Tesla’s market share. At the same time, demand for electric vehicles is plateauing as the market gets saturated, Brauer said.

Tesla’s profit plummeted 71% in the first quarter to $409 million as the company faced a flurry of setbacks, including a falloff in automotive sales and rising competition.

To keep up and remain viable, Tesla will have to reassess aspects of its business model.

“Many people, I think including Musk himself, have realized that the current business model is pretty much played out,” Brauer said. “He’s not going to substantially increase his revenue and his profit selling these same electric cars.”

Tesla could receive a boost in sales if it successfully launched an affordable model accessible to more customers, but despite rumors and claims by executives, a release date has not been announced.

The company could be further hurt by the loss of a $7,500 federal electric vehicle credit, which encourages sales and is likely to be eliminated by the Trump administration.

Completing a charging network

While chargers for electric vehicles are ubiquitous in many parts of California, infrastructure is lacking throughout large areas of the country — and that’s a problem. For the U.S. to rely more heavily on EVs, significant progress has to be made on the network of charging stations, Brauer said.

Finding a time and place to charge is an obstacle for many Tesla drivers and limits the range of customers Tesla can reach. The lack of a fully comprehensive charging network would also hinder Musk’s plans to operate a nationwide robotaxi service, Brauer said.

In California, many chargers are broken or have been intentionally damaged by protesters.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1026129/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5723x3005+0+995/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F95%2F27%2F2bcc7d124c669a45611be9bfab71%2Fap22081531669276.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 14:26:18.802638

Based on a European Union directive targeting unfair commercial practices, the TotalEnergies lawsuit is the first time a French court has heard such a case against a fossil fuel company.","French oil and gas giant TotalEnergies goes on trial in Paris on Thursday over allegations of misleading climate claims, an unprecedented ""greenwashing"" case against a fossil fuel firm in France.

The civil case stems from a March 2022 lawsuit by three environmental groups accusing the French energy giant of ""misleading commercial practices"" for saying it could reach carbon neutrality while continuing oil and gas production.

Starting in May 2021, TotalEnergies advertised its goal of ""carbon neutrality by 2050"" and touted gas as ""the fossil fuel with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions"".

At the time, the company had also changed its name from Total to TotalEnergies to emphasise its investments in low-carbon energy, such as electricity.

The plaintiffs have logged around 40 ""false advertisements"" in their lawsuit.

The ads ""don't sincerely reflect the reality of TotalEnergies' operations"", Apolline Cagnat, a legal counsel at Greenpeace, told AFP.

Cagnat said the NGOs want the court to send a ""strong signal"" to fossil fuel companies by ordering ""an immediate stop, under penalty, of the misleading commercial practices"".

TotalEnergies disputes the charges, insisting the messages are part of its institutional communication, regulated by financial authorities -- not consumer law.

It argues no consumer organisation is party to the case, and that the NGOs are misusing consumer protection rules to challenge its corporate strategy.

Environmental groups in recent years have turned to the courts to establish case law on companies misleading consumers by appearing more eco-friendly than they are.

In Europe, courts ruled against Dutch airline KLM in 2024 and Germany's Lufthansa in March over misleading consumers about their efforts to reduce the environmental impact of flying.

In Spain, utility Iberdrola failed to secure a conviction against Spanish oil and gas company Repsol over similar allegations of ""false"" environmental claims.

A greenwashing case against Australian oil and gas producer Santos, challenging its claim to be a ""clean fuels"" company, has been ongoing since 2021.

Based on a European Union directive targeting unfair commercial practices, the TotalEnergies lawsuit is the first time a French court has heard such a case against a fossil fuel company.

The NGOs said the Paris court will rule, for the first time in the world, on the legality of ads presenting gas as essential to the energy transition.

Climate experts say methane leaks from the gas industry have a powerful warming effect on the atmosphere.

TotalEnergies maintains it has not engaged in misleading commercial practices.

The company says it plans to show that its messages ""about its name change, strategy and role in the energy transition are reliable and based on objective, verifiable data"".

Policy Uncertainty Erodes Investor Confidence in U.S. Clean Energy The Inflation Reduction Act brought record investment in U.S. manufacturing.
Investing in domestic clean energy under competitive market conditions is crucial for building a resilient U.S. energy system, enhancing industrial competitiveness, and facilitating the transition towards a cleaner economy.
However, the energy policy established by the previous administration, with its multi-billion dollar tax breaks and subsidies, as well as government favoritism, has complicated the signals for clean energy investment.
To stay competitive in the global energy transition, the U.S. must provide clarity, consistency, and long-term confidence in its clean energy policies.","The Trump Administration’s energy policies are shifting the investment priorities in American renewable energy, and not to its benefit. But the jury is still out whether the green transition can be stopped or reversed.

In the first quarter of 2025, approximately $8 billion in clean energy investments and 16 large-scale projects were cancelled – the highest drop on record and the first decline since the Biden Administration enacted the barely effective Inflation Reduction Act which strongly favored the renewables. Among the companies that changed their plans were T1 Energy, formerly known as Freyr Battery, Kore Power, and many other solar, battery, and EV manufacturers. Projections still indicate that the U.S. will continue to increase its added renewable generation capacity in 2025, with Texas leading the way, profiting regardless of subsidies.

As green investors grow uncomfortable with the U.S. policy environment, other countries are using this to attract that capital instead. At the Energy and Security conference in London, co-hosted by the UK government and the IEA, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer told a roomful of global investors, “Let my message to the world go out: come build the future of energy here in Britain.” Yet, given UK and EU anemic economic growth, Starmer and other European leaders may succeed in their bid to usurp America’s future energy lead.

Policy Uncertainty Erodes Investor Confidence in U.S. Clean Energy

The Inflation Reduction Act brought record investment in U.S. manufacturing. However, the uncertainty surrounding its long-term direction is causing investors to hesitate, fearing that political shifts could undermine the policy foundations of their projects. Among others, Freyr Battery cancelled a $2.5 billion investment in a battery factory in Georgia, while Bosch cancelled a $200 million hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina in early 2025. Bosch still wants to reach economies of scale in green hydrogen, but is planning to focus on several projects in Europe. These developments reflect growing investor concern about the U.S. policy environment, which has undergone significant changes during the second Trump administration, as shown by declining indicators like Nasdaq’s Clean Edge Green Energy Index.

From Executive Orders like “Unleashing American Energy”, which calls for the immediate termination of the Green New Deal, to stepping away from the Paris Climate Agreement, eliminating grants for renewable energy projects, and weakening environmental institutions, there is a distinct shift away from renewables. In addition to policies directly targeting solar and wind, and climate-related programs, escalating global tariffs, trade tensions, and particularly the trade war with China, create risk in the U.S. investment climate.

For example, polysilicon is essential for manufacturing solar PV batteries, and Clean Investment Monitor’s April report estimates that polysilicon production expected to come online by 2035 represents 9 GW of solar capacity to be deployed by 2035. However, 87% of this capacity is linked to facilities that have been announced but have yet to be built, a sign of the policy uncertainty.

Global Players Move in as America Pulls Back

Countries such as the UK are likely to attempt capturing capital flowing out of the U.S. Following Prime Minister Starmer’s remarks at London’s Energy Security Summit, the UK’s energy secretary wrote to companies worldwide, promoting the UK’s clean energy plan and commitment to attracting investments. The U.S., by contrast, stood out at the summit for strongly backing fossil fuel expansion, in contrast with other participating countries more committed to renewables.

Renewable Energy in Sino-American Economic Competition

Beijing, which massively committed to the export-focused green tech, is seeking an advantage as well. This month, China released an unprecedented comprehensive national database of emissions broken down by location, industry, and type. It aims to inform investors how much money they can get by remediating certain emissions in both new and existing projects. The unspoken message is clear: America might not pay to reduce carbon emissions, but China will. Recognizing this, the UK sees cooperating with China as a “no-brainer” while acknowledging concerns over its supply chain dominance.

China continues to be the most significant player in the global clean energy landscape, specifically in manufacturing, exports, deployment, and supply chains. Instead of attending the summit, President Xi Jinping spoke at the UN, stating that China will remain committed to climate action regardless of what other major nations do.

In 2024, China poured approximately $680 billion into clean energy manufacturing, nearly matching the combined investments of the U.S. and the EU. As Milo McBride, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, noted, ""It is difficult to overstate China’s singular lead across clean energy technologies. The gaps are both enormous and historically unprecedented."" In 2024, with sales and investments worth $1.9 trillion, clean energy contributed 10% of China’s GDP, making it a key component of economic growth.

Investing in domestic clean energy under competitive market conditions is crucial for building a resilient U.S. energy system, enhancing industrial competitiveness, and facilitating the transition towards a cleaner economy. However, the energy policy established by the previous administration, with its multi-billion dollar tax breaks and subsidies, as well as government favoritism, has complicated the signals for clean energy investment.

Today, other countries are taking notice of the Trump Administration's policy shift and are attempting to attract investors to capture capital flight. Solar and wind are not going away, regardless of personal preferences, but that doesn't mean they need to be heavily subsidized by taxpayers. To stay competitive in the global energy transition, the U.S. must provide clarity, consistency, and long-term confidence in its clean energy policies.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6841248af8a8a64d90add2ba/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-05 14:23:48.657076

When asked about drilling for oil and natural gas on federal land, 33% of Americans say it should be increased and 28% say it should be decreased. The remainder say the amount of oil and natural drilling should be kept the same as it is now (19%) or are not sure (20%).

Democrats and Republicans have divergent views on this question, reflecting broader differences on fossil fuel production and use. A majority of Republicans (57%) say drilling for oil and natural gas on federal land should be increased, while only 9% say it should be decreased. In contrast, almost half of Democrats say oil and natural gas drilling should be decreased and about one-in-ten say it should be increased.

Younger Republicans are far less likely than older Republicans to say oil and natural gas drilling should be increased on federal land. Roughly one-third of Republicans ages 18 to 29 (34%) say drilling for oil and natural gas on federally owned land should be increased, compared with 70% of Republicans 50 and older. A smaller share of Republicans 18 to 29 (15%) think drilling for oil and natural gas on federal land should be decreased.

The survey asked roughly half of respondents whether they favor or oppose more offshore wind turbine farms (the other half of respondents were asked about their views on “wind turbine farms,” which is regularly included in our surveys on energy). About seven-in-ten favor more offshore wind farms (69%), while three-in-ten oppose this. More than eight-in-ten Democrats (84%) favor more offshore wind power, while about half of Republicans do (52%).

Electric truck startup Bollinger Motors has exited U.S. court receivership thanks to more financial aid from parent Mullen Automotive Inc., whose chief has ambitious plans for a rebound set in Michigan.

California-based Mullen acquired an additional 21 percent of Bollinger, bringing its ownership stake in the suburban Detroit company to 95 percent, Mullen announced June 2 as it executed its second reverse stock split in as many months to stay compliant with Nasdaq rules on share prices.

In tandem with Mullen’s transaction, Bollinger was discharged from federal court receivership and case dismissed with prejudice, according to a filing in U.S. district court in Detroit.

Mullen Automotive CEO David Michery said the company paid $11 million to Robert Bollinger. In March, Bollinger sued the company he founded, claiming it was broke and seeking to recover his loan.

Sign up for the weekly Automotive News Mobility Report newsletter for the latest developments at the intersection of transportation and technology.

Mullen, which has faced a host of financial issues beyond Bollinger, is all-in on the electric vehicle startup, Michery said June 4 in an interview with Automotive News and affiliate Crain’s Detroit Business. Bollinger Motors — despite the spat with its namesake — will persevere as a brand that “will outlast everyone,” Michery vowed at the startup’s Oak Park, Mich., headquarters.

“You can’t blame Bollinger for the current market, you can’t blame Bollinger for tariffs, you can’t blame Bollinger for the disruption that occurred with Robert filing this frivolous lawsuit,” Michery said. “That hurt the company.”

Now, Mullen is putting its chips on Bollinger Motors to weather the storm. Michery said production of Class 4 trucks would resume in eight to 10 weeks and that the company’s staff of about 85 in metro Detroit would soon swell in line with a predicted increase in demand — though that remains in question with a stagnant market.

Mullen will close its engineering base in Irvine, Calif., and consolidate it to the company’s tech center near Detroit in Troy, Mich., where 40 to 50 employees will be added, Michery said.

In recognition of this day, we explore how the dream of limitless clean energy may be closer than we think. While solar and wind have laid the foundation, newer technologies like hydrogen and nuclear fusion are gaining momentum — and at the heart of their progress lies innovation and intellectual property (IP).

The growing pressure on power

Global energy demand is soaring — driven by the rise of electric vehicles, energy-intensive manufacturing, and the rapid expansion of AI, data centres and digital infrastructure. Electricity demand alone has grown at twice the rate of overall energy consumption over the past decade. By 2030, it is projected to rise by 6,750 terawatt-hours — more than the current combined usage of the US and EU. Data centres alone could account for 20% of that growth.

On top of this, electricity production remains the largest source of global CO₂ emissions. Without a rapid shift to cleaner energy sources, meeting climate goals over the next five to twenty-five years will be all but impossible.

A green transition underway

Fortunately, change is in motion. As we discussed in our 2025 Clean Tech Trends report, the renewable energy sector is accelerating. Global leaders — from policymakers to scientists — are striving to decarbonise the energy system while also tackling energy poverty, aiming to deliver clean, affordable power for all.

But despite their success, intermittent supply and grid strain limit their scalability. The question now is: what comes next?

Hydrogen: clean, flexible, scalable energy

Hydrogen is emerging as one of the most promising alternatives. Hydrogen fuel cells produce electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen — emitting only water and heat. These cells can be integrated into existing infrastructure, making them highly adaptable.

Beyond cutting emissions, hydrogen offers an opportunity to decentralise power generation, which could ease grid pressure and benefit regions lacking reliable solar or wind resources. Companies like GeoPura argue that hydrogen could be the answer to both the AI energy boom and the electrification of transport, especially in the face of projected grid connection delays of up to 15 years.

Government and industry support is also growing. A 2024 white paper from Bosch, Centrica, and Ceres outlined hydrogen’s role in decarbonising UK power through solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). And yet, a challenge remains: while hydrogen fuel cells are green, the hydrogen used to power them often isn’t. As of 2024, only around 1% of global hydrogen is produced via low-emission methods like electrolysis — the rest is derived from fossil fuels. Scaling up ‘green hydrogen’ production will be crucial.

Momentum is building. In 2024, the UK committed £2 billion to fund 11 commercial electrolytic hydrogen projects, attracting an additional £413 million in private investment. In the US, Electric Hydrogen is delivering a 100MW electrolyser system capable of producing 45 tonnes of hydrogen per day with minimal emissions. According to the International Energy Association’s Global Hydrogen Review 2024, annual production of low-emissions hydrogen could reach 49 Mtpa H2 by 2030, up from 1 Mtpa H2 in 2024.

The pace of innovation is clear — but sustained progress requires more than technology alone.

Fusion energy: approaching a breakthrough?

Looking ahead, nuclear fusion could become the ultimate clean energy source. By fusing light atomic nuclei — typically deuterium and tritium — fusion releases vast amounts of energy without carbon emissions. One gram of fuel can generate the same energy as 20 tonnes of coal. With deuterium abundantly available in seawater and new tritium breeding techniques in development (e.g. by the likes of Oxford Sigma), fusion promises safe, scalable, and virtually limitless power.

Compared to nuclear fission, fusion produces significantly less radioactive waste, with materials becoming safe in around 100 years — not thousands, and carries a much lower risk of catastrophic failure.

Once considered a far-off fantasy, fusion is now edging closer to reality. In 2025, the EU unveiled its Competitiveness Compass, a roadmap that includes a new fusion strategy and public-private partnerships. The ITER project in France continues to make progress, while the UK has committed £410 million to develop the STEP prototype fusion plant, expected to be operational in the 2040s.

Why intellectual property matters

As hydrogen and fusion technologies scale up, the role of intellectual property becomes more critical than ever. Both fields face substantial barriers: long R&D timelines, high capital costs, and complex global supply chains. In this environment, IP provides innovators with a strategic advantage — helping protect their ideas, attract investment and support market growth.

IP and access to funding

It has been found recently that over 80% of late-stage venture capital funding in the hydrogen sector has gone to companies with existing patent applications. (See above graph; source)

In comparison, in the fusion space, innovators have commonly eschewed the pursuit of patents, believing commercial fusion to be too far off for a 20-year patent term to be relevant. That logic is now shifting, particularly as US-based fusion firms with robust patent strategies dominate funding rounds.

IP and collaboration

IP does more than protect inventions — it creates the legal scaffolding that enables meaningful collaboration. In frontier technologies like hydrogen and fusion, where development costs are high and technical expertise is globally dispersed, innovation increasingly happens across borders and between sectors. Whether it’s a private company building on public R&D or international teams co-developing fusion reactors, clear and enforceable IP rights are essential to align incentives, manage shared risk and ensure fair returns. In this way, IP acts not as a barrier, but as a bridge — fostering the trust needed to turn bold ideas into shared progress.

IP and market confidence

In emerging clean energy sectors such as hydrogen and fusion, IP will serve as a key instrument of market confidence. Hydrogen and fusion technologies are often capital-intensive, complex, and years away from profitability. For investors, robust IP portfolios will provide assurance that a company’s innovations are both unique and defensible — that they are not merely speculative science projects, but investable propositions. Patents thus have a key role in transforming R&D into tangible, protectable assets, offering a degree of certainty in an otherwise uncertain innovation landscape. With greater certainty provided, IP in turn can help channel private capital into high-impact green technologies, accelerating their path from lab bench to power grid.

A tool for global impact

This World Environment Day, we find ourselves at a turning point. Hydrogen and fusion have the potential to reshape the global energy landscape — but realising that promise will require coordinated innovation, investment and policy support.

IP will play a central role. Not just as a tool for protection, but as a foundation for confidence, cooperation and commercialisation. To fully unlock its potential, we must also embrace IP models that support responsible licensing, open innovation and global access. If we succeed, IP may become one of our most powerful tools in the fight against climate change.",https://www.mathys-squire.com/app/uploads/2025/06/AdobeStock_806774778-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-06-05 14:23:56.246131

This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Interviews were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.

Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.

The Trump administration has pursued an energy policy that prioritizes the development of fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and natural gas, over renewable sources like wind and solar. In Washington, Congress is considering speeding up approval of oil and natural gas projects and cutting incentives for low-carbon electricity development.

How have Americans’ views on energy changed in recent years? A new Pew Research Center survey of 5,085 U.S. adults conducted from April 28 to May 4, 2025, takes a look. This report builds on our long-standing work tracking how Americans think about energy production in the United States and related issues, including views on electric vehicles.

Key highlights

While wind and solar power are still popular overall, Americans have become less supportive of these sources since the first Trump administration. This shift has been driven by sharp declines in support among Republicans and Republican leaners.

Nuclear power has seen an increase in support in recent years, with more positive views among Republicans and Democrats alike.

Phasing out the production of new gasoline cars and trucks by 2035 is unpopular with Americans. A majority oppose this proposal, and opposition has become more widespread since 2021 (among both Republicans and Democrats).

Americans are more likely to say they would seriously consider buying a hybrid vehicle (45%) than an electric vehicle (33%). Democrats remain more likely than Republicans to say that next time they purchase a vehicle, they would be interested in buying a hybrid or electric model.

Shifting support for renewable energy since the first Trump administration

In the new survey, 68% of Americans favor more wind power, compared with 83% in 2020 at the end of the first Trump administration.

Similarly, 77% of Americans favor more solar power, down from nine-in-ten in 2020.

Using more of these renewable energy sources still remains popular with Americans – more so than carbon-intensive options like hydraulic fracturing and coal mining – but there’s been a clear trend in waning support nonetheless.

While less popular than renewable options, forms of fossil fuel development receive somewhat greater support today than five years ago.

Decline in support for renewables among Republicans since first Trump administration

In 2020, and in other Center surveys during the first Trump administration, wind and solar were the most popular forms of energy development among Republicans. For example, in 2020, 84% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents supported more solar power and 75% favored more wind power. Smaller shares favored more offshore oil and gas drilling (63%), hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas (56%), coal mining (54%) and nuclear power (53%).

In the new survey, wind and solar are much less popular among Republicans than they were, reflecting declines that have occurred over the last five years. About six-in-ten favor more solar power (61%), and about half favor more wind power (48%). There’s now greater GOP support for expanding offshore oil and gas drilling (75%), hydraulic fracturing (69%), nuclear power (69%) and coal mining (67%).

Should the country prioritize renewable or fossil fuel energy?

When asked whether the country should prioritize developing renewable sources or fossil fuel sources, six-in-ten Americans say the country should prioritize renewables like wind and solar. While this remains the majority opinion, the share who prioritize renewable sources is down significantly from a high 0f 79% in the spring of 2020.

Republicans’ views on the nation’s energy priorities are now the reverse of what they were in 2020.

Today, 67% of Republicans and Republican leaners say the country should give priority to developing fossil fuel sources like oil, coal and natural gas. In 2020, 65% of Republicans said renewable energy development should be the country’s bigger priority.

Younger Republicans still prioritize renewable energy more than older Republicans, but their support has dropped since last year

Younger Republicans remain more supportive of solar and wind power than their older counterparts – but their support for renewable energy has declined in the last year. For example, 51% of Republicans ages 18 to 29 say the country should prioritize renewable energy, a decrease of 16 percentage points from last year.

Refer to the Appendix for more.

Overwhelming majorities of Democrats continue to back wind and solar power. In the new survey, 91% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they favor more solar power and 87% support more wind power. Democratic support for renewables has been steadfast in recent years, and these shares are nearly identical to those seen during the first Trump administration. Consistent with these views, a large 86% majority think the country should prioritize renewable energy development over fossil fuel development.

Increased support for nuclear power

Some are pointing to more nuclear power as one way for the U.S. to meet rising demand for electricity. Americans have become much more favorable toward more nuclear power plants in recent years. About six-in-ten (59%) now back more nuclear power plants to generate electricity. As recently as 2020, there was greater opposition than support for more nuclear power. The increase in support for nuclear power has occurred among both Democrats and Republicans.",https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/06/PS_25.06.05_Energy_featured.png?w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-06-05 14:24:41.101375

The panel released a budget reconciliation draft that would rescind all the unspent funds and create a fee that developers of energy projects like oil wells or pipelines can pay to speed through environmental reviews.

The Environment and Public Works Committee budget reconciliation text would repeal all sections of the 2022 IRA, which Biden signed. The act unleashed billions of dollars in grants, loans and incentives for clean energy and electric vehicles, but unspent funds would be rescinded under the Senate panel's plan.

“This legislative text puts in motion plans that Senate Republicans pledged to take, like stopping Democrats’ natural gas tax and rescinding unobligated dollars from the so-called Inflation Reduction Act,"" said West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito, the Republican chair of the EPW committee.

Senate Republicans are wrestling with substantial changes to President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill, which narrowly won approval in the House of Representatives last month, a sign that significant hurdles remain for the package.

Some Republican senators have said they are interested in preserving some of the IRA's tax credits that were weakened in the House bill because they benefit investments in their states.

The measure would also pause for 10 years a fee on methane emissions for oil and gas operators included in Biden's law. It would also allocate over $250 million to repair the Kennedy Center for the Arts in Washington.

Other tax credits, such as advanced manufacturing production credits (Section 45X) and the investment and production tax credits (ITC/PTC), may also be terminated earlier than initially intended.
“The interconnected nature of clean energy financing means that changes in one area ripple throughout the entire market,” explained Johnson.
The report concludes that the outlook for clean energy financing in US projects and manufacturing remains robust, with increasing standardisation, growing liquidity, and broad policy support.","The report’s release comes as the US tax Reconciliation Bill passed a vote in the House of Representatives and is currently being discussed by the Senate. The bill, in its current form, would bring a swift end to tax credits which had bolstered US clean energy industries.

“The near-term uncertainty may lead some developers to face higher costs of capital, more limited capital availability, or higher equity requirements as they seek to finance their projects,” said Crux.

Among the measures that would affect the clean energy industry in general is the inclusion of a provision that would limit “prohibited foreign entities” from accessing Inflation Reduction Act tax credits or the possibility of limiting procurement of materials from certain foreign entities.

According to Crux, investors are divided on whether the provisions would affect their decision to invest in a company exposed to a foreign entity of concern (FEOC). Just over half (54.5%) of investors said it would not change their willingness to invest in a project, but 45.5% said it would.

“As we face unprecedented energy demands and shifting geopolitics, the efficiency and transparency of capital markets will determine whether America can successfully build the energy infrastructure of the future,” said Alfred Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Crux.

“This report pulls back the curtain on financing trends that have historically been opaque, giving project developers and manufacturers the insights they need to structure competitive financing packages.”

The House of Representatives bill also proposes the termination of several tax credits sooner than expected. The termination of Section 25D, a residential energy tax credit, was brought forward to the end of this year, rather than the end of 2034. Other tax credits, such as advanced manufacturing production credits (Section 45X) and the investment and production tax credits (ITC/PTC), may also be terminated earlier than initially intended.

“The interconnected nature of clean energy financing means that changes in one area ripple throughout the entire market,” explained Johnson.

“For example, our data shows that tax credit bridge lending – which allows projects to pull forward the value of future tax credits – has become increasingly accessible, with terms largely driven by advance rates and the presence of committed investment-grade tax credit buyers. If tax credit policies change, understanding these debt market dynamics becomes even more critical for project success.”

More capital available for solar PV and energy storage

One of the key findings from Crux’s report is that capital is most widely available for solar PV and energy storage projects. According to Crux, almost every investor at all stages of the development process indicated that they would invest in solar.

Moreover, construction/term lending for projects with contracted offtake usually has greater capital availability and lower cost of capital. Over 70% of lenders indicated that they were willing to invest in a fully contracted project. However, Crux’s data indicates that a smaller group of lenders are open to merchant or partially contracted projects.

The report concludes that the outlook for clean energy financing in US projects and manufacturing remains robust, with increasing standardisation, growing liquidity, and broad policy support.

Despite trade policy, tax administration and economic volatility persisting, Crux expects the foundation for long-term capital formation to be strong as the market matures beyond established solar, wind and energy storage technologies, and as smaller developers gain more liquid access to capital.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/american-public-power-association.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 14:24:46.360573

An exception is the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, whose president, former Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Stivers, wrote an op-ed praising the manufacturing tax credits and urging their retention.
Let’s take a step back and remember some of the politics around the passage of the IRA.
“The IRA just happens to have a large bill because it was so damn successful,” he said.
Most of the employees and family members who would be calling their members of Congress to defend the tax credits haven’t been hired yet.","One of the largest manufacturing investments in Ohio’s history has transformed cornfields in a rural county into a battery factory that could soon have thousands of employees.

The plant, a joint venture of Honda and LG Energy Solution, is part of a wave of new factories developed across the country following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, most of them in states and counties that usually vote Republican.

So what happens now, when the tax credits that support this plant and others like it are under threat in Washington as Congress and President Donald Trump try to find a way to pay for large tax cuts?

The answer, so far, is unsatisfying. The debate over the budget reconciliation measure that its authors call “One Big Beautiful Bill” has included little discussion of the manufacturing and energy tax credits as Republicans and Democrats place more emphasis on the parts of the bill that deal with tax cuts and Medicaid.

If enacted as currently written, the bill would lead to a more rapid phaseout of a tax break for battery production and other manufacturing, and it would eliminate a consumer tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicles.

I am based in Ohio and have heard little outcry from business leaders or state officials here about provisions in the bill that would severely harm the battery plant, which is near the village of Jeffersonville. An exception is the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, whose president, former Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Stivers, wrote an op-ed praising the manufacturing tax credits and urging their retention.

“Each manufacturing job supports an entire ecosystem in the local economy—restaurants, retailers, housing, and small businesses all benefit from manufacturing growth,” he wrote. “Communities once facing economic uncertainty now see renewed vitality.”

Honda referred questions about the reconciliation bill to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group for auto manufacturers.

“We believe the consumer credits are critical for automakers to achieve current federal and state emissions standards,” said Brian Weiss, a spokesman for the group, in an email.

Let’s take a step back and remember some of the politics around the passage of the IRA. It was a party-line vote, with every Republican voting against, but the authors wrote the bill in a way that would encourage manufacturing investment everywhere. They knew that much, if not most, of the investment would be in Republican-leaning areas, based on which places have open land for new factories and the larger trends of rapid development in the Southeast.

Part of the idea was that by spreading the benefits, the IRA would gain bipartisan support. It would transform rural portions of Ohio, Georgia, South Carolina and other states and show how government policies could bring manufacturing jobs back to this country and make the United States more competitive with China and others.

Was this idea wrong? I don’t think so, despite what’s now happening in Washington.

To help explain, I got in touch with Jigar Shah, a longtime energy entrepreneur who served as director of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office during the Biden administration.

He is skeptical of any attempt to connect the IRA to a hypothesis about U.S. politics and thinks it would have little to do with the current budget debate except for the fact that it has dollars that can be redirected to tax cuts.

“The IRA just happens to have a large bill because it was so damn successful,” he said. “The IRA wouldn’t have any cost associated with it at all if we didn’t have 1,000 new manufacturing plants that got announced during the last four years.”

Shah is relieved that the cuts to the manufacturing tax credit are not deeper. The House bill ends the credit in 2031 instead of a phaseout that concludes in 2032, as specified in the IRA, and it adds new restrictions to the credit’s transferability and places other limits that could reduce its use.

The more immediate cuts are to consumer-facing credits for climate-conscious acts such as buying rooftop solar and EVs.

Shah sees opportunities for the Senate, which is now working on the bill, to change some of the most onerous parts of the House bill. One easy fix, he said, would be to throw out or revise a provision that could be read to mean that a manufacturing project is ineligible for credits if it has even one component from a “foreign entity of concern,” such as China.

Let’s get back to Ohio.

President Barack Obama won Ohio’s electoral votes in 2012 largely because he painted Mitt Romney as someone who bought up companies and laid people off, Shah said.

“The IRA understood that people wanted stuff to be built in Ohio and that’s exactly what was inspired in communities that haven’t seen these types of investments in more than a half century,” he said.

He pointed to a database from the U.S. Department of Energy showing that Biden-era policies led to announcements of 11,684 new jobs and $12.5 billion in investment in Ohio.

The IRA was a large step forward, but it’s still in an early stage. The Honda plant has hired about 450 employees in anticipation of starting battery production by the end of this year.

It’s nowhere close to the 2,200 jobs that would be there if the plant was running at full capacity. The same is true of many other projects that benefit from IRA incentives and are still ramping up hiring.

Most of the employees and family members who would be calling their members of Congress to defend the tax credits haven’t been hired yet.

So, when environmental advocates and others wonder why there isn’t more of an outcry from places like Ohio in the budget debate, I think they may misunderstand the extent to which IRA benefits have arrived. This law needs more time for its constituency to grow.

We will learn, maybe within weeks, whether it will get that chance.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

The GOP Budget Bill Could Hit Consumers With High Electricity Prices: Electricity prices are already rising across the country. The budget reconciliation bill in Congress could make it worse, as Brad Plumer and Rebecca F. Elliott report for The New York Times. They cite recent research showing that the legislation could increase an average family’s electricity costs by $400 per year, due to the loss of energy tax credits and market factors that could make natural gas more expensive, which would boost market prices for electricity.

All Eyes Are on North Carolina’s Tillis as IRA Tax Credits Hang in Balance: Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) is a key vote as the Senate considers the budget reconciliation bill that would repeal much of the Inflation Reduction Act. He has expressed support for some of the tax credits in the IRA and environmental and clean energy advocates in his state are holding out hope that he will demand changes in the bill, as Elizabeth Ouzts reports for Canary Media.

Clean Energy Project Cancellations Exceed $14 Billion So Far in 2025: Businesses have cancelled or delayed more than $14 billion of investments in U.S. clean energy projects this year, a sign of uncertainty and pessimism, as my colleague Marianne Lavelle reports for ICN. There are still some positive signs, including $4.2 billion in new projects announced in the same period, from January through April, but that isn’t nearly enough to keep up with the cuts and delays.

Trump Administration Names Energy Attorney to Replace FERC’s Christie: The White House said this week that it is nominating Laura Swett, an energy attorney, to take the seat of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Mark Christie, as Ethan Howland reports for Utility Dive. The move appears to have been a surprise to Christie, who is a Republican, and it may signal that the Trump administration would like greater control of this independent agency. Analysts expect that Trump will name the other Republican on the panel, Lindsay See, as interim chair.

ACP says more BESS capacity was connected in Q1 2025 than in any other first quarter on record.

These installations place the cumulative operational storage capacity for the US above 30GW, which ACP notes is a growth of 65% year-on-year from Q1 2024.

Battery storage accounted for 27% of all pipeline capacity, with ACP noting its ‘robust’ growth of increasing 57% year-over-year.

A total of 28 battery storage projects were commissioned during Q1 2025, 22 standalone and 6 paired with wind or solar.

ACP notes that the two largest storage projects to come online during this time were NextEra Energy Resources’ 200MW/800MWh Silver State South Storage in Nevada and AES Indiana’s 200MW/800MWh Pike County Energy Storage.

Texas installed near equal amounts of land-based wind, solar and storage in Q1 across its approximately 1,800MW of clean power installations.

California’s clean power installations were mostly energy storage during Q1.

Indiana saw the second-largest increase in storage capacity and the third-largest addition of utility-scale solar in Q1. The state expanded its storage by 256MW, four times its previous installed capacity.

Notably, of the top ten states for Q1 clean power installations, eight voted to elect Donald Trump in the most recent US presidential election.

In order of installations, these states include Texas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, Wyoming, Kansas, Wisconsin and Mississippi. The remaining two states are Illinois and California.

Tax credits supported by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) for clean energy development are currently under threat from the budget reconciliation bill, or ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’, passed by the House of Representatives, the lower house of Congress on 22 May.

The bill aims to remove production tax credits (PTCs) and investment tax credits (ITCs) for various technologies, such as energy storage.

Should the Senate approve the bill as is, it would restrict tax credits to projects that commence construction within 60 days of US President Donald Trump signing it into law and that are operational by the end of 2028.

Powering the world’s largest EV market As Chinese EV makers expand globally, the domestic landscape is being shaped by large-scale infrastructure efforts designed to future-proof the transition and address interoperability.
In addition, a comprehensive analysis of levelized costs of EV charging at the provincial level reveals stark geographical variations.
How the country manages this balancing act will determine not only its future dominance, but the trajectory of the global EV transition itself.","From aggressive pricing to global expansion and grid integration, we explore how China’s evolving EV strategy is reshaping the global landscape, international partnerships, and infrastructure transformation.

It’s no secret that China has become the most influential force in the electric vehicle (EV) market—driven by a dynamic domestic industry and an expanding global presence. The country’s strategy is now entering a pivotal new phase, characterized by aggressive pricing, strategic partnership and energy resilience aimed at maintaining its dominance as EV sales are projected to exceed 40% of the global car market by 2030.

BYD’s strategic intent

The Chinese e-mobility landscape was jolted recently as shares of BYD, the country's largest EV manufacturer, plummeted by 8.6% following steep discounts across several of its models. The move has reignited fears of a renewed price war in the fiercely competitive market, especially amid persistent economic uncertainty and increasing geopolitical tensions with the United States. The pricing cuts, perceived as an aggressive attempt to clear swelling dealer inventories estimated at 150,000 units from January to April 2025, are also seen as a broader response to declining consumer demand.

Despite the market’s nervous reaction, industry analysts view BYD’s strategy as a calculated push to maintain its momentum both domestically and abroad. While the price reductions may pressure rivals to follow suit, they also reaffirm BYD’s intent to consolidate leadership in a market where affordability and production scale are becoming decisive factors.

Last year, international tensions escalated when the European Union (EU) imposed countervailing duties of up to 35.3% on imported EVs from China, in addition to the existing 10% import duty. More recently, the EU and China have initiated talks to potentially replace these tariffs with a minimum pricing mechanism. The proposed shift aims to ease trade friction and create a more balanced competitive landscape, as China continues to export tens of thousands of EVs to the EU while exports from the EU to China remain comparatively stagnant.

Global influence

In 2024 alone, Chinese manufacturers exported close to 1.25 million EVs to markets around the world, including emerging economies where Chinese imports have helped lower retail EV prices. In Europe, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time in April, marking a major milestone as registrations of its battery-electric vehicles surged. Alongside its new plant in Brazil, BYD is also building a manufacturing facility in Hungary.

BYD remains less exposed to trade tensions and tariffs by avoiding the U.S. market, focusing instead on growth in Southeast Asia, South America, and Europe. According to a recent IEA report, this expansion is already showing positive momentum, despite logistical challenges related to charging infrastructure and the complexities of entering less mature EV markets.

Chinese automakers more broadly have been steadily embedding themselves into local mobility ecosystems. In Spain, Repsol recently signed a comprehensive collaboration agreement with Chery’s OMODA and JAECOO brands to support automotive decarbonization. Meanwhile, in Germany, the public transport sector is piloting fully autonomous services using vehicles from Nio and technology developed by Intel-owned Mobileye.

Powering the world’s largest EV market

As Chinese EV makers expand globally, the domestic landscape is being shaped by large-scale infrastructure efforts designed to future-proof the transition and address interoperability. Recent notable moves include a partnership between battery manufacturer CATL and energy giant Sinopec to develop a nationwide battery-swap network alongside the country’s plans to use EVs as mobile energy storage in nine cities to feed power back into the grid during peak demand periods.

Similar initiatives from XPENG and Volkswagen Group China, as well as from NIP and CATL, mark a shift toward a more collaborative EV ecosystem. These initiatives signal a shift from individual vehicle sales to ecosystem-based solutions aimed at making EV ownership more convenient, flexible, and energy-aware.

But with speed comes structural strain as oversaturation looms. China’s EV rollout has outpaced regulatory development, particularly in areas like battery recycling and grid integration. According to East Asia Forum, only 156 of more than 40,000 licensed firms are certified to process decommissioned EV batteries, with fewer than 0.4% of used batteries handled properly. To ease growing grid stress from rising EV demand, China is also pushing energy reforms, including unifying its six regional grids into a national electricity market and adopting spot trading mechanisms to improve responsiveness.

The cost of being an EV powerhouse

According to the Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Promotion Alliance (EVCIPA), China had installed 12.82 million charging points by the end of 2024. However, this infrastructure remains unevenly distributed, with 69% concentrated in economically developed provinces and cities such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Beijing. This regional imbalance not only shapes access but also contributes to significant differences in charging costs across the country.

In 2023, prices at public charging stations in several cities rose sharply, with increases reaching up to 87% in some areas. As a result, charging costs climbed to around 1.5 yuan (aprox. $0.21) per kilowatt-hour in urban areas and 2 yuan (aprox. $0.28) in suburban areas. The surge was triggered by a policy change implemented on June 1, when the government reclassified electricity consumption at large charging stations as “industrial” use, making it subject to higher rates than those applied to “residential” electricity.

In addition, a comprehensive analysis of levelized costs of EV charging at the provincial level reveals stark geographical variations. While the national average cost is 0.973 RMB/kWh (aprox. $0.14/kWh) with home chargers and 1.148 RMB/kWh (aprox. $0.16/kWh) without, provinces like Xinjiang and Shanghai report cost differences of up to 147%, driven by disparities in electricity prices and usage intensity.

While Chinese automakers make inroads into foreign mobility ecosystems through exports and strategic partnerships, domestic priorities are shifting toward long-term resilience. Rising charging costs, regional price disparities, and evolving electricity policies are reshaping the economics of EV ownership within China, revealing that dominance in scale must be matched by affordability and accessibility. How the country manages this balancing act will determine not only its future dominance, but the trajectory of the global EV transition itself.

The Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump is aiming to undo or revise more than 30 major environmental regulations, many of them written or updated by the Biden administration. These include rules for cleaner vehicles, power plant emissions, and limits on tiny airborne particles known to harm human health.

The Associated Press set out to examine what might happen if all the rules were eliminated. The AP built on earlier work by the Environmental Protection Network, reviewing thousands of pages of regulatory impact analyses — documents agencies must produce for major rules with economic effects.

The methods used to estimate the annual financial costs and benefits of each rule have been largely standard since Ronald Reagan's presidency. Each analysis must go through months of review across multiple agencies, said K. Sabeel Rahman, a Cornell law professor who was a top regulator under the Biden administration.

""These are hundreds of pages of technical documentation, extensively researched and footnoted, and then pressure-tested within the executive branch,"" Rahman said.

The AP also drew from studies published in the journals Science and Nature Communications and emissions estimates from the independent and nonpartisan Rhodium Group in order to calculate the possible annual death toll. The AP's work was reviewed by multiple outside experts. AP interviewed more than 50 scientists, officials, analysts and advocates for the story.

The estimate of global deaths includes estimates of heat deaths from added carbon emissions, using a peer-reviewed formula developed by Daniel Bressler, a former White House climate economist during the Biden administration. It estimates one person will die for every 10,217 tons (9,318 metric tons) of carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere.

The Rhodium Group estimates that the Trump administration’s rollbacks would lead to 2.8 billion additional tons (2.6 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide emissions by 2035 — translating to, on average, more than 25,000 deaths each year.

Solar projects that interconnect with utility infrastructure at lower voltages, such as at most community solar plants, can also help avoid costly upgrades to substations and transmission lines.
Community solar policy has enabled gigawatts of solar capacity year over year, with a substantial 35% surge in growth in 2024, led by New York, Maine and Illinois.
A recent analysis by the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) highlights the benefits that community solar provides beyond the inherent megawatt hours of clean power.
For instance, consider the sheer amount of labor it takes to construct even a mid-sized community solar farm.","Demand for electricity is rising — and quickly. From data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, to the electrification of domestic manufacturing and transportation, power needs are predicted to rise to new all-time highs. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association reported in a recent study that U.S. electricity demand is projected to grow 50% by 2050, driven by data centers and electrification.

So, how will our nation meet this demand, affordably and quickly?

The answer is not straightforward, and to date, our track record has not been stellar. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, electricity supply has not kept up with demand over the past decade. Electricity prices increased 20% from 2020 to 2023, due to a lack of supply and needed upgrades to America’s transmission and distribution network.

As we navigate a shifting global trade environment, strained supply chains, and the lingering threat of inflation, all eyes are on deployment, both of new generation and the grid infrastructure needed to support it.

All-of-the-above energy?

The realities of spiking electricity demand has policymakers and investors alike speaking in terms of an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. Grid operators like PJM have created fast-track interconnection pathways to shore up supply, capacity auctions are sending crystal-clear market signals and longstanding plans to decommission power plants are being reconsidered.

But while all electrons may serve the same function, different types and sizes of generators face very different timelines. For instance, units 3 and 4 of the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia took 15 years to build. Lead times for gas turbines from leading OEMs can stretch more than five years. Coal plants are rarely economical to run, and there are none that are currently in development in the United States.

Solar and energy storage are lower cost and twice as fast to deploy compared with competing types of generation, but large solar and storage projects still linger for years in choked interconnection queues and permitting processes. How can we make more progress towards adding generation capacity that will meet the moment?

Distributed generation solar should be part of the solution

Renewables are undoubtedly one of the most rapidly scalable and cost-competitive ways to deliver power. These technologies are quicker to deploy than nuclear or natural gas, and their supply chains are far more robust.

Distributed generation (DG) or “middle market” solar assets, in particular, are a stand-out solution. DG projects have a less significant impact on overloaded electrical grids, they spend less time in interconnection queues, providing states with a viable and affordable option for meeting rising energy demands. Solar projects that interconnect with utility infrastructure at lower voltages, such as at most community solar plants, can also help avoid costly upgrades to substations and transmission lines.

Beyond meeting power needs, DG solar projects create jobs in construction, installation, operations and maintenance, and of course, reduce pollution, unlike carbon-emitting generation sources. This strengthens local communities and ensures a healthier environment for generations to come.

The promise of community solar

In a few states, community solar farms already provide low-cost clean power and optionality for retail electricity customers at scale. Community solar policy has enabled gigawatts of solar capacity year over year, with a substantial 35% surge in growth in 2024, led by New York, Maine and Illinois. In light of spiking electricity demand and a crisis of affordability across the country, more states are in the process of introducing community solar as an option for their ratepayers.

A recent analysis by the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) highlights the benefits that community solar provides beyond the inherent megawatt hours of clean power. CCSA reports that community solar could unlock more than $120 billion in economic activity nationwide. Each gigawatt of community solar can support more than 18,000 local jobs and generate $2.8 billion in state economic activity, according to CCSA’s findings.

Speed and efficiency are key

Building renewables projects, albeit much faster than other generation sources, is nevertheless quite an undertaking. Navigating real estate and land leases, overcoming permitting hurdles and managing supply chain issues can all impact how quickly projects are placed into service. That’s why bringing speed, precision, and quality to small-scale and middle-market solar development is so critical.

Although the core components — such as modules, inverters and trackers — attract the most attention, every aspect of renewable energy project construction can be optimized. For instance, consider the sheer amount of labor it takes to construct even a mid-sized community solar farm. Solutions that simplify fieldwork, streamline construction processes and can be repeated across full portfolios of small-scale solar projects are critical for accelerating capacity additions.

As demand for power continues to rise, driven by the expansion of data centers and advanced manufacturing facilities, the need for efficient, scalable energy solutions has never been greater. By making small solar projects repeatable and efficient to execute at scale, we can add capacity faster and smarter, meeting growing demand without letting go of our climate goals.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ampacity-dg-solar-stock.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 14:24:51.084854

Here are some takeaways from AP's work: The AP examination found that the targeted rules are estimated to save at least $275 billion a year and more than 30,000 lives annually.
One example is a proposed update to existing EPA emissions standards for vehicles that's aimed at jump-starting electric cars.
Under Trump, the EPA has created fact sheets that emphasize the costs but not the benefits of the rules.
In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses that AP examined, the estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.","The Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump has served notice it wants to back away from at least 30 major rules that seek to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change. The agency's administrator, Lee Zeldin, says doing so would mean a new “golden age” for America.

It’s not certain the rules will go away. They can’t be changed without going through a demanding federal rulemaking process.

The AP examination found that the targeted rules are estimated to save at least $275 billion a year and more than 30,000 lives annually. Those figures were built in part on regulatory impact reports prepared by the EPA itself to factor in things such as reduced illnesses and deaths, as well as how much it would cost companies to comply with the rules. AP also worked with research by the Environmental Protection Network of former agency employees.

AP found about 10,000 American lives were expected to be saved as the rules cut traditional pollutants such as soot, smog and heavy metals like mercury and lead. AP also calculated that doing away with the rules entirely would mean rising greenhouse gas emissions that would in turn drive deadly heat that would account for 25,000 more deaths each year around the world. That calculation also relied on a think-tank report and scientific studies that calculate deaths per ton of emissions.

Some of the rules have been in place for years, while others were written under President Joe Biden and have not yet taken effect because of court challenges or because they are designed to kick in during later years.

One example is a proposed update to existing EPA emissions standards for vehicles that's aimed at jump-starting electric cars. It's supposed to take effect for 2027 model years. The EPA's own analysis estimated net annual benefits of more than $100 billion a year.

Another rule sets the level of traditional pollutants allowable in air that's deemed clean. The Clean Air Act requires that it be updated every few years. Public health and experts say one type of traditional pollution, particulate matter — better known as soot — is the most deadly in America, with severe consequences when reaching a person's lungs. In 2024, the Biden administration cut by 25% the amount of particulate matter that states are allowed to emit into the air.

The EPA calculated a net benefit from that rule of as much as $46 billion a year, and the prevention of 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 asthma incidents annually.

Under Trump, the EPA has created fact sheets that emphasize the costs but not the benefits of the rules.

Nine of 10 fact sheets make no mention of benefits at all. But eight of the fact sheets cite costs.

For example, a fact sheet for one rule that would require newer coal-powered plants to cut or capture carbon emissions by as much as 90% noted that it would cost nearly $1 billion. But that sheet made no mention that the rule was estimated to save more than $24 billion a year.

In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses that AP examined, the estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.

The Trump administration has not said how far the targeted rules would be rolled back. And Zeldin has vowed to follow federal law.

Experts say the targeted rules were the product of rigorous impact analyses that got close scrutiny from the EPA and other federal agencies.

Such rules cannot be undone without presenting scientific justification through a federal rulemaking process that can take years to complete and includes requirements for public comment.

In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.
In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.
Under Trump, the EPA’s fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.
But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.","When the head of the Environmental Protection Agency announced a wide-ranging rollback of environmental regulations, he said it would put a “dagger through the heart of climate-change religion” and introduce a “Golden Age” for the American economy.

What Lee Zeldin didn’t mention: how ending the rules could have devastating consequences to human health.

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated; they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

But experts say the numbers are conservative and that even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

“More people will die,” said Cory Zigler, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University who has studied air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants. “More of this type of pollution that we know kills people will be in the air.”

What went into AP’s examination of the pollution rules

The AP set out to look at what could happen if all the rules were eliminated, by first examining exhaustive assessments the EPA was required to produce before the rules were approved. Though the agency’s priorities can change as presidential administrations change, the methods for the assessments have been largely standard since Ronald Reagan’s presidency and are deeply rooted in peer-reviewed scientific research.

The AP used those and eight different government and private group databases for its estimate of financial costs, some death estimates and analysis of pollution trends. AP performed additional analysis of potential deaths by drawing on peer-reviewed formulas and scientific research on the impacts of increased heat and pollution. And AP vetted its work with multiple outside health experts, who said it is scientifically justified, but likely an undercount.

Multiple experts say the science behind the rules is strong, and they pointed to the rigorous process that must be followed to change them, including requirements for public comment.

Zeldin acknowledged as much last month.

“I’m not going to prejudge outcomes with what will be a lot of rulemaking,” Zeldin said in April.

Virtually all the benefits from the rules come from restricting the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The fossil fuel industry was a heavy contributor to President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and Republicans overall. In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.

Calculating costs and benefits is contentious

Asked for comment on the AP findings, an EPA spokesperson said the agency’s plans would “roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden ‘taxes’ on U.S. families.”

“Unlike the Biden EPA attempts to regulate whole sectors of our economy out of existence, the Trump EPA understands that we do not have to choose between protecting our precious environment and growing our economy,” spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said.

Scott Segal, an attorney at Bracewell LLP who represents energy and manufacturing interests, suggested that EPA analyses under the Biden administration emphasized worst-case scenarios, inflated health benefit claims and missed the big-picture economic benefits of booming industry.

“If you only count lives saved by regulation, not lives harmed by regulation, the math will always favor more regulation,” Segal said. “This framing misses the larger point: public health isn’t just about air quality — it’s also about job security, housing, access to medical care, and heating in the winter.”

The EPA regulatory analyses are immense documents that numerous health and environment researchers and former officials say are grounded in science, not politics. For example, in January 2024, the EPA produced a 445-page analysis of tightening standards on dangerous particle pollution that cited more than 90 different scientific publications, along with scores of other documents. The Biden EPA presented four different regulatory scenarios and ultimately chose one of the middle options.

Two experts who reviewed AP’s work said the EPA documents that underpinned the analysis were themselves conservative in their estimates. University of Washington health and environment professors Kristi Ebi and Howard Frumkin said that’s because EPA looked at added heat deaths and air pollution mortality, but did not include climate change’s expected deaths from increased infectious disease, flooding and other disaster factors.

“This is a rigorous, compelling and much-needed analysis,” said Frumkin, who was appointed director of the CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health during George W. Bush’s administration. ”It makes clear that regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration will have major, direct consequences for health and well-being. Because of these regulatory rollbacks and funding cuts, Americans will die needlessly.”

That’s a sentiment echoed by two former Republican EPA administrators, William Reilly and Christine Todd Whitman, who served in the George Bush and George W. Bush administrations respectively.

“This administration is endangering all of our lives — ours, our children, our grandchildren,” said Whitman, who led EPA under George W. Bush.

How regulations helped clear the air

A visit to Evansville, Indiana, helps show how EPA regulations have made a difference.

The city of about 115,000 lies where the state’s southwest tip meets Kentucky at the curving Ohio River. Industry lines the banks and coal barges float past carrying loads destined to fuel power plants.

Kirt Ethridge, 30, grew up in Evansville and still lives there. As a child, he recalls looking down from high ground into the bowl-shaped valley where the heart of the city lies and seeing a haze of pollution atop it. He thought that was normal.

He didn’t think much of the looming smokestacks of the coal-fired power plants and factories that ringed the city, nor the line of inhalers waiting on a bench before he and his classmates ran the mile. He suffered asthma attacks in class, sometimes more than once a week, that sent him to the nurse’s office. Once, he was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

“It’s a very scary feeling, particularly as a kid, to not be able to get enough air in your lungs,” he said, describing it as like “breathing through a straw.”

In southwestern Indiana, coal-fired power plants were to blame for between 19,000 and nearly 23,000 deaths from 1999 to 2020, according to work by Zigler published in the journal Science that examined death rates among Medicare recipients and modeled where plants’ pollution would spread.

Nationally, he and his team found a sharp decline in air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants after the mid-2000s, from an average of 43,000 a year to just 1,600 a year in 2020, with a similar cut in particle pollution. That’s when two different forces came into play: Cheaper and less polluting natural gas pushed aside dirtier and costlier coal, while at the same time stricter regulations required more pollution control devices such as scrubbers.

Duke Energy operates its biggest power plant near Evansville — Gibson Station, which can power about 2.5 million homes. Emissions have declined significantly as the company installed scrubbers that pull unwanted chemicals out of smokestacks, along with other pollution control technology. Duke Energy spokeswoman Angeline Protegere said the scrubbers were a response to “regulations over the years as well as market factors.”

Put simply, the air got cleaner around places like Evansville. Vanderburgh County and neighboring counties violated national annual air standards for fine particles from 2005 to 2010, but no longer do, even as standards have tightened.

The same is true across the United States. The amount of tiny airborne particles in the last 10 years nationwide is one-third lower than 2000-2009, EPA statistics show. Smog pollution is down nearly 15% and sulfur dioxide has plunged 80%.

“The Clean Air Act, the EPA’s founding legislation, has been a powerful engine for improving public health as our air has grown visibly clearer and cleaner,” said Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA under President Barack Obama and served as Biden’s White House climate adviser. “Millions of Americans have avoided illnesses, hospital visits, and premature deaths thanks to EPA’s cleaner car and truck standards in concert with rules that limit industrial pollution.”

Five rules saving more than $200 billion a year

Five rules together were estimated to have more than $200 billion a year in net benefits, based on EPA documents that estimated reduced illnesses and deaths and the costs for companies to comply.

Three rules dealt with cars and trucks. The “clean car rule” is a tightening of EPA emission standards for vehicles that was supposed to take effect for 2027 model years and eventually have annual net benefits of more than $100 billion a year, according to the agency’s 884-page regulatory analysis. The EPA estimated that over the next three decades this rule alone would prevent 7.9 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, 8,700 tons of particulate matter and 36,000 tons of nitrogen oxides.

Two other proposed rules — one that deals with car models from 2023 to 2027 and another aimed at heavy trucks and buses — are estimated to save nearly $38 billion a year combined through reduced health problems from air pollution, according to EPA’s own detailed calculations.

EPA plays up costs, plays down benefits of targeted rules

Almost none of those benefits are to be found in 10 fact sheets the EPA produced in conjunction with Zeldin’s announcement. Nine make no mention of benefits from the rules, while eight mention the costs.

In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.

For example, Biden’s proposed power plant rule was designed to save more than $24 billion a year, prevent about 3,700 annual premature deaths and 3 million asthma incidents from fossil fuel-powered plants, according to EPA documents last year and work by the Environmental Protection Network. Under Trump, the EPA’s fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.

Another rule the EPA updated last year sets standards for pollution permitted in the air, called National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The update, required by the Clean Air Act, cuts allowable soot particles by 25% to reflect new science on the harms from such pollution. The EPA in Biden’s time calculated the change would annually save as much as $46 billion, 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 asthma incidents.

But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.

“The human body count and human health toll of particulate matter alone is just absolutely massive,” said K. Sabeel Rahman, a Cornell law professor who was a top federal regulatory officer from 2021 to 2023. “Literally tens of thousands of people will lose their lives” if the standard is rolled back, he said.

A penguin-shaped nebulizer

In southwest Indiana, many people have noticed a positive difference from the EPA regulations. And they’re concerned about changes.

In Bloomfield, Jessica Blazier’s 11-year-old son Julian has multiple health conditions that make him more sensitive to air quality, including nonallergic rhinitis, which inflames his nasal passage and makes breathing “feel like a knife sometimes,” in his words. Jessica Blazier said the proposed EPA rule rollbacks are “almost adding insult to injury in our particular circumstance.”

In Evansville, Ethridge is now raising kids of his own, including a 5-year-old daughter who was born early and doesn’t tolerate respiratory illnesses well. Whenever Eliza gets sick, she uses a children’s nebulizer that is shaped like a penguin and stored in an igloo-shaped case.

“I want to raise my kids in Evansville,” he said. “I don’t want to raise my kids in a bowl of pollution.”

That's great news for folks who dislike crossovers, I suppose, but not-so-great news for anybody hoping for more EVs.
As mentioned earlier, China's EV market is cutthroat.
With the near-term outlook on EVs dimming, will you consider a hybrid for your next car?","Remember when automakers were pledging to go all-electric as early as 2030? Sure, that came with an asterisk, but ""electrified"" was the buzzword and car companies knew that was the way the industry was headed. So just about every brand sunk endless amounts of cash into battery factories and electric tech.

Those same automakers are now quietly climbing down from the rooftop and walking back their ambitious plans. And while shelving that playbook, executives are dusting off the ol' hybrid-hustle handbook like it was 2019 all over again.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and tech in the automotive space. On today's docket: automakers are walking back their new EV projects to focus on hybrids instead, Chinese dealers are asking automakers to stop offloading excess inventory onto their lots and Xiaomi SU7's waitlist hits nearly a year. Let's jump in.

30%: Automakers Are Dusting Off The Hybrid Handbook

Photo by: Horse Powertrain

Blame politics, or economics, or high costs, or the challenges involved with ramping up a new technology. Either way, automakers seem to be cooling off on EV investments to focus on hybrids instead.

That news comes straight from Car Wars 2025. Don't get excited, that's not some new George Lucas flick—it's something more exciting (to some of us, anyway): a study by Bank of America into the global automotive pipeline.

Automotive News reports that BoA's study indicates that automakers are pulling back on the number of new models they plan to deploy in the next few years—gas, EV, you name it. Tariffs, uneven EV demand and uncertain regulations are among the culprits. Either way, BoA expects 159 models to be launched over the next four years, down from more than 200 last year. It's ""the lowest number we’ve had in decades,"" the report said.

The biggest pullbacks are on the EV front. Car Wars predicts 71 EV models will be offered over the next four years, The Detroit News reports—""about half of what the forecast had expected two years ago.""

More from Automotive News:

Speaking June 4 at an Automotive Press Association event at the company’s regional headquarters in suburban Detroit, [John Murphy, senior automotive analyst with Bank of America Securities] said Bank of America has an optimistic forecast of 16.5 million vehicles for 2025, and sees a market peak of “around 18 million” in 2028.

He said that there is pent-up demand in the market of “at least 10 million,” but a lot of that demand is for vehicles at the lower end of the market not currently met by the industry.

Murphy said that Bank of America expects 29 models to be launched in 2025, “and that’s the lowest number we’ve had in decades.""

Let's be clear on something. BoA doesn't believe that brands have suddenly fallen back in love with the combustion engine. This isn't some fairy tale where the two rekindle the spark that ignites their gasoline love story. It's a marriage built out of uncertainty.

Here's one more quote from Murphy that really nails down the issue, emphasis mine:

""This is really an indication that a lot of what’s been going on with EV investment and distractions otherwise that have really pulled product planning in many, many different directions. What you’re seeing is the push out and cancelation of numerous models, mostly in EVs.”

Translation: the EV roadmap is actively being rewritten as geopolitical tensions result in supplier uproots, loss of incentives and tariffs that make the existing automotive supply chain completely untenable.

In fact, Murphy forecasts that the U.S. market share of EVs may have already peaked at as low as 8% and may not continue to climb over the next ""four or five years.""

The study goes on to say that the EV crossover market is ""saturated,"" specifically. This means that fewer new crossover products as a whole, including electrified ones, will likely launch over the next four years.

That's great news for folks who dislike crossovers, I suppose, but not-so-great news for anybody hoping for more EVs. At least we've still got the Rivian R3X, right?

The study suggests that we've finally regressed into the hybrid hangover era. One where automakers know that the combustion engine still has its days numbered, but it's not yet time to go all-out on EVs.

Just know that it's implausible for automakers to just kill off development of EVs altogether—it's more like a small pause until there's more stability in consumer trust and a clear path forward with global suppliers.

60%: Dealerships Beg Automakers To Stop Offloading Excess EV Inventory On Them

If you think America's car buying incentives of cash on the hood is competitive, you haven't seen anything. China's EV market is ruthless, and its most recent price war is so fierce that even dealerships are begging automakers to stop the bleeding for their own good.

A new report from Reuters calls on a statement from the China Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce, where the organization asked brands not for more cars to sell, but quite the opposite. The rare public plea was for automakers to stop flooding dealerships with excess inventory and slashing prices like the new corporate model was a permanent going-out-of-business sale.

Reuters brings the details:

Conditions facing car dealers have become ""even more severe"" amid a new round of hefty discounting since the second quarter, the China Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce said in a statement.

Automakers should set reasonable annual production and sales targets and should not transfer inventory to dealers and force them to stockpile cars, the chamber proposed on Tuesday.

The cycle of payments to dealers should be shortened and dealers ""shall not be coerced to withdraw from the network and close their stores in the name of optimising network channels,"" it said.

Basically, brands aren't able to sell nearly as many cars as automakers are throwing at them and dealership lots are looking a lot more like parking lots where inventory is just building up as BYD and its competitors engage in a race to the bottom. Meanwhile, that means less margin for dealerships and more pressure to move units that consumers just aren't buying as quickly, despite lower prices.

The CADCC is asking OEMs for a few things: stop offloading extra inventory on dealers, increase dealership margins by knocking off the race to the bottom and speed up rebates to dealerships. These changes are something that the Chamber alleges will help keep dealership doors open and not end up like one BYD dealership group that shuttered 20 locations as it went out of business amid the ongoing price war.

Stock level in April reached 3.5 million vehicles, which is around 57 inventory days for China. That's only a few days higher year-over-year, however, the overall passenger car market has decreased 9.4% month-over-month, meaning that inventory is piling up as sales are slowing.

In a market this crowded—with BYD, Geely, NIO, Xiaomi, Xpeng, Tesla and others all throwing elbows—it's unclear if any one brand will blink first. Eventually, someone is going to run out of money (or patience) and will bow out to become more sustainable, but until then, dealerships see themselves as having to smile through the chaos and hope that there are enough lifeboats to keep lots afloat while the ship continues sinking.

90%: Xiaomi SU7 Waitlist Grows To Almost A Year

Photo by: Patrick George

China's Apple Car is absolutely killing it right now. The Xiaomi SU7 popped up out of nowhere and consumers were so enamored by the offering that they've been showing up in droves to take delivery of what might be one of the country's hottest cars.

In fact, the car is so popular that anybody waiting in line for one might want to bring a folding chair because it's going to be quite the wait to get their hands on one. A new report notes that Xiaomi's official delivery time has reached a whopping 350 days—nearly an entire year—to take delivery of one of its EV sedans after ordering.

Here's the scoop from CarNewsChina:

According to the Xiaomi Auto official app, the delivery waiting time for the SU7 Pro electric sedan lies in the 47 – 50 week range. It means the car would be delivered 329 – 350 days after placing the order. For clarity, customers who booked the car on June 3, 2025, would get their long-awaited cars in a gap between April 27 and May 18, 2026.

[...]

The company aims to put the F2 plant into operation soon. However, this factory will mainly focus on the manufacturing of the Xiaomi YU7 crossover, which will start sales in July this year. So, the SU7 delivery waiting time could grow even further.

This is a pretty amazing feat. As mentioned earlier, China's EV market is cutthroat. As if Western brands didn't have a hard enough time right now, domestic brands are feeling the pressure too—no surprise given that more than 100 EV brands are competing in the country right now.

But Xiaomi, which is already an established electronics manufacturing company, just launched its first car last March. Since then, it smashed delivery record after delivery record.

Perhaps more interesting is that Xiaomi's sales seem to be largely unaffected even after the manufacturer upped targets and faced public blowback over decisions to limit the car's power and a $6,000 performance hood with fake ducting. The only actual problem that consumers seem to have now is actually getting one in under a year.

It turns out that making a legitimately compelling EV with flagship specs for an affordable price is something that consumers actually want. And Xiaomi's money-printing sedan was so successful that we have even higher hopes for its Model Y fighter (with a bit more Ferrari Purosangue-esque styling), the Xiaomi YU7.

So, hats off to Xiaomi for this one. What a wild success story for the brand so far.

100%: Would You Go (Back) To A Hybrid?

Photo by: Motor1

Let's be real. EVs aren't going anywhere. But with huge price tags, state (and possibly federal) legislation costing more up-front to register the battery-powered behemoths and a likely stagnation in models coming up, fresh new hybrids might look rather appealing for new car buyers.

I personally love driving an EV. It's not even about the fuel or maintenance cost savings for me—they're just damn fun cars to drive with execllent performance. I love my combustion cars too, but my daily driver will likely be something powered by a battery for the foreseeable future.

That being said, I want to know where you stand. With the near-term outlook on EVs dimming, will you consider a hybrid for your next car? Let me know in the comments.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/1Z1Rl3/s1/ford-maverick-2170-ev-battery-cells-cm-hero.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 14:26:47.072019

In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.
In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.
Under Trump, the EPA’s fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.
But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.","When the head of the Environmental Protection Agency announced a wide-ranging rollback of environmental regulations, he said it would put a “dagger through the heart of climate-change religion” and introduce a “Golden Age” for the American economy.

What Lee Zeldin didn’t mention: how ending the rules could have devastating consequences to human health.

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated; they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

But experts say the numbers are conservative and that even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

“More people will die,” said Cory Zigler, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University who has studied air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants. “More of this type of pollution that we know kills people will be in the air.”

What went into AP’s examination of the pollution rules

The AP set out to look at what could happen if all the rules were eliminated, by first examining exhaustive assessments the EPA was required to produce before the rules were approved. Though the agency’s priorities can change as presidential administrations change, the methods for the assessments have been largely standard since Ronald Reagan’s presidency and are deeply rooted in peer-reviewed scientific research.

The AP used those and eight different government and private group databases for its estimate of financial costs, some death estimates and analysis of pollution trends. AP performed additional analysis of potential deaths by drawing on peer-reviewed formulas and scientific research on the impacts of increased heat and pollution. And AP vetted its work with multiple outside health experts, who said it is scientifically justified, but likely an undercount.

Multiple experts say the science behind the rules is strong, and they pointed to the rigorous process that must be followed to change them, including requirements for public comment.

Zeldin acknowledged as much last month.

“I’m not going to prejudge outcomes with what will be a lot of rulemaking,” Zeldin said in April.

Virtually all the benefits from the rules come from restricting the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The fossil fuel industry was a heavy contributor to President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and Republicans overall. In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.

Calculating costs and benefits is contentious

Asked for comment on the AP findings, an EPA spokesperson said the agency’s plans would “roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden ‘taxes’ on U.S. families.”

“Unlike the Biden EPA attempts to regulate whole sectors of our economy out of existence, the Trump EPA understands that we do not have to choose between protecting our precious environment and growing our economy,” spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said.

Scott Segal, an attorney at Bracewell LLP who represents energy and manufacturing interests, suggested that EPA analyses under the Biden administration emphasized worst-case scenarios, inflated health benefit claims and missed the big-picture economic benefits of booming industry.

“If you only count lives saved by regulation, not lives harmed by regulation, the math will always favor more regulation,” Segal said. “This framing misses the larger point: public health isn’t just about air quality -- it’s also about job security, housing, access to medical care, and heating in the winter.”

The EPA regulatory analyses are immense documents that numerous health and environment researchers and former officials say are grounded in science, not politics. For example, in January 2024, the EPA produced a 445-page analysis of tightening standards on dangerous particle pollution that cited more than 90 different scientific publications, along with scores of other documents. The Biden EPA presented four different regulatory scenarios and ultimately chose one of the middle options.

Two experts who reviewed AP’s work said the EPA documents that underpinned the analysis were themselves conservative in their estimates. University of Washington health and environment professors Kristi Ebi and Howard Frumkin said that’s because EPA looked at added heat deaths and air pollution mortality, but did not include climate change’s expected deaths from increased infectious disease, flooding and other disaster factors.

“This is a rigorous, compelling and much-needed analysis,’' said Frumkin, who was appointed director of the CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health during George W. Bush’s administration. ”It makes clear that regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration will have major, direct consequences for health and well-being. Because of these regulatory rollbacks and funding cuts, Americans will die needlessly.”

That’s a sentiment echoed by two former Republican EPA administrators, William Reilly and Christine Todd Whitman, who served in the George Bush and George W. Bush administrations respectively.

“This administration is endangering all of our lives — ours, our children, our grandchildren,” said Whitman, who led EPA under George W. Bush.

How regulations helped clear the air

A visit to Evansville, Indiana, helps show how EPA regulations have made a difference.

The city of about 115,000 lies where the state’s southwest tip meets Kentucky at the curving Ohio River. Industry lines the banks and coal barges float past carrying loads destined to fuel power plants.

Kirt Ethridge, 30, grew up in Evansville and still lives there. As a child, he recalls looking down from high ground into the bowl-shaped valley where the heart of the city lies and seeing a haze of pollution atop it. He thought that was normal.

He didn’t think much of the looming smokestacks of the coal-fired power plants and factories that ringed the city, nor the line of inhalers waiting on a bench before he and his classmates ran the mile. He suffered asthma attacks in class, sometimes more than once a week, that sent him to the nurse’s office. Once, he was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

“It’s a very scary feeling, particularly as a kid, to not be able to get enough air in your lungs,” he said, describing it as like “breathing through a straw.”

In southwestern Indiana, coal-fired power plants were to blame for between 19,000 and nearly 23,000 deaths from 1999 to 2020, according to work by Zigler published in the journal Science that examined death rates among Medicare recipients and modeled where plants’ pollution would spread.

Nationally, he and his team found a sharp decline in air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants after the mid-2000s, from an average of 43,000 a year to just 1,600 a year in 2020, with a similar cut in particle pollution. That’s when two different forces came into play: Cheaper and less polluting natural gas pushed aside dirtier and costlier coal, while at the same time stricter regulations required more pollution control devices such as scrubbers.

Duke Energy operates its biggest power plant near Evansville — Gibson Station, which can power about 2.5 million homes. Emissions have declined significantly as the company installed scrubbers that pull unwanted chemicals out of smokestacks, along with other pollution control technology. Duke Energy spokeswoman Angeline Protegere said the scrubbers were a response to “regulations over the years as well as market factors.”

Put simply, the air got cleaner around places like Evansville. Vanderburgh County and neighboring counties violated national annual air standards for fine particles from 2005 to 2010, but no longer do, even as standards have tightened.

The same is true across the United States. The amount of tiny airborne particles in the last 10 years nationwide is one-third lower than 2000-2009, EPA statistics show. Smog pollution is down nearly 15% and sulfur dioxide has plunged 80%.

“The Clean Air Act, the EPA’s founding legislation, has been a powerful engine for improving public health as our air has grown visibly clearer and cleaner,” said Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA under President Barack Obama and served as Biden’s White House climate adviser. “Millions of Americans have avoided illnesses, hospital visits, and premature deaths thanks to EPA’s cleaner car and truck standards in concert with rules that limit industrial pollution.”

Five rules saving more than $200 billion a year

Five rules together were estimated to have more than $200 billion a year in net benefits, based on EPA documents that estimated reduced illnesses and deaths and the costs for companies to comply.

Three rules dealt with cars and trucks. The “clean car rule” is a tightening of EPA emission standards for vehicles that was supposed to take effect for 2027 model years and eventually have annual net benefits of more than $100 billion a year, according to the agency’s 884-page regulatory analysis. The EPA estimated that over the next three decades this rule alone would prevent 7.9 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, 8,700 tons of particulate matter and 36,000 tons of nitrogen oxides.

Two other proposed rules — one that deals with car models from 2023 to 2027 and another aimed at heavy trucks and buses — are estimated to save nearly $38 billion a year combined through reduced health problems from air pollution, according to EPA’s own detailed calculations.

EPA plays up costs, plays down benefits of targeted rules

Almost none of those benefits are to be found in 10 fact sheets the EPA produced in conjunction with Zeldin’s announcement. Nine make no mention of benefits from the rules, while eight mention the costs.

In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.

For example, Biden’s proposed power plant rule was designed to save more than $24 billion a year, prevent about 3,700 annual premature deaths and 3 million asthma incidents from fossil fuel-powered plants, according to EPA documents last year and work by the Environmental Protection Network. Under Trump, the EPA’s fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.

Another rule the EPA updated last year sets standards for pollution permitted in the air, called National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The update, required by the Clean Air Act, cuts allowable soot particles by 25% to reflect new science on the harms from such pollution. The EPA in Biden’s time calculated the change would annually save as much as $46 billion, 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 asthma incidents.

But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.

“The human body count and human health toll of particulate matter alone is just absolutely massive,” said K. Sabeel Rahman, a Cornell law professor who was a top federal regulatory officer from 2021 to 2023. “Literally tens of thousands of people will lose their lives” if the standard is rolled back, he said.

A penguin-shaped nebulizer

In southwest Indiana, many people have noticed a positive difference from the EPA regulations. And they’re concerned about changes.

In Bloomfield, Jessica Blazier’s 11-year-old son Julian has multiple health conditions that make him more sensitive to air quality, including nonallergic rhinitis, which inflames his nasal passage and makes breathing “feel like a knife sometimes,” in his words. Jessica Blazier said the proposed EPA rule rollbacks are “almost adding insult to injury in our particular circumstance.”

In Evansville, Ethridge is now raising kids of his own, including a 5-year-old daughter who was born early and doesn’t tolerate respiratory illnesses well. Whenever Eliza gets sick, she uses a children’s nebulizer that is shaped like a penguin and stored in an igloo-shaped case.

“I want to raise my kids in Evansville,” he said. “I don’t want to raise my kids in a bowl of pollution.”

As eastern Kentucky communities attempt to bounce back from a string of natural disasters, more small businesses are struggling to get back on their feet.

An upcoming series of workshops led by the nonprofit Mountain Association and AppalReD Legal Aid this month aims to help small businesses in the region better prepare for emergencies.

Jessica Epperson, Mountain Association disaster recovery coordinator, said if businesses can get up and running as quickly as possible after catastrophe, communities benefit.

""They're going to cover the topics such as the death of a business owner, legal considerations, by-sale arrangements, key-person insurance, estate planning, just to help businesses really prepare for the other side of a disaster,"" Epperson outlined.

Workshop participants can sign up for free one-on-one meetings with an attorney. Workshops will be held in Hazard on Wednesday, London on Thursday, Ashland on June 17 and Prestonsburg on June 18.

Epperson pointed out while many businesses receive immediate funds in the aftermath of disaster, many are unable to navigate long-term challenges.

""We're hoping that businesses will be able to learn from each other, as well as find opportunities to improve disaster recovery,"" Epperson explained.

Epperson stressed Appalachian Kentucky's economic stability depends on local business owners.

""By having small businesses, it's ensuring the livelihood of our communities,"" Epperson added. ""It's a dual way of being able to support both the people and the businesses within a certain area.""

According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, between March 2022 and March 2023, more than 16,000 small businesses opened in Kentucky, and around 9,500 shut their doors. As of 2024, more than 380,000 small businesses operated across the Commonwealth, employing more than 685,000 people.

When you buy a car in California, the most the dealer can charge to process the sales documents is $85 but the cap could be raised to $500 if Senate Bill 791 becomes law.

The bill already passed several committees and is expected to get a vote in the full state Senate this week.

Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, argued the measure would harm consumers.

""It's a huge giveaway to car dealers, including multibillion-dollar corporations like Tesla, Auto Nation, CarMax,"" Shahan outlined. ""They're the ones that will benefit the most at the expense of California car buyers.""

The bill's author, Sen. Dave Cortese, D-San Jose, did not respond to a request for comment by our deadline, but has said in the past car dealers have to do a lot of work processing the sales contracts, and deserve to recover their costs. The bill would allow dealers to charge up to 1% of the sales price or a maximum of $500.

Document processing fees can surpass $1,000 in other states without a cap. Shahan noted some dealers like Carvana do not charge a document processing fee.

""If you belong to AAA, they offer this service of handling, registering the car for free or for a very minimal cost,"" Shahan pointed out. ""When you look at other states, there are some states that have no caps on the document fee, and it's crazy how much the dealers get away with charging people. But if this bill becomes law, instead of having the best cap for consumers, California would have one of the worst.""

Shahan added car dealers typically make most of their profits at the ""back end"" on financing and various add-ons. The California New Car Dealers Association is backing the bill.

The Trump administration is pushing to gut the top U.S. consumer watchdog agency, which alarms some advocacy groups in Arizona.

What's known in Congress as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" would reduce the budget for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by 70%.

Alex Alvarez, executive director of the advocacy group Progress Arizona, thinks the move will only hurt hardworking Arizonans. Since its creation in 2010, the agency has investigated complaints and created new rules to ensure financial transparency, prevent fraud and hold companies accountable. The bureau saw a 92% increase in complaints between 2023 and 2024, which Alvarez said speaks to the important work being done.

""People are working harder than ever before, are seeing rising costs,"" Alvarez pointed out. ""And instead of giving any kind of support, this Congress is trying to aid the Trump administration's assault on the CFPB, which has returned $21 billion to defrauded consumers in the form of restitution or canceled debts.""

Last year, the agency finalized a rule closing a loophole which had allowed financial institutions to reap major profits from overdraft fees. It capped the fees at $5 per overdraft, which the agency claimed would save consumers $5 billion a year.

Last month, Congress voted to overturn the rule. Conservatives argued the bureau imposes unacceptable costs on businesses. The House approved the 2026 budget bill last Thursday, moving it to the Senate for consideration.

Alvarez argued while the bureau is strict, the agency advocates for all consumers and their hard-earned money. He contended they should be able to rely on the government to help keep businesses in check.

""We are asking for the Senate to vote 'no' on the reconciliation bill and protect the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog that protects hardworking families from financial abuse, predatory lending products and financial fraud,"" Alvarez emphasized.

Alvarez added Arizonans can reach out to their elected officials to share their views on potential reforms and future of the agency.

Ironically, the Trump administration’s so-called “gold standard” EO regresses all scientific integrity policies back to 2021, before this progress was made.","On the Friday afternoon before Memorial Day, the Trump administration released an Executive Order (EO), ostensibly meant to improve the science used to inform federal policy. As my colleagues have pointed out, that’s absolutely not what it does. It’s important to unpack what’s really hidden under the layers of misleading text.

A dubious premise

The EO gets off to a bad start right away. Generally in science, we cite sources when referencing someone else or making statements that aren’t commonly known or agreed upon. While executive orders don’t often include citations, the failure to cite any of the sweeping claims made in the “Policy and Purpose” section of this EO calls into question whether its authors know anything about scientific standards. Some of the statements made in the Policy and Purpose section are not supported with evidence–for example, the statements justifying the EO’s changes by referencing the public’s distrust of science. Contrary to the administration’s rhetoric, there is evidence that people have a relatively high level of trust for science compared to other professions.

This EO and the resulting guidance are crucial for us to monitor because our government uses science when making decisions that affect American community’s health, access to services, and the infrastructure we count on every day. Certainly, it undermines public trust when decisionmakers suppress or distort science to advance a political goal. This EO, far from addressing that issue, is actually just another attempt to subvert science and enable deception.

The Requirements section of the EO lays out some basic premises of the scientific method, stating that federal science must be: “reproducible; transparent; communicative of error and uncertainty; collaborative and interdisciplinary; skeptical of its findings and assumptions; structured for falsifiability of hypotheses; subject to unbiased peer review; accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and without conflicts of interest.” All fair enough. But, as my colleague Jules Barbati-Dajches discusses, it doesn’t include the word “independent,” which is fundamental in ensuring that studies are free of bias toward favored industries or ideological preferences. The EO uses scientific terminology to create an impression of support for science, but considering the context in which this EO was published draws a stark contrast–we’ve seen attacks on academic institutions; freezing, decreasing, and eliminating scientific funding; and firing and reassigning federal scientists. This EO is not simply a wasteful attempt to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. It sets the stage for political appointees to exercise total control over science and throw out evidence that doesn’t suit the ideological viewpoints of this administration.

A dangerous process to discard science

One of the many alarming red flags in this EO is the way it talks about transparency and reproducibility in science. These are, of course, important aspects of the scientific method, but again it is important that we consider the context and the history of how these terms have been exploited. After the dubious Policy and Purpose section, and the list of some of the principles of the scientific method, the EO gets specific about what will be required of federal agencies to comply with the stated goals of transparency and reproducibility. These requirements include providing all scientific information including data, models, and source code, except when “prohibited by law, and consistent with relevant policies that protect national security or sensitive personal or confidential business information.” The decisions about whether the science is sufficiently transparent to be considered won’t be made by scientists—they’ll be made by political appointees who will be free to subjectively apply these criteria. We have been here before. It’s worth digging into these parts of this EO, because this is where they are setting up a dangerous process that will enable the politicization of science and science-informed policy.

First, let’s dissect the phrasing in this EO a bit. The term “sensitive personal information” (SPI) is defined differently and used inconsistently under federal government statutes, but there are some basic categories of SPI, including financial, geolocation, health, and data distinguishing people’s identities. The US Code defines SPI using these categories as applying to data held by federal agencies. “Confidential business information” (CBI) refers to information or data held by an individual or company that is proprietary. One difference between these two types of private information is that the US Code sets up a process for businesses and companies to request treatment of certain data and information as CBI, whereas SPI is defined in statute and not generally open to case-by-case requests by individuals. This creates an imbalance between these two types of sensitive or private information. These differences stand out to me, as does the history around the use of forced raw data sharing.

Public health studies, such as those that examine associations between toxic chemical exposures and health effects, often rely on anonymized personal health information—which is a type of SPI—between health care providers and their patients. This allows researchers to aggregate data in order to compare populations, eliminate other variables that could explain the results, or increase in the robustness of the study, all while maintaining the privacy of individual participants. This type of health information is called “protected health information,” and is covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), later amended and finalized as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. Maintaining individual privacy is a necessary protection for many reasons, and doing so supports the public health studies that are vital to understand the impacts of, for example, air pollution on children’s respiratory health and comparisons of different populations’ exposures to toxic substances.

The requirement to keep individual data private has been exploited over time to remove consideration of these types of studies from decision making. The tobacco industry has been a historic (and health damaging) leader in this tactic—notably, when Phillip Morris attempted, unsuccessfully, to obtain the raw (protected) data indicting second hand smoke in lung cancer, right as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was set to classify it as a known human (Class A) carcinogen. The fact that the fossil fuel industry has borrowed tactics from the tobacco industry’s science-squashing efforts is well-documented. These and other for-profit groups have developed earlier renditions of “science guidance” that set up barriers to keep scientific results that indicate health harms out of government decision-making. The 1997 “Sound Science Plan”, funded by Phillip Morris, recommend many of the tactics that this EO requires of federal agencies as a strategy to avoid enactment of safeguards around secondhand smoke.

In 2014, the US House of Representatives introduced and passed the so-called “Secret Science Reform Act.” This bill, if enacted, would have mandated that the US EPA could only propose a regulation if ”all of the data, models, methods, and other information in the scientific studies used in its development were publicly available, accessible, and reproducible,” putting the tobacco industry’s carefully-crafted barrier in the way of public health and safety rules. The bill never passed the Senate. But in the first Trump administration, political leaders at EPA proposed the misleadingly-titled Transparency in Pivotal Science Rule, and later amended it.

Under that rule, most studies collecting individual-level data would not have met the sharing requirements and, as a result, would have been given less weight when developing EPA health-based pollution standards and policies. It stands to reason, of course, that effective public health rules for chemicals already in our environment are better when you base them on actual evidence that comes from studies of real people. That proposed rule drew tens of thousands of comments, and was broadly criticized by health researchers and scientific organizations such as the American Academy for the Advancement of Science, scientific journals, state departments of health and environmental protection, and many non-profits and state attorneys general. The Journal of Science wrote explicitly about the nuanced importance of transparency in scientific studies for reproducibility. On February 1, 2021, the rule was vacated following legal challenges based on both the EPA’s lack of authority to enact it and its inherent conflicts with the Clean Air and Water Acts.

Sowing doubt by design

There are other tactics to censor or exclude scientific information that reveal health and environmental harms. One is the “re-review” tactic. The final Transparency in Pivotal Science rule required that EPA conduct additional internal peer review of “pivotal” science, even if those studies had already undergone independent peer review. Section 5 of this gold standard science EO includes this tactic, since it requires “re-review” of “regulations, guidance documents, policies, and scientific evaluations” developed between January 20, 2021 and January 20, 2025. The UCSF library curates a collection of industry documents that includes evidence of plans for industry manipulation of government decision-making, including that industry-developed Sound Science Plan I mentioned earlier—which suggests required data transparency, creating a narrative to decrease trust in certain areas of science, and setting procedural science criteria without input from the scientific community. The Trump administration’s new EO is drawn straight from these corporate disinformation tactics.

We all want science to be free from the influence of industries and organizations that value their profits over truth and the public interest. We want scientific studies to undergo independent and unbiased peer-review, and to have the resources to produce high quality studies. In fact, some scientists have laid out a set of criteria that industry could follow so that their studies would be met with greater trust – like competitive and transparent funding processes, independent research agendas, and freedom to publish. An administration that is truly supportive of science wouldn’t be cutting funding, producing bogus reports, firing scientists, threatening to block scientists from publishing, or claiming falsehoods as facts. Admittedly, sometimes it’s tricky to sift through the rhetoric to figure out what is supportive of science and what is a guise to keep evidence of health harms out of policy-making. Data sharing is not an all-or-nothing issue; it is nuanced and there are levels of data sharing and availability, ranging from general description of the sources to fully accessing the raw data itself. Some observers have proposed divulging all but individual identifiers (e.g. names, addresses) in order to comply with data transparency rules. However, researchers tested this and found that they could successfully re-identify 25% of de-identified participants with publicly available datasets. For medical data that can and should be kept private, that’s too high a risk.

There’s a real way to improve scientific standards

One of the recommendations to protect science from politicization is to enact scientific integrity policies, and UCS has been studying and advocating for these policies for a long time. The Biden administration enacted the “Restoring Trust in Governmental Decisionmaking and Evidence-Based Policymaking” EO, which set up a scientific integrity taskforce and required federal agencies to develop scientific integrity policies. That administration’s Office of Science and Technology Policy adopted this definition of scientific integrity: “the adherence to professional practices, ethical behavior, and the principles of honesty and objectivity when conducting, managing, using the results of, and communicating about science and scientific activities.” This EO followed many recommendations from the Center for Science and Democracy at UCS, with a focus on reducing and eliminating the risk of political interference in science. It set up metrics to develop and monitor high quality scientific integrity policies. Ironically, the Trump administration’s so-called “gold standard” EO regresses all scientific integrity policies back to 2021, before this progress was made.

The danger here is that this EO creates pathways for science to be influenced for political and financial gain, and specifically to down-weight or censor scientific studies and data from decisionmaking if they cannot comply with unnecessarily broad raw-data transparency requirements, (as is the case for most health studies). It bears repeating: the power to decide over whether a study meets the Trump administration’s “standard” would rest in the hands not of scientists but of political appointees, who could use this power to discard any evidence that doesn’t give them an answer they want.

UCS supports transparency practices in government, academia, and industry, but these requirements set out by the Trump administration are designed to be impossible for many valuable studies to meet. In the face of website takedowns, the removal of inspectors general and Freedom of Information Act officers, and a general culture of dishonesty, it’s laughable to think that these “transparency” requirements are offered in good faith. It’s just the latest iteration of a tactic that powerful industries created to shield themselves from accountability.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alesia-gritcuk-rH_T40Nj7Rc-unsplash-scaled-e1749128309793.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 10:05:54.381980

renewables and natural gas, sets the price for the whole system, which can disadvantage nuclear power.
Environmental groups were largely either indifferent or outright opposed to nuclear power.","The modern climate movement came into its own demanding that the world stop shrinking from inconvenient truths. But as polls increasingly showed the 2024 election trending toward Republicans, Ackva saw few funders propping up advocates with any influence over the GOP. Founders Pledge pumped millions into Deploy/US, a climate group where former Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida served as the top adviser, which then distributed the money to upward of 30 right-leaning climate groups, including the American Conservation Coalition and the Evangelical Environmental Network.

The bipartisan gamble paid off. In April 2024, Founders Pledge received an anonymous $40 million donation to bolster its efforts. Now an anonymous donor has granted Founders Pledge’s climate fund another $50 million, Heatmap has learned.

Founders Pledge declined to say whether the money came from the same unnamed source or separate donors. But the influx of funding has “radically transformed our ability to make large grants,” Ackva told me, noting that the budget before 2024 came out to about $10 million per year.

“The word exponential is overused,” he said. “But that’s roughly the trajectory.”

Amid the so-called green freeze that followed the Trump administration’s rollback of climate funding, Founders Pledge has joined other climate philanthropies in stepping in to back projects that have lost money. When Breakthrough Energy shuttered its climate program in March, Founders Pledge gave $3.5 million to serve as the primary funding for the launch of the Innovation Initiative, started by former staff from the Bill Gates-backed nonprofit.

Ackva said his organization is looking to invest in climate efforts across the political spectrum. But Founders Pledge’s focus on right-of-center groups wasn’t an election-year gimmick.

“You can’t just divest from the eco-right after the election,” he said. “That’s not an authentic way to build a civil society ecosystem.”

As Republicans in Congress proceed with their gutting of green funding, including through Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, Ackva said it’s too soon to say whether the political strategy is paying off.

“If you think of grantmaking as making bets, some bets exceed others sooner, but that doesn’t make them bad bets,” Ackva told me. “Ultimately, philanthropy cannot define how a given policy goes. You can adjust the probabilities, maybe level the bets. But obviously it’s larger forces at play that shape how the One Big, Beautiful Bill gets made.”

The Senate may save or even expand parts of the IRA that support baseload power, e.g. nuclear and geothermal. But regardless, Ackva said, climate advocates are making a mistake training their focus so intently on the fate of this one law.

“It’s kind of the only thing that’s being discussed,” he said.

Meanwhile the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, better known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is set for reauthorization next fall. The Energy Act of 2020 is slated for renewal this year. And funding for the Department of Energy is up for debate as the White House now pushes to expand the Loan Programs Office’s lending authority for nuclear projects by $750 million.

“Those are things we would see as at least as important as the Inflation Reduction Act,” Ackva said.

Given those deadlines, Ackva said he expected other donors to press advocates for plans last year on how to sway Republicans toward more ambitious bills this Congress. But after former Vice President Kamala Harris took over the Democratic ticket last year, he said he’d heard from his grantees “that they were asked what they were going to do with a Harris trifecta.”

“Everyone was betting on Harris to win,” he said. “There’s a very strong ideological lean among climate funders to a degree that was frankly a little bit shocking.”

The partisan divide over climate wasn’t always so pronounced. In 2008, the Republican presidential nominee, John McCain, ran on a more ambitious decarbonization platform than what President Barack Obama proposed in the White House.

There are dueling — though not mutually exclusive — narratives about how the American climate movement over-indexed on one side of the political spectrum. Both stories start in 2010.

The version liberals and leftists will find familiar is one that blames fossil fuel megadonors such as Charles and David Koch for aggressively promoting climate denial among Republican lawmakers.

The version told by Ted Nordhaus, the founder of the Breakthrough Institute think tank where Ackva got his start years before joining Founders Pledge, starts with the failure of the Obama-era cap-and-trade bill to pass through Congress.

When the legislation “went up in flames in 2010,” Nordhaus told me, a bunch of environmental philanthropies hired Harvard professor Theda Skocpol to author a 145-page report on what triggered the blaze.

“The report concluded that the problem is we were too focused on the technocratic, inside-the-Beltway stuff,” Nordhaus summarized. “We needed to build political power so the next time there’s an opportunity to do big climate policy, we would have the political power to put a price on carbon.”

Out of that finding came what Nordhaus called the “two-pronged, boots-on-the-ground” era of the movement, which backed college campus campaigns to divest from fossil fuels and also efforts to prevent new fossil fuel infrastructure such as the Keystone XL pipeline.

Reasonable people could debate the fiduciary merits of scrapping investments in natural gas companies or the value of blocking oil infrastructure whose cancellation spurred more shipments of crude on rail lines that face higher risk of a spill or explosion than pipelines. But once supporting fossil fuel divestment or opposing pipelines became the key litmus tests activists used to determine if a Democrat running for office took climate change seriously, the issue became more ideological.

“That made it impossible for any Democrat to become a moderate on climate, and made it impossible for any Republican to be a moderate on climate,” Nordhaus said. “The Republican Party has its own craziness and radicalism, but a bunch of that is negative polarization.”

To fund an effective “climate right,” Nordhaus said, Founders Pledge should seek out groups that don’t explicitly focus on the climate or environment at all.

“I’d be looking at which groups are all-in on U.S. natural gas, which has been the biggest driver of decarbonization in the U.S. over the last 15 years; which groups are all in and really doing work on nuclear; and which groups are doing work on permitting reform,” Nordhaus said. “That’s how you’re going to make progress with Republicans.”

I asked Ackva where the line would be for funding an eco right. Would Founders Pledge back groups that — like some green-leaning elements of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s party or allies of France’s Marine Le Pen — support draconian restrictions on immigration in the name of reducing national emissions from the increased population?

“That would not be appropriate,” Ackva told me. “When we say we’re funding the eco right, like when we’re funding groups on the left or in the center, the things they are proposing don’t need to be exactly the things we will be prioritizing, but they need to be plausible, high-impact solutions.”

To Emmet Penney, a senior fellow focused on energy at the right-leaning Foundation for American Innovation, it’s an obvious play. The green left that has long dominated climate policy debates “is premised on aggressive permitting and environmental law that makes it impossible to actually build anything useful toward addressing the things they’re most afraid of.”

“It’s become clear to anyone who wants to build anything that what the environmental left has to offer simply doesn't work,” he told me. “Naturally, more centrist organizations who might not even otherwise be slated as right-wing now look that way and are becoming increasingly attractive to people who are interested in building.”

On Wednesday evening, Republicans on the Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee released their section of President Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful” budget reconciliation bill. “At least so far, it’s hardly deviating from the stark cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act that have already passed the House,” my colleague Emily Pontecorvo wrote in her analysis of the contents — although there is one Environmental Protection Agency grant program, for reducing pollution at ports, that had been targeted in by the House bill and is absent from the Environment and Public Works Committee’s text. As in the House bill, the latest text eliminates the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which the Trump administration has sought to kill with accusations of fraud, though it has yet to produce any evidence of impropriety.

Elsewhere in the Senate, however, some Republicans appear more friendly toward preserving at least some IRA tax credits. “I would be in the camp that doesn’t think we need [to do] a full repeal and instead can live with a circumscribed, narrower version of the existing IRA credits,” Senator Todd Young of Indiana, a member of the Finance Committee, said, as reported by Axios. Senator John Curtis of Utah published an op-ed in Deseret News on Wednesday in which he argued that “the right policy solution must navigate tax credits and regulatory reform in what I believe is central to America’s economic future, the planet and our national security: energy.”

2. … and a public lands sell-off is back on the table

Senate Republicans are reviving a plan to sell off public lands to fund President Trump’s tax cuts after their colleagues in the House thwarted a similar proposal, Senator Mike Lee of Utah told reporters on Wednesday. According to the senator, a new version of the plan will be included in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources’s pass at the bill, which will likely be made public on Monday, Bloomberg reports.

Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana helped lead the charge to kill the earlier version of the proposal in the House, although Lee added that his version would exempt Montana. Still — as I’ve reported — the plan would jeopardize as much as 500,000 acres of public land across Utah and Nevada alone. “These are the places people recreate with their families, they are places to hunt and fish, and they are held in trust for the American people to enjoy for generations to come,” Travis Hammill, the D.C. director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said in a statement.

3. 2025 will be a banner year for energy investment, despite economic turbulence: IEA

Despite tariffs, trade wars, and economic uncertainty, the International Energy Agency anticipates a record $3.3 trillion investment in global energy in 2025, per a new report released Thursday. That represents a 2% rise from 2024. “The fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement about the findings.

Around $2.2 trillion of the total global investment is “going collectively to renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency, and electrification, twice as much as the $1.1 trillion going to oil, natural gas, and coal,” the report says. Solar specifically is booming, with a forecast of $450 billion in investment by 2025. The overall picture represents an enormous reversal from a decade ago, when fossil fuel investments were 30% higher than electricity generation, grids, and storage. That said, the research also found that investment in grids — at around $400 billion per year — is “failing to keep pace with spending on generation and electrification,” mainly because of “lengthy permitting procedures and tight supply chains for transformers and cables.” Read the full report here.

4. UK solar is having a record year due to unusually sunny spring

Carbon BriefSolar farms in the United Kingdom generated more electricity than ever before in the first five months of the year, according to a newly released accounting by Carbon Brief. The surge in solar energy was 42% higher than over the same period last year, growing from 5.4 terawatt-hours of electricity generated to a record 7.6 terawatt-hours. Carbon Brief credited the record output to the nation’s sunniest spring on record, although the publication notes it was also “aided by rising capacity, which reached 20.2GW in 2024, up by 2.3GW from 17.9GW a year earlier.” You can read the full report here.

5. ‘Atmospheric thirst’ is making droughts more severe: study

While extreme heat almost always has a climate change signal, the same cannot be said for droughts, which have different causes and feedback mechanisms that researchers are still working to understand. A new study published Wednesday in Nature has found that atmospheric evaporative demand — that is, the complex process of water evaporation into the atmosphere, also called “atmospheric thirst” — has increased drought severity by an average of 40%. Over the five years from 2018 to 2022, areas in drought have expanded 74% on average compared to the 1981 to 2017 period, with atmospheric evaporative demand “contributing to 58% of this increase,” the report further found. “We were very much shocked when we saw the results,” Solomon Gebrechorkos, a hydroclimatologist at the University of Oxford and lead author of the study, told The New York Times.

THE KICKER

“A large majority of new residential houses and buildings in Germany feature a heat pump as their main heating system,” according to government numbers reported by Clean Energy Wire. “The climate-friendly heating technology was installed in more than two-thirds (69.4%) of the 76,100 homes finished in 2024, a 5% increase compared to 2023.”

While neither Meta nor Constellation disclosed the value of the deal, Mark Nelson, founder of Radiant Energy Group, estimated that it would cost around $17 billion, of which between $7 billion to $9 billion would be profit for Constellation, enough to fund the building of a new plant. Either way, the announcement represents the “first time a nuclear customer is proposing another nuclear reactor in the state,” Nelson told me.

These types of deals are not exactly novel anymore (Microsoft struck a deal with Constellation last year to resurrect Three Mile Island), but they demonstrate a shift in mindset among tech companies, which are finally showing some respect for the emissions benefits of nuclear energy — albeit about a decade late.

The 2010s were a dark time for the nuclear industry. Cheap natural gas threatened the economic viability of aging plants, while the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan combined with rising enthusiasm for renewable power had left the industry politically isolated. Between 2012 and 2022, 12 nuclear reactors closed in the U.S. Those 12 plants represented over 9,000 megawatts of capacity, about a 10th of the total capacity of the American nuclear fleet.

Nuclear plants suffered most in “restructured” electricity markets like Illinois’, where utilities generally purchase power from independent power producers. In these markets, power that’s cheap on an hourly basis, i.e. renewables and natural gas, sets the price for the whole system, which can disadvantage nuclear power.

At the same time, big technology companies were ramping up purchases of low-carbon power — typically wind and solar — with Google doing its first power purchase agreement in 2010. Many state and federal programs to support alternative energy usage were aimed at wind and solar, i.e. were no help to struggling nuclear generators. Environmental groups were largely either indifferent or outright opposed to nuclear power.

Eventually states had to do what the market couldn’t and big tech wouldn’t and step in and keep plants alive. A broader Illinois clean energy law from 2016 included a program to support nuclear power plants by paying for what the market had historically ignored: the fact that their electricity is generated without carbon dioxide emissions. The zero emission credits were part of a larger climate law that provided 10 years of support for downstate nuclear plants. The Illinois bill followed on similar efforts in New York to keep upstate plants open.

(The push and pull between the economic and environmental concerns on both sides of the nuclear argument also led to some bizarre political inversions: At the same time New York was working to keep the upstate plants open, then-Governor Andrew Cuomo joined with Riverkeeper, the environmental group long associated with Cuomo’s ex-brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to close the Indian Point nuclear plant closer to New York City.)

Environmental groups supported the New York and Illinois clean energy programs, but they were at best cool to the nuclear provisions, illustrating the political hole nuclear power plants had fallen into. Touting the pollution benefits of the Illinois law, the Natural Resources Defense Council claimed that “nuclear energy does not represent a clean energy resource.” In New York, the NRDC filed a brief supporting the state’s legal authority to set up a zero emission credit system — “not because it supports the nuclear support program,” but rather because it supported the broader principle of paying for zero-emissions attributes.

The Environmental Defense Fund likewise supported the Illinois law, but with assurances that the nuclear credits “only represents a small fraction of the more-than-500-page bill.” The Union for Concerned Scientists hailed the bill but also made clear that it was “much more than a nuclear subsidy.”

The balance changed in earnest with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which included generous subsidies for new and existing nuclear power, reflecting both its lack of emissions and the industry’s longstanding sway in Washington. Then tech companies’ demand for energy started to climb with the advent of large language models and the immense power needed to train and operate them.

Energy policy experts at the big tech companies were also rethinking how best to decarbonize their operations. They had “run out of baseload,” Nelson told me, referring to always-on power sources as opposed to intermittent sources like wind and solar, and so would need to start supporting options like nuclear in order to truly decarbonize. With the arrival of a new breed of artificial intelligence, Nelson said, these companies realized that they were, in fact, industrial electricity purchasers and would have to act like it.

The past year has seen a flurry of big tech and nuclear tie-ups.

Amazon acquired a data center adjacent to a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania in March, 2024, although the company’s subsequent efforts to use it as a “behind the meter” power source soon faced regulatory opposition. Google, along with Microsoft and Nucor, announced a plan to work together to buy and advance the development of non-carbon-emitting power, including nuclear. Microsoft announced its Three Mile Island deal later last year, while Amazon started investing in small modular reactors and Google said it would buy power from plants built by the advanced nuclear company Kairos. And in December, Meta released a request for proposals for nuclear energy developers to deliver at least 1 gigawatt and up to 4 gigawatts of clean power by “the early 2030s,” which the company said today it was “still advancing.”

Meta’s deal for the Clinton nuclear plant will essentially replace the Illinois emissions credit program, which runs out in 2027. The announcement of the deal also reflects the volatile and confusing politics of clean power in 2025. While Republicans in Congress are looking to slash the Inflation Reduction Act and its support for clean power investment and production, the House budget reconciliation bill included carve-outs for advanced nuclear power. The Trump administration has also signed a fleet of executive orders looking to streamline nuclear power regulations and encourage new nuclear development, reflecting the high esteem the industry has with the Republican Party despite its lack of interest (at best) in climate change policies, per se.

When Constellation announced the Three Mile Island project less than a year ago, it included a quote from a Biden Energy Department official, as well as a line about how “renewed interest in nuclear energy has spread globally as nations seek to electrify their economies to support the digital economy and address the climate crisis.” This time, Constellation included quotes from Clinton, Illinois’s mayor, as well as three legislators who represent the area, all Republicans, and a local union official. It also mentions climate change zero times, although it does describe the electricity generated by the plant as “emissions free.” (Meta’s release also doesn’t mention climate change specifically.)",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDQ2Mzc2Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4Njc2NTE4OX0.rz_9T7guWLrsDu4beAdUpBiq2pX2cOJVA_EK5UatY9A/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-06 08:28:07.889001

As the US administration advances its deregulatory agenda, geothermal energy has emerged as a beneficiary in President Donald Trump’s push for energy dominance — a rare example of a renewable gaining traction as a lobbying focus among Republican lawmakers.

On May 29, the US Department of the Interior said it will apply “emergency permitting procedures” to streamline the approval of geothermal projects deemed critical to national security.

Among the first to be fast-tracked are proposals for three Nevada geothermal projects put forward by Ormat Technologies, a US-based developer that received federal funding for research and development during Trump’s first term.

The move follows an April announcement by the department to expedite environmental assessments for certain domestic energy and critical mineral projects on federal lands, reducing a year-long process down to 14 days. This streamlined process was made possible by the president’s declaration of a national energy emergency on his first day back in office.

Members of the geothermal industry have welcomed the reforms as a timely boost for project development, amid rising demand from artificial intelligence data centres and other energy-intensive infrastructure.

“These streamlined processes will reduce bureaucratic hurdles, allowing for faster project initiation and completion, which is crucial for meeting the growing energy demand,” Ormat tells Sustainable Views.

A spokesperson from Quaise, a start-up specialising in ultra-deep geothermal drilling technology, says the move highlights the administration’s focus on grid stability and positions geothermal as a key source of clean, baseload power.

Sustaining this deregulatory momentum, the department unveiled plans on June 3 to repeal 18 federal land-use rules related to geothermal energy and mineral exploration on public lands, with the aim of reducing regulatory burdens for energy developments and limiting federal oversight.

It described the regulations as “obsolete or redundant”, and framed the changes as part of Trump’s strategy to “advance America’s energy independence”.

Bipartisan support for geothermal

Generated by tapping into heat stored deep underground, geothermal energy is a rare win-win-win: renewable, carbon-free and a round-the-clock source of energy and heating.

Steve Humes, a partner at US-based law firm Holland & Knight, says geothermal’s relatively small land footprint and limited visual impact help make it less controversial, particularly in rural areas. “What truly sets geothermal apart is its ability to bridge political divides,” he says.

Unlike wind and solar, up to 80 per cent of the investment required in a geothermal project involves technology, practices and skills familiar to the oil and gas industry, shows data from the International Energy Agency.

What truly sets geothermal apart is its ability to bridge political divides

Steve Humes, Holland & Knight

Anna Littlefield, programme manager for low-carbon energy technologies for the Payne Institute at the Colorado School of Mines, says this overlap makes geothermal politically attractive. Indeed, it is sparking interest from the fossil fuel industry.

Jamie Beard, executive director of non-profit geothermal advocacy organisation Project InnerSpace, says much of the industry’s recent momentum is driven by “oil and gas industry veterans who have started geothermal companies”, or fossil fuel companies.

Geothermal also avoids many of the supply chain vulnerabilities to which other clean energy technologies are subject. Unlike solar, whose manufacturing is concentrated in China, US geothermal development leverages off-the-shelf equipment and a domestic supply chain built around US-produced materials such as steel.

Its ability to be an “all-American” resource makes it a strategic fit for Trump’s energy independence agenda, says Bryant Jones, executive director of US-based trade association Geothermal Rising.

“The Trump administration has embraced geothermal as a ‘non-threatening’ renewable resource — one that supports domestic energy production without the cultural baggage often associated with other green or zero-carbon technologies,” adds Holland & Knight associate Nic Martell.

IRA tax cuts threaten growth

Despite the recent reforms to the federal permitting process, a number of policy barriers continue, nonetheless, to constrain the growth of the geothermal industry.

Experts say this is particularly true for next-generation technologies, which allow developers to reach untapped resources by drilling deeper underground where temperatures are higher, known as “superhot rock geothermal”.

With high upfront costs and lengthy installation times, tax credits introduced under the Joe Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act are seen as critical in making these early-stage projects financially feasible.

Geothermal, like all energy sectors, benefits significantly from predictable and consistent policy frameworks, and this stability remains a key variable moving forward

Anna Littlefield, Colorado School of Mines

Sage Geosystems chief executive Cindy Taff describes the early financing gap as the “valley of death” — a stage where many innovative technologies struggle to reach commercial scale.

According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, projected levelised costs of electricity for enhanced geothermal systems in 2025 dropped by around 85 per cent between 2020 and 2024 model projections.

However, if enacted, the House Republican’s sweeping tax proposal would repeal IRA clean energy tax credits, putting the future of early-stage geothermal development at risk.

The bill would begin phasing out key investment tax credits within 60 days of its enactment, three years ahead of the current schedule, weakening financial support for long-lead projects. Meanwhile, its proposal to eliminate credit transferability after two years would restrict developers’ access to capital, making it harder to finance early-stage developments.

“We are worried that Congress is inadvertently throwing the baby out with the bathwater and it’s an oversight on the House’s part,” Jones tells Sustainable Views.

Martell warns that despite Trump positioning geothermal as a policy priority, meaningful support will hinge in part on the administration’s willingness to “back up its rhetoric with sustained investment”.

“Ultimately, geothermal, like all energy sectors, benefits significantly from predictable and consistent policy frameworks, and this stability remains a key variable moving forward,” adds Littlefield.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/6d6c5ae8-7b2d-488d-87f0-cbf442b897e0.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 09:03:27.956261

Capture rates are important because they measure the economic performance of renewable energy generation by indicating the revenue realized compared with the potential revenue at the baseload power price. High capture rates suggest effective market integration and profitability, while low rates may highlight challenges, influencing investment decisions and energy policy development.

For example, a 50% capture rate in the context of renewable energy indicates that half of the potential renewable energy resources available in a specific area or system are being effectively harnessed and converted into usable power. This shows potential challenges in market integration, pricing competitiveness or demand for renewable energy, signaling that improvements may be needed to enhance profitability and market performance.

Platts publishes daily renewable capture rates in seven North American ISOs: California Independent System Operator, Electric Reliability Council of Texas, ISO New England, Midcontinent Independent System Operator, New York Independent System Operator, PJM Interconnection and Southwest Power Pool.

Wind capture rates are published for CAISO, ERCOT, ISONE, MISO, NYISO, PJM and SPP, and solar capture rates are published for CAISO, ERCOT, ISONE, MISO and PJM.

Platts utilizes published capture prices from across the US and wholesale electricity prices from ISOs for the corresponding hubs and zones. Renewable Capture Price Rates are measured in %.

This essay was recognized as a runner-up in the 2025 Spring Semester Chair’s Essay Competition. The competition, coordinated in partnership with the European Investment Bank, focused on the topic: “Competitiveness in a low-carbon economy: the role of innovation and green technologies in maintaining the competitive advantage.”

As the climate clock is ticking, greenhouse gas emissions are struggling to decline. According to the IPCC, global emissions would need to be reduced by 43% by 2030 compared with 2019 to limit warming to 1.5°C [IPCC 2023]. The EU has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with a net reduction of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 [Council of the European Union, 2023]. Despite these commitments, emissions in some sectors, such as transportation, are either stagnant or increasing. However, these sectors are both highly emitting and crucial for the European economy.

This climate challenge is coupled with an uncertain geopolitical context. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) adopted by the United States in 2022 injects $370 billion to support green technologies, including electric mobility. However, Donald Trump’s return to the White House has threatened this course, with a withdrawal from climate commitments. This prospect opens up a scenario of a return to laissez-faire climate, where environmental ambitions become optional once again, even as the European Union continues to impose increasingly stringent standards (Bellan, 2025). China, for its part, is pursuing an offensive strategy by massively subsidizing its green industries, enabling players like BYD to flood the international market with low-cost electric vehicles. This asymmetry in public policy accentuates the risk of European industry falling behind the competition.

Furthermore, the Draghi report, submitted to the European Commission in March 2024, warns of this delay in investment in key transition sectors. It points to a risk of loss of industrial attractiveness and strategic dependence if Europe does not react [The Draghi report on EU competitiveness, 2024]. This is particularly true for the transport sector, “responsible for nearly a quarter of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions” [European Environment Agency, 2021]. The automotive industry, the economic backbone of countries such as Germany and France, employs 13 million people in Europe [European Commission, 2025]. Today, it is weakened by aggressive foreign competition, dependence on critical metals, and the high costs associated with the transition to electric vehicles.

The question is therefore clear: how can we prevent Europe’s climate ambitions from translating into an industrial drain, job losses and a loss of economic sovereignty? This essay will analyze the levers that innovation and green technologies offer to meet this challenge, through the prism of the transport sector.

1. An automotive industry under pressure: Global tensions and European vulnerabilities

Europe has historically been an industrial export powerhouse. In the automotive sector, giants like Volkswagen, Stellantis, and Renault have long dominated global markets. However, today, the situation is changing. In 2023, China became the world’s leading car exporter, particularly in electric vehicles. Supported by the Chinese government, manufacturers like BYD, SAIC, and Geely benefit from massive subsidies for production, research, and exports. The result: their vehicles are arriving in Europe at unbeatable prices. In 2024, Chinese companies accounted for 76% of global EV sales (Hanley, 2024), and nearly 60% of electric vehicles sold in Europe now come from China. This breakthrough is also explained by China’s dominance over supply chains, presenting internal challenges: China controls 70% of the extraction and processing of critical metals (lithium, cobalt, nickel) necessary for batteries (Dasgupta, 2024). “In 2023, 52% of global lithium-ion battery sales were made by Chinese companies” [Le Point, 2024]. This strategic dependency makes the European industry vulnerable to supply disruptions or trade tensions.

At the same time, the IRA in the United States encourages manufacturers to invest locally through generous tax credits and administrative simplification. Several European firms have already announced plans for partial relocation or preferential investment in the US, such as Swedish group Northvolt and German company BASF [Transitions & Energies, 2022]. This dual pressure, from China and the US, creates a significant competitive distortion for European companies, which are subject to demanding climate standards without receiving equivalent public support.

This observation leads us to a conclusion: there is a strong need for innovation in Europe, investment in R&D, detaching from the global value chain (particularly for batteries), and training workers and researchers in strategic locations, with the creation of clusters. Protection mechanisms are also needed to safeguard the industry, preventing relocation and carbon leakage.

2. Green innovation as a competitiveness lever: Investing in strategic technologies

To preserve its competitiveness while meeting its climate goals, Europe must invest heavily in strategic green technologies. The solution lies in the reshoring of critical value chains and the development of integrated industrial sectors.

Several initiatives are moving in this direction. First, the European Battery Alliance, launched in 2017, aims to create a continental battery production sector, from raw material extraction to recycling [European Commission, 2017]. In France, the Douai gigafactory (ACC, a consortium of Stellantis, Mercedes, and Total) symbolizes this ambition (Vermeersch, 2024). In Germany, Northvolt and Volkswagen are investing in local production units (Volkswagen & Northvolt, 2019). The goal is clear: reduce dependence on China and create sustainable industrial jobs.

In addition, because the battery market is characterized by volatile prices [IEA, 2024], it would be interesting to develop solid-state batteries (SSBs) for the next generation of electric vehicles (EVs), which offer significant advantages over traditional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), including higher energy density, safety (Hughes & Vagg, 2022), and environmental sustainability (Mauger et al., 2019).

Other areas are also strategic, such as clean hydrogen technologies, advanced biofuels, and electric charging infrastructure. The European Investment Bank (EIB) plays a crucial role here by financing innovative projects.

Moreover, innovation also involves the creation of regional technological clusters: ecosystems that bring together businesses, research and training centers, and public and academic institutions. These hubs allow for resource pooling, accelerate R&D, and structure entire industries. The creation of regional clusters in key automotive regions represents a far-reaching strategy aimed at ensuring competitiveness, creating jobs, and mitigating regional disparities, while driving innovation. These clusters would integrate various components, including reskilling centers to upskill displaced workers, fostering a “coalition cascade” (Meckling & Goedeking, 2023) that strengthens support for the green transition. R&D centers would drive technological advancements. These hubs will foster partnerships between private companies and academic institutions, which are key to incentivizing innovation and, therefore, patent creation. Finally, battery manufacturing plants will reduce Europe’s dependency on foreign raw materials while ensuring sustainability through recycling facilities. As battery recycling is another critical element for ensuring sustainability in the EV supply chain, recycling facilities would be established to create a circular economy for essential raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. These facilities will reduce Europe’s dependency on foreign raw material supply chains, which are currently dominated by China, and ensure that vital resources are reused within the domestic market.

These clusters could be established in regions historically marked by thermal automotive industries to facilitate the transition. In Germany, Stuttgart, in Baden-Württemberg, and Wolfsburg, in Lower Saxony, are ideal sites for these clusters due to their automotive industrial legacy (Nahm, 2021) and existing infrastructures. For this green industrial policy to be effective, it must be accompanied by support for workers. Training and accompaniment in these regions are essential to avoid territorial divides. A just transition is a key condition for both political and economic success.

3. European tools to protect industry and avoid carbon leakage

Finally, we can conclude by discussing the European tools to protect industry and prevent carbon leakage. Europe has begun to equip itself with protective and incentivizing mechanisms to support its transition. First, the most emblematic is perhaps the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which will gradually come into force from 2026, after a transitional phase, which started in October 2023 (European Commission, 2025). This mechanism aims to tax imports of highly emitting products from countries without equivalent climate regulations. It allows for the protection of European industries while encouraging third countries to adopt stricter standards. However, it faces several implementation challenges today.

Additionally, European climate diplomacy is shifting towards the creation of climate clubs, which are alliances between countries that share the same climate ambitions and commit to avoiding practices of environmental dumping. These clubs can facilitate technological exchanges, industrial cooperation, and the harmonization of standards [Climate Club, n.d.].

Conclusion

Europe cannot afford to choose between climate and industry. If it fails to combine climate ambition with industrial competitiveness, it risks not only losing its geopolitical influence, but also undermining its economic model. On the other hand, a well thought-out green innovation strategy can transform the ecological transition into a real driver of sovereignty, job creation and cohesion. The transport industry, and the automotive sector in particular, illustrates this crucial tension. Faced with growing geopolitical and industrial pressures, notably from China and the US, Europe needs to step up its industrial policies and structure its efforts around the key technologies of tomorrow, such as batteries, and the creation of regional clusters. The European Union has the necessary levers to succeed, but it must use them strategically. The European Investment Bank (EIB), a key player in the field of financing, has a central role to play as a catalyst for this ambitious pact between innovation and the environment.

Environmentalists opposed to the Line 5 tunnel felt the draft statement neglected an important aspect.
He said he hopes EGLE considers that when it again looks at permits for the tunnel project.
For the Love of Water (FLOW) Executive Director Liz Kirkwood outlined the legal proceedings that have occurred during the permitting process.","Opponents of drilling a tunnel to house an oil and natural gas liquids pipeline beneath the Straits of Mackinac gathered last night, calling on the State of Michigan to take a harder look at the project when it reconsiders a Water Resources Permit.

The Canadian pipeline company, Enbridge, proposes rerouting its 72-year-old Line 5 through the proposed tunnel rather than leaving it where it is now, lying on the bottom of the Straits, the four-mile-wide stretch of water that connects Lake Michigan to Lake Huron.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, one of the regulators involved in permitting the tunnel project, recently released a draft Environmental Impact Statement. The draft and the permitting process is being rushed by an order by President Donald Trump as part of his declaration of a ""national energy emergency.""

One of the speakers at an event last night said the Army Corps of Engineers is taking less of a look at the environmental impact than the Michigan Public Service Commission and EGLE, both of which have approved permits, although the EGLE permits will have to be reconsidered.

Environmentalists opposed to the Line 5 tunnel felt the draft statement neglected an important aspect.

“Nobody so far in this permitting process have looked at the actual environmental impacts of building a tunnel through the most sensitive part of the bottomlands of the Great Lakes,” said Sean McBrearty, Michigan state director of Clean Water Action.

He said he hopes EGLE considers that when it again looks at permits for the tunnel project.

For the Love of Water (FLOW) Executive Director Liz Kirkwood outlined the legal proceedings that have occurred during the permitting process. They include a back and forth struggle to keep a lawsuit filed against Enbridge by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in state courts rather than federal courts. There is some dispute over Michigan’s public trust rights over the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac.

Native American tribes are also concerned there are ancient ancestral structures on the lake bottom that could be damaged by the construction of the tunnel.

There is also Canada’s invocation of treaty rights which protect the transfer of energy across national boundaries.

Kirkwood said throughout the process Enbridge insists that Line 5 is critical infrastructure for Canada and the U.S., although the bulk of the oil merely crosses through Michigan to deliver tar sands oil extracted from western Canada to the big population centers in Ontario and Quebec.

“And they’re saying that multinational corporations should be able to trump sovereign rights of states and indigenous peoples because oil is more important and their profits are more important than our ability to govern and protect the most important thing, which is water,” Kirkwood told the audience in Traverse City and online.

McBrearty of Michigan Clean Water Action said Enbridge has been on a campaign to discredit the environmentalists and businesses opposed to the Line 5 tunnel, by buying ads on media and buying gasoline at stations to give away to people in small towns to persuade them to support the tunnel project.

“Despite all of that and their efforts in the press to make it look like we’re a marginalized group, our movement is growing.”

In an emailed statement, Enbridge said in part, “In designing and constructing the tunnel, Enbridge is working with state and federal agencies to study and develop plans that will minimize and mitigate impacts to the natural environment, natural resources, cultural heritage and community priorities.”

But what if instead of waiting in anxious silence, nonprofit leaders took a proactive public stance in defense of their work?
We don’t know if we’ll ultimately succeed in regaining access to our unlawfully frozen federal funds, but we do know our odds are better now that others are fighting with us.
But since Trump took office, reticence has become a common response, even for organizations that are typically outspoken.
An alarming number of mission-driven groups have taken a wait-and-see approach, choosing to stay quiet and hope for the best rather than risk speaking up.","In the days leading up to Earth Day this spring, environmental groups across the country were convinced that President Trump would sign an executive order on April 22 threatening their tax-exempt status. They swiftly assembled legal teams, developed public responses, and called on philanthropy to prepare for a potential massive blow to their ability to operate. For the first time this year, climate leaders were ready to turn fear into a coordinated, decisive response.

The anticipated executive order never happened, but most of the field continues to wait for the next shoe to drop as grants are canceled, legislative proposals are written, and regulations are slashed. But what if instead of waiting in anxious silence, nonprofit leaders took a proactive public stance in defense of their work?

Fear is a powerful force, especially during times of uncertainty. Speaking up can feel scary. But it doesn’t have to.

A few short months ago, I would have met that claim with skepticism. What about the risks of retaliation? What if there’s a bad outcome? What if our reputation is damaged? I’m now convinced that many of those concerns are misplaced.

I speak from experience.

On February 12, the Trump administration promised to claw back funds from recipients of a $20 billion Environmental Protection Agency grant program — money that was legally obligated and disbursed last summer. The nonprofit investment firm I lead, Climate United Fund, was one of those grantees, competitively selected under the National Clean Investment Fund to increase access to affordable financing for clean energy projects in communities across America.

We learned about the administration’s plan to freeze our funding through a video on X in which EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin falsely claimed the program was riddled with waste, fraud, and abuse. Numerous federal investigations have turned up no evidence to support those claims, and the EPA’s own lawyers have admitted in court that we did nothing wrong.

Overnight, Climate United went from financing clean energy projects to becoming a main character in a national story based on misinformation. Our initial response to this shocking and surreal situation was to stay silent, lay low, and hope the conversation fizzled out. We reached out almost daily to the EPA and Citibank, which held the grant funds, to schedule a conversation and clear things up. But we never got a response, let alone an explanation for why our funds were frozen. At one point, EPA scheduled a meeting, then rescheduled it, and then cancelled it altogether. For weeks, we were left in the dark.

Responding to Lies

Despite our efforts to avoid attention, the baseless attacks persisted. Lies and smears circulated across the internet about us and the EPA program we were hired to administer. We received thousands of threatening emails, phone calls, and mentions on social media. Egged on by the EPA, right-wing media spread blatant misinformation. The FBI and Department of Justice launched investigations, which led a veteran federal prosecutor, citing a lack of evidence in the case, to resign in protest.

Keeping quiet was clearly no longer an option. On March 8, after three weeks of silence, we sued the EPA and Citibank for unlawfully freezing our funds. Our decision to shift strategies wasn’t the result of reduced risk or diminished attacks, but a suspicion that staying quiet was only making matters worse. Our hunch proved correct.

Negative media stories about us decreased by 50 percent, and news coverage generally became more positive and balanced as we started going on the record with reporters and providing statements. Our increased media presence was also instrumental in helping us raise critical philanthropic dollars to cover operational expenses and minimize staff reductions while our bank accounts remain frozen.

Reclaiming our own story had another important effect: It increased trust in our brand. As an organization that received federal grant dollars, we doubled down on our commitment to transparency. We interacted with supporters and skeptics alike on social media, and posted documents and reports on our website detailing our work to date. Those who engaged with us expressed gratitude for our efforts, even if they disagreed with the grant program itself.

Perhaps most importantly, our decision to say something empowered others to do the same. By choosing to speak up, we created a safer space for our peers, our partners, and the communities we serve to share their unique perspectives. We have since been joined by nine additional plaintiffs in our lawsuit, many of whom are telling their own stories. We don’t know if we’ll ultimately succeed in regaining access to our unlawfully frozen federal funds, but we do know our odds are better now that others are fighting with us.

Facing Fear

Changes in presidential administrations have always invoked varying degrees of fear and uncertainty across sectors and political ideologies. Historically, nonprofits such as Climate United, which is nonpartisan, have played a critical role in filling gaps where the government and markets fall short, and keeping the focus on serving communities in need.

But since Trump took office, reticence has become a common response, even for organizations that are typically outspoken. An alarming number of mission-driven groups have taken a wait-and-see approach, choosing to stay quiet and hope for the best rather than risk speaking up.

This strategy can be effective for self-preservation in the immediate term but ultimately has chilling implications for public discourse and democracy itself.

What’s the alternative? Lead the way by speaking openly and honestly about your work and invite others to join you. Courage is contagious. Every leader has tough choices to make about what risks an organization can take, but collective action mitigates risk and creates space for stories that need to be told. Test different strategies, gauge the results, and discover the benefits of speaking up, as we did.

Follow the lead of universities and law firms that have stood up in opposition to attacks by the Trump administration — and who have seen courts rule in their favor.

Join the nearly 700 philanthropic organizations that have signed onto a collective effort to build power, defend the Constitution, and lessen the risk of individual potential threats.

Leverage industry groups like the National Council of Nonprofits to make your voice heard on key executive and legislative actions that could harm your work and your community.

Philanthropy can help federal grantees defend their work and values without fear of political retaliation. When nonprofit leaders are weighing the risk of speaking out and potentially losing federal funding, foundations and individual donors can join them in solidarity — not by trying to replace federal funds, but by helping them fight back and pivot to new funding models, including raising more money from other foundations and donors.

As the political environment becomes even more unpredictable and hostile towards nonprofits, the nation needs more action, not less. Our communities and our planet cannot afford to wait for this storm to pass. We all need to buckle up, stand strong, and speak out.",https://chronicle.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7eb027d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1415x743+0+91/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchronicle-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fdd%2Fcf%2Fd7d0846e4d95bfa3e75ec2fc748b%2Fopinion-baffordspeakingup.JPG,N,,2025-06-05 08:11:45.541321

The poor air quality stretching across the US came as a result of dozens of wildfires burning across Canada as the country’s annual wildfire season roars into destructive action.

The fires, which have been sparked by both humans and natural causes, have prompted at least 25,000 residents in three Canadian provinces to evacuate in recent days.

On Wednesday afternoon, a map from the US Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow forecast showed large swaths of moderate to unhealthy air quality across the east, midwest and southern parts of the US, featuring smoke and dust.

Also on Wednesday, the New York state department of environmental conservation issued an air-quality advisory from 11am to 11pm for multiple counties including parts of New York City.

New York officials recommended that individuals consider limiting strenuous outdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health effects. Officials also said that people who may be especially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of pollutants include the very young and those with pre-existing respiratory issues.

Similarly, New Jersey’s department of environmental protection issued a code orange air-quality alert for the multiple parts of the state on Wednesday. A code orange air-quality alert means that air pollution concentrations within the region may become unhealthy for sensitive groups including children, elderly people, and people with asthma, heart and lung diseases.

Meanwhile, the Iowa department of natural resources issued a statewide air-quality alert on Tuesday that is set to last until Thursday. The department warned that intermittent thick smoke can be expected over the state.

In New Hampshire, officials declared an air-quality action day on Tuesday, and in Maine, the state’s department of environmental protection issued an air-quality alert from 11am Wednesday to 11pm Thursday.

Musk amplified a post from Tesla Energy, a part of his business empire focused on solar and batteries, against the House-passed bill’s rollback of renewable energy credits from the Democrats’ 2022 climate law.
“Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid,” the company wrote.
Cramer said Musk has never pushed him to support EV credits.
Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who runs an electronics manufacturing business, said of Musk: “He’s an incredibly smart man, we know that.","The single biggest donor in last year’s elections stands to lose billions of dollars because the Republicans he helped bankroll are now poised to scrap energy policies that support his electric car and energy business.

But Elon Musk has repeatedly pointed to deficit concerns when going on an online blitz starting Tuesday against the GOP’s “big beautiful bill,” breaking his allegiance to President Donald Trump and stunning congressional leaders who are trying to pass a tax cut, energy and security spending package with razor-thin majorities.

Still, lawmakers and other observers are questioning Musk’s motives. And the billionaire himself has provided some clues he’s not happy with how the GOP bill would hurt his bottom line.

“Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns, on Wednesday.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has worked to rebut Musk, at one point Tuesday suggesting the Tesla CEO was miffed about the legislation scrapping Biden-era rules meant to promote the use of electric vehicles.

“It’s part of the Green New Deal. And I know that has an effect on his businesses, and I’ll admit that,” Johnson said. “But for him to come out and pan the whole bill is, to me, just very disappointing.”

On Wednesday, Johnson would not address Musk’s potential motives. “Everybody can draw their own conclusions about that,” the speaker said. “Look, I don’t subscribe [motivation] to anybody.”

Musk’s public displeasure with the megabill started showing last week as he was preparing to leave his position as a special federal worker tasked with cutting spending.

Musk amplified a post from Tesla Energy, a part of his business empire focused on solar and batteries, against the House-passed bill’s rollback of renewable energy credits from the Democrats’ 2022 climate law.

“Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid,” the company wrote.

Murk also amplified a post saying “slashing solar energy credits is unjust.” “There is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar,” Musk wrote.

And even though Musk had said he didn’t want federal incentives for his EV business, POLITICO and other outlets — citing anonymous sources — have said the billionaire was lobbying to protect those very credits.

“Tesla certainly stands to lose a perverse incentive to manufacture cars people aren’t willing to pay for,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). “Or we’ll find out who’s actually willing to pay for them if they are not subsidized. But frankly, I’ve never been lobbied by Tesla or Elon personally.”

‘He just wants to be treated fairly’

Fiscal hawks in Congress are either trumpeting Musk’s attacks against the bill or suggesting changes are needed. Many other lawmakers are showing contempt for the Trump ally — especially if he’s throwing a tantrum because of business concerns he once claimed not to have.

About a dozen lawmakers asked about the dispute Wednesday told POLITICO’s E&E News they had not heard from Tesla lobbyists in years, and when they had heard from Musk himself recently, the conversation was not about his cars. Musk’s focus on federal cost-cutting meant he focused less on his businesses.

“Elon came here and sacrificed six months of his life that no one remotely near his net worth would do,” said Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), who owns car dealerships.

He continued, “And he never came here to advocate for Tesla. He’s the one guy — the business leader — who doesn’t come here looking for a handout. He just wants to be treated fairly.”

That could be true, but the Republicans’ continued targeting of EV incentives at a time when Tesla Motors has been struggling may have finally rubbed Musk the wrong way.

The GOP in recent weeks used the Congressional Review Act — a rule-busting law — to scrap a Biden EPA waiver for California emissions rules meant to promote the use of EVs. Then there’s the megabill.

Republicans are moving to end a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers by the end of this year. Moreno suggested the Senate could push to end the credit in September.

In addition, new requirements to root out Chinese materials from U.S. supply chains stand to thwart the advanced manufacturing credit, or 45X, meant to benefit facilities like Tesla’s Nevada battery plant.

Cramer said Musk has never pushed him to support EV credits. “He’s never said that,” the senator said, noting he’s exchanged an occasional text message with Musk. “He’s never said that to me. … I don’t question his motives.”

‘They are not fine’

In the past six months, as Musk took a proverbial chainsaw to the federal government — and wielded an actual one in an infamous appearance — his company’s lobbying presence on Capitol Hill was seriously limited, said an auto lobbyist granted anonymity to speak freely.

Indeed, Tesla’s government relations shop was gutted in roughly the last year after some high-profile departures, but the company retained Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in addition to Cassidy & Associates.

“Everyone was like, ‘Oh, they will be fine, the CEO is in the White House,’” the auto lobbyist said. “They are not fine.”

Disclosure records show Tesla and its outside firms spent $240,000 in the first quarter of this year on discussing clean energy tax credits and other policies. None of that was on the California clean car waiver issue, which observers said should have been a concern.

“They don’t have much of a [government relations] presence on the Hill anymore,” said Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.), though he recalled meeting in 2019 with a Tesla executive who’s no longer with the company.

Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) said he used to meet with Tesla to talk about clean energy issues but “haven’t seen them in a while.”

“They were interested in the deployment of batteries,” he said. “It’s a great invention. They have a lot to offer.”

Democrats like Peters and Levin are happy to see Musk join them in opposing the legislation, which Republicans are looking to muscle through using the budget reconciliation process. It allows the majority to bypass the Senate filibuster on certain fiscal matters.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who runs an electronics manufacturing business, said of Musk: “He’s an incredibly smart man, we know that. But one can be naive about politics.”

The program provides tax incentives to California manufacturers of green technologies and environmentally friendly projects.

SB 86 would double the amount of funds available in the program, from $100 million to $200 million, and would extend the program until 2031. SB 86 would also expand the tax incentive program to include nuclear fusion, a cutting-edge technology that has the potential to produce unlimited amounts of clean energy.

“With the Trump Administration dramatically slashing clean energy funding, it’s imperative that California continue its leadership role in the fight against climate change,” said Sen.

Plus, the bill will help California become a national leader in fusion energy, a potential game-changing clean technology.”

SB 86 won unanimous approval in the Senate on a vote of 39-0. The bill now goes to the state Assembly for consideration.

SB 86 would extend and expand the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority’s (CAEATFA) Sales and Use Tax Exclusion (STE) Program. California State Treasurer Fiona Ma, who serves as chair of the CAEAFTA authority, is sponsoring SB 86.

The California Legislature established CAEATFA in 2010. Since then, the program has incentivized $11 billion in clean tech and environmental projects in California, funding 256 projects in over 40 counties and creating or retaining 115,000 jobs.

The program, which funds renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and advanced transportation and manufacturing technologies to reduce air pollution, conserve energy, and promote economic development and jobs, is also oversubscribed.

SB 86 would also provide tax incentives for nuclear fusion energy technology for the first time. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, located in Sen. McNerney’s district, has also been on the leading edge of fusion tech.

The Morning

A Travel Ban

President Trump signed a travel ban for citizens of 12 countries.

June 5, 2025Updated 7:16 a.m. ET

President Trump signed a travel ban for citizens of 12 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa. Those countries are: Afghanistan, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. He also imposed visa restrictions on other countries. See the full list here.

When it starts: The ban goes into effect on Monday.

Will it last? A travel ban in Trump’s first term led to chaos and court battles. This time, the ban appears more likely to withstand legal challenges: “They seem to have learned some lessons,” Stephen Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown, said of the administration. “But a lot will depend upon how it’s actually enforced.”

The rationale: In announcing the ban, Trump claimed foreigners who were not properly vetted posed a risk. “We don’t want them,” he said. He cited the recent arrest of an Egyptian man who overstayed a tourist visa and was charged with attacking Jewish protesters in Colorado. (The restrictions don’t cover Egypt.)

There’s also a list of exceptions, including green card holders, dual citizens, athletes traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup or the Olympics, and others. See who’s exempted.

More immigration news

Harvard: Trump said he would prevent Harvard’s international students from entering the country. The university said that was illegal. Read more about their fight here.

Asylum claims: For people in war-torn nations like Afghanistan and Myanmar, the travel ban dims hopes for sanctuary.

Deportations: The administration obeyed a judge’s order and brought back a Guatemalan man whom it wrongly deported to Mexico.

A Biden investigation

Trump ordered the White House counsel and the attorney general to investigate Joe Biden and his staff. The government will examine if some of Biden’s presidential actions were legally invalid because his aides enacted those policies without his knowledge.

It’s Trump’s latest attempt to stoke outlandish conspiracy theories about his predecessor: Trump recently shared a claim on social media that Biden was killed in 2020 and replaced by a robotic clone.

Chaos at Tesla

Elon Musk says he is stepping away from politics to care for his businesses, particularly Tesla.

It needs the help.

Tesla drove the electric-car revolution, and Musk spent nearly two decades making his image inseparable from the company. For years, Tesla seemed like a window into the future as it grew larger than the Big Three automakers in Detroit. But during — and partly because of — Musk’s stint slashing government programs and laying off workers, Tesla has withered.

Its stock has tumbled since President Trump’s inauguration. Global sales have cratered. One blue state is nixing contracts. In Los Angeles, where I live, sheepish Tesla owners place “Bought Before the Plot Twist” stickers on their bumpers. Today’s newsletter is about how one of America’s great avatars of futurism broke.

A decline

Tesla had a few troubles before Musk jumped into politics. The company was losing market share around the world to Chinese electric automakers like BYD, and it had abandoned plans to manufacture a completely new and cheaper model. Instead, Musk was hyping humanoid robots and self-driving taxis, technologies that seem a long way off from mainstream use.

But Musk’s sojourn in politics extracted a steep cost, partly by polarizing Tesla’s clients.

The stock price is down more than 17 percent since the start of the year, and profit fell 71 percent in the first three months of 2025.

Protesters have picketed Tesla showrooms around the world. They say they intend to expand their demonstrations.

People have vandalized Tesla vehicles and charging stations. A Colorado resident spray-painted “Nazi” onto a dealership sign.

In Germany (where Musk backed a far-right party) and Britain (where he said a civil war driven by migration was “inevitable”), registrations in April of new Teslas fell to their lowest points in more than two years. Elsewhere in Europe, the story is the same.

Last Friday, the agency that runs the New Jersey Turnpike said it would replace more than 60 Tesla-made electric vehicle chargers with another company’s chargers.

Signs of distraction abound: Musk waited for months after the Trump administration imposed tariffs to ask for a briefing at Tesla about their impact on the firm, worrying some executives. In recent months, a board member has stepped in to fill him in on day-to-day operations.

Back to business

Musk says he’s entering a new phase. He posted on X last month that he’s back to “spending 24/7 at work.” One sign of distance from Trump: He flayed the Republicans’ deficit-fattening policy bill as a “disgusting abomination” this week. (The current proposal would end financial perks for people who buy electric cars.)

Musk, who has a Forbes-estimated net worth of $415 billion, is arguably the most successful businessman of his generation. He has spent his career overcoming obstacles (few took Tesla seriously as a competitor for the Big Three when he first invested in the company in 2004) and proving doubters wrong (SpaceX invented reusable rockets).

But Tesla is now the only publicly traded company in Musk’s empire, and during his season in politics he wiped out about $220 billion from the company’s market valuation.

Related: Republicans are scrambling to appease Musk, who is furious at them for voting for a bill to deliver Trump’s domestic policy agenda.

Karine Jean-Pierre, a White House press secretary under Biden, is leaving the Democratic Party and becoming an independent.

TAXES ON TIPS

Trump promised to end taxes on tips, and his proposal is now part of the “big, beautiful bill” that the House recently passed. Evan Gorelick explains what we know about the plan.

Who would benefit from Trump’s “no tax on tips” policy? My colleagues at The Upshot examined it. Among their findings:

Roughly 3 percent of U.S. employees work for tips: They include bartenders and blackjack dealers, waiters and delivery drivers. But the policy would create a huge incentive for workers like cashiers and retail salespeople to start earning tips.

How much will tipped employees gain? It depends on how much they earn in tips. Though most would see some benefit, many — about a third — wouldn’t. Those who make enough to receive the break might typically pay around $1,800 less in taxes.

More tips, more benefits: Workers who earn more in tips — at expensive restaurants or Vegas casino tables — stand to save more. This fits a broader theme of the bill: Higher earners have the most to gain.

That has a limit, though: The legislation would halt the exemption for tipped workers who make more than $160,000. It’s a hard cutoff: A tipped worker making $160,001 would receive nothing and pay thousands in additional taxes.

The tip policy would add $40 billion to the federal debt over four years, experts estimate. The Senate has taken up Trump’s legislation and aims to vote on it before the July 4 holiday. Republicans have a narrow margin in the chamber, and several members have criticized the size of the bill. Still, party leadership has deftly flipped holdouts in the past.

Related: Late night hosts joked about the bill.

A new video game console from Nintendo hits stores today. German Lopez explains.

Even if you don’t play video games, you have probably heard of the Nintendo Switch. It can be played on a TV screen or as a portable device, and it is the third most popular console of all time, with 150 million units sold. That’s enough for every person in Britain, France and Belgium to own one.

Today, Nintendo released a sequel, the Switch 2. It has not gone as planned.

Demand for the system is greater than supply, and gamers say retailers abruptly canceled their orders in the past few days. Nintendo also had to delay pre-orders in the United States after Trump’s announcement of global tariffs led the company to reassess how much it would cost. (Prices eventually rose on Switch 2 accessories but not on the Switch 2 itself.)

Despite the problems, fans are excited and expectations are high.

From start to finish the application process for the $27 billion in taxpayer-backed fund only lasted months.
Many of the nonprofits that received billions in funding had been established after the application process was announced, according to Republican lawmakers.
The Republican lawmakers' letter went on: 'These improper relationships between federal agencies and grant recipients reinforce concerns that considerations other than merit influenced the selection process.'
The Republican lawmakers requested a meeting to discuss with Zeldin how to prevent grants being awarded in such a manner again.","Republicans in Congress are investigating ties between a Biden-era $27 billion green fund at the Environmental Protection Agency and former Democratic staffers.

The EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), created in 2023 after Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act passed, was responsible for doling out the billions to nonprofit organizations to help them champion climate causes.

From start to finish the application process for the $27 billion in taxpayer-backed fund only lasted months. Many of the nonprofits that received billions in funding had been established after the application process was announced, according to Republican lawmakers.

Reports indicate that up to $20 billion of the GGRF was obligated after Donald Trump won the 2024 election but before he was sworn in on January 20.

A former Biden EPA official likened the fund to 'tossing gold bars off the Titanic' - a mad dash to hand out federal dollars to anyone that would accept them.

President Donald Trump's EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has ordered an internal investigation into the matter, and the Justice Department is also probing the GGRF.

Republican lawmakers claim firms that were incorporated after the GGRF application process opened - and which employed staff with ties to Democrats - were granted billions without proper oversight.

'The Biden Administration’s EPA rushed through $27 billion in grants with little transparency, minimal vetting, and troubling political ties,' Chairman Brian Babin of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee claims in a letter to Zeldin about the GGRF exclusively obtained by the Daily Mail.

'The American people deserve fairness and accountability in how their money is spent — especially at this scale,' he wrote in the letter sent to Zeldin on Tuesday. 'We’re demanding answers and pushing for real reforms to ensure this never happens again.'

Georgia Republican Rep. Rich McCormick, who also signed the letter, claimed the grants were given to organizations with 'questionable ties.'

'I'm deeply concerned that the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund has prioritized speed and political favoritism over competitive merit and fiscal responsibility,' he wrote.

'This $27 billion program has bypassed critical oversight safeguards, awarding massive grants to organizations with limited experience and questionable ties.'

Most of the cash went to eight main grant recipients that were then responsible for giving out smaller loans to other nonprofits, according to the letter to Zeldin about the GGRF.

The EPA does not accuse the recipients of wrongdoing, but the agency has called foul about the process in which the awards were doled out.

However, the original legislation did not call for much oversight of the funds, and many of the awards were won by firms with ties to former Presidents Barack Obama or Joe Biden, the Republican lawmakers claimed.

They cited the example of Power Forward Communities, a group that received $2 billion dollars, which was founded by Ari Matusiak, who worked in the Obama administration from 2011 to 2014.

PFC reported just $100 in revenue in its first four months of operation before receiving the billions, according to nonprofit tracker Influence Watch.

A spokesperson for PFC told the Daily Mail the 'group formed in 2023 to apply for the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy funding.'

Stacey Abrams, a former Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate, was later brought on to nonprofit Rewiring America, a firm that was allocated $490 million under the Biden-era GGRF program.

'Abrams, an attorney, joined Rewiring America, one of the coalition’s members, in March 2023 as a senior counsel,' a spokesperson said. 'Abrams did not have a role at Power Forward Communities beyond her position at Rewiring America.'

She left Rewiring America at the end of 2024.

'Hope Enterprise Corp., awarded approximately $94 million, is led by CEO William Bynum, who served on the Biden-Harris Presidential Transition Team and was later appointed to the Department of the Treasury’s Racial Equity Advisory Committee,' the Republicans wrote in their letter to Zeldin.

In a statement to the Daily Mail, HOPE President Ed Sivak responded: 'The $94 million award will be used to support increased access to solar power in Arkansas. In Arkansas, HOPE was one of two applicants and the only statewide applicant.'

The effort is projected to save money for Arkansans, Sivak claimed, though it is not yet up and running.

'Groundswell, Inc., recipient of $156 million, is led by CEO Michelle Moore, who served as President Obama’s Chief Sustainability Officer and a Biden-appointed board member for the Tennessee Valley Authority,' the lawmakers wrote.

The Republican lawmakers' letter went on: 'These improper relationships between federal agencies and grant recipients reinforce concerns that considerations other than merit influenced the selection process.'

The EPA is now working to claw back cash given out in the last days of the Democrat administration, but since the officials sent billions out of federal coffers to a Citibank account, it is already out the door.

Zeldin and his team are currently litigating the matter.

The case is before a federal appeals court after a judge ruled that EPA must allow the obligated funds to flow to the grant recipients.

'The agency’s inability to ensure regulatory compliance further underscores the structural problems surrounding the GGRF,' the letter continues.

'The EPA’s accelerated $27 billion grant process appears to have bypassed many of these critical safeguards.'

The Republican lawmakers requested a meeting to discuss with Zeldin how to prevent grants being awarded in such a manner again.

Earlier this year, the EPA administrator shared he is prepared to take the case to the Supreme Court.

'The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, so if a district court judge makes a decision, we are not going to assume that the United States Supreme Court is going to agree with that district court,' he testified before the Senate.

By Zachary Matson

Gov. Kathy Hochul has recommended former New Jersey congressman Rush Holt Jr., a scientist who also served as chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and New York City environmental attorney Jose Almanzar to serve on the Adirondack Park Agency board.

Hochul submitted the slate of appointees to the state Senate last week, which also included new four-year terms for current board members Benita Law-Diao, Daniel Wilt, Ken Lynch, Mark Hall and Zoë Smith.

Holt, who lives in Clinton County and would fill an in-park seat, served as a Democratic representative for New Jersey’s 12th district from 1999 to 2015, one of the only professional scientists serving in Congress. Holt was the chief executive officer of the Association for the Advancement of Science from 2015 to 2019, leading the longstanding nonprofit devoted to promoting scientific freedom and cooperation. In that role Holt was also publisher of the well-known scientific journal Science.

Holt, who also held positions at Swarthmore College and Princeton University during his scientific career, has served on the Adirondack Council board of directors since 2020.

“Holt has a really strong science background and a good sense of politics,” said John Sheehan, spokesman for the Adirondack Council. “He is a really smart, thoughtful person.”

Almanzar works as an environmental lawyer in the New York City office of the law firm Holland & Knight. He also has professional experience as an environmental scientist. Almanzar was born in the Dominican Republic and immigrated to New York City when he was around 7 years old. Almanzar in an interview for his firm’s website recounted becoming extremely ill as a young child after playing in a contaminated creek. He said that experience fueled his passion for environmental law and policy.

“It was kind of my superhero origin story in a way,” Almanzar said in the interview.

Hochul’s appointments, if confirmed, would refresh the APA board and fill the vacancy left when Andrea Hogan resigned from the board in January 2023.

“The governor nominated a full slate of appointees to the APA for Senate consideration,” said Emma Wallner, a spokesperson for the governor. “She looks forward to their timely confirmation.”

The appointments come on the cusp of all APA board members reaching expired terms. The last members serving on unexpired terms were set to see their terms run out at the end of June.

It’s not clear if Hochul has specified someone to replace John Ernst as board chair. Ernst last week said he planned to retire after the June meeting, the last of his term. The governor can designate the board chair from among the appointed board members.

The appointees are typically interviewed before the Environmental Conservation Committee before senators vote on their confirmation. After the latest state budget in years, lawmakers are working through a backlog of end-of-session bills and appointments. There was no scheduled hearing to consider the appointments as of Wednesday.",https://www.adirondackexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_8928-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 08:11:40.916270

Already in 2025, the majority of Chinese EVs are cheaper than their fossil equivalents and are flooding the world with low-cost exports, including in emerging markets from Ethiopia to Brazil.

Thanks to new battery and charging technologies, electric vehicles (EVs) are cheaper than anticipated and the fear of range-anxiety is immaterial. Barring a few competitors in South Korea and Europe, this market belongs entirely to China. Such a scenario is increasingly a base case. Already in 2025, the majority of Chinese EVs are cheaper than their fossil equivalents and are flooding the world with low-cost exports, including in emerging markets from Ethiopia to Brazil. Alongside producing over 60 percent of the world’s EVs and 80 percent of its batteries, Chinese companies have unveiled new breakthroughs that will solidify their dominance in automobile markets: EVs that charge in five minutes, batteries that doesn’t require any costly critical minerals, and a luxury EV that can drive for 14 hours on a single charge. These are tectonic shifts in one of the most politically and economically vital manufacturing sectors across developed nations.

Notably, the United States is missing from the picture—but ongoing negotiations among Republican lawmakers on the heels of the House reconciliation bill passed last month will decide whether this becomes reality. There has been much attention paid on the energy front to the bill’s changes in tax incentives for clean electricity projects. Equally consequential, but receiving far less attention, are the provisions that would disrupt the emerging industrial base for electric vehicles, batteries, and critical minerals.

The House bill, which is now with the Senate, would repeal the EV tax credit, strip manufacturers of the ability to monetize production incentives quickly, and add sweeping new restrictions on foreign sourcing and technology collaboration. These moves would not only derail Detroit’s efforts to develop globally competitive electric vehicles, but also undermine the Trump administration’s stated goals of securing critical minerals and revitalizing U.S. manufacturing. EVs have become symbolic in partisan debates, but their industrial significance transcends politics. Senate Republicans must now reckon with the long-term economic and security consequences of reversing course.

Actions already taken by the Trump administration have injected bearish sentiments across U.S. EV markets. Even before the House text was released, uncertainty around the future of Biden-era energy incentives had already done its damage. Bipartisan cleantech funding worth billions of dollars has been frozen by federal agencies and $6.9 billion in clean energy projects were voluntarily canceled in the first quarter of 2025 alone. The vast majority of projects canceled—roughly $6.3 billion—were battery factories. The Trump administration’s aggressive tariffication and its ensuing unpredictability have hit U.S. automakers especially hard and resulted in a number of them downgrading their annual sales outlooks.

Despite China’s dominance across the battery supply chain, the Biden administration’s bet to build a domestic industrial base was both strategic and sound. Batteries are essential for electric vehicles, grid-scale storage, consumer electronics, and defense applications—and they are key demand drivers for a myriad of dual-use minerals. The Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law together provided a suite of demand- and supply-side incentives that had all the makings of an industrial policy.

This multifaceted approach used every lever of government. On the demand side, the 30D New Clean Vehicle tax credit had sourcing requirements that required the onshoring—or, at the least, friendshoring—of components and minerals that went into the batteries of a qualifying electric vehicle. On the supply side, the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit provided incentives at every segment of the battery supply chain from the processing of critical minerals to the production of cathodes and anodes to the assembly of battery packs. These were further buoyed by grant and loan programs that helped finance domestic processing facilities, cathode and anode manufacturing, and cell assembly lines.

By the end of the Biden administration, there were over 200 planned EV and battery supply chain projects worth $184 billion scattered across the country—especially concentrated in the Midwest and the Southeast, which was making a name for itself as the “battery belt.” These investments were part of a broader all-of-government strategy to reorient critical mineral sourcing and processing around U.S. and allied supply chains. For example, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation issued a loan to Syrah Resources in November 2024 to support operations at the Balama graphite mine in Mozambique. A portion of the mine’s output was bound for Vidalia, Louisiana, to a processing facility built by Syrah with a separate loan from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office that would be eligible for the 45X credit. The anode-grade material produced by the facility would ultimately be used in batteries for EVs sold by U.S. automakers, enabling those vehicles to qualify for the 30D tax credit available to consumers.

Domestic and international efforts were increasingly aligned under a more cohesive industrial policy. From the Department of Defense’s expansive use of Defense Production Act funding to the Export-Import Bank’s revival of its long-dormant import finance authority, federal agencies moved in concert to build a more secure and diversified battery supply chain. But critically, those upstream investments were only viable because the 30D and 45X tax credits created long-term, predictable demand for materials and manufacturing in the United States.

That foundation is exactly what the House proposal now threatens to dismantle. Repealing the electric vehicle tax credit—the sole federal demand-side incentive for EVs built with U.S.- and allied-sourced batteries and materials—would undercut the financial viability of domestic and non-Chinese supply chain projects. These projects were structured around the expectation of long-term market certainty. Stripping away that certainty would not only freeze new investment but also undermine innovation. The U.S. is well positioned to lead in next-generation battery technologies like lithium-sulfur, lithium metal, and silicon anodes—but without a reliable domestic market, those breakthroughs will struggle to reach scale and compete internationally.

The proposed House legislation also introduces new eligibility restrictions that would remove incentives for battery factories and mineral projects with any involvement from foreign entities of concern. Notably, the overwhelming majority of foreign battery deals in the United States involve Japanese and Korean companies, with only a small handful of proposed joint ventures involving Chinese firms. However, nearly all of these factories depend on capital equipment—specialized, often boutique machinery used in mineral processing and battery cell production—that is nearly impossible to source without Chinese manufacturers. These restrictions could disqualify projects that have no Chinese ownership or control but remain linked to globalized supply chains, effectively stalling the battery belt before it even gets off the ground.

A cautionary example of what’s at stake is A123, an American pioneer of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology. Without supportive industrial policy, A123 struggled to scale and ultimately filed for bankruptcy in the early 2010s. The company was legally acquired by a Chinese firm, who then scaled up the core technology, and helped kick-start China’s global lead in LFP production. We can’t afford to repeat that mistake. In fact, the U.S. might take a valuable lesson from China’s success—where absorbing as much Chinese tech as possible would help expedite the U.S.’s industrial base and access to relevant high-tech machinery.

The great risk to U.S. competitiveness isn’t dependence; it’s policy incoherence. Securing the supply of critical minerals has been given great importance by the Trump administration, from executive orders to the ongoing deals with Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The stubborn fact, however, is that minerals don’t move without markets. Moreover, without a stable demand signal for batteries and EVs built outside China’s orbit, no amount of supply diplomacy will matter.

The United States is at a strategic crossroads now on whether it can truly compete in the global vehicle market, innovate next-generation batteries, and secure mineral supply chains. The first step is recognizing that all three imperatives are intertwined.",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/electric-vehicle-GettyImages-2215956747.jpg?w=1000,N,,2025-06-05 07:03:47.859567

Why this matters:

The EPA plays a central role in monitoring air and water quality, enforcing pollution limits, and researching environmental health threats. A sharp drop in staff — especially scientists and regulators — can mean fewer inspections, delayed responses to contamination, and weakened oversight of polluting industries. As the federal government scales back, watchdog groups warn that polluters may face fewer consequences, and public health could suffer. Respiratory conditions like asthma, already exacerbated by dirty air, are expected to increase, particularly among children.

Hence, the other big factor when it comes to affordability: vehicle leases and the EV tax credit.","The federal EV tax credit is, to put it lightly, in limbo given the current wording of the GOP's ""big, beautiful bill.""

Though a lot of back-and-forth remains, with the Senate haggling with the House — and senators from red states with EV factories loath to damage the industry — it is more likely than not that GOP holdouts will fall in line and gut former President Biden's $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases and leases.

The big question is how important the tax credit is to Tesla and CEO Elon Musk? Could it be that his recent outbursts against the Trump-backed budget bill are frustration over the loss of the tax credit?

A new report from Bloomberg suggests that Musk's new tack to destroy the bill comes after his lobbying to save the tax credits was unsuccessful. Musk responded that the budget bill negates all the cost savings supposedly achieved by the DOGE ""at great personal cost and risk,"" alluding to the hit to Tesla's business.

But if you listened to Musk in the past, you would think the EV tax credit is not a big deal for Tesla EV sales vis-à-vis its competitors.

""I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly,"" Musk said when asked about the future of the tax credits during Tesla's Q2 earnings call last year. ""But long term probably actually helps Tesla, would be my guess.""

Tesla likely would not exist if not for that tax credit, which the company availed itself to for years during the Obama administration. The EV tax credit was extended and enhanced under President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, signed in 2022.

Tesla can profitably produce its EVs, so at the time, Musk seemed fine with Congress potentially pulling the EV tax credit benefit.

But Musk has been changing his tune. In addition to his tirade trashing the GOP bill as a ""disgusting abomination"" and the Bloomberg report on Musk's lobbying to save the credit, he complained in a recent post about the bill's favorable tax treatment for carbon-based energy, but not clean electric.

""There is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar,"" Musk wrote about the budget bill.

The name of the game: Affordability

On Friday, the US Department of Energy announced that it was canceling $3.7 billion in funding for 24 projects related to energy and industry. That included nearly $1.3 billion for cement-related projects.

Cement is a massive climate problem, accounting for roughly 7% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. What’s more, it’s a difficult industry to clean up, with huge traditional players and expensive equipment and infrastructure to replace. This funding was supposed to help address those difficulties, by supporting projects on the cusp of commercialization. Now companies will need to fill in the gap left by these cancellations, and it’s a big one.

First up on the list for cuts is Sublime Systems, a company you’re probably familiar with if you’ve been reading this newsletter for a while. I did a deep dive last year, and the company was on our list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in both 2023 and 2024.

The startup’s approach is to make cement using electricity. The conventional process requires high temperatures typically achieved by burning fossil fuels, so avoiding that could prevent a lot of emissions.

In 2024, Sublime received an $87 million grant from the DOE to construct a commercial demonstration plant in Holyoke, Massachusetts. That grant would have covered roughly half the construction costs for the facility, which is scheduled to open in 2026 and produce up to 30,000 metric tons of cement each year.

“We were certainly surprised and disappointed about the development,” says Joe Hicken, Sublime’s senior VP of business development and policy. Customers are excited by the company’s technology, Hicken adds, pointing to Sublime’s recently announced deal with Microsoft, which plans to buy up to 622,500 metric tons of cement from the company.

Another big name, Brimstone, also saw its funding affected. That award totaled $189 million for a commercial demonstration plant, which was expected to produce over 100,000 metric tons of cement annually.

In a statement, a Brimstone representative said the company believes the cancellation was a “misunderstanding.” The statement pointed out that the planned facility would make not only cement but also alumina, supporting US-based aluminum production. (Aluminum is classified as a critical mineral by the US Geological Survey, meaning it’s considered crucial to the US economy and national security.)

An award to Heidelberg Materials for up to $500 million for a planned Indiana facility was also axed. The idea there was to integrate carbon capture and storage to clean up emissions from the plant, which would have made it the first cement plant in the US to demonstrate that technology. In a written statement, a representative said the decision can be appealed, and the company is considering that option.

And National Cement’s funding for the Lebec Net-Zero Project, another $500 million award, was canceled. That facility planned to make carbon-neutral cement through a combination of strategies: reducing the polluting ingredients needed, using alternative fuels like biomass, and capturing the plant’s remaining emissions.

“We want to emphasize that this project will expand domestic manufacturing capacity for a critical industrial sector, while also integrating new technologies to keep American cement competitive,” said a company spokesperson in a written statement.

There’s a sentiment here that’s echoed in all the responses I received: While these awards were designed to cut emissions, these companies argue that they can fit into the new administration’s priorities. They’re emphasizing phrases like “critical minerals,” “American jobs,” and “domestic supply chains.”

“We’ve heard loud and clear from the Trump administration the desire to displace foreign imports of things that can be made here in America,” Sublime’s Hicken says. “At the end of the day, what we deliver is what the policymakers in DC are looking for.”

But this administration is showing that it’s not supporting climate efforts—often even those that also advance its stated goals of energy abundance and American competitiveness.

On Monday, my colleague James Temple published a new story about cuts to climate research, including tens of millions of dollars in grants from the National Science Foundation. Researchers at Harvard were particularly hard hit.

Even as there’s interest in advancing the position of the US on the world’s stage, these cuts are making it hard for researchers and companies alike to do the crucial work of understanding our climate and developing and deploying new technologies.

Other automakers have publicly said the new restrictions on the manufacturing credit go too far.
The House-passed reconciliation bill would bar companies that license Chinese technology from claiming the manufacturing credit.
That panel was hosted by Jennifer Safavian, the president and CEO of Autos Drive America, a separate trade group representing international automakers that sometimes diverges from the Alliance.
“Overall, the North American content of our battery supply chain will increase eightfold between now and 2028,” Kelty said.","But even as the Senate has moved quickly to take up the bill, the Alliance has yet to take a public stance because its members have failed to reach consensus on changes to a key tax credit claimed by automakers for producing EV batteries, according to the four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal dynamics.

The House-passed megabill would largely sunset the $7,500 consumer EV tax credit and a provision that allows leased EVs to qualify for the credit by the end of the year. It would also impose severe “foreign entity of concern” restrictions on the advanced manufacturing production credit, known as 45X, that companies in a range of industries have said will render the credit unusable.

While most automakers in the trade group are urging the Senate to loosen the 45X restrictions passed by the House, General Motors largely supports them because it believes its current supply chain is set up to comply, the people said.

A GM spokesperson told POLITICO in a statement that the “strengthened [foreign entity of concern] restrictions in the House bill validate the importance” of its efforts to shift manufacturing to the United States.

“GM has been investing in a resilient critical minerals and battery supply chain to support American innovation, manufacturing and economic security,” the spokesperson said. GM’s position on the House language has not previously been reported.

Automakers, especially the Detroit Three and their international competitors, have long diverged on some policy issues, making it difficult for the industry to present a united front. The Alliance, which was formed in 2020 out of a merger of two auto trade groups, has nearly four dozen members including battery manufacturers and suppliers.

But in this case, GM is the outlier, according to three of the people. Other automakers have publicly said the new restrictions on the manufacturing credit go too far.

At a conference last week, Ford Motor Co. Executive Chair Bill Ford said the foreign entity of concern restrictions would “imperil” Ford’s under-construction battery plant in Marshall, Michigan, and the 1,700 jobs it is set to create.

Ford plans to use licensed Chinese technology for the advanced batteries it produces at the plant, which the automaker says is the only option to produce the batteries on U.S. soil as opposed to buying them from China.

But Republicans have long targeted the plant with legislation and investigations because of the licensing agreement with the Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. The House-passed reconciliation bill would bar companies that license Chinese technology from claiming the manufacturing credit.

Beyond Ford, a number of international automakers have called for changes to the foreign entity of concern rules.

Donald Davidson, head of federal affairs and political strategy at Volkswagen Group of America, said during a panel discussion at Benchmark’s Giga minerals conference Tuesday that the language is “so complex that I don’t know who, at the moment, could comply.”

Phillip Sherman, senior manager of international and industry affairs at Mercedes Benz, told the panel his company and other automakers would make an all-out effort to secure changes to the 45X language in the Senate. “We’re gonna leave it on the field,” he said.

That panel was hosted by Jennifer Safavian, the president and CEO of Autos Drive America, a separate trade group representing international automakers that sometimes diverges from the Alliance.

One of the people who is familiar with the lobbying efforts on the manufacturing credit said GM is “undermining the other automobile companies to try and gain a competitive advantage based upon their present supply chain.”

“The indictment of it all is by doing that, you might be helping GM in the short term, but what you’re really helping is the Chinese auto manufacturers [to gain] a foothold in the global auto marketplace and preventing U.S. companies from being able to compete on a level playing field with China,” the person said.

But Kurt Kelty, vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability at GM, told the Benchmark conference Tuesday that the automaker has already become the largest producer of battery cells in North America and plans to invest even further.

“Overall, the North American content of our battery supply chain will increase eightfold between now and 2028,” Kelty said. “We’re building not just better batteries, but a stronger, more resilient U.S. industry for the future.”

A spokesperson for the Alliance said in a statement the organization has been engaged with both chambers of Congress on the megabill, including on credits for consumer EVs, leased EVs and manufacturing.

“What we’ve communicated to the House (and now the Senate) during the process to date is this: The overwhelming majority of our members support the extension of 30D, 45W and 45X because of their importance to the health and competitiveness of the auto industry in America,” the Alliance spokesperson said.",https://static.politico.com/7f/7a/133775524be8931e06b3dc6bf9a8/trump-tariffs-evs-95875.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 05:05:54.032430

These collaborations help manufacturers align product development with regional regulatory requirements and grid modernization initiatives, ensuring long-term relevance in a shifting energy landscape.

Lastly, retrofitting and life extension programs have become central to maintaining market presence. As new coal-fired plant construction declines, companies are increasingly focused on upgrading existing turbines to meet efficiency and environmental standards, allowing operators to extend asset lifecycles without full replacement.

RECENT MARKET DEVLEOPMENTS

In February 2024, General Electric (GE Vernova) launched an updated line of ultra-supercritical steam turbines optimized for North American coal and gas-fired power plants, aiming to enhance efficiency and support emissions reduction goals for aging thermal fleets.

In May 2024, Siemens Energy announced a collaboration with a leading U.S. utility to retrofit multiple coal-fired power stations with digitally enabled steam turbines, improving reliability and compliance with evolving environmental standards.

In July 2024, Mitsubishi Power introduced a new steam turbine service center in Houston, Texas, designed to provide localized technical support, spare parts logistics, and field engineering services for power plant operators across North America.

In September 2024, Baker Hughes entered into a strategic alliance with a Canadian industrial energy firm to deploy compact steam turbines for cogeneration applications in the pulp and paper sector, expanding its presence in industrial energy solutions.

In November 2024, Ansaldo Energia acquired a U.S.-based turbine control systems developer to enhance its digital capabilities, integrating real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance features into its steam turbine offerings for North American customers.

One example, he said, was Amazon’s partnership with Entergy to service its $10 billion investment in two data center complexes in Mississippi.","Dive Brief:

Amazon and Google are trying to remain nimble as their electricity demands increase steeply during a period of political uncertainty and technological evolution for the energy sector, division heads for the hyperscalers said during a Wednesday panel at the American Council on Renewable Energy’s Finance Forum.

As Google attempts to meet a goal of operating on 100% carbon-free energy by 2030, the company is making investments in emerging generation sources like geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors in an attempt to accelerate them, said Will Conkling, Google’s head of data center energy, Americas. “But even at Google, we can't wish things to be true, right? We have to deal with the reality of technology and commercialization curves.”

“It's going to take a mix of everything to really reach the capacity that we need as a nation,” said Jessica Johnson, director of offtake at CleanCapital. “Not just for data centers, but for the entire demand.”

Dive Insight:

The last five years have been tumultuous for the renewable energy industry, Johnson said, and recently the sector has seen added uncertainty resulting from President Trump’s tariffs as well as a House-passed budget bill that would slash most tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act.

As a result, she said many energy buyers that don’t have the resources of Amazon or Google have been “shying away” from renewables and wanting to see “what else is out there.” However, Johnson said, fast-deploying generation like solar and storage still has a place when weighed against resources that are slower to bring online, like nuclear.

Conkling said he doesn’t see the challenge of responding to demand growth from data centers as one that can be met by a one-size-fits-all solution. He said that when there is growth, “the system has always basically looked at … building new gas,” but “I think we have to be careful that we don't over-generalize the solution to the growth question.”

“It's tailored responses to tailored problems,” Conkling said. “When we start to say, ‘well, the grid needs energy, and the solution is X,’ we're papering over a lot of detail and a lot of nuance, that actually probably leads us to the suboptimal.”

For instance, while data center loads on their own are too large to be handled by distributed resources, the deployment of distributed resources across a grid can ease constraints and free up transmission capacity overall, he said.

Conkling said Google’s strategy “is generally to be a grid-tied customer, we see that as being a great benefit to us, and also being very much front and center as being part of the solution for how the grids grow and how Google grows and how the economy grows.”

“We think electricity growth on the system is actually not a threat, it's an opportunity for us and for the country and for utilities and states,” he said. “Infrastructure growth has always been a huge driver of economic growth in this country, and electricity growth on the system has always been a very big indicator of GDP growth, economic growth, and quality of life.”

Craig Sundstrom, Amazon’s Americas head of energy and sustainability public policy, said customers are the ones driving the demand for Amazon’s cloud services — and, as a result, driving the company’s increasing electricity demand.

“But our customers also want [Amazon Web Services] to be clean, which is why nothing's changed in terms of our own commitment to hitting that longer-term target of net zero by 2040,” he said.

Sundstrom said that Amazon sees its role in the energy system as that of a customer, not a project developer, but that the company is — like Google — working to advance new technologies like small modular reactors, “putting capital up for a technology that has still not yet been deployed.”

“I think we're seeing that it's going to take a mix [of generation],” Sundstrom said, and creative solutions to address growing demand.

In an interview, Van Drew said he was “disappointed” the large tax bill altered the nuclear tax credit, adding that the federal approval process for new nuclear plants should be faster.","WASHINGTON — A tax package on track to pass both chambers of Congress would raise electricity prices, accelerate the release of heat-trapping greenhouse gases and undercut low-emission energy investments, according to researchers who have analyzed the legislation.

This week the Senate took up the bill that narrowly cleared the House in May and would deliver deep cuts to federal aid programs, including two lifelines for the poor — Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly called “food stamps.”

Beyond cutting federal assistance programs, the bill would end an array of federal tax credits for renewable energy sources including solar and wind power, as well as hydrogen production and nuclear energy.

This broad repeal of federal tax credits would land after electricity rates in New Jersey are expected to go up 20 to 30%, starting this month.

Without these tax credits, which are part of a 2022 climate, tax and health-care law called the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, power companies would likely add fewer projects to the electrical grid, in turn making electricity more scarce and more expensive — in other words, bowing to the economics of supply and demand.

Who will pay?

Overall, the bill would raise “national average retail electricity rates and monthly household electricity bills by about 9% in 2030,” researchers at Princeton University concluded.

The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that advises Congress, said Wednesday the bill would cost $2.4 trillion over the next decade.

Another group, Energy Innovation, found repealing existing federal tax credits could increase “annual household energy costs in New Jersey (including electricity and fuel expenses) by nearly $10 per year in 2030 and more than $30 per year in 2035,” while analysts at the nonpartisan Resources for the Future said repealing Biden-era tax credits could increase electricity bills annually $75 to $100.

Those predicted increases would be added to the already rising costs for electricity customers.

How NJ Congress members voted

The overall bill passed the House on May 23, with members of New Jersey’s delegation to Congress split along party lines. Republican lawmakers Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd), Chris Smith (R-4th) and Tom Kean (R-7th) voted for the bill, arguing it will keep Medicaid solvent by removing undocumented immigrants from enrollment.

Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid and they are barred from coverage through the insurance marketplaces created in the 2010 federal health law, often called Obamacare.

Every Democrat elected to Congress, from New Jersey and beyond, voted against the bill, zeroing in on its cuts to Medicaid and food benefits — and the tax cuts expected to flow disproportionately to the wealthy.

Passage in the Senate is likely because Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, though if lawmakers in that chamber make any change, no matter how small, the bill would have to pass the House again before President Donald Trump can sign it into law.

Long-term costs

The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that advises Congress, said Wednesday the bill would cost $2.4 trillion over the next decade.

In its current form, the legislation would make dozens of changes to energy tax credits in place in current law.

It would phase out two tax credits for individuals to make their homes more energy-efficient at the end of 2026; they were scheduled to expire in 2033.

Van Drew, whose district includes three nuclear reactors the energy company PSEG runs, has pushed to maintain the tax credit for nuclear power, formally called 45U.

It would weaken a tax credit for nuclear-power plants and phase it out by 2032.

And it would end a tax credit for “clean hydrogen” production at the end of this calendar year, seven years earlier than Congress intended when it wrote the 2022 law.

That change to the hydrogen tax credit poses a threat to seven projects, known as “hydrogen hubs,” including the proposed regional project between Southeastern Pennsylvania, Delaware and South Jersey.

These hubs were a point of emphasis for the Biden administration. It’s unclear if the Trump administration will continue funding all of them.

Van Drew disappointed

Van Drew, whose district includes three nuclear reactors the energy company PSEG runs, has pushed to maintain the tax credit for nuclear power, formally called 45U.

“Maintaining the 45U tax credit for existing nuclear plants is essential to preserving and strengthening this clean and reliable energy source,” Van Drew told members of the House tax-writing committee in January.

In an interview, Van Drew said he was “disappointed” the large tax bill altered the nuclear tax credit, adding that the federal approval process for new nuclear plants should be faster.

“I was disappointed in that, and I’ve expressed that,” Van Drew told NJ Spotlight News. Nuclear power is a great option, he said. “Regardless of what you think about all these different forms of energy, there’s no question that nuclear should have a role, that we should permit it faster.”

It can take decades for federal authorities to fully permit a new nuclear power plant.

“There’s no reason permitting can’t be done in five years. It’s clean. There’s no carbon footprint, why aren’t we doing it?” Van Drew said.

Knock-on effects

The broad legislation would ramp up greenhouse gas emissions, increase average annual energy costs $100 to $160 per household in 2030 and cut domestic investment in domestic electricity and “clean fuels” production by $1 trillion over the next decade, according to researchers with Princeton’s REPEAT Project.

It would also lower the sales of plug-in electric vehicles by about 40% in 2030 and “imperil a total of $522 billion in announced but pending investments” in domestic clean-energy manufacturing, they found.

‘Forget about the climate aspect of it, but if you ostensibly believe in “America First” and want American manufacturing, what they’re doing by repealing those tax credits is the exact opposite.’ — Rep. Dan Goldman (NY)

“Current federal policies, such as clean energy tax credits, grants, loans, and standards accelerate clean energy project deployment and electric vehicle sales in New Jersey,” analysts at Energy Innovation said. “But repealing these policies would force New Jersey households to pay higher electricity bills because less low-cost clean energy is being built, while fewer EVs on the road would force consumers to spend more on gasoline.”

National electricity prices will rise 13% on average between 2022 and 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a recent forecast, adding that people in Mid-Atlantic states, such as New Jersey, could see electric price increases “more than the national average.”

Republicans who may balk

Some Republican senators are balking at the cuts to energy tax credits in the legislation.

In an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota who leads the chamber, four Republicans, including Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, who has a history of voting against Trump, said a “wholesale repeal” of energy tax credits from the 2022 law or a more limited repeal would create “uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.”

Since the 2022 law was enacted, 2,369 new “manufacturing, utility-scale clean electricity, and industrial decarbonization facilities” have opened, according to the Rhodium Group, a nonpartisan organization that studies energy and climate policy.

That law spurred new energy jobs in many Trump-friendly states, including about 13,000 in Texas, more than 12,500 in Georgia and roughly 7,500 in North Carolina, according to Rhodium.

Politically, Democrats see an opening.

“What we see here is them devaluing all the long-term investments, whether it’s in clean energy” or other fields, Rep. Dave Min, a Democrat from Southern California, told NJ Spotlight News recently. “This is the opposite of long-term thoughtful economic policy.”

Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, had similar thoughts.

“This desire to repeal the energy credits in the IRA is going to cost hundreds of thousands of Americans jobs and hundreds of billions of investments in American manufacturing, the majority of which are in red districts,” Goldman said of the 2022 law.

“Forget about the climate aspect of it, but if you ostensibly believe in ‘America First’ and want American manufacturing, what they’re doing by repealing those tax credits is the exact opposite,” Goldman said.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/06/Sen.-Marsha-Blackburn-senate-tax-bill.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 05:05:58.237388

The agreement will support the continued operation of the Clinton Clean Energy Center, a 1,121-megawatt reactor that powers around 800,000 homes, according to a report by Reuters. Without this deal, the plant was at risk of closure in 2027, when an existing state-funded subsidy programme is set to expire.

The move comes as Big Tech faces growing pressure to secure reliable, low-carbon energy sources to power data centres and support the energy demands of artificial intelligence (AI). Meta's long-term power purchase will effectively replace the public support the plant has been receiving and may also help Constellation obtain a renewed operating licence from federal regulators through 2047, states Reuters.

According to the report, Urvi Parekh, Meta's global head of energy, said utilities want confidence that existing plants will continue operating, especially as electricity needs surge. US power demand is rising for the first time in decades, largely due to the boom in AI and the rapid expansion of data infrastructure.

While financial terms were not disclosed, multi-decade power purchase agreements typically run into billions of dollars. The deal also gives Constellation the option to expand the Clinton plant's capacity by 30 megawatts.

Industry analysts say this could be the first of many similar arrangements between tech firms and nuclear providers. Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation, confirmed the company is in talks with other potential clients across the country.

The North Sea is stood at crossroads, caught between two stories. For decades it has served as a powerhouse of northern European economies, providing jobs, stability and energy security. In recent years, with oil and gas production in decline, the pen was poised to write the North Sea’s final chapter, yet with offshore wind taking centre stage, the region is primed for a must watch sequel, this time as the green power plant of Europe.

With ambitious targets to reach 120GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 300GW by 2050, the North Sea could soon supply over half of Europe's renewable energy. The opportunity is highly compelling. In fact, research suggests that closer cooperation on the clean energy transition in the North Sea could lower bills, create up to 51,000 jobs, and add up to £36 billion to the UK economy alone.

But achieving this transformation will require more than just technology innovation and investment; it demands the region reimagine its own future and continue to embrace change. To successfully deliver these ambitions, industry must usher in an era of unprecedented collaboration across borders, companies, and disciplines.

A new era of collaboration

The signing of the UK-Norway Green Industrial Partnership is a positive first step towards greater collaboration. In summary, as Norwegian Minister of Trade and Industry Cecilie Myrseth put it at the signing in May: ""By combining Norwegian and British strengths, we can create jobs, develop new industries, and enhance our competitiveness"".

The Partnership reorientates the two countries’ longstanding North Sea relationship to support clean energy investment in the region, fostering dialogue and collaboration on offshore wind, grid integration, protecting offshore infrastructure and the cross-border storage of carbon dioxide.

The initiative will build on existing private industry collaborations, for instance, the 500MW Siravind floating offshore wind project – a joint venture between RES and our Norwegian partner Zephyr. Sourcing world-leading expertise from project partners in different countries, the joint venture plans to establish a floating offshore wind project as part of Utsira Nord.

In a further call to action, over 60 companies recently signed Wind Europe’s New Offshore Wind Deal Proposal, which calls on European governments to address the barriers to developing a homegrown offshore wind industry. The Deal asks governments to commit to 100GW of two-sided Contracts for Difference (CfDs) over 10 years and to undertake cross-border planning to ensure consistent project commissioning. This could be supported by a further 5GW a year financed by corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).

This level of commitment would provide the stability needed for the industry to invest in the projects, manufacturing capacity and people needed to meet the committed volumes while reducing the cost of electricity by 30% towards 2040 for consumers and businesses.",https://www.renewableuk.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-05 06:05:03.404411

Companies canceled $4.5 billion in investments in new battery, electric vehicle, and wind projects in April alone. These cancellations occurred before the U.S. House’s passage of a massive tax and spending package, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” that could kill federal clean energy tax credits.

E2 also tracked an additional $1.5 billion in newly found canceled projects from the previous months.

Republican congressional districts benefited the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022. Through April, Republican congressional districts hosted over 61% of all clean energy projects, 72% of all the jobs, and 82% of all the investments.

These districts are experiencing the highest number of job cancellations, with over $12 billion and more than 13,000 jobs eliminated as of now.

However, E2 said companies continue to invest in the U.S.’s clean economy potential despite the rising cancellations.

In April, businesses announced nearly $500 million in investments for new solar, electric vehicles, and grid and transmission equipment factories across six states. These investments include a $400 million investment by Corning to expand a solar wafer factory in Michigan, which is expected to create 400 new jobs.

Another major investment is from a Canadian solar equipment manufacturer, valued at $9.3 million, for a new plant in North Carolina.

Seven projects were announced in April. These projects, when combined, are expected to create approximately 3,000 jobs upon completion.

E2 said April’s project announcements increase the overall energy projects it is tracking to 390 across 42 states and Puerto Rico. Companies said they target investing roughly $132 billion in the projects and hiring 123,000 permanent workers. However, these numbers reflect ongoing revisions and updates.

A total of 45 announced projects have been canceled, closed, or downsized since the U.S. Congress passed the federal clean energy tax credits in August 2022. The abandoned projects encompassed nearly 20,000 jobs and $16.7 billion in investments.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are canceled. Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country,” said Michael Timberlake, Communications Director, E2.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs,” he said.

Its deal for the Clinton plant comes eight months after Microsoft Corp. also signed a deal for power from Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant.
The Meta deal marks a significant turnaround for the Clinton plant, which has enough to power about 1 million homes.
“It was not clear who would buy electricity from this power plant,” Parekh said in an interview.","Constellation Energy Corp. has agreed to sell power from an Illinois nuclear plant to Meta Platforms Inc. as artificial intelligence sends power demand soaring.

The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp signed a 20-year contract to buy 1,121 megawatts from the Clinton plant starting in mid-2027, when a state subsidy expires, according to a statement Tuesday. Constellation, the biggest U.S. nuclear operator, and Meta didn’t provide financial details.

Under the deal, Constellation will invest in boosting Clinton’s output. The company is also considering plans to build another reactor at Clinton, which already has federal approval for a second unit.

“It’s a logical place for us to talk to Meta, and to others, about potentially building the next generation of assets,” Constellation Chief Executive Officer Joe Dominguez said in an interview. “Those conversations are well under way.”

Nuclear power has emerged as one of the biggest winners from the AI-fueled surge in electricity demand. While the tech industry is also using solar and wind power, their intermittent nature means stable electricity supplies generated by nuclear reactors — but also coal and natural gas — is in high demand. Atomic power has the added benefit of not emitting planet-warming air pollution.

Meta is contracting for more power after the company’s total electricity consumption nearly tripled from 2019 to 2023. Its deal for the Clinton plant comes eight months after Microsoft Corp. also signed a deal for power from Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant. Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are investing in small-scale reactors. Sam Altman recently stepped down as chairman of his nuclear company, Oklo Inc., to clear a path for OpenAI to do business with it.

Shares of Constellation surged up to 9.1% on Tuesday. Other nuclear-related stocks jumped: Vistra Corp. rose as much as 5.1% and Oklo gained as much as 12%. Meta was up as much as 0.7% before erasing early gains to trade lower.

While Big Tech’s power bills represent just a fraction of the industry’s overall expenses, their enormous power demand means those companies play an outsized role in driving growth in energy demand — not just for zero-emissions nuclear operators but across all energy resources including natural gas.

The tech giants’ environmental reports last year pointed to an overall jump in electricity demand across energy resources, with Microsoft’s emissions soaring by 30% and Google’s by nearly 50% from years earlier. Microsoft has admitted that its AI push is jeopardizing a long-held goal to be carbon negative by 2030. But tech executives including Altman have warned that, without more breakthroughs in energy technologies, the world won’t have enough supply to sustain the AI boom.

While there’s also strong interest from technology companies in new reactors, power producers are wary of committing to a major nuclear investment after Southern Co. last year completed its Vogtle project in Georgia years behind schedule and more than double its budget.

A major tech company could provide the support that would prompt Constellation to move forward with a new reactor, Dominguez said, a decision that would be a significant advance for the industry. He’s evaluating a broad range of potential technologies for the site, from small reactors that are still under development to the big AP1000 design that Southern installed in Georgia.

The Meta deal marks a significant turnaround for the Clinton plant, which has enough to power about 1 million homes. Then-owner Exelon Corp. had threatened to close the site in 2017 as nuclear operators around the U.S. struggled to compete with cheap natural gas and renewables. The company changed course after Illinois approved a 10-year subsidy.

Constellation has other Illinois nuclear plants receiving state subsidies that are set to expire in the next several years, and Dominguez said he’s talking to multiple customers about additional deals similar to the Meta contract. He said there may be a completed agreement in the next six to 12 months.

The contract is Meta’s largest power deal to date, according to Urvi Parekh, the company’s global head of energy. The company is increasingly interested in nuclear to run its operations, and in December announced it was seeking proposals for as much as 4 gigawatts of new U.S. reactors. So far it’s received about 50 proposals from a range of companies, including Constellation.

That initiative is aimed as bringing power onto the grid in the early 2030s, while the Clinton deal is seen as a near-term effort. With the subsidies set to expire, Meta and Constellation said they wanted to ensure the plant remained competitive.

“It was not clear who would buy electricity from this power plant,” Parekh said in an interview. “We want to make sure that this location continues to be a site where nuclear operates and it’s going to give Constellation the ability to start thinking creatively about how they could expand capacity here in the future.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ctc-l-meta-headquarter.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-06-05 04:02:33.952517

Commentators and economists estimate the Act, if passed by the Senate and signed into law by President Trump, may have a net cost of $3.8 trillion over 10 years, and would increase the federal statutory debt limit by $4 trillion.

Overall, the Act would prevent tax increases on 62% of taxpayers that would occur if the sunsetting provisions of the TCJA were permitted to expire. However, the introduction of certain narrowly targeted tax provisions and ultimately sunsetting pro-growth provisions, like bonus depreciation and research and development expensing, could spur economic growth.

As the Senate returns from recess on June 2nd to make its own amendments and possibly finalize the bill, it is vital for individuals, business owners, and advisors to evaluate the impact of the Act’s key provisions that could result in changes to effective tax rates for U.S. taxpayers. Taxpayers, business owners, and advisors should understand how the Act encourages certain business investments, curtails other types of investment, impacts the taxation of international business operations conducted by U.S. persons, and accelerates the phase-out date of certain Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) clean energy tax credits.

Congressional leaders have set a goal of sending a final version of the Act to President Trump before Congress begins its July 4th recess. This means the House and Senate will have to agree on a final identical version of the Act that was independently approved by both chambers. This alert provides an overview of the Act and explains where it stands in the legislative process.

Key TCJA Provision Extenders and Amendments

The Act extends or amends several key provisions of the TCJA that would otherwise sunset at the end of 2025. The major extensions and expansions include:

Individual Taxpayers

Individual Income Tax Rate Reductions (Section 1(j)): The Act seeks to permanently extend the lower tax rates and thresholds for individuals, estates, and trusts established by the TCJA, with the highest tax rate being 37% (as opposed to the pre-TCJA rate of 39.6%). These brackets would continue to be adjusted for inflation but would maintain the existing rates.

Child Tax Credit (Section 24(h)): The Act extends the increased child tax credit, with an increase from $2,000 to $2,500 per qualifying child for 2025 through 2028. The proposal requires Social Security numbers to be provided and that all individuals claiming the credit be U.S. citizens (or have other specified legal status).

Standard Deduction (Section 63(c)(7)): The TCJA’s standard deduction changes would be increased for certain taxpayers for 2025 through 2028. The Act proposes a standard deduction of $16,000 for single filers; $24,000 for the heads of household; and $32,000 for married joint filers.

SALT Deduction Cap (Section 164(b)(6)): The $10,000 cap on individuals’ state and local tax (SALT) deductions, would be increased to $40,000 ($20,000 in the case of married individuals filing separately) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024. The cap would be reduced for individuals with income above $500,000 ($250,000 in the case of married individuals filing separately), but not below $10,000 ($5,000 in the case of a married individual filing separately). This cap is set to increase by 1% each year from 2026 through 2033, providing incremental relief to taxpayers in high-tax states.

Mortgage Interest Deduction (Section163(h)): The Act permanently disallows any mortgage interest deduction for home equity indebtedness and generally permits interest deductions for acquisition indebtedness up to $750,000 ($375,000 for married individuals filing separately).

Alternative Minimum Tax (“AMT”) Exemption (Section 55(d)): The increased AMT exemption amounts and phaseout thresholds from the TCJA are made permanent. The AMT exemption amount for single filers is $88,100 and starts to phase out at $626,350. The AMT exemption amount for married filers is $137,000 and starts to phase out at $1,252,700.

Qualified Opportunity Zones (Sections 1400Z, 6039K, 6939L, 6726): The Act creates a new round of opportunity zone (“OZ”) investment opportunities for capital gains (and up to $10,000 of ordinary income) invested in OZs after 2026 and before 2034, with a focus on revitalizing rural OZs. The Act would allow for deferral of invested gain and income, while requiring enhanced information reporting and filing obligations for OZ investments and increased penalties for noncompliance.

Estate and Gift Tax Exclusion Thresholds (Section 2010(c)(3)(C)): The current elevated exclusion thresholds for estate and gift taxes would be extended and increased, with the exclusions increased to $15 million for single filers, and $30 million for married couples starting in 2026.

Business Taxpayers

Pass-Through Business Income Deduction (Section 199A): The 20% deduction for qualified business income from pass-through entities is made permanent and increased to 23%. The revised provision extends the deduction to certain qualified interest dividends from qualified business development companies.

Limitation on Excess Business Losses of Noncorporate Taxpayers (Section 461(l)): The Act permanently extends the disallowance of a deduction for excess business losses and applies to losses arising in tax years after 2025. Further, the carryover rule is amended to treat losses carried forward as an excess business loss rather than as a net operating loss.

Interest Deduction Limits (Section 163(j)): Currently, business interest deductions are capped at 30% of the entity’s “adjusted taxable income.” The Act modifies the calculation of “adjusted taxable income” to the pre-2022 methodology. This change would allow businesses to earn greater benefits from interest deductions.

Bonus Depreciation for Qualified Property (Section 168(k)): The Act reinstates 100% bonus depreciation for property acquired after January 19, 2025, and placed in service after such date, but before 2030, as well as for specified plants that are planted or grafted within this timeframe.

R&E Expensing (Sections 174 and 174A): The Act suspends the current requirement to capitalize and amortize domestic-only research and experimental (“R&E”) expenditures for amounts paid or incurred after 2024 but before 2030. This would mean that taxpayers could choose to (i) immediately deduct R&E expenditures; (ii) elect to capitalize and recover such expenditures over the useful life of the research (with a minimum period of 60 months); or (iii) elect to capitalize and recover expenditures over 10 years. Note that foreign R&E expenditures would continue to be amortized over 15 years.

International Tax Provisions

GILTI and FDII (Section 250(a)): The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) effective tax rate (applicable to U.S. shareholders of foreign corporations considered to be “Controlled Foreign Corporations” (“CFCs”)) is currently set to rise from 10.5% to 13.125% in 2026. Likewise, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) effective tax rate (which is both a component of the GILTI calculation and a separate export regime) is set to increase from 13.125% to 16.406%. The Act would extend the lower effective tax rates with slight modifications to the respective so-called percentage deductions related to a U.S. taxpayer’s GILTI inclusion and its FDII income. The proposed deduction for GILTI is decreased from 50% to 49.2% of a taxpayer’s GILTI inclusion (including its corresponding “gross up amount”) and from 37.5% to 36.5%. The small adjustments to GILTI and FDII rates raise revenue. Also, because the U.S. indirect foreign tax credit rules applicable to the GILTI calculation are not modified under the Act, the effective rate on GILTI is actually increased. The Act also corrects an error under the TCJA and would now exclude “qualified Virgin Islands services income” from GILTI.

Base Erosion & Anti-Abuse Tax Rate (Section 59A): The Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (the “BEAT”) regime applies to companies with average annual gross receipts of at least $500 million that make base-eroding deductible payments, such as interest, royalties, and certain intercompany payments to non-U.S. affiliates. The Act expands BEAT to include two rates, a standard 10.1% increase from 10%, and a Super BEAT rate of 12.5%, which could be applied to countries imposing “unfair foreign taxes, Digital Service Taxes, and diverted profits taxes.” Banks and certain financial institutions or service entities may be subject to an 11% BEAT rate. Additionally, there was a cap on deductible-related party payments (3% of all deductions). The proposed change to BEAT eliminates the 3% threshold on deductible-related party payments, resulting in the potential for triggering BEAT even for minor deductible payments, as part of the new U.S. Surtax, discussed below.

New Tax Provisions

In addition to extending and amending the TCJA provisions, the Act introduces several new tax provisions aimed at providing targeted tax relief, addressing policy priorities, and raising tax revenue.

Individual Taxpayers

No Tax on Qualifying Tips and Overtime (Section 225): Qualifying tips and overtime pay would not be subject to federal income tax. Both provisions would expire at the end of 2028.

No Tax on Car Loan Interest (Section 163(h)(3)(F)): The Act creates a deduction for interest paid on qualified car loans related to personal use vehicles that are made in the United States. This provision also expires at the end of 2028.

Enhanced Deduction for Seniors (Section 63(f)): The Act includes a deduction for seniors (age 65 or older) of $4,000 per eligible filer with a modified adjusted gross income that does not exceed $75,000 for single filers ($150,000 for married filing jointly). The senior deduction would be available to both itemizers and non-itemizers, with the deduction allowed for tax years between 2025 and 2028.

Business Taxpayers

Partial Structure Expensing (Section 168(n)): The Act introduces a 100% bonus depreciation deduction for qualified production property (“QPP”). QPP includes non-residential structures (such as commercial real estate) utilized as an integral part of qualified manufacturing, agricultural, chemical production, or refining of a qualified product. The QPP must be placed into service in the U.S. before January 1, 2033, provided that construction begins between January 19, 2025, and January 1, 2029. Note that under the Act, if QPP is disposed of at a gain the taxpayer would be required to recapture 100% of the depreciation claimed as ordinary income if the property ceases to be utilized as an integral part of the qualified production activity with 10 years of being placed in service. This rate differs from the conventional real estate recapture rate of 25%.

Increased Small Business Expensing of Depreciable Assets (Section 179(b)): The Act increases the prior $1 million cost limitation of qualifying property to $2.5 million, and increases the limitation reduction amount under Section 179(b)(2) from $2.5 million to $4 million, for property placed in service in tax years beginning after December 31, 2024. Thus, the Act makes it easier for small businesses to immediately deduct the cost of qualifying property.

Curtailing SALT Deduction Cap (Section 164(b)(6)) Workarounds: The Act closes the workarounds on state and local tax (“SALT”) deductions for pass-through businesses, partially overturning 2020 IRS guidance that allowed for certain SALT deduction workarounds. However, some workarounds would still be permitted for specific types of businesses.

U.S. Surtax on Certain Foreign Payments (Section 899): The Act would increase applicable withholding taxes and gross-basis tax rates on foreign payments made to certain countries by 5% per year, and in some cases, up to a maximum rate of 20% above the typical statutory rate. These increases would apply to payments of (i) U.S. sourced passive income (known as FDAP), (ii) income from the sale of U.S. real estate assets or real estate investment trusts (REITs), and related partnership distributions, (iii) income that is connected with an active U.S. business and related branch profits tax, and (iv) private foundation investment income. As alluded to above, this new provision (i) eliminates the $500 million gross receipts and 3% base erosion percentage threshold applicable under the BEAT regime, (ii) disallows and modifies deductibility and capitalization rules that would otherwise be applicable to certain foreign payments, and (iii) overall results in increasing the BEAT rate to 12.5% on U.S. companies with shareholders from applicable countries who own more than 50% of the vote or value of such corporations. The new U.S. Surtax could impact not just non-U.S. corporations, but partnerships, trusts, and private foundations. The rule contains a “Majority U.S. Owner Exception” that would generally apply to U.S. multinationals and U.S. funds owning a majority stake in non-U.S. corporations. It is unclear whether this new rule would apply to income that is otherwise exempt from U.S. tax, like portfolio interest.

Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) Changes: To help pay for the tax cut extensions, the Act repeals certain clean energy credits for projects that begin 60 days after its enactment, phases out the advanced manufacturing credit, limits credit access to foreign entities of concern, and eliminates certain clean vehicle credits. Note that bonus credit rates under the IRA applicable to certain credits remain intact. Taxpayers can still benefit from higher credit amounts by satisfying the requirements for prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, domestic content requirements, and other location-based incentives.

Tax-Exempt Organizations

Excise Tax on Private Colleges’ & Universities’ Investment Income (Section 4968): The Act replaces the endowment excise tax on applicable educational institutions with a new rate structure, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025. The amount of tax imposed on an applicable educational institution for each tax year would be equal to the applicable percentages of the net investment income for such year. The Act makes other modifications to the current endowment excise tax provision, including amending the definition of an eligible student by including only students eligible for federal financial aid (i.e., to exclude certain foreign students). The applicable percentages are as follows:

1.4% in the case of an institution with a student-adjusted endowment in excess of $500,000 and not in excess of $750,000;

7% in the case of an institution with a student-adjusted endowment in excess of $750,000 and not in excess of $1,250,000;

14% percent in the case of an institution with a student-adjusted endowment in excess of $1,250,000 and not in excess of $2,000,000; and

21% in the case of an institution with a student-adjusted endowment in excess of $2,000,000.

Tax on Net Investment Income of Private Foundations (Section 4940(a)): The Act increases the rate of tax on net investment income of certain private foundations, adding a progressive tax rate system for larger private foundations based on asset size.

Increasing unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) of Tax-exempt Entities (Section 512(a)(7)): The Act increases UBTI for amounts related to employer-provided qualified transportation fringes and facilities for qualified parking.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16319_2315.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:32:11.398643

I’m proud to have worked in tandem with my colleagues and President Trump to make good on a promise I made.

On May 22, Congress struck down a key aspect of the Biden Administration’s nationwide EV mandate under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). This is a win for American consumers and protects Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority over federal agencies and unelected bureaucratic overreach.

How did we get here?

More than 50 years ago, Congress allowed California to request a “wavier” from applicable federal air regulations. Congress provided California this tool because the state had extraordinarily poor air quality and unique challenges to control it. Recently, California has abused that discreet authority to set climate policy across the country.

In December of 2024, the lame duck Biden Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved California’s request to implement its “Advanced Clean Cars II” regulation when Democrats wouldn’t have to face voters over this politically toxic policy.

California’s ACC II waiver requires all vehicles sold in the state, Washington D.C., and the 11 other states that have adopted California’s standard to be zero emissions vehicles by 2035. This means in one decade that these states, totaling 30 percent of the nation’s new car market, will have a full ban on the sale of gasoline powered vehicles and traditional hybrids. These unattainable standards, backed by a fine of over $26,000 per vehicle for non-compliance, would reshape auto manufacturing and take away consumer choice across the country.

Only 2.3 percent of new vehicle registrations in West Virginia last year were EVs. Nationwide, EVs accounted for only 10.2 percent of new vehicle registrations. West Virginians don’t want California’s climate policy, and West Virginians don’t want California’s EV mandate. I’m confident that most Americans don’t want these things either.

The Biden EPA tried to avoid accountability from Congress by claiming their decision was not a rule and refusing to submit it to Congress under the CRA. Fortunately, President Trump corrected this by identifying the waiver as a rule and submitting it to Congress.

To protect American consumers and workers, as well as the Senate’s oversight authority of bad agency rules, I introduced a resolution under the CRA to reverse EPA’s California waiver. Using this statutory process allows members of the Senate and the House – the constitutionally elected representatives of all Americans – to decide whether a nationally significant agency rule should move forward.

After the rule was submitted to Congress, Senate Democrats who wanted to protect this EV mandate requested the Government Accountability Office (GAO) find the waiver was not a rule under the CRA. GAO has consistently found that once a rule is submitted by an agency, GAO does not issue an opinion. Despite its own precedent, GAO “observed” in a letter that the Biden EPA action approving California’s waiver was not a rule under the CRA, despite the agency’s submittal to Congress.

Democrats got this GAO letter to obstruct the Senate from exercising its authority provided by the CRA. Nothing in the plain text of the CRA, Senate Rules, or Senate precedents gives unelected staff at the GAO the authority to prevent the Senate from considering a resolution of disapproval against a rule that has been submitted to Congress.

Once an agency submits a rule to Congress, as EPA did here, elected representatives are able to decide whether to approve or disapprove of the rule. That is how the CRA and GAO precedent has functioned since its enactment in 1996 as a statutory exception to the Senate’s normal practice of unlimited debate. This allows Congress to realize the fundamental purpose of the CRA – oversight by elected representatives over unelected agencies.

Democrat Senators claim that our action undermines the legislative filibuster. That is simply untrue. Unlike my Democrat colleagues, I have supported the legislative filibuster as a Senator in the majority and as a Senator in the minority. The procedural action we have taken is not about the filibuster. Instead, the procedural action the Senate has taken is simply about whether GAO staff can violate its own precedent and have veto authority over elected officials’ ability to use the CRA against rules submitted to Congress by an agency. The answer is no.

Despite the best efforts of unelected bureaucrats in California, the Biden Administration, and congressional Democrats to shield this EV mandate from the will of the American people, Congress has rejected California’s attempt to impose an electric vehicle mandate that would have eliminated consumer choice, increased prices, and killed jobs across the country.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.newsandsentinel.com/images/2024/11/20211138/Image-From-a-Certain-Point-of-View-Op-Ed-1100x638.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 05:06:08.542351

Big Tech companies are looking to secure electricity as US power demand rises for the first time in two decades on demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

The deal will help keep open Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center which may have been forced to shut after the expiry in 2027 of an Illinois ratepayer-funded zero emissions credit program that awards benefits for generation of power virtually free of carbon emissions.

It depends on the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission renewing the plant’s license, after Constellation last year applied to renew it through 2047. Meta’s power purchase will replace the Illinois support and help with re-licensing and operations.

The deal could serve as a model for Big Tech companies to support existing nuclear plants while they also plan to power data centers with new nuclear and other energy sources.

Constellation Energy shares rose 5.7 per cent to US$330.93 in morning trading.

Financial details of the deal were not revealed, but such lengthy power purchase agreements tend to run to multi-billion dollars.

The deal also allows Constellation to expand Clinton, which has a capacity of 1,121 megawatts, by 30 MW. The plant powers the equivalent of about 800,000 US homes.

Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, said: “One of the things that we hear very acutely from utilities is they want to have certainty that power plants operating today will continue to operate.”

Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation, said, “We’re definitely having conversations with other clients, not just in Illinois, but really across the country, to step in and do what Meta has done, which is essentially give us a backstop so that we could make the investments needed to re-license these assets and keep them operating.”

Bobby Wendell, an official at a unit of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said the agreement will deliver a “stable work environment” for workers at the plant.

Evercore ISI analyst Nicholas Amicucci viewed the deal as “first of many” following President Donald Trump’s recent executive orders aimed to boost US nuclear capacity.

Independent power producers like Constellation have announced some of the biggest power deals in US history in the last year, as AI data centers are expected to drive U.S. electricity consumption to record highs in 2025 and 2026.

Last year, Constellation announced it had struck an agreement to restart a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to serve Microsoft data centers. The reactor, which is being prepped for a restart, requires various approvals.

Vistra Corp and NRG Energy have also announced major planned acquisitions in recent months.

The company is now on track to achieve its goal of 2.5 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 as part of its broader commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.

The projects, which include a mix of wind, solar, and pumped storage technologies, are expected to reduce over 6 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually—equivalent to the carbon sequestration of nearly 350 million trees each year. As the largest producer of energy transition metals and critical minerals in India, Vedanta plays a vital role in supporting the global shift towards renewable energy.

With an annual production capacity of over 4.5 million tonnes of materials like aluminium, zinc, copper, and nickel, the company’s products are crucial for the infrastructure needed for renewable energy, electric vehicles, and cutting-edge technologies. Vedanta’s focus on low-carbon products, including aluminium and zinc lines like Restora and EcoZen, is a key part of India’s push towards clean energy solutions.

Vedanta’s decarbonization efforts are driven by four key strategies: scaling up renewable energy, switching to low-carbon fuels, improving energy and process efficiency, and implementing carbon offsets. The company is currently running over 350 high-impact environmental initiatives across its business units.

Notable achievements include the utilization of 2.61 billion units of renewable energy, the deployment of lithium-ion forklifts and LNG-powered trucks, and the establishment of India’s largest torrefied bio-pellet manufacturing facility in Punjab.

According to WardsAuto, the fifth-generation model (G65) will ride on the familiar CLAR platform, but adopt several features from Neue Klasse vehicles. That’s a wise move considering a fully electric iX5 will join the lineup, which will also consist of gas, diesel, plug-in hybrid, and hydrogen powertrains.

According to the publication, the iX5 will have an advanced powertrain that has a 20% higher energy density as well as a 30% increase in range and charging speed compared to the “current technology used by BMW.” The crossover is also said to have a 40% reduction in energy loss, hinting at a huge efficiency boost.

The second-generation X7 (G67) is slated to follow in 2027 and should largely echo its smaller counterpart. However, it could be far sportier as the report says there will be an iX7 M70 with more than 800 hp (597 kW / 811 PS). It could eventually be joined by an Alpina variant packing around 900 hp (671 kW / 913 PS).

Despite modest sales, a new X6 (G66) is also planned and it’s rumored to spawn an electric iX6 in 2028. Little is known about the crossover coupe, but it should follow in the footsteps of the X5.

All three models are slated to be built in America thanks, in part, to a $1 billion investment in Spartanburg, South Carolina as well as a $700 million investment in a nearby battery plant.

While the US and European EV industries are primarily focused on domestic markets, both exported just under one-fifth of their domestic EV production in 2024.","Electric vehicles (EVs) have grown from a niche technology to a mainstream industry in the space of a little over a decade. EV deployment is crucial to meet climate targets and is transforming the automotive industry – a cornerstone of manufacturing in both the United States and Europe. Unlike China, the EU and US are particularly exposed to the EV transition with whole communities built on the back of internal combustion engine (ICE) technology.

The roll-out of EVs is driven by policy incentives, falling costs and shifting consumer preferences. To meet growing demand in the EU and US, companies are investing hugely across the EV value chain. Fresh competition comes from booming Chinese manufacturing capacity, which policymakers and companies are grappling with.

Based on an assessment of EV uptake in major regions – one in ten new vehicles in the US is an EV, compared to one in five in the EU, and one in two in China – we evaluate EV manufacturing investment in the EU and US at the project level, to provide a transatlantic perspective on the scale and pace of regional investment and what that means for EV production capacities. The data helps assess how invested the US and EU are in producing electric vehicles, and how exposed each is to Chinese competition.

EV sales

Global demand for EVs has accelerated since 2020. In China, sales and investment across the domestic EV supply chain took off in the late 2010s, driven by incentives for manufacturers and consumers. China now dominates the global EV market, with 65 percent of global sales in 2024, followed by Europe with 20 percent and the US with 10 percent.

European sales rose in 2019 after the EU passed legislation to ban the sale of new ICE vehicles by 2035, introducing annual fleet-wide CO2 emission targets for all new vehicles (Figure 1). Under pressure from auto manufacturers, in May 2025, the EU requirements were modified. Rather than requiring companies to meet annual CO₂ emissions targets for new cars in 2025, 2026 and 2027 separately, the rules now allow compliance to be assessed based on the average over those three years. While this somewhat weakens ambition and creates investment uncertainty, the 2035 target remains. Norway and the UK have similar phase-out plans with zero new-ICE sales from 2025 and 2030, respectively.

In the US, federal tailpipe standards and EV tax credits, coupled with state-level EV mandates, helped drive EV take-up in the late 2010s. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) expanded consumer EV tax credits.

Sales in China are dominated by ‘low-end’ vehicles priced under $40,000, while sales in Europe and the US are more concentrated in the premium segment (Figure 2). The average price of a Chinese EV is $35,100, compared to $56,800 in Europe and $59,100 in the US . Faced with limited EV models at an affordable price, many European and US consumers have continued to opt for conventional vehicles. Consumer preferences, coupled with the phase-out of subsidies in EU countries and policy uncertainty in the US, led to slowing sales growth in both regions in 2024.

Two-thirds of EVs sold in Europe and the US are produced locally – with local production referring to final assembly of vehicles, not earlier stages such as battery cell fabrication (Figure 3). Chinese-produced EVs are one-fifth of Europe’s market, with essentially no sales in the US. Domestically, China builds nearly everything it sells. In the rest of the world, where EV sales are rising quickly, China accounts for 40 percent of sales, with the US and Europe taking smaller slices.

EV manufacturing investments and production capacity

The US and Europe are global leaders in ICE manufacturing. Consequentially, the auto industries in the US and Europe have developed strong political constituencies relatively insulated from overseas competition, giving US and European automakers weaker incentives to invest in novel EV technologies, compared to Chinese producers.

As global EV sales rise and concerns about China’s leadership in the sector grow, both Europe and the US have ramped up domestic manufacturing. In Europe, growing demand has driven a surge in EV production capacity since the CO2 standards were passed in 2019, often supported by national state aid (Figure 4). The US saw an uptick in EV production capacity following the adoption of the IRA, but capacity is around two-thirds of that in Europe.

Annual investment has grown steadily in both regions, at roughly 10 percent quarter-on-quarter from 2020 to 2025 (Figure 5). Even with this impressive growth, compared to batteries, the EV industry in the US saw less of a step change in investment following the passage of the IRA compared to batteries (Jugé et al, 2025). Investment in the battery industry surged after the IRA, and the industry diverged sharply from Europe (Figure 6). Many factors may contribute to the more modest impact of the IRA on EVs relative to batteries, including the fact that IRA tax credits apply to a wide array of battery components (including cells, modules, packs, anodes and cathodes), leaving room for a variety of new entrants. By contrast, EVs are a more complex product and therefore new ventures likely face higher barriers to entry and higher bars to meet domestic sourcing requirements for IRA tax credits.

There are signs of a slowdown in EV investment growth rates in both markets, even though investments remain high compared to earlier, and companies continue to make new announcements. In the US, growth in EV manufacturing investments decelerated in Q4 2024, before falling 5 percent in Q1 2025. In addition, more than $6 billion worth of battery projects, including Freyr Battery in Georgia and Kore Power in Arizona, were cancelled in Q1 2025 – the highest value of cancellations on record. Quarter-on-quarter European investment also slowed in Q3 2024 and shrank marginally in Q4 2024. In Europe, ACC and SVOLT have paused their plans for battery manufacturing plants in Germany . In both regions, this downturn mirrors slowing EV sales. In the US, it is compounded by uncertainty about the future of federal EV support and the impact of tariffs.

These uncertainties create additional risks for the pipeline of future projects, including operating facilities ramping up production (‘operational but not yet online’, Figure 7) and those under construction and announced. For the US, a capacity of 3.9 million vehicles is anticipated to come online, adding to current operational capacity of 2.6 million. Europe has even more new projects in the pipeline, with capacity for 5.2 million vehicles under construction or announced, in addition to 3.8 million in capacity already available (Figure 7). While the outlook appears more stable for Europe, the rate of future EV demand growth remains uncertain.

The future competitiveness of the EV sector

President Trump’s tariffs, the risk of escalating trade wars and an evolving policy landscape will impact EV sales and production in both the US and Europe. In the US, EVs have become a political flashpoint and the industry’s future is uncertain. Even before Trump’s second term, EV prices were relatively high in the US. Tariffs on construction materials will make it more expensive to build manufacturing facilities. Tariffs on China – initiated under President Biden and ramped up under President Trump – raise the cost of EV production in existing facilities, given that China provides most upstream EV battery components.

The budget package passed by the US House of Representatives on 22 May 2025, and at time of writing under consideration in the Senate, would effectively gut the energy tax credits under the IRA, including the EV-related provisions that have been critical in catalysing the latest wave of investments . Potential repeal of the IRA, along with many other attacks on federal and state clean vehicle regulation and incentives , further undermine the outlook for the US domestic market and threaten to reduce the competitiveness of US-made EVs abroad.

The EU outlook is clearer, with the 2035 zero-emission vehicles target providing certainty. The main question is the degree to which domestic production should be protected, even at the cost of restricting cheaper imports, which benefit consumers. This issue has arisen in discussions concerning whether the EU should impose tariffs on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles . Imports of Chinese-made EVs are important for increasing the availability of affordable models to European consumers. But taking market share from European production is damaging for domestic jobs and value added, and especially a concern if deemed unfair competition due to Chinese state subsidies.

In response, the EU launched an anti-subsidy investigation in 2023 and by October 2024 imposed additional tariffs on top of the standard 10 percent import duty. These tariffs aim to address unfair competition while still allowing Chinese EV imports to continue. Currently, the EU and China are negotiating the future of these trade measures. One option under discussion is the introduction of a minimum import price mechanism, which would establish a floor price for Chinese EVs sold in Europe .

While the US and European EV industries are primarily focused on domestic markets, both exported just under one-fifth of their domestic EV production in 2024. European manufacturers have diversified their export partners and fostered partnerships with Chinese firms, a strategy their US counterparts have largely avoided.

The global EV transition presents an enormous industrial opportunity. China’s significant lead in production scale, cost efficiency and domestic market size positions it as the dominant player. US and European firms are likely to lose the export shares they enjoyed during the ICE era, both to the Chinese market and other countries. The extent to which Chinese exporters are allowed into the US and European markets will continue to be an important policy question, with a need to balance affordability and industrial competitiveness. Current US policy is to deny any domestic market access to Chinese exporters, while the picture in Europe is more nuanced. Smart policy is needed to strengthen domestic markets, encourage domestic manufacturing and respond to growing Chinese dominance.

Constellation Energy wrote in a statement that it is ""pleased"" to work with the department and PJM, and is taking measures to meet the power demand ""at this critical time when America must win the AI race,"" according to the Associated Press.

The company also said it is trying to accelerate the process to bring Three Mile Island's nuclear power plant back online as part of a deal to supply data centers to Microsoft in the next few years.

The IEA’s World Energy Investment 2025 report forecasts $2.2trn will be directed towards clean energy, including renewables, grids, storage, nuclear, and electrification. Fossil fuel investment is expected to total $1.1trn.

IEA executive director Fatih Birol said energy security is a key driver of this year’s record investment levels.

“Countries and companies are seeking to insulate themselves from a wide range of risks,” said Birol. “Despite geopolitical and economic uncertainties, most existing projects remain on track.”

China remains the world’s largest energy investor, spending nearly as much as the EU and US combined, with almost one-third of global clean energy investment, the IEA said.

Solar PV is the dominant technology, expected to attract $450bn in investment this year. Battery storage is also rising rapidly, exceeding $65bn, while nuclear spending is on track to reach $75bn.

Electricity investment—including generation, grids and storage—is now 50% higher than fossil fuel supply spending. A decade ago, fossil fuels outpaced electricity by 30%.

However, the IEA warned grid investment—currently $400bn—is lagging behind and must rise to match generation spending by the early 2030s to ensure electricity security.

Upstream oil investment is projected to fall by 6% in 2025, driven by weaker demand and a sharp drop in US tight oil activity. By contrast, LNG investment is surging, with new capacity expected from 2026 to 2028 in the US, Qatar, Canada and other markets.

In its current form, the tax and budget bill would slash funding for research and development in technology and clean energy.
Last year, China invested more in clean energy than the US, EU, and UK combined.
Eliminating clean energy incentives will not stop the global tide of decarbonization.
We look to the Senate to support US global competitiveness in the clean energy technologies of the future by restoring clean energy technology incentives.","There is nothing beautiful about the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s obstruction of US clean energy progress and American economic competitiveness.

Investors in public companies are concerned that the proposed bill, now before the Senate after it was passed by House Republicans by a one-vote margin, prioritizes culture war skirmishes over innovation and long-term economic stability and growth.

In its current form, the tax and budget bill would slash funding for research and development in technology and clean energy. Central to the bill is the repeal of key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, despite the IRA’s success in driving $321 billion in new private investment across 2,369 domestic clean-energy facilities.

The House bill’s accelerated phaseout of tax credits that support domestic manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and electric vehicles will be devastating for American competitiveness and job creation. The administration has already decimated $8 billion in renewable energy investments along with 10,000 high-quality jobs, simply by creating uncertainty around the future of incentives. Ending those incentives permanently will gut these areas of technological progress for the US.

If there is indeed an “energy emergency” in this nation, undermining the renewable energy sector takes us in the wrong direction. Renewables are currently the US’s leading source of new domestic generating capacity. Instead of bolstering US technological and economic leadership in energy development, the proposed budget cuts key investment programs and coddles legacy fossil fuel industries from next-generation competition.

Pulling the plug on these crucial investments weakens the innovation ecosystem that historically fueled America’s economic leadership. That puts the US at a competitive disadvantage with geopolitical rivals like China.

Last year, China invested more in clean energy than the US, EU, and UK combined. It has overtaken the US in university and government R&D spending and continues to advance its technological leadership. From 2003 to 2007, the US led in 60 of 64 critical technologies. In the most recent five-year period of 2019 to 2023, its lead in critical technologies plummeted to only 7 out of the 64; China now leads development in 57 critical technologies.

EV leaders and laggards

As just one example, Chinese electric vehicles now account for 76% of global market share. As China leaps ahead, the proposed budget will make it increasingly difficult for the US to close this competitive divide.

IRA funding provides a critical and much-needed opportunity for US automakers to reclaim their competitive edge. IRA incentives supported the development of nearly two dozen US-based EV assembly and battery manufacturing plants, developing a domestic workforce with EV and battery expertise.

Ford CEO Jim Farley cited the IRA as a key impetus to building new battery plants in the US instead of Mexico or Canada. The IRA production and consumer credits lowered costs for automakers, enabling more competitive EV pricing while boosting both supply and consumer demand to support long-term plant success.

Driven by fossil fuel lobbying and culture war rhetoric, America is missing the global shift toward innovation and research leadership. Eliminating clean energy incentives will not stop the global tide of decarbonization. Instead, this short-sighted policy reversal simply creates risks for the companies in which we invest by undermining their ability to compete, attract capital, and create long-term value.

The budget bill’s backward-facing funding decisions are of great concern to investors who want US companies to not only retain value but create growth into the future. This means being viable in a global market which is quickly decarbonizing. Indeed, over 2,000 companies and hundreds of billions in private investment have called on Congress to preserve clean energy tax credits.

Innovation requires dedicated investment in people, infrastructure, and institutions. The proposed House budget doesn’t just slow American progress, it is likely to cement our mediocrity. Passing the House bill as-is will undermine what made America an exceptional leader in the first place—innovation. Innovation in one sector drives progress across many. Weakening support for advanced technologies risks slowing growth across the entire US economy.

Business needs a stable policy environment in which to succeed—one that rewards long-term thinking, is guided by evidence, and prioritizes American economic innovation over political expediency. Smart investment in a sustainable economy promotes US competitiveness. The proposed House budget bill may score short-term political points, but does so at the expense of our economic future and a livable planet.

The United States cannot afford to abandon its leadership in clean energy and innovation.

The proposal is pending approval from the Michigan Public Service Commission.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel expressed strong opposition to the proposed increase.

""It's appalling that they are asking for more money,"" she said, noting that Consumers Energy had recently been approved for a $154 million rate hike. ""They haven't even started to spend the money that they got from the last rate hike. How do they know that they need this much more for the next rate increase? So I find it just to be appalling.""

Nessel highlighted the impact on consumers, stating, ""It's pricing people out of their ability to afford electricity.""

She also criticized the lack of choice for consumers, as utility companies are assigned to customers without alternatives. ""If you think that the service is poor and that your power is constantly going out, you can't go to some other company and say, I'm gonna hire somebody else to do this job for me. This is all you get,"" she said.

Consumers Energy defended the proposed increase, stating it is necessary for upgrades to reliability and services. The company provides energy to nearly 2 million homes and businesses across Michigan.

Nessel is urging the Michigan Public Service Commission to scrutinize the proposed rate increase. ""My office will intervene, which we have the statutory ability to do, and to review all the documents associated with the rate increase,"" she said.

The proposal will be reviewed in a hearing before the commission, where Nessel plans to present testimony advocating for a lower rate increase. Last year, her office successfully negotiated a reduced rate approval.

America’s biggest technology companies are its largest voluntary buyers of emissions-free power. Only in the past few years have these two facts managed to mingle with each other.

The latest tech nuclear deal is in Central Illinois; Meta on Tuesday unveiled a 20-year power purchase agreement for the electricity produced by the Clinton Clean Energy Center, an 1,100-megawatt nuclear plant run by Constellation Energy. The deal will “guarantee that Clinton will continue to run for another two decades,” Constellation said in its announcement. The deal allows the company to look at extending its existing early site permit for a new plant, the announcement said — or apply for a new one to “pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor,” although it made no specific development commitments.

While neither Meta nor Constellation disclosed the value of the deal, Mark Nelson, founder of Radiant Energy Group, estimated that it would cost around $17 billion, of which between $7 billion to $9 billion would be profit for Constellation, enough to fund the building of a new plant. Either way, the announcement represents the “first time a nuclear customer is proposing another nuclear reactor in the state,” Nelson told me.

These types of deals are not exactly novel anymore (Microsoft struck a deal with Constellation last year to resurrect Three Mile Island), but they demonstrate a shift in mindset among tech companies, which are finally showing some respect for the emissions benefits of nuclear energy — albeit about a decade late.

The 2010s were a dark time for the nuclear industry. Cheap natural gas threatened the economic viability of aging plants, while the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan combined with rising enthusiasm for renewable power had left the industry politically isolated. Between 2012 and 2022, 12 nuclear reactors closed in the U.S. Those 12 plants represented over 9,000 megawatts of capacity, about a 10th of the total capacity of the American nuclear fleet.

Nuclear plants suffered most in “restructured” electricity markets like Illinois’, where utilities generally purchase power from independent power producers. In these markets, power that’s cheap on an hourly basis, i.e. renewables and natural gas, sets the price for the whole system, which can disadvantage nuclear power.

At the same time, big technology companies were ramping up purchases of low-carbon power — typically wind and solar — with Google doing its first power purchase agreement in 2010. Many state and federal programs to support alternative energy usage were aimed at wind and solar, i.e. were no help to struggling nuclear generators. Environmental groups were largely either indifferent or outright opposed to nuclear power.

Eventually states had to do what the market couldn’t and big tech wouldn’t and step in and keep plants alive. A broader Illinois clean energy law from 2016 included a program to support nuclear power plants by paying for what the market had historically ignored: the fact that their electricity is generated without carbon dioxide emissions. The zero emission credits were part of a larger climate law that provided 10 years of support for downstate nuclear plants. The Illinois bill followed on similar efforts in New York to keep upstate plants open.

(The push and pull between the economic and environmental concerns on both sides of the nuclear argument also led to some bizarre political inversions: At the same time New York was working to keep the upstate plants open, then-Governor Andrew Cuomo joined with Riverkeeper, the environmental group long associated with Cuomo’s ex-brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to close the Indian Point nuclear plant closer to New York City.)

Environmental groups supported the New York and Illinois clean energy programs, but they were at best cool to the nuclear provisions, illustrating the political hole nuclear power plants had fallen into. Touting the pollution benefits of the Illinois law, the Natural Resources Defense Council claimed that “nuclear energy does not represent a clean energy resource.” In New York, the NRDC filed a brief supporting the state’s legal authority to set up a zero emission credit system — “not because it supports the nuclear support program,” but rather because it supported the broader principle of paying for zero-emissions attributes.

The Environmental Defense Fund likewise supported the Illinois law, but with assurances that the nuclear credits “only represents a small fraction of the more-than-500-page bill.” The Union for Concerned Scientists hailed the bill but also made clear that it was “much more than a nuclear subsidy.”

The balance changed in earnest with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which included generous subsidies for new and existing nuclear power, reflecting both its lack of emissions and the industry’s longstanding sway in Washington. Then tech companies’ demand for energy started to climb with the advent of large language models and the immense power needed to train and operate them.

Energy policy experts at the big tech companies were also rethinking how best to decarbonize their operations. They had “run out of baseload,” Nelson told me, referring to always-on power sources as opposed to intermittent sources like wind and solar, and so would need to start supporting options like nuclear in order to truly decarbonize. With the arrival of a new breed of artificial intelligence, Nelson said, these companies realized that they were, in fact, industrial electricity purchasers and would have to act like it.

The past year has seen a flurry of big tech and nuclear tie-ups.

Amazon acquired a data center adjacent to a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania in March, 2024, although the company’s subsequent efforts to use it as a “behind the meter” power source soon faced regulatory opposition. Google, along with Microsoft and Nucor, announced a plan to work together to buy and advance the development of non-carbon-emitting power, including nuclear. Microsoft announced its Three Mile Island deal later last year, while Amazon started investing in small modular reactors and Google said it would buy power from plants built by the advanced nuclear company Kairos. And in December, Meta released a request for proposals for nuclear energy developers to deliver at least 1 gigawatt and up to 4 gigawatts of clean power by “the early 2030s,” which the company said today it was “still advancing.”

Meta’s deal for the Clinton nuclear plant will essentially replace the Illinois emissions credit program, which runs out in 2027. The announcement of the deal also reflects the volatile and confusing politics of clean power in 2025. While Republicans in Congress are looking to slash the Inflation Reduction Act and its support for clean power investment and production, the House budget reconciliation bill included carve-outs for advanced nuclear power. The Trump administration has also signed a fleet of executive orders looking to streamline nuclear power regulations and encourage new nuclear development, reflecting the high esteem the industry has with the Republican Party despite its lack of interest (at best) in climate change policies, per se.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDM4NTQyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4OTY2NTg1MH0.Olq_fv6zlMVWVyYuo0NDK7FrTKGsm1niGuwaG-Zj7bw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-05 04:02:49.277222

Constellation Energy Corp. and Meta recently inked a 20-year power purchase agreement that will enable the Clinton Clean Energy Center to continue to flow emissions-free power onto the local grid.

“We are proud to partner with Meta because they asked that important question, and even better, they figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy,” said Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez. “Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.”

Constellation’s nuclear power plant located near Clinton, Ill., supports Meta’s clean energy goals and operations in the region with 1,121 megawatts (MW) of emissions-free energy.

Beginning in June 2027, the agreement supports the relicensing and continued operations of Constellation’s nuclear facility for another two decades after the state’s ratepayer funded zero emission credit program expires.

The deal will expand Clinton’s clean energy output by 30 MW through plant uprates; preserve 1,100 local jobs; deliver $13.5 million in annual tax revenue; and add $1 million in charitable giving to local nonprofits over five years, according to Constellation.

The Clinton Clean Energy Center was slated for premature closure in 2017 after years of financial losses, despite being one of the best performing nuclear plants in Illinois, according to Dominguez.

Clinton’s retirement was prevented by enactment of the Future Energy Jobs Act, which established a Zero Emission Credit (ZEC) program that provides financial support to the plant through mid-2027.

An analysis by The Brattle Group found that shuttering Clinton would raise emissions by more than 34 million metric tons of carbon over 20 years, the equivalent to putting approximately 7.4 million gasoline-powered cars on the road for a year.

The same report also found that Illinois’ GDP would drop by $765 million annually, impacting businesses and jobs across multiple industries. Constellation’s deal with Meta prevents these impacts, according to Dominguez.

“Last year, Constellation’s announced plan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center became national news, but despite all of the interest and overwhelming support, a key question was missed: why did we let such a valuable plant close in the first place?” Dominguez said. “We all know that the closure cost our community jobs, tax revenue, more pollution and higher prices.”

Constellation said its agreement with Meta is a market-based solution that essentially replaces the ZEC program and ensures long-term operations of the plant without ratepayer support.

Meta is purchasing the plant’s clean energy attributes as part of its commitment to match 100 percent of its electricity use with clean and renewable energy.

“We are excited to partner with Constellation and the Clinton community to ensure the long-term operations of the nuclear plant, add new capacity, and help preserve over 1,000 jobs. Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta. “We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.”

The agreement with Meta will allow Constellation to add more new, clean, reliable energy to the grid in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s (MISO) zone four territory, covering central and southern Illinois.

Under the deal, Clinton will add 30 MW of increased output from nuclear uprates. With the guarantee that Clinton will continue to run for another two decades, Constellation is also evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor at the Clinton Clean Energy Center site.

Constellation is also increasing its charitable giving and will invest $1 million over five years starting in 2026 to support workforce development, social services, education, and local nonprofits in Clinton and surrounding communities.

“Constellation’s Clinton nuclear plant has long been an important part of our local economy, supporting a vibrant community with great jobs, excellent schools and well-resourced fire and police departments,” said Clinton Mayor Helen Michelassi. “While many other communities are losing jobs and tax revenues, Meta is investing in our future, preserving good-paying jobs, and driving economic development for decades to come.”

Illinois State Rep. Regan Deering (R-88) noted that Clinton has been a cornerstone of clean energy and good-paying jobs in central Illinois for decades.

“This partnership ensures that legacy continues without burdening taxpayers,” said Deering. “It’s the kind of forward-thinking investment we need more of in Illinois: one that supports families, boosts local economies and keeps reliable power on the grid.”

Other Illinois legislators also applauded the deal, including State Reps. Sally Turner (R-44) and Mary Miller (R-15).

The Trump administration has proposed ending the program, but in a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Gallego wrote Energy Star saves Arizonans money by providing them independent assurance that products from appliances to homes are energy-efficient investments.

“With energy prices continuing to be a top concern for American families, programs like Energy Star are more critical than ever,” Gallego wrote Zeldin, a former congressman from New York.

The Energy Star program was launched in 1992 during President George H.W. Bush’s administration. The goal was to emphasize the alignment between economic growth, energy efficiency and air quality protection. Business leaders and environmentalists were behind the idea, and Energy Star has enjoyed bipartisan support ever since.

If you ask Gallego, it pays for Arizonans to have something such as Energy Star in place. The first-term senator said “a typical household can save about $450 annually on their energy bills” by choosing Energy Star products. Gallego added that 45% of Arizona’s housing and rental market is Energy Star-certified.

“The state boasts 270 participating businesses and organizations, including 14 manufacturers of Energy Star certified products and 140 companies constructing certified homes, apartments, commercial buildings, and schools,” wrote Gallego. “Energy Star utility partners serve 3.2 million customers and support thousands of facilities – including schools, hotels, hospitals, office buildings, and industrial plants.”

Eliminating the Energy Star program would, according to Gallego, be “a shortsighted decision” undermining decades of consumer savings and the conservation of energy.

“I strongly urge you to reconsider any efforts to eliminate the Energy Star program,” wrote Gallego. “Its continued operation is essential to advancing our shared goals of economic growth, energy efficiency, and making life more affordable for all Americans.”

The EPA confirmed in an email to The Center Square that the agency has received Gallego’s letter.

While battery storage might be the most exposed to tariff risk among power sectors, as reported by our colleagues at PV Tech today in their coverage of the Wood Mackenzie report, solar PV is also vulnerable.
“An increase in tariff levels will only worsen this premium US energy consumers need to pay to access renewable energy.
It’s not just battery cells that the US BESS industry relies on importing.
CEA said BESS cells, container bill of materials (BOM) and power plant components could be subject to up to five tariffs.","This is due to the reliance of the battery energy storage system (BESS) market on imported products from China, with “nearly all” battery cells used in US utility-scale projects in 2024 coming from there.

Depending on the severity of potential tariff increases, the cost of utility-scale BESS could rise between 12% and 50% across three tariff scenarios modelled by Wood Mackenzie analysts.

Wood Mackenzie vice-chairman of power and renewables Chris Seiple said that while US battery cell manufacturing capacity is expanding, this is not happening fast enough “to meet even a small fraction of battery projects in the US.”

“In 2025, we estimate there is sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity to only meet about 6% of demand and, by 2030, domestic manufacturing could potentially meet 40% of demand,” Seiple said.

While battery storage might be the most exposed to tariff risk among power sectors, as reported by our colleagues at PV Tech today in their coverage of the Wood Mackenzie report, solar PV is also vulnerable.

“The tariffs that have been in place on solar modules along with an inefficient transmission policy that exacerbates interconnection costs have made construction costs for solar higher in the US than in most other markets,” Chris Seiple said.

“An increase in tariff levels will only worsen this premium US energy consumers need to pay to access renewable energy. While the full impact remains uncertain, it’s clear that [solar] industry participants need to prepare for increased costs and potential disruptions to their supply chains.”

CEA: AD/CVD risk for active anode materials, sources beyond China impacted post-tariff pause

Clean Energy Associates this week published an interim update to its quarterly ‘Energy Storage System Price Forecasting Report’, which notes that even under the current 90-day pause on US-China tariffs, total duties on Chinese battery imports remain over 40%.

Once the paused arrangement—which itself has driven uncertainty for battery storage developers and investors—expires, CEA says that if the highest tariffs announced by US president Donald Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), duties could exceed 150%.

It’s not just battery cells that the US BESS industry relies on importing. CEA said prices for imported DC blocks or AC blocks would also see steep price increases, along with locally integrated systems only using cells from abroad.

With the 2 April announcement of Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs, China was targeted with a 34% tariff rate, which was then hiked to 84% and finally to 125%. Added onto the first IEEPA blanket tariff of 20% on all imported goods from overseas, this put tariffs over and above existing tariffs at 145%, CEA said.

A deal agreed 12 May then saw the China-specific IEEPA tariffs dropped to 10% for 90 days, meaning that for now, 30% tariffs apply on all goods with China as the country of origin.

There are also existing Section 301 tariffs on Chinese lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries at 7.5%, which are due to go up to 25% from the beginning of 2026 on all Li-ion batteries, battery parts and materials. On top of this is a 3.4% baseline ad valorem tariff.

CEA calculated that as of the end of May, tariffs on Chinese Li-ion batteries will be at 40.9% until the 90-day pause ends 12 August. From then until the end of this year, they will be at 64.9% and 82.4% from January 2026 once the Section 301 tariff goes up.

CEA said BESS cells, container bill of materials (BOM) and power plant components could be subject to up to five tariffs. These include tariffs on steel imported from anywhere in the world and the impact of Trump’s ‘reciprocal tariffs’ on other countries that play a role in the supply chain, like Canada and Mexico, plus separate active anode tariffs which could yet be imposed on companies importing from China under anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD),

While US companies are seeking alternative supply sources, other BESS DC block- and cell-producing countries like South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and latterly Poland will also face relatively steep tariffs.

At the current tariff rate during the three-month standoff, CEA said Chinese OEMs would likely be willing to absorb some of the extra cost to maintain market share, but of course, the picture is much less certain in the longer term.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wood-Mackenzie-tariff-impacts-on-power-sector-costs.png,N,,2025-06-05 07:03:39.140650

Instead, nuclear power will help offset carbon emissions from data centers elsewhere that rely on power from coal or natural gas.
In support of that goal, the company is in the process of selecting partners to build between one and four gigawatts of new nuclear power generation.","A nuclear power plant in Clinton, Illinois, has gone from nearing the end of its lifespan to becoming the latest example of a power plant saved by the technology industry. Meta Platforms Inc. signed a 20-year agreement Tuesday, June 3, with the plant’s owner, Constellation Energy, to purchase electricity and upgrade the facility.

The Clinton Clean Energy Center was scheduled to be decommissioned in 2027 when taxpayer funds for the zero-emissions electricity-producing plant were set to expire. Under the new power purchase agreement, Meta, which needs abundant power sources for new data centers powering the artificial intelligence boom, will pay Constellation to keep the plant running through 2047 and increase its total electric capacity by 30 megawatts. The plant’s current capacity is 1092 megawatts, or 1.092 gigawatts, which is enough to power more than 200,000 homes.

“Data companies are looking for the fastest way to get access to power,” Todd Allen, an expert on the nuclear power industry and chair of the nuclear engineering department at the University of Michigan, told Straight Arrow News.

Allen called the partnership unsurprising and said he expects that the Meta-Constellation deal will not be the last of its kind because it’s faster and less costly to invest in an existing power plant than to start from scratch.

Why is Big Tech power-hungry?

Modern artificial intelligence tools are energy-intensive, and the data centers that power them need to operate around the clock. The International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand from data centers will double by 2030, consuming as much electricity as the entire country of Japan does today. In the U.S., data centers are projected to consume nearly half of all new energy added between now and 2030, according to the IEA.

To meet the surging need for reliable electricity, Meta is not the only Big Tech company choosing the nuclear energy option. In fall of 2024, Amazon, Google and Microsoft each unveiled plans to partner with nuclear power companies to bolster the electricity supply in the face of AI needs and help ensure the companies meet targets for fighting climate change, which include getting power from zero-emissions sources.

Constellation Energy is already partnering with Microsoft to restart a unit at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island nuclear plant, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. Google and Amazon are collaborating with companies to develop new small modular reactors, which are more cost-effective to build and offer greater flexibility than traditional large nuclear plants.

How does Big Tech help the nuclear power industry?

Long-term commitments from the tech industry are providing hope to the nuclear power sector. In recent history, nuclear has stagnated, providing around 18-20% of the country’s power for the past 30 years. The total capacity of active nuclear power plants in the U.S. peaked in 2012 and declined about 7% over the following decade as plants built in the 1970s and ’80s began to be decommissioned.

Nuclear plants, depending on where they are located, can also face competition from less expensive sources of power, such as natural gas or wind and solar, according to Allen.

“If you look over the course of the nuclear plants that have shut down in the U.S., it’s usually the local economic conditions are such that they can’t compete,” he said.

That was the story in Clinton, where the power plant fell on hard economic times, and in 2016, the plant’s former owner, Exelon Corporation, announced plans to shut it down. At the end of that year, the state of Illinois stepped in with the passage of a bill setting up zero-emissions credits (ZECs) for nuclear power, aiming to help meet the state’s environmental goals.

The state agreed to start out paying $16.50 per megawatt-hour of electricity produced by nuclear plants in a 10-year deal that is set to expire in 2027. In 2024, Constellation would have received about $177 million in taxpayer funding for running the Clinton plant, according to an analysis by Straight Arrow News. Constellation did not confirm the number or respond to questions from SAN.

In a press release, the company wrote, “Constellation’s agreement with Meta is a market-based solution that essentially replaces the ZEC program and ensures long-term operations of the plant.”

Meta’s nuclear plans

The deal in Illinois will not coincide with the establishment of a new data center in the area, although Meta does have existing operations in the region. Instead, nuclear power will help offset carbon emissions from data centers elsewhere that rely on power from coal or natural gas. Meta’s environmental goals include offsetting 100% of their energy needs with zero-emissions sources.

Along with Google, Amazon and several other companies, Meta has signed onto a pledge to help triple the global capacity of nuclear power by 2050. In support of that goal, the company is in the process of selecting partners to build between one and four gigawatts of new nuclear power generation.

Allen sees the tech industry’s investments as a significant “accelerator” for the nuclear industry’s growth. However, he warns that although interest in nuclear technology has been on the rise, a major challenge will be developing the workforce capable of building a new generation of nuclear reactors.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Featchy.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 04:02:53.008892

Critics say the changes would increase people’s energy bills. Republican lawmakers said they think the opposite is true, and that the bill should help rates go down in the future. Rep. Dean Arp, R-Union, said the bill was written “in a way to explicitly save ratepayers dollars.”

But when a Democratic lawmaker pressed one of the energy industry representatives on such claims during Wednesday’s committee hearing on the bill, he declined to commit to lower rates.

“You can assure us that the rates will not go up? You made that statement?” Rep. Garland Pierce, D-Scotland, asked Dalton Ashworth, a representative for ElectriCities of NC, one of the industry groups backing the bill.

“I do not believe I did,” Ashworth replied.

A lobbyist for Duke Energy, which provides power to almost everyone in North Carolina, likewise didn’t commit to keeping rates from going up.

“We're committed to powering our state's continued success through a reliable and increasingly clean mix of energy resources while keeping costs as low as possible for our customers,” Duke lobbyist Ryan Minto said. “North Carolina is experiencing rapid growth, more people, more businesses and more demand for energy.”

The bill would allow energy companies to charge people for power plants that aren’t built yet. Supporters say it will allow plants to be built and paid off faster, keeping costs down.

Donald Bryson, who leads the pro-business John Locke Foundation think tank, noted that the bill comes as Duke Energy faces a mandate from the legislature to shut down its coal-burning plants and transition to cleaner sources of energy, such as nuclear power, to become carbon-neutral by 2050 — part of a 2021 bill that Duke Energy helped write.

""This bill enables a rational energy transition that balances environmental goals with economic growth and ratepayer protection,"" Bryson said. ""In short, if we want energy policy grounded in reality and responsible governance, then this is the right step forward.""

Critics say it’ll shift risks from shareholders to customers, leaving regular people on the hook for business mistakes or fraud. They pointed to South Carolina, which has a similar rule as the one being proposed here. There, customers are currently stuck paying for a $9 billion nuclear power plant that never ended up being built.

Arp said the bill has guardrails in place intended to stop that South Carolina example from playing out in North Carolina. Critics weren't convinced of the strength of those guardrails.

""As our neighbors look to repeal these laws and warn us not to repeat their mistakes, some North Carolina lawmakers want us to learn this lesson the hard way,"" Will Scott of the Environmental Defense Fund NC wrote in a statement. ""If the utility wants to gamble, they should do it with shareholder money, not with captive North Carolina customers footing the bill.""

Short public notice

At many times during Wednesday’s debate over the bill, lawmakers appeared to be talking past one another as they debated what the bill would mean for people’s pocketbooks — often appearing to misunderstand each other’s questions, or to misunderstand the bill itself.

The confusion might have been due in part to the fact that some legislators on the committee weren't shown copies of the proposed new language in the bill until Tuesday night; Democratic lawmakers also said the bill wasn't made available to the general public until 10 minutes before Wednesday's committee began.

Committee leaders took an unrelated bill — Senate Bill 266, which proposed changes to building code rules related to Hurricane Helene — and rewrote it to delete all the Helene-related language and replace it with dozens of pages of proposed new energy policy rules. The process is known in legislative parlance as gut-and-amend.

Many business interests were at the meeting to praise the bill.

Duke Energy, the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute, the North Carolina Manufacturers’ Alliance, the John Locke Foundation, Electricities of North Carolina and the North Carolina Electrical Cooperative all sent representatives to the hearing to offer their support.

Rep. Sarah Crawford, D-Wake, cited the lack of public notice on the highly technical bill that will affect the entire state. For that reason, she asked for the committee’s vote to be delayed to give lawmakers and members of the public more time to read it and consider its impacts. The committee’s chairman Rep. Kyle Hall, R-Stokes, declined.

Offering some insight into the legislative process, Hall said the state Senate won’t agree to pass this bill. The Senate previously voted to pass its own version of these changes, with some notable differences, as part of Senate Bill 261 in March.

Hall said the effort to rush this separate bill through the House was an acknowledgement that the two chambers need to start formally working on negotiating a final deal, and he’d like that to start that process sooner rather than later.

It’s up to us to alert our communities and tell our lawmakers: Don’t sell rural America out to big corporations and the wealthy.","Republicans in Congress are jamming through a sweeping bill to fund handouts to the rich — at the cost of jobs, health care, and food in rural Kentucky.

By Michael Chameides

Right now, Congress is working on a giant, fast-track bill that would make historic cuts to basic needs programs to finance another round of tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations.

As the Communications and Policy Director for the Rural Democracy Initiative, I’ve been hearing from rural leaders across the country about the devastating impacts this bill would have.

The good news is it’s not too late. But there’s little time to spare.

This dangerous, unpopular bill would increase costs for rural working families by thousands of dollars per year, leaving millions hungry and without health care — all to provide tax breaks and handouts to the wealthy and special interests.

Here are just six of the worst provisions.

1. It guts rural healthcare.

The bill would drastically cut Medicaid and impose new barriers to care. It would take healthcare away from 13.8 million Americans and increase the cost for millions more. In some states, 50 percent of rural children get healthcare from Medicaid. Millions more rely on access to clinics and hospitals that would likely close because of these cuts.

2. It takes food off the tables of rural people.

The plan includes approximately $290-$319 billion in cuts to SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps) even as the cost of groceries continues to escalate. More than 15 percent of families in small towns and rural areas rely on this support to feed their families.

3. It shifts costs to states and local governments.

State and local governments in rural areas depend more on federal funding from programs like SNAP and Medicaid than other states. Slashing federal funding to states would create new burdens for rural states that are already struggling to provide critical public services like health care, transportation, and emergency response services to local communities.

4. It takes away local control.

Landowners have fought to stop the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines by passing bans and moratoria, as well as enacting county setbacks and safety requirements to protect their communities.

But this bill would overrule state and local laws and ordinances, override local voices, and deprive residents of a fair opportunity to evaluate the adverse impacts of pipelines. It also sets up a “pay to play” system under which companies can simply pay for pipeline, mining, and drilling permits — and avoid public comment and legal challenges.

5. It ends clean energy and infrastructure funding.

The bill would phase out existing tax credits for wind, solar, batteries, geothermal, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing. It would also take away $262 million in funding for energy efficiency and conservation grants as well as transportation infrastructure.

Ending these tax credits will increase household energy costs, which are already higher in many rural communities. These changes would also reduce new clean energy projects — and jeopardize billions in rural investments in clean energy manufacturing.

6. It gives handouts to agribusiness and mega farms.

Leaders in Congress are using the budget reconciliation process to give big farms a $50 billion windfall. Add the heightened pressures and instability caused by the Trump administration’s erratic trade policy and more family farmers would lose their farms — while Big Ag consolidates more of the market.

In short, this bill would make it harder for rural people to meet their basic needs — all so the wealthy and corporations can avoid paying their fair share of taxes like the rest of us do.

Lawmakers have already heard from the giant corporations who helped write the bill. Now, they need to hear from the rest of us.

China has become the world’s dominant manufacturing nation, a factor driving imperialist competition with the United States, including Donald Trump’s harsh tariffs on Chinese goods.

Successive US administrations under Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Trump (twice) have made reining in China their main priority.

Obama undertook a pivot to Asia, designed to increase the US’s military domination and prevent China from “breaking out” into the Western Pacific. Biden promoted plans to onshore sophisticated computer chip production. And Trump is trying to keep out Chinese imports in the hope of reviving US manufacturing and weakening China as a rival.

It isn’t working. China currently accounts for 35 per cent of global manufacturing, a figure the United Nations is projecting to rise to 45 per cent by 2030.

China already leads global production in wind turbines, drones, steel, aluminium, shipbuilding, solar power, consumer electronics, batteries, active pharmaceutical ingredients, 5G equipment, consumer electronics and bullet trains. In 2023, it installed more industrial robots than all other countries combined.

When Chinese company DeepSeek unveiled its artificial intelligence chatbot in January, developed with cheaper chips than its Western rivals, it rattled its US competitors.

But perhaps nothing sums up China’s dominance more than its car industry—and particularly its development of electric vehicles, or EVs. According to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, China produced 32.3 per cent of all cars in 2023, towering over the US in second place with 11.3 per cent.

Its EV industry is growing rapidly. Chinese firm BYD last year made slightly more EVs than Tesla, previously the world’s most popular EV brand. BYD now has a market value greater than that of Ford, GM and Volkswagen combined.

The development of the EV industry in China did not happen by chance—it reflects the intersection of globalisation and state intervention and highlights the contradictions between competing imperialists.

Winning globalisation

The US encouraged China to welcome foreign investment, leading to China’s admission to the club of “free trade” countries, the World Trade Organisation, in 2001.

Former US trade representative Michael Froman wrote, “The US strategy of engagement with China was based on the premise that, if the United States incorporated China into the global rules-based system, China would become more like the United States.”

But it didn’t work out that way. Froman said that today, “It is important to recognise a fundamental truth: the United States is now operating largely in accordance with Beijing’s standards … In the war over who gets to define the rules of the road, the battle is over, at least for now. And China won.”

Under Hu Jintao, President of China from 2003 to 2013, and now under Xi Jinping, China combined elements of free trade—exporting vast amounts of cheap, low-tech goods—with state intervention to create “national champions” in strategic sectors. One of those sectors was EVs.

The Chinese ruling class recognised that it could not compete with US, Japanese and European manufacturers of fossil fuel cars. Instead it put resources into developing a battery industry and, from that, an EV industry.

Today the Chinese firm CATL produces a third of the world’s electric car batteries and supplies 16 of the world’s biggest carmakers, including General Motors and the Shanghai factory of Tesla. Its main rival, BYD, makes about one-sixth of the world’s EV batteries.

China is increasingly using its large domestic market to underpin strategic industries so it no longer depends on access to markets in Europe or the US and is therefore less vulnerable to tariffs. China accounted for 65.3 per cent of total global EV sales last year, compared to just 8.7 per cent for the US.

Rare earths

Trump (and before him, Biden) has erected a tariff wall that effectively keeps Chinese EVs out of the US. He is now looking to get Chinese EVs banned in Britain as part of trade negotiations with London.

He is responding to the demands of industrialists. Despite the tariffs, Ford’s chief executive, Jim Farley, has described China’s EV industry as an “existential threat” to the US car industry.

The tariffs have added to inter-imperialist tensions, with China in turn restricting the export of a wide range of rare earths and magnets to the US.

China has benefited from its deposits of rare earths—minerals that are key to the creation of batteries and magnets that can operate at high temperatures. As former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping boasted, “The Middle East has oil, China has rare earth.”

Rare earths are of critical importance not only for EV batteries but for military applications. An F-35 fighter needs more than 400 kilograms of rare earths, an AUKUS submarine more than four tonnes.

The minerals go into making weapons guidance systems, radar, precision-guided bombs, lasers, satellites, drone motors and night-vision goggles.

Competition for the minerals and the threat of China withholding supply helps explain Trump’s claim on Greenland and his trade deal with Ukraine, both sources of rare earths.

It is also a potential factor in negotiations between Trump and Anthony Albanese.

The Australian mining company Lynas is the only producer of certain “heavy” rare earths outside China, from ore mined in WA and processed in Malaysia.

Imperialist contradictions

One of the challenges for Trump’s hopes of “reshoring” manufacturing to the US is the way that corporations operate and source materials, parts and labour across national boundaries.

As motoring journalist Peter Anderson told the ABC, “From a supply chain perspective, China is critical to global automotive production.

“It doesn’t matter whether you’re making a Ford truck in Michigan or you’re making a sports car in a garage in the UK, you have [almost certainly] got Chinese parts in there.”

The same globalisation logic applies to the EV industry. BYD has factories in Thailand, India, Hungary, France and Uzbekistan.

Different imperialists have different priorities. Trump is hostile to EVs in general and has tried to slam the door shut to Chinese cars. But the European Union is trying to simultaneously defend its manufacturing sector against imports and encourage Chinese companies to invest in Europe.

Chinese-built EVs (including foreign brands such as Tesla) were just 3.5 per cent of EVs sold in the EU in 2020. Last year, that figure hit 27.2 per cent. In response, the EU has imposed total tariffs on Chinese EVs of up to 45 per cent.

As Stephen Bartholomeusz wrote in Nine Newspapers, “The Europeans don’t want a repeat of their experience with solar panels, where heavily subsidised Chinese products wiped out Europe’s solar manufacturing sector.”

But even within the EU, the capitalists are divided. Of the 27 member states, four voted against the tariffs and 10 abstained.

Germany voted against (despite pressure from the pro-tariff Greens). Germany is the world’s sixth biggest car manufacturer and is heavily entangled with China.

Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz all have factories there and they also export fossil fuel vehicles to China.

The other No votes came from Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia. Hungary is keen to attract further. Chinese EV manufacturing investment. Slovakia is heavily linked into Germany’s car industry. All four worry about Chinese retaliation.

But even those EU nations that supported the tariffs know that they cannot burn the relationship with China, in case the EU’s trading relationship with the US sours. In early May, Trump threatened the EU with 50 per cent tariffs, pending further negotiations.

Workers resist

China poses a serious challenge to the US’s economic and military domination. This is driving the charge to war.

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on 31 May that the US was ready to fight China over Taiwan. “There’s no reason to sugar coat it. The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent.”

Workers everywhere have an interest in standing against the madness of the market and the inter-imperialist tensions it produces. And that is just as much the case in China.

According to the China Labour Bulletin, there have been 24 strikes or protests by car workers over just the past six months, over issues such as relocation, layoffs and unpaid wages. Recently, that resistance broke out among BYD workers.

CLB reported, “In a dramatic show of collective action, thousands of workers at BYD’s factories in Wuxi and Chengdu walked off the job in late March and early April 2025, protesting steep pay cuts and deteriorating working conditions.”

More than 1000 workers protested inside BYD’s Wuxi factory. Just days later, the spirit of resistance spread to BYD’s Chengdu facility, 1900 kilometres away, where workers staged similar protests.

BYD has built its EV empire on a business model that forces workers to do excessive overtime. CLB reported on a forklift driver at a BYD factory who worked 11 hours a day and took only five days off in a month. He earned about 5700 yuan ($1228)—but more than half of that came from a crushing 122 hours of overtime.

When it comes to EVs as with so much more, the imperialist powers are locked into competition, even where their economies are intertwined. It is this pressure that is fuelling a dangerous drive to war.

Car workers from Wuxi to Detroit, from Thailand to Hungary, have a common interest in standing against this spiral of doom.

Workers everywhere gain nothing from the argument between tariffs and free trade. Instead, we need to fight for control over our industries so that we can democratically plan our lives.",https://solidarity.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tesla_Gigafactory_Shanghai.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 01:06:27.818497

Vehicle Efficiency and Emission Standards

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

Climate Pollution Reduction Grants

Environmental Justice Block Grants

Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program

Opt-In Fee Program Impacting the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)

Other IRA programs affected by EPW

1. Vehicle Efficiency and Emission Standards

The Department of Transportation (DOT) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. These standards have saved drivers trillions of dollars and drastically reduced harmful pollution from vehicles—reducing smog and health impacts like asthma and heart disease. Rescinding these standards is not allowed by the rules of budget reconciliation, but Republicans are trying to repeal them anyway.

1a. Summary of Senate Text

This bill would repeal the EPA air pollution emissions standards for light- and medium-duty vehicles, phasing in over model years 2027 through 2032.

1b. Changes from House Version

This is largely consistent with the House text that repealed these EPA standards, as well as greenhouse gas emissions standards starting in 2023, plus the DOT efficiency standards (which we will likely see in bill text from the Senate Commerce committee).

1c. Key Impacts

If Republicans gut vehicle standards in the final bill as they did in the House bill, we would end up with less efficient and more polluting vehicles, burning 70 billion extra gallons of gasoline through 2050 and increasing climate pollution by more than 710 million metric tons. Eliminating these standards would increase costs by $600 over the lifetime of new vehicles. Increased pollution would lead to greater health risks (asthma, heart disease, cancer) from toxic air pollution. Attempting to repeal these rules via reconciliation would seriously surpass the limits of reconciliation by trying to set regulations via this budgetary process.

2. Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

The $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) is the largest grant program within the IRA. This $27 billion is divided into three programs: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA), and Solar for All. Not only does this program provide a significant investment in pollution-reducing clean energy technology and green banks, but it also benefits communities that have been historically overlooked and underserved, bringing greater equity to the clean energy transition. For months, the Trump administration has waged an unsubstantiated assault on this fund. At every turn, the administration has been unable to justify its attacks to undermine this program, failing to offer evidence to support its bogus claims of fraud, waste, or abuse.

2a. Summary of Senate Text

Senate Republicans would repeal Section 134 of the Clean Air Act, which created the GGRF. All unobligated balances from the GGRF program would be rescinded.

2b. Changes from House Version

There is no change from the House version.

2c. Key Impacts

The GGRF is unlocking a historic wave of public and private investment, delivering local economic development opportunities that would not have materialized without this program, especially in disadvantaged communities. But the Trump administration has already been attacking the GGRF through an illegal funding freeze, and a court battle is currently raging with program awardees, in particular the NCIF and CCIA programs. The GGRF funding has technically been obligated, and only minimal GGRF funds remain unobligated and available for rescission. But the EPW bill will harm program implementation and oversight at EPA. It may also represent an attempt by Congress and the administration to block or claw back funds that have been legally obligated.

3. Climate Pollution Reduction Grants

The Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (CPRG) are an EPA program established as part of a new Clean Air Act Section 137 created in the IRA, which provides grants to state, local, and Tribal governments to create and implement programs that reduce emissions and support jobs and communities. It was funded with $5 billion, including $250 million in planning grants, $4.6 billion for implementation grants, and the remaining balance for technical assistance and program implementation. These grants have been used to support state, local, and Tribal governments in nearly all 50 states.

3a. Summary of Senate Text

Senate Republicans would repeal Section 137 of the Clean Air Act, eliminating the CPRG program. Any unobligated funds would be rescinded.

3b. Changes from House Version

The Senate version is the same as the House version.

3c. Key Impacts

The CPRG program is a primary vehicle for states to fund their pollution reduction programs. Rescinding unobligated funding for the CPRG program would dramatically harm program implementation at the agency. Many awarded states could have to stall or permanently halt their pollution reduction plans that were intended to create jobs, reduce energy and transportation costs, and mitigate pollution in impacted communities.

4. Environmental Justice Block Grants

This first-of-its-kind $3 billion federal program aims to empower disadvantaged communities to determine and design their own visions of pollution reduction and clean energy investment. The Environmental Justice (EJ) Block Grants, also known as the Community Change Grants, provide highly flexible funding that goes directly to nonprofit organizations serving these communities. This means projects are designed by and for communities to address their unique needs and build resilience to extreme weather events and environmental risks.

4a. Summary of Senate Text

Senate Republicans want to completely repeal Section 138 of the Clean Air Act, eliminating the Environmental Justice (EJ) Block Grants program, and rescinding any unobligated funding.

4b. Changes from House Version

The Senate version closely mirrors the House version.

4c. Key Impacts

Without EJ Block Grants, there will be less financial support for on-the-ground, community-led organizations that provide life-changing services to households based in disadvantaged communities or living near sacrifice zones. Examples of critical services include community-led pollution monitoring, prevention, and remediation; projects that reduce indoor air pollution; projects to counter health risks from urban heat islands, extreme heat, and wildfires; improved community engagement in public processes; and technical assistance. Much of these funds are unobligated.

5. Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program

Methane is a potent, planet-heating greenhouse gas that oil and gas operators often flare or leak into the atmosphere. That’s why Congress passed the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) through the IRA in 2022, requiring oil and gas operators to pay a penalty fee if they exceed a certain level of methane pollution. Soon after, the Biden-led EPA introduced a rule implementing the WEC. But at the beginning of 2025, the Republican-controlled Congress voted to eliminate that rule. Now, Congress is trying to get rid of the fee outright via the budget reconciliation bill.

5a. Summary of Senate Text

Senate Republicans want to repeal Section 136 of the Clean Air Act. Unobligated balances are rescinded. A fee on excessive methane waste is retained, but the language is now altered so the collection of charges are postponed to 2034, as opposed to 2024 under current legislation. This renders the fee largely ineffective for the next decade.

5b. Changes from House Version

The Senate version is virtually the same as the House version.

5c. Key Impacts

By cutting methane pollution and other harmful pollutants, the WEC would have helped prevent asthma attacks and other health-harming impacts. The program would have reduced an extremely harmful greenhouse gas superpollutant. Altering the WEC will disproportionately impact communities of color and disadvantaged communities. The methane fee is also a revenue raiser, so its alteration increases the budget deficit and would necessitate even deeper cuts to other vital programs to comply with the GOP’s self-imposed spending cut targets.

6. Opt-In Fee Program Impacting the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is our nation’s bedrock environmental law. It requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of all major proposed government projects.

6a. Summary of Senate Text

Senate Republicans have created a new “opt-in fee” mechanism that would allow project sponsors to receive special treatment in the environmental review process. Additionally, the fee would allow projects to avoid judicial review of findings, drastically curtailing the rights of affected communities to petition the courts.

6b. Changes from House Version

This is similar to the House version.

6c. Key Impacts

This is a continuation of the “pay-to-play” politics we saw in the GOP’s House version, but this time, the bill is attacking the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which provides for environmental reviews of all major government actions. We also expect to see similar “pay-to-play” provisions in the Senate ENR text related to liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and expedited gas permitting.

7. Other IRA Programs Affected by the Senate EPW Bill

The Republican EPW Committee also repealed and/or rescinded any unobligated funds from the following IRA programs:

Air pollution monitoring program for schools in low-income and disadvantaged communities at EPA.

American Innovation Manufacturing (AIM) Act aims to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—potent greenhouse pollutants used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and other applications. The EPW proposes to eliminate funding that helps implement this important bipartisan law.

Diesel Emissions Reduction Program at EPA for grantmaking to reduce diesel emissions from facilities and goods movement in low-income and disadvantaged communities.

Funding for Efficient, Accurate, and Timely Reviews at EPA to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of environmental reviews, permitting, and project approvals.

Efficient and Effective Environmental Reviews, which support expediting the environmental review and permitting processes.

Enforcement Technology and Public Information at EPA.

Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) at EPA for construction materials and products. This initiative aimed to enhance the standardization, transparency, and reporting criteria for EPDs, which include measurements of the embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated with materials and products used in construction.

Environmental Review Implementation Funds, which provide funds to the Federal Highway Administration to review transportation projects by providing guidance, assistance, and training to state, local, and Tribal governments.

Environmental and Climate Data Collection, which provides funding for data collection efforts on the disproportionate harms and cumulative impacts resulting from pollution and climate change.

Fenceline pollution monitoring program at EPA monitors pollution, particularly in communities near polluting facilities.

Greenhouse Gas Air Pollution Plans and Implementation Grants, which provide funding to states, local governments, and Tribes to develop and implement “Climate Change Action Plans” and environmental justice initiatives.

Greenhouse Gas Corporate Reporting at EPA to enhance the standardization and transparency of corporate climate action commitments and plans to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

Heavy Duty Vehicle Electrification at EPA for grantmaking for heavy-duty vehicles in non-attainment areas.

Low Carbon Materials Grant Program at DOT for grantmaking to support the use of low-carbon materials in construction projects.

Lowering Embodied Carbon Labeling for Construction Materials, including developing a program for identifying and labeling construction materials with substantially lower levels of embodied GHG emissions compared to industry averages. This initiative was designed to promote the use of low-carbon materials in construction projects, particularly in federal buildings and transportation infrastructure.

Low Emissions Electricity Program, which funds a wide range of activities to encourage low-emissions electricity generation and reinforced EPA’s authority to regulate carbon pollution.

Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant Program, which would improve walkability, safety, and affordability in transportation, as well as mitigate and remediate impacts from transportation facilities.

Renewable Fuel Program at EPA for grantmaking for advanced biofuels.

Various Green and Efficient Government Building Programs, including use of low-carbon materials and emerging technologies in federal government building projects.

Conclusion

In a nutshell: Senate Republicans are taking money out of working people’s pockets to give tax breaks to billionaires.

Throughout the entire reconciliation process, the GOP has been taking a wrecking ball to dozens of programs that make energy affordable for households, reduce toxic pollution, combat the climate crisis, provide life-changing healthcare, and nourish families with food assistance.

Though this analysis has focused on Evergreen’s priority IRA climate programs found in the Senate EPW bill, we anticipate that other life-changing federal programs will be gutted. Evergreen will continue to track developments in the coming weeks, including the release of the Senate Finance and Senate Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) Committee bill texts. The full bill is expected to go to the Senate floor in the coming weeks and, if passed, could be signed into law by the president soon after.",https://www.evergreenaction.com/blog/og-image/senate-rapid-analysis-blog-hero-2-og-1.jpg?1749088015,N,,2025-06-04 22:05:01.148835

By MARC LEVY, The Associated Press

HARRISBURG — The U.S. Department of Energy has ordered another power plant, this time an oil and gas plant in Delaware County, to keep its turbines running through the hottest summer months as a precaution against electric shortfalls in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid.

The department’s order to the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, regarding the Eddystone power plant along the Delaware River, is the department’s second use of federal power under President Donald Trump to require a power plant to keep operating on the mainland United States.

Constellation Energy had planned to shut down Eddystone’s units 3 and 4 on Saturday, but Trump’s Department of Energy ordered the company to continue operating the units until at least Aug. 28. The units can produce a combined 760 megawatts.

The department, in its order, cited PJM’s growing concerns about power shortfalls amid the shutdown of aging power plants and rising electricity demand. PJM has projected significant growth in electricity use to power America’s fast-rising demand for artificial intelligence and cloud computing platforms.

Demand for electricity has spiked for the first time in decades. In addition to artificial intelligence, crypto mining, the broader electrification of society and bipartisan political pressure to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. are fueling new electricity demand.

PJM last year approved Constellation’s request to shut down the units, but it welcomed the department’s order to keep them operating, saying it’s a “prudent, term-limited step” that allows PJM, the department and Constellation to study the longer-term need and viability of Eddystone’s units.

In a statement Monday, Constellation said it is “pleased” to work with the department and PJM and is taking emergency measures to meet the need for power “at this critical time when America must win the AI race.”

It also said it is trying to accelerate its restart of Three Mile Island ‘s Unit 1 to bring it online in 2027, instead of in 2028, as part of a deal to supply data centers run by tech giant Microsoft with carbon-free energy.

PJM, based in Pennsylvania, earlier this year won federal approval to fast-track the construction of new power plants that critics said would favor natural gas plants over clean energy projects that don’t emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

PJM has said a power shortage could affect the grid as early as 2026 as demand grows for electricity at the same time that aging coal-fired plants and nuclear plants are retiring. Clean energy advocates blame PJM for creating the existing reliability problem by taking an unduly long time to study proposed wind and solar energy projects in its project queue.

Proposals awaiting PJM’s approval are more than 97% solar, wind or battery storage, according to federal figures. Less than 3% are natural gas.

The department took a similar step last week, ordering Consumers Energy to keep the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant open in Michigan past its Saturday retirement.

The grid operator there, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, said the order was unnecessary, that there was no energy emergency there and that there should be enough energy in the region through the summer.

An environmental advocacy group, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, criticized the move to keep Eddystone operating as an “environmental injustice.” Shutting down the units would reduce hazardous pollution and carbon emissions from the decades-old facility and help the region meet federal clean air standards for smog, it said.

The Biden administration’s ambitious clean energy agenda is continuing to unravel under intensifying economic realities, with the Department of Energy canceling $3.7 billion in green energy awards. In contrast, traditional economic indicators show robust growth in personal income and manufacturing output. This tectonic shift exposes fundamental flaws in centrally planned energy transitions while validating market-driven approaches favored by U.S. heavy industries.

DOE Axes $3.7 Billion in Subsidy-Dependent Projects

Financial Viability Concerns Drive 24 Green Project Cancellations

The Department of Energy terminated 24 clean energy demonstration projects authorized under the pork-laden Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, including $540 million for Calpine’s carbon capture initiatives at gas-fired plants in California and Texas. Energy Secretary Chris Wright cited systematic failures in project economics, noting that these ventures “would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” The canceled awards spanned carbon capture, cement decarbonization, and industrial efficiency programs, all sectors where artificial government demand outpaced organic market development.

Notable green casualties included:

ExxonMobil’s Baytown Olefins Plant Carbon Reduction Project ($332 million)

Heidelberg Materials’ carbon-neutral cement initiative ($500 million). Heidelberg will have to rely on green Canada for any return on investment (ROI) on their “carbon-zero” technology in North America.

Kraft Heinz’s cross-facility efficiency upgrades ($170 million)

The decision reflects a broader reassessment of green projects approved during the Biden administration’s final months. With 16 awards signed (most likely by Biden’s autopen handlers) between November 2024 and January 2025, all of which lacked proper financial vetting. While the Carbon Capture Coalition lamented a “major step backward,” the uber-green Sierra Club predictably criticized the prudent energy move as “abandoning frontline communities.”

Severe Structural Flaws in Green Financing

These cancellations expose critical weaknesses in subsidy-dependent energy models. The DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was established in 2021 to manage $27 billion in infrastructure act funding, yet failed to ensure projects could survive without perpetual public support.

As Steven Nadel of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy noted, locking plants into unproven technologies undermines industrial competitiveness. The average requested subsidy for terminated projects exceeded $150 million per initiative, creating artificial markets that were divorced from the actual needs of energy consumers.

US Economic Engine Thrives on Traditional Foundations

Personal Income and Manufacturing Resilience

While renewable projects falter, April 2025 economic data reveals strong fundamentals:

Personal income rose 0.8% ($210.1 billion), driven by private sector wages and Social Security adjustments.

Disposable income increased 0.8% ($189.4 billion), fueling 0.2% growth in consumer spending.

International Case Studies: When Green Ideology Overrides Energy Reality

Germany’s $160 Billion Energiewende Debacle

Germany’s renewable energy transition stands as a cautionary tale:

– Electricity prices rose 50% (2006-2017) despite $160 billion spent.

– Carbon emissions actually increased as shuttered nuclear plants were replaced by coal.

– Wind installations collapsed 60% (2017-2018), with 2021 levels matching 2000 deployments.

The OECD concluded German electricity prices will keep rising as long as solar/wind expansions continue—a stark contrast to France’s nuclear-driven 40% lower rates.

France’s Nuclear Woes and Spain’s Grid Collapse

EPR reactor projects, such as Flamanville 3 (€19.1 billion, 13 years behind schedule), demonstrate the pitfalls of centralized energy planning. Spain’s April 2025 grid collapse—triggered by a 67% solar output drop in one hour—highlights renewable intermittency risks. The Iberian Peninsula’s overreliance on politically favored technologies left no redundancy when clouds disrupted 18 GW of solar generation.

EU’s Hydrogen Hubs Implode

Nearly 20% of EU hydrogen projects were canceled in 2024 due to 3 factors:

Uncompetitive pricing vs. fossil alternatives

Lack of scalable demand

NEL ASA’s 70% stock plunge and production halt

Sweden’s cancellation of 13 offshore wind projects due to military concerns further highlights the spatial conflicts associated with renewable energy.

Economic Realities Versus Political Engineering

Renewable Energy’s ROI Crisis

Comparative analysis reveals stark differences in payback periods:

| Technology | Avg. Payback (Years) | Key Constraints

| Wind Farms | 7–12 | Transmission costs, NIMBYism

| Solar Arrays | 8–10 | Land use, storage dependencies

| Nuclear | 15–20 | Regulatory hurdles

| Natural Gas | 3–5 | Market pricing

Carbon Capture and Subsidy Addiction

Carbon capture projects exemplify subsidy addiction—Exxon’s canceled Baytown initiative required $332 million in federal grants despite the company’s $7.7 billion quarterly profits. Market-driven innovations, such as Exxon’s advanced recycling (with an 80M lbs/year capacity), prove more sustainable without government intervention.

Trump Policy Pivot Reshapes the US Industrial Landscape

The Trump administration’s energy reset prioritizes:

1. Grid resilience over renewable quotas

2. All-of-the-above energy strategies

3. Corporate tax incentives over project-specific subsidies

This shift aligns with Q1 2025 corporate profit trends:

Energy sector: +5.4% (Q4 2024)]

Manufacturing: -2.9% (Q1 2025)

Tech/services: +7.9% (2024 annual)

The collapse of $3.7 billion in green energy projects coinciding with 0.8% personal income and industrial sector growth validates Resource Erectors’ long-held position: Sustainable industrial growth emerges from market signals, not bureaucratic fiat. Germany’s Energiewende and Spain’s grid failure demonstrate the perils of political engineering, while U.S. policymakers now correct course by:

– Rejecting subsidy-dependent models

– Leveraging private sector innovation

– Maintaining diversified energy portfolios

As Kal Maggie’s “Dear Aggie” column frequently advises, career resilience in heavy industry requires adapting to market realities, not chasing politically fashionable technologies. The summer of 2025 opens new horizons for engineers and heavy industry leaders wise enough to heed these lessons.

With a power purchase agreement, Meta Platforms secured the Clinton Clean Energy Center’s operation, including upgrades and supporting related infrastructure work.

The agreement will preserve over 1,100 local jobs and generate significant local tax revenue, supporting ongoing demand for construction and maintenance.

Constellation Energy is evaluating advanced nuclear options, including new reactors at the Clinton site, which would create new construction opportunities and enhance grid reliability.

Meta Platforms has signed a 20-year nuclear energy agreement with Constellation Energy, securing the entire output of the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois to power its regional operations and advance its clean energy commitments.

The power purchase agreement guarantees the continued operation and relicensing of the Clinton Clean Energy Center, a facility at risk of closure as Illinois’ zero-emission credit program neared expiration.

The deal will expand the plant’s clean energy output by 30 megawatts through targeted facility upgrades.

Over 1,100 local jobs will be preserved, and the project is expected to generate $13.5 million in annual tax revenue for the community and over $1 million in charitable contributions over five years.

Constellation Energy said it “is also evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor (SMR) at the Clinton Clean Energy Center site.”

Impact on Construction and Energy Sectors

Meta’s investment signals a shift in how technology companies drive demand for reliable, clean power to support next-generation data centers. By supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing nuclear plants, Meta and Constellation are helping to stabilize the grid and ensure that critical infrastructure remains operational.

The deal, which begins in June 2027, will provide Meta with 1,121 megawatts of emissions-free nuclear energy, it said in a release. That is enough power to support the company’s growing data center needs as artificial intelligence and related infrastructure demand have surged.

“We are excited to partner with Constellation and the Clinton community to ensure the long-term operations of the nuclear plant, add new capacity, and help preserve over 1,000 jobs. Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” said Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta, in a statement.

Supporting New Nuclear Development

Meta also said it was advancing a nuclear request for proposals (RFP) process, reviewing over 50 submissions from over 20 states.

The company aims to accelerate the early-stage development of 1 to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear projects, prioritizing sites that can deliver quickly and reliably.

Meta said it is “continuing to focus on how [we] can spur new nuclear capacity by partnering to push forward the development of new locations for future nuclear power plants.”

Like other recent energy and infrastructure-related construction projects, this initiative is expected to create opportunities for construction professionals.

Clearing, Collaborating, and Construction

A January 2025 White House executive order directed federal agencies to eliminate regulations and policies that restrict domestic energy production. The order aimed to revoke several conflicting climate-related executive orders and streamline permitting for energy and infrastructure projects, among other initiatives.

Reducing permitting time, lowering regulatory barriers, and increasing opportunities for projects tied to energy development and infrastructure are welcome opportunities to boost nonresidential construction jobs in the US.

Leadership and Economic Benefits

By locking in two decades of nuclear power, Meta is powering its future and helping to strengthen local economies and America’s energy leadership.

The technology, energy, architectural, engineering, and construction sectors have shown a willingness to collaborate to meet the rising energy needs of the digital age.

The Clinton energy agreement is one demonstration of how supporting existing nuclear assets can benefit job creation, tax revenue generation, and the supply of emissions-free energy.

Crux’s world-class team brings together expertise from energy, tax, finance, government, and technology to power an abundant, resilient, and secure energy future.","New insights reveal critical market lending dynamics as potential policy changes threaten capital access for developers and manufacturers

This report pulls back the curtain on financing trends that have historically been opaque, giving project developers and manufacturers insights they need to structure competitive financing packages.”

— Alfred Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Crux

NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, June 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Today, Crux, the capital markets technology company for the clean economy, released its first debt capital report on lending and investment dynamics in the U.S. clean energy and manufacturing sector. This report comes at a time when surging energy demand and policy uncertainty presents both opportunities and challenges for American developers and manufacturers.

Crux is addressing today’s critical need for greater transparency into capital costs, project availability, and investor appetite, just as the company’s authoritative market intelligence reports have done for the transferable tax credit market. Transferable tax credits are driving hundreds of billions in private investment into American energy and manufacturing projects. The credits have also presented an opportunity to centralize otherwise disparate project finance markets for advanced manufacturing, bioenergy, battery storage, critical minerals, and clean energy.

""As we face unprecedented energy demands and shifting geopolitics, the efficiency and transparency of capital markets will determine whether America can successfully build the energy infrastructure of the future,"" said Alfred Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Crux. ""This report pulls back the curtain on financing trends that have historically been opaque, giving project developers and manufacturers the insights they need to structure competitive financing packages.""

Critical Timing Amid Policy Uncertainty:

The report's release comes as potential changes to federal tax credit policies could reshape the financing landscape. If transferable tax credits are scaled back or repealed for certain market segments, clean energy developers and manufacturers will face an even greater need to source alternative financing through debt capital markets. Private debt markets are opaque, illiquid, and inefficient.

""The interconnected nature of clean energy financing means that changes in one area ripple throughout the entire market,"" explained Johnson. ""For example, our data shows that tax credit bridge lending – which allows projects to pull forward the value of future tax credits – has become increasingly accessible, with terms largely driven by advance rates and the presence of committed investment-grade tax credit buyers. If tax credit policies change, understanding these debt market dynamics becomes even more critical for project success.""

Key Market Findings:

There were nearly $340 billion in new American clean energy investments last year, but macroeconomic factors such as interest rate volatility and supply chain inflation continue to impact capital costs. Uncertainty in these variables may dampen appetite for long-duration lending and reduce advance rates, particularly for early-stage projects and those deploying less-established technologies.

For clean energy developers and manufacturers, understanding capital market dynamics has never been more essential.

Key findings from Crux’s market report include:

● Capital markets are increasingly open to a wider variety of projects, but availability varies based on technology, strength of the sponsor, and contracted offtake. Capital is most widely available for solar and storage projects; and nearly all investors at all stages of the development process indicated that solar was a technology that they invest in. Less established technologies — like advanced manufacturing, biofuel, carbon capture, and nuclear — have historically faced challenges accessing debt financing, but in recent years have seen growing interest from investors supported by ​​transferable tax credits.

● Investment structures like tax and preferred equity are highly dynamic and evolving. Tax equity structures have evolved to hybrid structures, or t-flips, which explicitly contemplate the sale of a portion of tax credits in the transfer market. These structures comprised about 60% of the tax equity committed in 2024, and that share is expected to rise. This trend has already expanded the availability of tax equity to a broader range of projects.

● For construction/term lending, projects with contracted offtake generally have greater capital availability and lower cost of capital. However, the data indicates a smaller but meaningful group of lenders are open to merchant or partially contracted projects. While more than 70% of investors indicated that they were more willing to invest in a fully contracted project, some lenders view merchant or partially contracted projects as a better fit for their return requirements.

● Capital markets are likely to continue to expand in both availability and cost-competitiveness, but require a stable and constructive policy environment to do so. Policy volatility is unconstructive for risk-averse project finance lenders, and is likely to disrupt investment. This effect is particularly concentrated in newer technologies, such as nuclear, manufacturing, and biofuels. Whether the market continues its cycle of expansion or whether it recoils back to the most well established wind and solar projects will be a function of ongoing political processes.

Serving the Full Clean Energy Ecosystem:

Unlike previous market analyses that focus primarily on investment-grade sponsors and established technologies, this report provides comprehensive insights into the broader clean energy ecosystem. This includes projects spanning clean fuels, carbon capture, nuclear plants, geothermal, critical minerals production, and advanced manufacturing facilities, by developers and manufacturers ranging from large utilities to regional developers and startups.

Crux launched in early 2023 to supercharge the clean economy by making capital markets more liquid, efficient, and intelligent. The company first tackled the nascent transferable tax credits market: developing the central marketplace for transfers; assembling an expert team; and providing leading market intelligence to help developers and manufacturers exchange tax credits for private sector investment into their companies. By 2024, Crux had expanded its offerings to help developers and manufacturers access liquidity in a range of debt products as well; the Crux debt capital marketplace has a network of over 90 lenders who have collectively issued $1.3B of term sheets, with $700M in term sheets signed, to date.

To date, Crux has facilitated more than 80 transactions totaling billions of dollars in tax credits and loans across advanced manufacturing, battery storage, bioenergy, critical minerals, geothermal, hydropower, microgrids, solar, and wind. More than 630 market participants use Crux’s platform.

The Missing Engineers

The world’s need for power is outstripping the workforce that can build it. Aging populations and anti-immigration rhetoric aren’t helping.

Swedish battery startup Northvolt AB’s bankruptcy filing was preceded by a number of debilitating events: failing to fulfill its contracts with customers; pleas to investors for more cash; ghosting its creditors. But its downfall began with a problem many companies are facing today. There was a severe, years-long struggle to find enough workers with the right skills.

Peter Breuer, who oversaw new factory planning at Northvolt until 2023, says that the startup’s ambitions grew faster than its workforce. “That contributed to its failure,” says Breuer, who is now chief of staff at Peak Energy, another battery startup.

Northvolt wanted to be Europe’s first homegrown lithium-ion battery giant, raising more than $13 billion. And for a while, it seemed like it might succeed. As recently as late 2023, the company was planning to go public with a market valuation of more than $20 billion.

The fall came less than a year later. Northvolt failed to make enough batteries, which led to BMW canceling a contract worth €2 billion ($2.3 billion). When investors didn’t step in, the company filed for bankruptcy in the US in November 2024 and in Sweden in March of this year. Many of these facilities needed staff with sophisticated knowhow to use complex, high-risk production lines typically bought from China and South Korea.

Europe’s aging workforce couldn’t provide them, and bringing in enough experienced workers from battery giants in Asia proved to be a challenge the company couldn’t overcome. “The Northvolt fiasco is a classic example of a great idea in concept, but it falls over on the availability of labor,” said Bas Sudmeijer, managing director at Boston Consulting Group and part of its climate and sustainability practice. Northvolt declined to comment.

A shortage of skilled workers, especially engineers, is a growing problem in developed countries. How do you get more labor? “You either birth them or you import them,” says Zeke Hernandez, professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “But in an environment of declining birth rates, increasing retirements and now a restrictive immigration regime, shortages become quite severe.”

Listen to the Zero podcast: Labor Shortages Are Holding Back Electrification

The US is already unable to fill about a third of its more than 400,000 new engineer roles created each year. The UK will see 20% of its engineers retire by 2030 — leaving a shortfall of 1 million jobs. Japan will see a deficit of 700,000 in that period.

These can have big impacts on the economy. In Britain, the shortage of engineers could wipe 5% from its gross domestic product, according to the think tank Stonehaven. In the US, the lack of skilled workers will hold back President Donald Trump’s attempts to increase manufacturing, even if the tariff regime stabilizes and businesses get ready to invest. Trump’s attacks on US universities’ international students, who tend to study engineering in a greater proportion than domestic students, will likely further sap the supply of skilled workers.

This is the second story in Bottlenecks, a series examining the many obstacles slowing the transition to a cleaner, more electrified future. Read the first story about the shortage of transformers here.

When it doesn’t bankrupt a company or halt a project, skilled worker shortages lead to higher costs and longer timelines to build much-needed infrastructure, such as electricity grids. This is a problem for the US and Europe, which are seeing a surge in demand for power thanks to electric cars, heat pumps and massive data centers. The US utility Xcel Energy Inc. estimates its labor costs have risen 50% in the past five years, outpacing inflation.

There’s also a growing urgency to electrify because it’s a major strategy in fighting climate change. The world recorded its hottest year in 2024 and, on the current trajectory, it’s only years away from blowing past the climate targets set under the Paris Agreement. The quickest way to get back on track is to electrify as much of the global energy system as possible while simultaneously decarbonizing electricity.

The severe shortage of skilled workers is slowing progress towards electrifying everything. Some data center builders in the US are delaying new work, while others are having to plan projects two years in advance instead of six months. Utilities in the UK are struggling to keep up with customer demand for solar panels and EV chargers, while German heat pump customers are having to wait twice as long as French ones.

The problem is expected to get worse. “The demand for future engineers far outstrips the supply,” says Steve Lefton, executive chairman of engineering firm Kimley-Horn, which designs electrical infrastructure. “The workforce shortage has the potential to be an existential threat to our industry.”

Electrification is a more recent vocation than one might think. It was tinkerers, hobbyists and inventors who built the first electric grid in the late 19th century. There was little formal training and people mostly learned on the job.

Among those first grids was the one that Thomas Edison built in New York City in 1882 with the help of people receiving workmen’s wages whom he called ‘muckers.’ The grid powered light bulbs fueled by a coal-fired generator.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the US and Europe saw rapid growth in industrialization and the size of the population, which also meant rising demand for electricity and a skilled workforce.

It’s the kind of trajectory that countries like India and China are experiencing in the 21st century. India doesn’t have a shortage of engineers, but its troubles are more to do with the quality of education. Technology and regulations for the sector are changing very fast. “We don’t put them on the job on day one,” says Jai Prakash Shivahare, managing director of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd., a state-run utility. “They undertake training for 45 days in the office and on the ground.”

In China, grid operators are in the enviable position of choosing among a growing horde of young engineers. Many of those who lost jobs in the tech industry in the past few years are suddenly keen for secure employment at state-owned utilities, known as “iron rice bowls.” Even if the jobs aren’t flashy or high-paying, they’re secure and offer strong benefits.

State Grid Corp. of China, which distributes power across more than 80% of the country, received about 406,000 applications during its 2024 recruitment efforts that ultimately ended with about 26,000 hires, according to financial news provider sina.com.

China’s utilities are also benefiting from a decades-long push in science education. The number of engineers in the nation more than tripled from 2000 to 2020 to 17.7 million, according to the State Council, and many are young. Engineers under the age of 30 account for 44% of the total pool, compared with 20% in the US, according to data compiled by Kaiyuan Securities.

While Asia was booming, electricity demand in the US and Europe remained largely flat or even declined alongside deindustrialization over the past three decades. That saw the industry shed jobs, as people moved to services roles instead.

That’s starting to change as more and more economies — including rich ones — are getting electrified, creating a boom for those industries. But they can only be realized if they can find the workers.

The skilled workforce needed for electrification is wide ranging. Today it’s not just power-systems engineers and battery scientists with advanced degrees; it’s also concrete pourers and electricians. These workers are key to not just manufacturing, but also to building housing and other kinds of desperately needed infrastructure.

The shortage is more severe for engineering roles, which typically need years of study to understand advanced physics, industrial design and complex systems. But ramping up the domestic supply for most types of skilled roles is proving difficult.

Attempts across Western economies to try to boost birth rates have shown little success. “Given the demographic reality, immigration is the most viable solution to the shortage of workers, both in the short term and in the long run,” says Hernandez of Wharton School of Business.

That has been one route that electrification industries have taken. Data shows that immigrants make up big portions of green jobs, from 8% of renewable energy workers in Spain to 26% in Australia, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI).

But the politics around immigration in rich countries has become toxic. “Companies aren’t talking about immigration policy now,” says Julia Gelatt, associate director at MPI. “They are running away from the topic.”

This problem shows up in a more acute way in the UK, which has rapidly shed its industrial past and where many people voted to exit the European Union primarily to slow down legal migration.

Today, less than 10% of Britain's economic output comes from manufacturing. But the net zero emissions economy grew at three times the rate of the country’s economy. That’s why Prime Minister Keir Starmer now sees expanding green jobs as a central part of desperately needed faster economic growth, and that means developing a large portion of the supply chain on the British Isles.

Indian conglomerate Tata Group, under a newly formed company called Agratas, is building an electric-vehicle battery plant in Somerset in southwest England. The batteries will power Tata-owned Jaguar and Land Rover cars and it will mean more than 4,000 new jobs. A second plant is being built by the Nissan Motor Co.-backed joint venture AESC in Sunderland in northeast England. Both facilities are expected to begin production in the early 2030s.

Colin Herron, professor of practice at Newcastle University who is developing training for battery workers to staff these factories, says it’s not at all clear where the employees will come from. “Somerset is full of farmers,” says Herron. “They haven’t a clue what the automotive industry is like.”

But with anti-immigration campaigns winning in elections, companies are being forced to get creative. One idea is to poach workers from other industries.

Jonty Deeley-Williamson, head of learning at the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC), used to make croissants for a living. The battery-making process isn’t all that different, he says. “The machinery [to make pastry] is very similar.”

UKBIC provides space for universities and companies to test their battery innovation. It’s also a training ground to help workers new to the battery industry. Its staff of about 150 includes many who have switched over from food and drug manufacturing. They are familiar with the machinery and used to working on a factory floor.

It’s a learning curve, but less steep than you might think, says Deeley-Williamson. “Instead of using flour or pharmaceuticals, you are now looking at handling a slightly more hazardous substance.”

But the need for staff is so great that it has led to a rapid increase in training academies — many funded directly by companies — that are readying a new generation of workers for electricity-related jobs.

A shortage of skilled people is the main thing holding up UK utility Octopus’s ambitions to dominate the country’s growing markets for solar panels, heat pumps and EV chargers, says John Szymik, chief executive officer of Octopus Energy Services. The company has long waiting lists of customers wanting low-carbon tech.

Octopus needs 4,000 installers by 2030. It’s hard to recruit engineers from abroad, so the company must train them itself. So far, only 36 have started the two-year course that will teach them to install those low-carbon devices at homes and businesses. It’s not the only company seeking more skilled workers. The British government has launched a series of taxpayer-funded programs with the goal of training 18,000 installers as soon as the middle of next year.

“It's not that we don't have the technology or the hardware or solutions,” he says. “It's just how quickly we can physically get people bought into the business [and] trained up.”

In a small classroom wedged inside a cavernous warehouse in northern England’s Rotherham, 11 Octopus apprentices each examine a radiator. The white, suitcase-sized, rectangular object is made of steel, and the piping inside it will transport hot water from an electrically powered heat pump, which will bring a room to a comfortable temperature without a fuel-burning furnace. The apprentices are learning how to hang one on the wall.

Each apprentice has been given an array of shiny copper fixings, a toolbox and their own practice area the size of a restaurant booth. They learned the theory in a PowerPoint presentation in the morning, and now it’s time to put it into practice.

This group is in their fourth month of training; along with classroom time, they also will get on-the-job experience.

One of the apprentices, Ed Connor, 46, spent 26 years in the British Army, retiring as a sergeant managing training for weapons handling and battlefield skills. Connor’s neighbor, an Octopus employee, told him that the company was recruiting for its low-carbon apprenticeship. The students range from teenagers to career-changers like Connor.

Being part of a national effort to install heat pumps has offered Connor a new purpose. “A lot of ex-servicemen do struggle to adjust,” says Connor. “I’ve kind of embraced this Octopus identity,” he says, pointing to the bright pink Octopus logo on his shirt.

Some companies are targeting the young. French power-distribution company Enedis has launched technology classes in 120 high schools and 40 universities. Those who are chosen for its training programs are offered 18-week internships. Daikin Industries Ltd, a gigantic heat-pump maker based in Japan, has doubled the number of training centers it operates across Europe in the last three years.

Alison Tripp, who leads recruiting at DPR Construction Inc., worries about the shortage of construction workers needed to build data centers. To build up the company’s applicant pipeline, she sends recruiters to schools around the US so they can talk up the benefits of being a foreman, concrete worker or — especially right now — an electrician.

“The field positions are really hard,” she says. “There's a labor shortage across the country. Everybody's talking about it. It keeps me up at night.”

DPR Construction builds crucial infrastructure to support the AI boom and employs 11,000 across the world. But often the new power plants and massive data centers it’s building are in remote locations, and the local workforces aren’t sufficient. In those instances, DPR, like an increasing number of companies, will dispatch “travelers,” workers who rent nearby hotel rooms or drive their own recreational vehicles (RVs) to live in near the worksite.

Many utilities that build power lines for data centers also are having to pay more for skilled workers and then recoup those costs from ratepayers. Dominion Energy Inc., the utility that powers Virginia's Data Center Alley, asked regulators for permission to increase residential bills by about $10 per month over the next two years in part because of the high cost of labor.

Clients want projects started and completed quickly but sometimes there just aren't enough workers available, says Joe Sczurko, the US region president at global engineering firm WSP, which designs solar, wind and gas power plants. In those cases, WSP has to work out a more realistic — and longer — deadline with the client.

Another solution is to employ refugees, some of whom have the right technical skills but may lack in language skills or have precarious housing situations. German utility E.ON SE, which has found it hard to recruit software engineers, says it attracts refugees for these roles by offering free language courses and legal support to secure stable accommodation.

Smaller things also can make a difference. Perception can hold back candidates. Some people in the UK see engineering as dirty, a job where grease-laden mechanics toil in garages or on chaotic factory floors.

Office jobs and university education have been prioritized over apprenticeships and trades, according to UKBIC’s Deeley-Williamson. “There does seem to be this bias against manual labor jobs,” he says. His pitch to recruits is that battery clean rooms are tidier than the most sensitive areas of hospitals. “They’re sometimes cleaner than operating theatres.”

GE Vernova Inc. received very few female applicants for heavy duty plant engineering jobs at its electrical-equipment factory in Stafford, UK. Aiming to increase the applicant pool, the company started deleting the word “heavy” in its marketing materials and added photos of women doing the job. As a result, a larger proportion of women started applying for hundreds of new jobs at the Stafford factory to produce transformers, a device necessary for the functioning of the grid.

Highlighting the do-gooder factor of clean energy can also help. Samantha Betts, 37, used to work as a hairdresser in London. But a few years ago she began taking software classes, eventually receiving a job offer from the green British utility Ovo Energy Ltd. “It aligns with my beliefs and things that I'm passionate about,” says Betts. She joined the startup two years ago, and now works on Ovo’s app for customers.

Her hairdressing skills were surprisingly transferable. “You think of a software engineer, you think of the guy in the basement, tapping away,” says Betts. But she's hoping that being used to chatting with people and making them at ease sets her on a path to becoming a manager. “I feel like I still use the same skills every day.”

These domestic attempts are small but necessary. Because even if political opposition to immigration policies could be overcome, it’s not easy to recruit people from abroad given electrification industries are on the upswing everywhere.

Steve Doyle, chief executive officer of EVera Recruitment, specializes in UK-based electric car and battery companies. One of his tasks was to hire battery cell designers, mostly from Japan, South Korea and China, to bring to Britishvolt, the UK’s answer to Northvolt. His team found 500 people in the world who could fill the jobs.

They managed to hire a “grand total of zero,” he says. Britishvolt filed for bankruptcy in 2023.",https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iIXYZ.3kITsI/v0/-1x-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 22:04:45.303886

We have the technology to produce renewable energy; it’s just a matter of cost and placement.","Nicholas Britton’s passion for energy policy began at Dartmouth College, where he majored in environmental studies and helped support the campus’s energy transition. Through fieldwork and research, from New Hampshire to Southern Africa to Washington, D.C., Britton developed a focus on equitable energy access as a means to serve both environmental and social goals.

Now a student in the Master of Public Administration in Environmental Science and Policy (MPA-ESP) program, which is offered by Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs in partnership with the Columbia Climate School, Britton is driven by the belief that equitable energy access is a fundamental human right and a powerful lever for climate and equity solutions. He shares more about this outlook and his experiences below.

Given your diverse background in environmental studies, what drew you to focus on energy?

I originally wanted to study physics, but a seminar at Dartmouth that explored pathways to a low-carbon society shifted my thinking toward the interconnectedness of social, economic, political and scientific issues, as well as how we might tackle these problems on a systems level. That’s when I decided to pursue environmental studies.

The following summer, I worked with the Nature Conservancy in New Hampshire, monitoring conserved lands. I fell in love with the work, but it wasn’t until I started taking energy-related courses at Dartmouth that I became particularly focused on energy issues.

Dartmouth’s campus uses No. 6 fuel oil to heat and power its facilities. No. 6 is one of the dirtiest, least refined forms of oil, full of sulfur and carcinogens that are harmful to air quality and public health. My dorm was right next to the plant, so I watched it pollute the air every winter. That really sparked my interest in finding ways to reduce the campus’s carbon footprint.

My foreign study program in Southern Africa was another defining moment for me. We spent time working with local organizations on conservation efforts, and I saw how rural, low-income communities were often without reliable energy to cook their food and heat their homes. In these areas, even having a solar panel to power basic devices was considered a luxury. This made me realize how vital energy is not just for economic development, but also for health and overall quality of life. In many privileged societies, we take energy for granted, but in communities without reliable access, it’s clear that energy is a fundamental human right. From this, I realized that focusing on energy policy would allow me to make a significant impact on both environmental and social issues.

Does your interest in energy lie more in shaping policy or implementing it?

Before Columbia, I worked with the Energy Futures Initiative (EFI) Foundation in D.C., researching how federal clean energy policies can accelerate decarbonization through technologies and different pathways. It was important work, but I realized that I wanted a role where I could be more involved in the implementation of these policies or the development of clean energy projects, rather than just researching or discussing them.

That’s what really drew me to the MPA-ESP program. It offers management courses and energy-focused classes that equip me with the practical skills to apply these policies. I want to move beyond just the policy ideas and contribute to bringing these solutions to life.

How do you think about equity in energy policy?

At EFI, I worked on a project exploring how federal investments might affect disadvantaged communities. We focused on places like Cancer Alley in Louisiana, and parts of West Virginia, where fossil fuel industries have long shaped economic and health outcomes.

A central concern was ensuring that the billions being invested in clean energy actually benefit these communities, not just the industries replacing fossil fuels. A key takeaway was that community engagement needs to be accessible. Many residents work multiple jobs or face resource constraints, so it’s critical for government and industry to make participation easier. The federal government plays a vital role in convening stakeholders and ensuring resources are equitably distributed. This research helped me realize how important it is to have policies that don’t just focus on energy innovation, but also on how those innovations are implemented to support communities that have been historically marginalized.

You’re working on an energy-focused capstone with a client from EFI. What has that experience been like and can you explain more about the project?

It was kind of crazy at first because my client was my boss when I joined EFI, so this felt like a full-circle moment. The team is enthusiastic about the topic, and we’re approaching the capstone a bit differently from my previous work. I’m glad I can contribute the insights I gained while also learning from my peers.

Our client is Clean Tomorrow, a D.C.-based nonprofit that focuses on effective clean energy policy deployment. Our project examines state-level policies that help distribute benefits to communities, particularly given the current uncertainty around many federal community benefit programs. We’re exploring mechanisms like legally binding agreements between towns and wind developers, and tax structures that return energy revenues to residents. Some of our research has focused on oil- and gas-producing states like New Mexico and Wyoming, where fossil fuel revenues fund local services like schools and municipalities. This reliance is both deeply embedded and volatile, with state budgets vulnerable to price swings.

Our research has focused on how we might adapt this model for renewable energy, looking at examples where states have used renewable energy revenues to benefit local communities. One such example is property taxes from wind and solar farms. We’re exploring these structures to see if they can provide a more stable revenue source for communities while supporting the transition to clean energy. We’re looking at seven states to compare how each handles these challenges, with the goal of providing our client with a state-by-state analysis.

How do you navigate the fact that fossil fuels are so entrenched in society?

It’s definitely a tough issue. On a societal scale, the reality is that fossil fuels are still deeply embedded in daily life, especially through products like plastics and in sectors like healthcare. We won’t move away from them overnight, but there’s room for real progress in electricity. We have the technology to produce renewable energy; it’s just a matter of cost and placement. But transitioning is slow, and local resistance to new energy infrastructure is a big barrier, whether it’s a solar farm or a coal plant.

Outside of your studies, how do you spend your free time?

I love exploring New York. I’m really into live music and saw a local Brooklyn band, Geese, at their festival last year. I also like to run along the Hudson River Greenway and through Central Park to unwind. I live in Hell’s Kitchen, so I’ve been enjoying Broadway shows and great food in the neighborhood, especially Thai food. It’s been great to balance the busy school life with these activities.",https://media.news.climate.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/britton_image-1300x975.jpeg,N,,2025-06-04 22:04:49.306996

Keefe said West Virginia jobs in construction, manufacturing and other sectors in Huntington, Wayne County and other places in the state will be affected if the U.S. Senate were to vote in favor of a portion of the budget which calls for cutting clean energy tax credits.

Keefe made the announcement a few days after officials at Core Natural Resources, citing the market, warned more than 200 miners at Itmann Mine #5 in Wyoming County that they would face a lay-off in early August, if mine operations did not improve.

“Look, every job is important. Every coal job is important,” Keefe said on Wednesday. “What’s killing coal is not clean energy. What’s killing coal is that coal companies continue to automate and also, frankly, the economics have caught up with the energy industry.”

The proposal mirrors rescissions and policies laid out in the House reconciliation bill in pulling back on clean energy initiatives in the name of Republicans’ “energy independence” goals. But the Senate committee didn’t provide a figure showing the impact on the deficit. The panel had been directed by the budget resolution to deliver provisions that would increase the deficit by no more than $1 billion.

“This legislative text puts in motion plans that Senate Republicans pledged to take, like stopping Democrats’ natural gas tax and rescinding unobligated dollars from the so-called Inflation Reduction Act,” Environment and Public Works Chairman Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said in a statement, referring to the 2022 reconciliation law.

The title would pause for a decade the enforcement of the tax on certain methane emissions that was included in the 2022 law and rescind all unobligated funds provided for the collection of the tax.

Twenty-five of the 28 sections in the Senate panel’s title relate to the full or partial repeal of programs established by the 2022 law, according to a section-by-section summary released with the bill text. The committee also released a one-page description of the provisions.

The proposal would rescind unobligated funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, environmental and climate justice block grants, and for clean heavy-duty vehicles.

The provisions would also repeal a Biden-administration EPA tailpipe emissions rule for light- and medium-duty vehicles — a regulation that Republicans have called a “mandate” to switch to electric vehicles. The EPA has already said that it would work to repeal the regulation through the rulemaking process, but a legislative repeal would save the agency time and resources.

The bill would also provide $257 million to the Kennedy Center that is “necessary for capital repair, restoration, maintenance backlog and security structures of the building and site.” The House bill would do the same.

The Senate provisions would also mirror the House bill by creating an opt-in fee that would allow project sponsors to pay for an expedited review under the National Environmental Policy Act. The fee would be equal to 125 percent of the costs to prepare the environmental reviews, and the provision sets a one-year timeline for completion of an impact statement and a six-month timeline for an environmental assessment.

Now that a bit of time has passed since the House passed its big budget bill that would largely gut the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits, a number of research groups have assessed the impacts and consequences that would result from passing the bill. In a word, they would be bad. Really bad.

Three organizations (Princeton REPEAT, Energy Innovation, and Rhodium Group) evaluated the impacts of the entire budget bill, while five others (Aurora Energy Research, Resources for the Future, Brattle Group, National Economic Research Associates, and Solar Energy Industries Association) looked specifically at the repeal of the clean electricity tax credits that have been a focus of CCL’s advocacy.

I’ll group their findings into four categories below, and for more specific details about the findings of these reports, see this Nerd Corner post on CCL’s Community forums.

It’s effectively an electricity and gas tax

If the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits are repealed, fewer clean energy projects will financially pencil out and be built. That means less clean and cheap power sources will be deployed at a time when electricity demand is expected to rise fast due to rapidly expanding data centers, artificial intelligence, electrification of vehicles and buildings, and air conditioning use as temperatures rise.

And as the law of supply and demand tells us, if demand goes up faster than supply can meet it, prices will increase as a result. The reports estimate that repealing the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits will result in annual American household electricity bills becoming more expensive, by between $46 and $160 over the next decade.

But it’s not just electricity prices that will rise. If fewer clean energy sources are deployed, utilities will have to burn more natural gas to meet rising power demand. The law of supply and demand again tells us that this will make natural gas prices rise, by an estimated 2–7%. That will contribute to higher home heating and cooking bills for households with gas appliances.

Repealing the electric vehicle tax credits will also result in tens of millions fewer EVs on American roads in the 2030s. That means more demand for gasoline, which means higher prices at the pump. Resources for the Future estimates that gasoline prices will be about 10 cents per gallon more expensive than if the EV tax credits remain in place. And since fueling up an EV costs about $1,000 less per year than a gasoline car, tens of millions of Americans will miss out on those savings too. Overall, American household vehicle fueling costs would rise by an estimated $40 to $200 per year, on average, on top of the similarly higher electricity costs.

It would imperil American manufacturing, jobs, and economic growth

Hundreds of new clean energy projects have been announced since the IRA was signed into law, representing hundreds of thousands of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in communities around the country. You can explore the investments in your state and district using CCL’s IRA projects database. As MIT and Rhodium’s Clean Investment Monitor illustrates, the vast majority of those investments have been in batteries, EVs, and solar panels.

Repealing the IRA’s clean electricity and EV tax credits would imperil many of these projects and their associated jobs and local economic benefits. The Princeton team estimated that if the EV tax credit were repealed, we may already have enough manufacturing capacity in place to meet the reduced American demand for EVs by 2030. We wouldn’t need to build any more domestic EV or battery manufacturing capacity, and companies might even have to reduce output and lay off workers from some of the factories that have already been built.

Without the clean electricity tax credits, there would also be less demand for US solar and battery and wind manufacturing, and fewer construction jobs building new clean power facilities. Overall, the experts estimate that hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost throughout the US economy, and the country’s gross domestic product could decrease by more than $1 trillion as a result.

It would reduce our energy security

At a time when power demand is rising rapidly, natural gas turbines are facing years of delivery backlogs. Many experts have concluded that clean electricity – especially solar panels and batteries, which accounted for over 80% of new US electricity generation capacity added in 2024 – are the only sources that can be deployed fast enough to meet that rapidly growing demand. The less new power generation we build, the higher the risk not only of high electricity prices, but also of power outages and blackouts. Just look at Texas, which had no problem navigating a spring heatwave thanks to its high deployment of solar and batteries.

Experts estimate that US power demand will increase by 25–50% over the next decade, after rising by less than 10% over the previous two decades. Because of natural gas turbine backlogs, they won’t be able to meet more than one-third of the increased peak power demand. But the expert analyses find that repealing the tax credits would cut the amount of new clean power generation built over the next decade in half, putting Americans at greater risk of blackouts.

It would increase pollution and worsen Americans’ health

Repealing these investments in clean energy technologies would of course also increase both climate and air pollution. The reports estimate that doing so would leave US climate pollution just 20–30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Total emissions would be an estimated 1.5 to 3 billion tons higher over the next decade than if the IRA is protected. That’s equivalent to jamming an extra six months’ worth of US climate pollution into the next decade.

An increase in local air pollution would further harm public health, leading to thousands of extra premature American deaths over the next decade, according to Energy Innovation’s analysis.

To summarize, while repealing the IRA would save the government around $500 billion over the next decade, it would also cost:

$1 trillion in economic growth and around $2,000 per American household in higher energy costs

Hundreds of thousands of lost domestic manufacturing and construction jobs

Reduced energy security and a higher risk of blackouts

And certainly what's good for the economy is not doing anything that would risk losing thousands of jobs,"" Miller said.
Some 330,000 solar industry jobs are at risk if the tax credits aren't extended, according to a new report from the Solar Energy Industries Association, which estimates Utah could lose 2,700 jobs.","SALT LAKE CITY — Business leaders in Utah are warning of potentially dire economic impacts if the U.S. Senate moves ahead with plans to cut green energy tax credits in President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill.""

Those credits, included in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, have been targeted by House Republicans and would be phased out within 60 days of the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — at least as it's currently written. The White House took aim at the energy credits Tuesday, celebrating that the megabill ""repeals and rescinds every 'green' corporate welfare subsidy in Democrats' so-called 'Inflation Reduction Act.'""

But as senators rush to put their own stamp on the bill to send back to the House ahead of Trump's July 4 deadline, businesses in Utah that have benefited from the credits are urging Sens. Mike Lee and John Curtis to help rescue them. Tax credits for energy have been around for decades, they argue, and shouldn't be politicized simply because the latest iteration was approved under former President Joe Biden.

In fact, they argue, the tax credits could be key to accomplishing Trump's goal of American energy dominance.

""I fear that these specific credits are being lumped into and having a label put on them as being either progressive or leftist ... when that's not the case,"" said Derek Miller, president and CEO of the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce. ""The solar credits have been something that's been bipartisan for a long, long time, but more importantly they ought to be taken out of the political realm at all.

""We ought to be asking ourselves: 'What's good for the economy?' And certainly what's good for the economy is not doing anything that would risk losing thousands of jobs,"" Miller said.

Some 330,000 solar industry jobs are at risk if the tax credits aren't extended, according to a new report from the Solar Energy Industries Association, which estimates Utah could lose 2,700 jobs. Miller said that only captures the direct job losses, however, and up to 7,500 jobs could be impacted by downstream effects.

""Manufacturing is one of those industries where it has a multiplier effect,"" he said, ""so one job in manufacturing can create, for example, three or four jobs throughout the economy just by virtue of its impact.""

The tax credits aren't just a boon to local economies; they will help the U.S. meet growing energy needs as an artificial intelligence arms race heats up with China. Paul Dickson, president and chief revenue officer of Sunrun, which merged with Vivint Solar in 2020, argued the ""stigma"" of the Inflation Reduction Act is misleading policymakers to push for the cuts.

""Lawmakers are open to cutting those things, not fully understanding some of the implications,"" he said. ""Essentially, the proposal that currently sits is to cut this multidecade existing motivation for promoting the generation of new electrons onto the grid.""

As the country's largest purchaser of Tesla Powerwall batteries — used to store solar energy for powering homes during outages or overnight — Dickson said the spending bill would significantly hinder Sunrun's ability to continue to bring more power generation and storage online.

The Lehi-based company's current assets are equivalent to the energy capacity of seven nuclear power plants, Dickson said, and each year Sunrun adds the equivalent of an additional nuclear plant's worth of power capacity.

""So, we're bringing on meaningful supply, and the current proposal would kill all of that generation and pull it off the grid,"" he said.

Miller said the solar industry has an outsized footprint in the Beehive State because of Vivint, a homegrown company that embraced solar, and because it has the workforce to sell home solar door-to-door.

""These are young men and young women who are used to going out and knocking on doors when they serve missions,"" he said. ""And they come back and they go to college, and then they spend the summer knocking on doors — but instead of handing out copies of the Book of Mormon, they're signing people up for home security systems or home solar installations.""

Solar advocates already have one of Utah's senators on board with reversing the rollback on tax credits: Curtis told reporters last week the Senate should reconsider the cuts and penned a Deseret News op-ed to that effect Wednesday.

Miller and Dickson said they're appealing to Lee, who has expressed his own issues with the spending included in the bill and told the Deseret News in April he wants to overturn the Inflation Reduction Act ""lock, stock and barrel."" Dickson said Lee is ""incredibly thoughtful, understands the issue thoroughly and is actively engaging with our team and his staff ... to help make thoughtful recommendations for an appropriate path forward.""

""Sen. Lee is a friend,"" Miller said, adding that he has not spoken to the senior senator but plans to by the end of the week. ""He's been helpful in the past. I expect that what would matter most to him are the issue of Utah jobs and then his point of a level playing field (for different types of energy) and getting rid of tax credits.

""But my message to him would be: Let's not cut off our nose to spite our face and get rid of an important part of our energy portfolio — nationally and especially in Utah.""

John Curtis, Bill Gates push for geothermal

With Congress out of session last week, Curtis toured the Fervo Energy Cape Station geothermal project in Beaver along with billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. Curtis has advocated for an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy and called geothermal ""critical"" to making energy ""affordable, reliable and clean"" for Americans.

""Utah is at the forefront of energy innovation, and the Cape Station geothermal project in Beaver is a powerful example of that progress,"" the senator said. ""This project highlights what's possible when private investment is matched with government collaboration to provide the right tools for success. I'm hopeful it will drive new opportunity, strengthen rural communities and showcase the kind of results that come from pairing innovation with Utah's work ethic.""

Gates said the project ""is what happens when great science, smart policy and American entrepreneurship come together.""

The Trump administration has proposed ending the program, but in a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Gallego wrote Energy Star saves Arizonans money by providing them independent assurance that products from appliances to homes are energy-efficient investments.

“With energy prices continuing to be a top concern for American families, programs like Energy Star are more critical than ever,” Gallego wrote Zeldin, a former congressman from New York.

The Energy Star program was launched in 1992 during President George H.W. Bush’s administration. The goal was to emphasize the alignment between economic growth, energy efficiency and air quality protection. Business leaders and environmentalists were behind the idea, and Energy Star has enjoyed bipartisan support ever since.

If you ask Gallego, it pays for Arizonans to have something such as Energy Star in place. The first-term senator said “a typical household can save about $450 annually on their energy bills” by choosing Energy Star products. Gallego added that 45% of Arizona’s housing and rental market is Energy Star-certified.

“The state boasts 270 participating businesses and organizations, including 14 manufacturers of Energy Star certified products and 140 companies constructing certified homes, apartments, commercial buildings, and schools,” wrote Gallego. “Energy Star utility partners serve 3.2 million customers and support thousands of facilities – including schools, hotels, hospitals, office buildings, and industrial plants.”

Eliminating the Energy Star program would, according to Gallego, be “a shortsighted decision” undermining decades of consumer savings and the conservation of energy.

“I strongly urge you to reconsider any efforts to eliminate the Energy Star program,” wrote Gallego. “Its continued operation is essential to advancing our shared goals of economic growth, energy efficiency, and making life more affordable for all Americans.”

SUBMITTED BY THE ILLINOIS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

CHICAGO, Ill. – The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency has issued an Air Pollution Action Day for the Chicago Metropolitan area for Thursday, June 5 due to elevated particle pollution.

The Action Day includes the counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Grundy, Lake, McHenry and Will. Regional air quality is expected to reach the “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” (USG)/Orange category on the national Air Quality Index (AQI) today and is expected to extend into tomorrow due to wildfire smoke in the region. This is the first Action Day issued by Illinois EPA for 2025.

Canadian wildfire smoke at the surface is expected throughout much of Illinois today, June 4th, and tomorrow June 5th, with the highest concentrations in the northern third of the state. Surface smoke may at times have impacts further south in areas with a Moderate/Yellow daily 24-hour PM2.5 forecast as well. Hourly NowCast AQI readings may show higher categories than what is forecast to help identify periods of higher 1-hour PM2.5/smoke. Those with air quality concerns can check current NowCast readings or sign up for EnviroFlash alerts on AirNow.gov.

In Illinois, a Chicago Air Pollution Action Day is issued when air quality is forecasted to be at or above the USG/Orange category for two or more consecutive days for Chicago Metropolitan area. Wildfire smoke is expected to continue to have an impact on particulate levels with daily 24-hour AQI forecast for particle pollution at the orange/USG level on June 4th and June 5th, posing a potential health hazard to sensitive populations. Individuals most at risk due to elevated air pollution, including ground-level ozone and particle pollution, are those with respiratory or pulmonary disorders, as well as children and adults who are active outdoors. Sensitive individuals should follow their doctor’s advice. Some symptoms to look out for include wheezing, coughing, a fast heartbeat, fatigue, chest pain, and shortness of breath. If symptoms worsen, you should call your physician or 911.

The Illinois Department of Public Health has established a Wildfire Smoke webpage to provide resources and information. In addition, the U.S. EPA has developed an Air Quality Guide for Particle Pollution at: https://document.airnow.gov/air-quality-guide-for-particle-pollution.pdf.

The Illinois EPA issues daily air quality forecasts, based on the AQI, for 14 sectors throughout Illinois. The AQI is a color-coded system that classifies air quality from Good to Hazardous. All air quality forecasts are available at AirNow.gov. In addition to the AirNow.gov, residents can subscribe to FREE air quality forecasts and alerts through the EnviroFlash program and download the Free AIRNow App for iPhone and Android phones: iPhone App | Android App.

Businesses and residents in the region are encouraged to take the listed steps below to reduce contributions to air pollution every day, but especially on Action Days. Actions include:

Limit driving – combine errands, walk, or bike if possible.

If driving, avoid idling, consolidate errands, and keep your vehicle and other engines properly tuned.

Conserve energy to reduce energy demands.

Use environmentally friendly household and cleaning products.

Avoid using gasoline-powered equipment like lawnmowers and leaf blowers on Air Pollution Action Days.

Notify colleagues, friends, and family to help protect their health and encourage actions.",https://thelansingjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/featured-image_640.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 20:08:21.286728

All submitted comments are included in the Detroit District’s administrative record, analyzed, and considered in the preparation of the Final EIS and other parts of the District’s review, as applicable.

“Even when operating under emergency procedures, the Detroit District remains committed to following the NEPA process,” said Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff.

The Line 5 Tunnel Project is a proposal by Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership (Enbridge) to construct a tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac in Lake Michigan. The tunnel would house a replacement segment of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, which transports crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Detroit District is reviewing Enbridge’s permit application (File LRE-2010-00463-56-A19) pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for a Department of the Army permit.

The EIS assesses the potential impacts of the Line 5 Tunnel Project and project alternatives (including the No Action alternative, an alternative that would install a protective gravel/rock cover over the existing Dual Pipelines in the Straits, and multiple pipeline decommissioning sub-alternatives, if the proposed tunnel were to be permitted) to land use and recreation; aesthetics; water resources; biological resources; cultural resources; geology; soils; transportation and navigation; air quality; noise and vibration; socioeconomics; and reliability and safety.

In addition to its consideration of cultural resources in the EIS, the Corps of Engineers is separately evaluating impacts to historic properties, as well as impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act

The Corps of Engineers is also conducting a treaty rights analysis in consultation with federally recognized Tribes to determine if the proposed Line 5 Tunnel Project would impinge upon or abrogate treaty rights. Findings of the Section 106 process and treaty rights analysis will be presented in the Record of Decision following release of the Final EIS.

The Record of Decision date is anticipated in fall 2025.

“The Detroit District continues to prepare the Final EIS and comply with all applicable legal and policy requirements, including its federal trust responsibility to Tribal Nations, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act,” Lt.

The European Commission’s Clean Industrial Deal marks a bold step toward securing Europe’s industrial competitiveness while accelerating its transition to a low-carbon economy. By simplifying state aid rules, the plan aims to fast-track investments in clean technologies. To achieve its full potential, however, the plan must embrace a balanced, inclusive strategy that recognises the role of diverse clean energy technologies in Europe’s industrial transformation, including nuclear energy.

A diverse energy mix is essential for industrial decarbonisation

Europe’s most energy intensive sectors – such as steel, cement, and chemicals – require large volumes of continuous power and high-temperature heat. Variable renewables like wind and solar have driven much of the EU’s energy transition to date, but will need to be complemented by clean firm power to meet these needs at the scale or reliability that industry demands, particularly given land constraints and intermittency challenges. Adding more clean firm power in Europe through technologies such as nuclear fission, fusion energy, or geothermal, can help to complement weather dependent generation reducing the need for extensive transmission infrastructure and decreasing land-use pressures resulting in enhanced speed of decarbonisation.

To meet the needs of the industrial sector, the EU’s State Aid Framework must adopt a technology-neutral approach, empowering Member States to deploy the solutions best suited to their resources and industrial needs, and the energy mix they decide on. This means supporting not just wind and solar, but also nuclear power, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and clean hydrogen. Ultimately, a diverse energy portfolio is in the best interest of the EU institutions and its Member States, helping to reduce their reliance on fossil fuel imports, strengthen energy security, and keep pace with global competitors like China, which are already investing heavily in advanced nuclear and other low-carbon technologies.

Nuclear energy can deliver both clean power and industrial heat

Heavy industries account for over half of Europe’s energy consumption, much of which goes toward heat production – a sector still dominated by fossil fuels. Nuclear reactors, especially small modular reactors (SMRs), offer a more flexible solution by providing carbon-free electricity and high-temperature heat directly to industrial facilities. These systems can be deployed alongside industrial facilities, slashing emissions from the existing on-site fossil generation. In European context, although not widespread nuclear heat has been deployed for both process applications and well as for district networks. Gösgen NPP in Switzerland is an example of a traditional NPP that delivers heat to nearby cardboard and paper factory as well as to a local district heating network. Co-location of SMRs and industrial facilities is gaining momentum amongst EU nuclear projects developers, e.g. OSGE aiming to deploy SMRs across six sites in Poland.

As Europe continues to bolster its industrial decarbonisation and energy sovereignty efforts, Europe’s nuclear sector needs crucial funding support that national state aid already provides to other clean technologies. Yet the current draft of the State Aid Framework update sidelines nuclear energy in critical areas. It prioritises “renewable heat” but overlooks the potential of carbon-free heat from nuclear reactors. Even more concerning, it also imposes strict deadlines that could block new nuclear projects, which often require longer construction timelines.

To address this, CATF recommends that the EU state aid framework:

Deploy strategic financing mechanisms for clean energy projects to guarantee stable electricity prices and revenue certainty.

Replace rigid timelines with milestone-based deadlines tied to project phases, such as final investment decisions or reactor commissioning.

Ensure nuclear energy receives funding parity with other clean technologies, such as CCS and hydrogen, which currently qualify for 30–50% state aid intensity.

A level playing field is essential to unlock nuclear energy’s full potential in securing Europe’s industrially competitive, low-carbon economy future. To accomplish this, the EU must also create market structures that reward grid reliability and long-term affordability.

Long-term contracts like PPAs and CfDs can stabilize energy costs for industry

Long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and Contracts for Difference (CfDs) could play a pivotal role in decarbonising industry by guaranteeing stable electricity prices and revenue certainty for clean energy projects. Nuclear energy PPAs, in particular, offer a unique advantage: they provide industries with 24/7 carbon-free power at predictable costs, shielding businesses from volatile fossil fuel prices. This makes nuclear energy a compelling option for utilities and corporations aiming to meet environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals while maintaining competitiveness.

Europe needs to strengthen its nuclear energy supply chain

Europe’s nuclear energy revival hinges on a robust manufacturing ecosystem. The EU’s Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) rightly identifies SMRs as “strategic” for decarbonising energy-intensive sectors, but state aid rules must go further to support localised production of critical components like reactor pressure vessels and nuclear fuel. Without this, Europe risks relying on foreign suppliers, undermining its energy independence. EU manufactories involved into the nuclear supply chain could provide additional boost to the EU economy.

To scale SMRs efficiently, the EU should prioritise factory-built modular reactors, which can slash construction costs and timelines. Cross-border “Nuclear Valleys” in countries like Poland and Romania – supported by EU funding programs – could mass-produce standardised reactor designs, addressing supply chain bottlenecks. Aligning state aid provisions with the NZIA’s goals would also help fast-track permits and unlock grants for strategic nuclear projects, ensuring Europe remains a leader in clean tech innovation.

Targeted incentives can unlock private investment

Nuclear energy projects face high upfront costs, but smart policies can attract private capital. The EU should incorporate:

Accelerated depreciation schemes, which allow companies to deduct investments faster from taxable income, would reduce financial burdens and improve project viability.

Flexible loan guarantees covering up to 70% of capital costs for SMR factories, de-risking investments in next-gen nuclear infrastructure.

With these tools, the EU can be a leader in unlocking private investment for nuclear to allow Member States interested in diversifying their energy portfolios to become energy secure and meet their EU decarbonisation targets. This is especially crucial for Member States historically left out of private economic investments, such as Central and Eastern Europe.

Scaling deployment reduces costs

Early nuclear energy projects may carry higher costs, but these will decline with standardisation, stronger supply chains and learning by doing. History offers a lesson here: early wind and solar projects were once expensive, but costs plummeted as technologies matured, and production scaled thanks to wide subsidy support. Nuclear energy is poised to follow the same trajectory if the right incentives are put in place. By standardising reactor designs and fostering cross-border collaboration, Europe can drive down costs through repeatable projects – transitioning from costly first-of-a-kind (FOAK) units to affordable nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) deployments within the decade.

A fair shot for all clean technologies

Europe’s economic and climate goals depend on a pragmatic, inclusive strategy that harnesses a broad portfolio of low-carbon solutions. By integrating nuclear energy into the Clean Industrial Deal’s State Aid Framework, the EU can ensure industries have access to reliable clean power, strengthen its energy security, and reclaim leadership in the global clean tech race.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/24110244/CATF_NuclearAtom_Hero_1a.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 20:08:09.000932

Beginning in 2027, this agreement will ensure a steady supply of clean energy. This will help Meta grow its AI operations and cut carbon emissions.

Nuclear energy is low in carbon and reliable, making it a good choice for big tech companies. As these companies increase their green power commitments, they also face more regulatory pressure.

Why Meta Is Betting Big on Nuclear for Its AI Future

Meta signed a long-term contract to support its growing energy needs. This is important as its AI infrastructure expands in Illinois. AI data centers use a lot of electricity, and nuclear power provides a reliable and strong energy source.

Moreover, nuclear doesn’t emit greenhouse gases while running. This makes nuclear a strong alternative to fossil fuels, which still dominate much of the U.S. energy landscape.

Constellation Energy will supply energy from the Clinton Clean Energy Center. This nuclear plant currently powers about 800,000 homes. As part of the deal, the plant will boost output by 30 megawatts to meet increased demand from Meta’s operations.

The agreement lets Meta boost its AI skills using clean energy, not coal or gas. This helps the tech giant lead in the shift to sustainable power.

RELATED: Meta Bets Big on Nuclear Power and $10B on AI Data Center to Meet its Sustainability Target

The Environmental Edge of Meta’s Nuclear Pact

Nuclear power plays a key role in reducing carbon footprints. Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear energy does not emit CO2 when generating electricity. Meta’s new deal helps the company limit its environmental impact while supplying the massive energy needs of AI systems.

Nuclear power accounts for about 20% of the U.S. energy supply. This helps reduce the emissions that contributes to climate change.

The World Nuclear Association says that since 1971, nuclear energy use has stopped more than 64 gigatons of CO2 emissions. That equals removing every car from U.S. roads for 14 years. Worldwide, about 10% of power comes from nuclear.

Meta boosts the argument for nuclear energy in climate efforts by using Illinois’ nuclear network. This network already provides more than half of the state’s electricity.

The Clinton plant will keep running under this deal. This helps the environment by stopping new fossil-fuel plants from being built. It also cuts down the need for carbon-heavy peaker plants used during peak power times.

What’s the Economic Impact of This Energy Agreement?

The Clinton Clean Energy Center will maintain more than 1,100 local jobs and generate roughly $13.5 million in annual tax revenue. That’s a big boost for the state’s economy. It shows how clean energy investments help the environment and support local jobs.

Meta’s partnership with Constellation shows that nuclear power is not only good for the environment but also makes economic sense. By securing fixed energy costs in the long term, companies like Meta can avoid price volatility in fossil fuels. With AI and data center growth accelerating, this kind of cost stability becomes even more critical.

How Does This Fit Into Tech’s Clean Energy Strategy?

Tech companies increasingly look to clean energy like nuclear to power their operations while reducing emissions. Meta plans to reach 100% renewable energy use for all global operations by 2025. The map below shows where its renewable energy projects are.

Signing long-term clean energy deals supports this goal. It also helps the company meet climate reporting and disclosure rules from investors and governments.

According to the International Energy Agency, global investments in renewable energy will surpass $1 trillion annually. Much of this growth is being driven by corporate buyers like Meta, who are paving the way with large-scale power purchase agreements.

The partnership with Constellation boosts Meta’s goal to lead in sustainability. It also helps support clean energy infrastructure.

Why Does Nuclear Energy Appeal to Big Tech?

Nuclear energy offers constant output, unlike solar or wind, which depend on the weather. For data centers that require 24/7 energy supply, this reliability is critical. It avoids downtime and reduces the need for diesel generators or carbon-heavy energy backups. With AI functions demanding even more power than traditional digital systems, nuclear becomes a logical choice.

Federal energy policies are also evolving to support expanded nuclear capacity. The Biden administration, for example, has called for tripling global nuclear capacity by 2050. That momentum adds long-term policy backing for deals like Meta’s, helping reinforce nuclear’s key role in the clean energy grid.

The Market Trends Behind This Move

Meta’s move reflects a growing trend among tech leaders to sign long-term clean energy contracts. Market leaders like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have already invested heavily in solar and wind. Now, these companies are focusing on nuclear power. They want clean energy that’s always available. This energy can support big operations, like AI data centers.

This trend aligns with expected growth in clean energy investments, particularly in more reliable forms of power. The U.S. market continues to prioritize decarbonization, and nuclear energy stands out by offering consistent output with zero emissions during operation. Meta’s decision highlights nuclear’s rising appeal in a changing energy market.

What Challenges Still Remain?

Despite nuclear power’s advantages, scaling up remains difficult. New plants face long construction times and high upfront costs. The U.S. is only building a few new reactors, and existing infrastructure requires upgrades. Modernizing the grid and improving energy storage are crucial. They will help ensure clean energy supplies run smoothly.

Still, Meta’s investment helps keep the conversation active around nuclear’s potential. It supports existing plants, encourages innovation, and strengthens demand for new regulatory solutions and financing methods.

More notably, President Donald Trump recently signed a series of executive orders aimed at revitalizing and transforming the U.S. nuclear energy sector. These orders focus on accelerating reactor development, easing regulatory barriers, increasing domestic uranium production, and reforming the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

As storms intensify and weather patterns become more extreme, climate change is no longer a future concern — it's showing up on doorsteps today. In 2023, natural disasters forced 2.5 million Americans from their homes and inflicted $92.9 billion in property damage. From devastating hurricanes to unprecedented wildfires, these events reshape how we think about home safety and resilience. By making these upgrades, you can protect your home while being part of the climate solution.

Enhance your home’s envelope

Yur home's envelope — its exterior walls, roof, windows and doors — is your first line of defense against extreme weather. These following improvements can protect your home from environmental challenges and reduce energy costs:

Install storm doors and windows, which can save you up to 30% on heating and cooling costs.

Strengthen your roof with hurricane straps to reinforce the connection between the roof truss and the wall plate.

Upgrade to Class 4 impact-resistant roofing materials designed to withstand hail, wind and sleet.

Seal any gaps or cracks in walls and around windows to prevent air leakage.

Improve insulation in your attic, walls and floors to maintain indoor temperatures.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that homeowners can save an average of 11% on total energy costs by air sealing their homes and adding insulation.

Improve flood protection

Anywhere it can rain, it can flood. Check FEMA’s Flood Map Service Center to learn about your home’s flood risk level before making upgrades. Protective measures include:

Installing check valves to prevent sewage backup.

Elevating critical systems like electrical panels and HVAC units.

Equipping your home with a sump pump that has a battery backup.

Redirecting water away from your foundation using French drains and strategic landscaping.

Adding a rain barrel to manage runoff.

Strengthen wildfire defenses

If wildfires are a concern, fireproofing your home should be a priority.

Use non-combustible roofing materials such as metal, concrete and clay tiles.

Surround your home with fire-resistant landscaping. Opt for plant species with high moisture content, like dogwood, sycamore and magnolia.

Remove flammable vegetation near your home to create a defensible space.

Install a spark arrestor for chimneys and stovepipes.

Invest in solar panels

Solar energy reduces utility costs while contributing to clean, renewable power generation. Although the initial investment can be substantial, financial incentives, such as a federal tax credit covering up to 30% of eligible installation costs, make solar systems more accessible. Solar panels decrease reliance on fossil fuels, lower greenhouse gas emissions and provide extra protection to your roof from weather-related wear and tear.

Prepare for power outages

Extreme weather often brings power outages, so it’s important to have backup systems in place. Consider investing in a backup generator or a solar battery system to power essential appliances like refrigerators, medical devices and lighting. LED lights and energy-efficient appliances can help conserve power, ensuring your resources last longer.

Adopt smart home technology

Put smart technology to work protecting your home. Some options include:

Weather-monitoring systems for real-time alerts.

Smart water sensors can detect leaks or flooding early.

Smart air purifiers to detect pollution and restore clean air to your space.

Advanced home security systems provide added peace of mind during severe weather or evacuations.

Your climate resiliency roadmap

Climate resilience isn't a universal blueprint. Your home's specific upgrades will depend on your geographic location and local climate risks.

Start by assessing your specific risks based on your location. Then, prioritize upgrades that address your most significant vulnerabilities. Remember, the goal isn't just protecting your property — it's ensuring your family has a safe, comfortable home regardless of what nature throws your way.",https://cdn.entergynewsroom.com/userfiles/ClimateResilienceNewsroom2025.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 19:13:59.423270

Many drivers may be hesitant to switch to electric vehicles (EVs) simply because of uncertainty about how to recharge the battery. After all, gas stations seem to be pretty much everywhere and EV chargers can be harder to scope out.

But as it turns out, EV charging stations are abundant in the U.S., and EV charging can be explained easily. Here's what you need to know about refilling an EV battery and how it all works.

Kilowatts vs. kilowatt-hours

The first step to understanding EV charging is knowing the difference between kilowatts (kW) and kilowatt-hours (kWh).

Kilowatts (kW) measure how much power is being used at a given moment. You may see a charging station's output expressed in kW.

Kilowatt-hours (kWh) measure the amount of power used over a given amount of time (energy consumption). How much you'll be charged for EV charging is expressed in kWh.

Charging levels explained

EV chargers are characterized by levels, instead of grades. These levels determine how quickly a charger will take to recharge an EV's battery — 1 taking the longest, while DC fast charging is fastest.

Level 1 (L1) chargers supply an average of 1.3-2.4 kW of power. That translates to about 3-5 miles of range per hour, meaning it can take 15-24 hours to fully charge an EV.

Level 2 (L2) chargers output between 3 and 19 kW of power. L2 chargers can add 18-28 miles of range each hour, fully recharging an EV in four to eight hours. Entergy’s eTech program offers customers an incentive for purchasing electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

Direct-Current Fast Chargers (DCFC) formerly called Level 3 and can output a maximum of 350 kW. They can fill an EV battery to 80% capacity in 20-40 minutes and fully recharge in 60-90 minutes.

Both L1 and L2 chargers use alternating current (AC) power, while DC fast charging uses direct current (DC). L1 chargers use standard 120-volt plugs, L2 chargers use 240-volt, and DCFC use 480-volt plugs.

Public vs. private charging

Now it's time to get into where you can charge. Charging stations can have multiple charging devices, which can have multiple charging points. That means a charging station's capacity is determined by the number of available charging points. But what are the differences between public and private charging stations?

Public charging is the EV version of fueling at gas stations. Public charging stations are often located off main roads, close to shopping centers and restaurants. They typically use Level 2 or 3 charging and have more charging points than private stations. These stations may be free, while others may charge a fee. Billing rates are determined by the charging networks or site hosts and can range from $0.10/kWh to over 1.00/kWh.

Private charging stations are not available for everyone's use. Many private stations are located in residential or office buildings and can only be used by residents and employees. Level 1 and 2 chargers are most common in these spaces. Electricity from residential L1 chargers can cost an average $0.13 per kWh, while office buildings may charge more for L2 charging.

Optimizing your charging schedule

Planning ahead is important to ensure you have time to reach a full charge. If you don't have access to a charging station at home or work, you'll need to determine where the most convenient charging spot is. The U.S. Department of Energy's Electric Vehicle Charging Station Locations, Entergy's residential eMobility page and other resources allow you to search by zip code, charging level and more.

Trump’s bill would curtail the electric vehicle and residential solar tax credits that are important to Musk’s Tesla car and clean energy divisions.","WASHINGTON — Just days after he left his powerful position as one of Donald Trump’s closest advisers, Elon Musk is orchestrating a pressure campaign to sink the mammoth tax and spending package that is the centerpiece of the president’s policy agenda.

Musk used X, his social media site, on Wednesday to implore Americans to call Congress and urge it to “kill” the bill that Trump hails as “big” and “beautiful.”

He also urged lawmakers to rewrite the bill from scratch, putting him squarely at odds with Trump, who had invited him into Cabinet meetings and empowered him to dismantle whole agencies and shrink the government workforce.

The bill, which has already passed the House, faces an uncertain fate in the Senate, where just four Republican defections would spell defeat.

It doesn’t sit well with Trump world that Musk is the messenger. Trump is considering when and how to respond to Musk’s gambit, a White House official said. He was “caught off guard” but ""not entirely surprised"" by Musk’s opposition, a senior official said.

Trump had sent Musk off in style, giving him a golden key and staging a goodbye ceremony in the Oval Office that the media covered live.

“The president wanted to be a nice guy,” the senior official said.

Musk’s posts come a day after his surprising break with Trump over the bill’s merits. On Tuesday, he called the measure a “disgusting abomination,” warning that it would push the nation deeper into debt.

Having elevated Musk and made him a prized sidekick, Trump may discover that the world’s richest man is a potential nemesis beyond his control.

A White House official downplayed the notion of a falling-out with Musk.

“Everyone here in a senior role understands who Elon Musk is, understands how he acts, understands how he plays,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “There’s been no surprise when it comes to Elon Musk, because he’s been such a friend to the administration.

“And we all know this is coming from a place of business and is not personal.”

But people in Trump’s orbit were angry that Musk skewered the bill. They were particularly outraged by his not-so-veiled warning that Republicans who vote for it could lose their jobs come November 2026, a person familiar with the matter said. That assertion came after Musk said late last month that he would do “a lot less” political spending going forward.

A Republican lawmaker, in a private text chain with colleagues, wrote sarcastically of Musk: “Team Player.”

Trump is normally quick to clap back at those who publicly oppose his interests. When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., objected Tuesday on CNBC that the bill would inflate the national debt, Trump swiftly denounced him.

“The people of Kentucky can’t stand him,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

In the case of Musk, Trump so far has been silent. The disparate treatment may be rooted in cold political reality. Paul doesn’t have a national following, while Musk, with his capacity to influence the midterm elections, is someone Trump may not wish to antagonize.

Musk spent more than $250 million to boost Trump last year and is free to pour money into a midterm campaign season in which control of Congress is up for grabs. If Democrats seize the majority, they could saddle Trump with serial investigations and perhaps impeachment proceedings in the back half of his term.

Republican lawmakers, too, trod carefully Wednesday when they were asked about Musk’s evisceration of Trump’s key legislative priority. Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana quipped: “Well, let me say this about Elon. I wish he wouldn’t sugarcoat stuff.”

“I think he’s really smart,” Kennedy added. “I think he’s entitled to his opinion. He’s frustrated. I think he believes, in my judgment correctly, that we’re quickly becoming debt slaves.”

Still, Musk’s apostasy shows the inherent risks in Trump’s executive style. As a centibillionaire, Musk never fit neatly in the Trump administration’s chain of command. He squabbled with at least two Cabinet secretaries and found that his private interests clashed at times with Trump’s policy goals.

Trump’s bill would curtail the electric vehicle and residential solar tax credits that are important to Musk’s Tesla car and clean energy divisions. The measure would also impose a new annual $250 fee on EV drivers.

Musk spoke to Trump personally about extending the electric vehicle credit, a person familiar with the matter said.

He also pressed some senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill in recent weeks — before his recent X posts — including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to keep tax credits in the bill that would incentivize electric vehicle purchases, two people familiar with the conversations said.

The tax credits had been eliminated to get the most conservative House members on board as part of the delicate negotiations to ensure the bill’s passage.

“Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid — we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down” of the credits, Tesla Energy posted on X on May 28, the day Musk officially left his government role.

In opposing the bill, Musk has amplified a point that the more fiscally conservative Republicans also find troubling: The measure would greatly add to America’s whopping debt. A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office holds that the House-passed version of the bill would inflate the debt by $2.4 trillion over the next decade.

Paul, the senator from Kentucky, wrote Tuesday that he wants trillions in new debt “removed” from the measure and that four of his colleagues “feel this way.”

An open question is the degree to which Americans care what Musk thinks. His public approval rating was underwater amid his association with the Department of Government Efficiency and the drastic cuts that left many government workers suddenly unemployed. An NBC News poll in March found that 51% of registered voters held negative views of Musk, with only 39% viewing him positively.

Lawmakers seeking campaign donations may be solicitous of Musk and the news media may treat him with outsize interest because of the role Trump gave him, but can he shape public opinion on controversial legislation?

Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker, suggested the answer is no.

“I haven’t seen any” public constituency for Musk, Gingrich told NBC News. “If you can find one, call me.”

“I’m a big admirer of his as an entrepreneur, but he never understood the political business, and he doesn’t now,” he added.

That having been said, “I’m sure no one on the Trump team thinks it’s helpful,” Gingrich added.

Democrats are delighted by Musk’s dissent and the rift it exposes inside GOP ranks.

“Musk is right about this,” Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., told NBC News. “He’s been wrong about a whole lot of other things.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250513-elon-musk-donald-trump-se-255p-3eb481.jpg",N,,2025-06-04 19:13:22.555182

LOS ANGELES, Calif. (June 4, 2025) – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a settlement with Ultramar Inc., doing business as Valero Wilmington Refinery, over chemical safety violations under both the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). The company fixed the identified safety issues and will pay $270,437 in penalties.

""I had hoped that Valero would invest in upgrades to their California facilities and stay in business in our state. They will soon shut down at least one California refinery and leave. This will be a huge hit to gas prices in California, Nevada and Arizona,"" said EPA Pacific Southwest Regional Administrator Josh F.W. Cook. ""This settlement today ensures that Valero has improved its safety systems and emergency response procedures at the Wilmington refinery. As they continue toward closure elsewhere in the state, we at EPA will continue to monitor the situation.""

A June 2022 EPA inspection of the Wilmington facility identified violations of the CAA’s Risk Management Program requirements. The inspection found several safety problems, including that the facility had underestimated the distance that dangerous concentrations of chemicals could spread in a worst-case scenario release. Underestimating the impact of such a release potentially leaves nearby homes, daycares, schools and businesses unprepared in an emergency. Accurate calculations are essential for emergency responders to quickly protect the public from chemical releases.

The inspection further identified violations including inaccuracies in the facility’s equipment diagrams essential for rapid emergency response, insufficient analysis of how facility-wide power failures might compromise safety systems, failure to implement previously recommended safety measures, and omission of mandatory information in both operating procedures and incident reports.

EPA also determined that Valero violated the EPCRA by failing to immediately notify state emergency officials after three separate sulfur dioxide releases in 2018, 2020, and 2021. Releases of sulfur dioxide require immediate reporting when they exceed 500 pounds.

The facility refines petroleum using hydrofluoric acid, a highly dangerous chemical. Hydrofluoric acid can cause severe, permanent health problems if released. The Clean Air Act’s Risk Management Program regulates industrial processes that produce, process, or store more than 1,000 pounds of hydrofluoric acid.

“Since we began tracking interest in fully electric vehicles, we’ve seen some variability,” AAA Director of Automotive Engineering Greg Brannon said. “While the automotive industry is committed to long-term electrification and providing a diverse range of models, underlying consumer hesitation remains.”

Survey respondents cited the high cost of battery repairs and vehicle purchase price as the main barriers to making the jump to electric. Electric vehicles, according to the survey, also appeared to respondents as unsuitable for long-distance travel.

Respondents also pointed to a lack of available charging stations, difficulty installing a home charger and the potential for government tax credits and rebates to be reduced.

AAA acknowledged interest in electric vehicles may also be waning due to decreased gas prices. Gas prices in 2022 reached $5 per gallon, making electric vehicles appear cost effective. The average price of gas per gallon now ranges from $3 to $3.50 nationwide.

“Despite advancements in the EV industry and the growing availability of models, public perception regarding the future of EVs remains uncertain,” AAA wrote. “Many consumers may find hybrid or plug-in hybrid vehicles more appealing.”

I met Elsa Modesto at her home in the southern coastal town of Salinas, Puerto Rico, less than a month after a blackout in April had plunged much of the island into darkness. But she had barely noticed the outage.

Ms. Modesto’s home was equipped with a solar system, complete with rooftop panels hooked up to a large wall-mounted battery that peeked out from behind her washing machine. As the lights flickered out in houses across the neighborhood, hers stayed on. And her fridge never stopped humming. That was a relief: Ms. Modesto, a diabetic, used to worry about her insulin supplies during power outages. She would sometimes submerge the medicine in cold water to prevent it from spoiling.

I was in Puerto Rico to report on the effects of the Environmental Protection Agency’s attempts to claw back some $20 billion in climate grants. Of that, more than $100 million had been promised to credit unions in Puerto Rico. The credit unions planned to use the grants to offer people low-cost loans for rooftop solar installations.

As of this month, the money still hasn’t arrived. (Ms. Modesto received her system through a local pilot project.)

This winter, in my first Climate Forward newsletter, I wrote about the controversy that ignited after the head of the E.P.A., Lee Zeldin, called for the return of the funds to the federal government; the subsequent funding freeze prompted several of the nonprofit grant recipients to sue. The E.P.A. later moved to cancel the grants outright.

I had followed the ensuing court battle closely for months. With an appellate hearing pending, I wanted to understand how the funding freeze was affecting the communities that had been promised support.

That brought me to Puerto Rico, where the need for rooftop solar installations has taken on particular urgency. There a resident on average loses power eight times per year. Two large-scale blackouts have also swept the island in the last six months. Solar energy provides a critical backup source when the power grids fail.

I spent two days last month crisscrossing the island, at one point driving down a road so narrow that branches brushed both sides of my rental car. I wanted to talk to people who would jump at the chance to buy solar systems if federal support made them affordable.

I also drove south to Salinas, where I met Wanda Ríos Colorado at her local credit union. There she was inquiring about loan options for her multistep plan to bring solar power to her entire 314-home neighborhood. The plan involves solar systems for individual homes and a microgrid that would power several houses at a time.

I was impressed that much of the plan seemed ready for construction. Then she told me about the millions of dollars in federal funding that had been promised for the project but had not yet materialized. More than 50 people in her community sit on a waiting list for solar power, and she worries older residents could trip and fall during outages.

As I walked around her neighborhood, and imagined it producing its own electricity, I couldn’t forget the circumstances that made these plans feel so pressing. The community sits alongside the beach and a river, and gets hit with intense summer storms. A period of heavy rainfall can bring a one-two punch: first, the rains pummel the town. Then, the river overruns its banks, inundating local homes.

Solar power can’t prevent flooding, but it can help residents deal with the fallout. Ms. Ríos Colorado showed me a picture of her couch with a puddle of water creeping up the legs. She joked that the image was clear because the lights had stayed on.

After interviewing several people, I was struck that so many saw solar power as just another energy source. They didn’t seem to care so much that it was better for the environment — they just wanted the lights to stay on.

The E.P.A. grant funds remain frozen as an appeals court considers the case. But Ms. Ríos Colorado remains hopeful. During our last conversation, she said her goal was to get solar systems installed in dozens of homes before peak hurricane season in September.

It would be a challenging timeline, even if funding was available today.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/03a2_insider-puerto-rico-bjmp/03a2_insider-puerto-rico-bjmp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 22:05:57.264984

Marshall Township Treasurer Glenn Kowalske and grassroots activist Julie Ann Bryant, critics of the project that was announced in 2023, were given the floor Wednesday to voice their concerns to the Republican-led Michigan House Oversight Committee’s corporate subsidies and state investments subcommittee, which is scrutinizing economic development deals.

Ford’s BlueOval Battery Park Michigan was thrust back into the spotlight last week when Bill Ford, the Dearborn-based automaker's executive chairman, said if Congress makes the plant ineligible for a key manufacturing subsidy due to its ties to China-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), it would ""imperil what we do in Marshall."" The project also is being supported with state and local tax incentives and state infrastructure grants.

""I'm encouraged that the project could be stopped,"" said Kowalske, who won election in November. ""It's going to sound funny because it's 60% complete, right? However, I think right from the beginning … the community really didn't want this facility. It didn't want this industrial development. We still don't want it.”

The Committee for Marshall-Not the Megasite tried to challenge the development with a referendum but lost in trial and appellate courts, which ruled the matter could not go to voters because Marshall included an appropriation in an ordinance rezoning the land. Its appeal is pending before the Michigan Supreme Court.

""It certainly is frustrating that so much time, energy and resources (have) been spent using taxpayer dollars to destroy a community like yours for a project that may not even come to fruition."" the subcommittee chair, Rep. Steve Carra, R-Three Rivers, told Kowalske. ""But I'm encouraged that there's a chance that it may not come to fruition. I appreciate the hard work that you and everybody else has put into shedding light on what’s going on in your community there.”

The hearing was one-sided in favor of the factory's opponents.

The Michigan Economic Development Corp. will testify in support of the project and answer legislators' questions at a second hearing next week, Carra said. He publicly called on James Durian, CEO of the Marshall Area Economic Development Alliance, to be there, too, alleging that Durian had been unresponsive to requests to testify.

In a letter to Carra and other subcommittee members Wednesday, Durian said he will not attend the meeting. He highlighted the plant's benefits, saying more than 1,500 construction workers are at the site daily and it will eventually have 1,700 long-term, high-paid workers.

""It's important this project stays on track so we can continue to experience the economic boost already being felt as our small businesses, shops and restaurants see an uptick in foot traffic,"" he wrote. ""This kind of economic growth is hugely important for our region, which has seen population decline and job losses over the past 20 years. Ford BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is helping us reverse that trend.""

MAEDA noted that more than 100 Marshall-area business owners, school leaders, elected officials and other community stakeholders sent a letter to Michigan’s congressional delegation last week backing the plant and urging the tax credit's preservation.

A House-passed tax plan would end the credit and restrict the use of Chinese components and technology. The bill is now in the Senate.

""The economic impact of this investment on this region cannot be overstated,"" the letter stated.

MEDC spokesperson Otie McKinley said the agency ""continues to support Ford and their investment plans that will help Michigan secure our position as the global leader in mobility and highly advanced manufacturing.""

In the hearing, however, critics told lawmakers their voices were ignored, blaming many factors including that key officials signed non-disclosure agreements preventing them from gauging the community’s interest in such a project.

""There are so many reasons that the residents didn't want this factory in our small town of 7,000 people,"" said Bryant, who administers the Stop the CPP Ford Marshall Megasite group on Facebook.

Several dozen protesters were outside Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage, where U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin were featured speakers. The federal officials were continuing a multiday trip aimed at highlighting President Donald Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state.

The trip has included meetings with pro-drilling groups and officials, including some Alaska Native leaders on the petroleum-rich North Slope, and a visit to the Prudhoe Bay oil field near the Arctic Ocean that featured selfies near the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline.

Calls for additional oil and gas drilling — including Trump’s renewed focus on getting a massive liquefied natural gas project built — are “false solutions” to energy needs and climate concerns, protester Sarah Furman said outside the Anchorage convention hall, as people carried signs with slogans such as “Alaska is Not for Sale” and “Protect our Public Lands.”

""We find it really disingenuous that they’re hosting this conference and not talking about real solutions,” she said.

Topics at the conference, which runs through Thursday, also include mining, carbon management, nuclear energy, renewables and hydrogen. Oil has been Alaska’s economic lifeblood for decades, and Dunleavy has continued to embrace fossil fuels even as he has touted other energy opportunities in the state.

Another protester, Rochelle Adams, who is Gwich’in, raised concerns about the ongoing push to allow oil and gas drilling on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Gwich’in leaders have said they consider the coastal plain sacred, as caribou they rely on calve there. Leaders of the Iñupiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling as economically vital and have joined Alaska political leaders in welcoming Trump's interest in reviving a leasing program there.

“When these people come from outside to take and take and take, we are going to be left with the aftereffects,” Adams said, adding later: “It's our health that will be impacted. It’s our wellness, our ways of life.”

Zeldin, during a friendly question-and-answer period led by Dunleavy, said wildlife he saw while on the North Slope didn't appear “to be victims of their surroundings” and seemed “happy.”

Burgum, addressing a move toward additional drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, said wildlife and development can coexist. His agency during the Alaska trip announced plans to repeal Biden-era restrictions on future leasing and industrial development in portions of the petroleum preserve that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.

Wright bristled at the idea of policy ""in the name of climate change” that he said would have no impact on climate change. Stopping oil production in Alaska doesn't change demand for oil, he said.

“You know, we hear terms like clean energy and renewable energy. These are inaccurate marketing terms,” he said. “There is no energy source that does not take significant materials, land and impact on the environment to produce. Zero.”

Joining for part of the U.S. officials' trip were representatives from Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and United Arab Emirates. Asian countries are being courted to sign onto the Alaska gas project, which has floundered for years to gain traction amid cost and other concerns. The project, as proposed, would include a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from the North Slope to port, with an eye largely on exports of liquefied natural gas.

Wright told reporters a goal in inviting them to the Prudhoe Bay stop was for them to see the oil pipeline infrastructure and environment and meet with residents and business leaders.

Glenfarne Alaska LNG LLC, which has taken a lead in advancing the project, on Tuesday announced expressions of interest from a number of “potential partners."" Costs surrounding the project — which have been pegged around $44 billion for the pipeline and other infrastructure — are in the process of being refined before a decision is made on whether to move forward.

Overall, greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. agriculture have remained relatively stable over the past several decades.","The Trump administration has taken an ostrich-like approach to climate change.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is required to publish a report about the country’s sources of climate-changing pollution each year by April 15. This year, that didn’t happen. But the completed report was recently made public as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by the Environmental Defense Fund.

This latest U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report provides granular detail on U.S. emissions in 2023. It’s unclear why the administration withheld this report, which had been completed, and thus its suppression offered no budgetary benefit. But suppressing the report lines up with the Trump Administration’s general attack on climate action.

Among his Day One executive orders, the president announced America’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and declared “a national energy emergency” that focused primarily on expanding fossil fuel production while largely halting low-carbon wind power development. His administration subsequently began purging the phrases “climate crisis” and “climate science” from government websites, dismantling climate and weather research, firing climate scientists at federal agencies, and even attempting to cancel the next National Climate Assessment Report.

The EPA report itself offers some good news regarding modest reductions in U.S. climate pollution through 2023. But it’s a trend that may not continue, let alone accelerate as needed to meet climate targets, if the administration and Congress are successful in implementing proposed rollbacks of pollution regulations and clean energy policies.

U.S. coal consumption and climate pollution declined in 2023

The EPA report documents that in 2023, U.S. climate pollution fell by 2.3%. That’s about 147 million metric tons, or MMT, of reduced carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases.

2023 was the first full year after President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrats’ signature climate law that committed hundreds of billions of dollars to reducing climate pollution.

The continued long-term decline in U.S. coal consumption accounted for the bulk of the reduction in emissions in 2023. In fact, an 18% decline in carbon pollution from coal accounted for 164 MMT in reduced emissions, which is more than the nation’s overall emissions reduction for the year. Higher carbon emissions from natural gas offset some of that coal decline, increasing by 1%, or a bit under 18 MMT.

Climate pollution from the U.S. industrial sector has also modestly declined over time, due in part to improved efficiency and a shift to cleaner technologies, and to the use of increasingly low-carbon electricity. Emissions from most other sectors of the economy have remained relatively stagnant. Transportation has become the country’s largest source of climate pollution, as electric vehicles haven’t yet made much of a dent in the number of polluting cars on the nation’s roads.

In total, the U.S. released 6,197 MMT of climate pollution in 2023. The country’s natural carbon sinks, like trees that pull carbon out of the air through the process of photosynthesis, removed about 940 MMT.

Combining those sources and sinks, U.S. net emissions of 5,257 MMT in 2023 were about 20% below the country’s highest annual level in 2005. For perspective, under the Paris Agreement, the U.S. committed to reducing its climate pollution by at least 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030.

What’s happening with U.S. forests and agriculture

About one-third of U.S. land area is covered by forests, and those trees absorb a significant amount of annual U.S. carbon pollution. The country’s natural carbon sinks absorbed just over 15% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Nearly all of that work was done by trees growing in forests and in cities and by the planting of new trees to expand forests.

The amount of carbon absorbed by the country’s natural carbon sinks has remained relatively stable in recent years, although it’s become threatened by a combination of aging forests and climate-worsened wildfires. A 2023 report by the think tank Resources for the Future concluded that avoiding a significant future reduction in the amount of carbon naturally absorbed by U.S. forests would require major sustained efforts to plant more trees and expand the nation’s forests.

Agricultural activities were responsible for a little over 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution in 2023. Close to half those emissions were associated with nitrous oxide from “soils management.” This term describes farming practices that are intended to increase crop yields, primarily the application of synthetic fertilizers that are made with chemicals rather than natural sources. Nitrous oxide is a long-lived greenhouse gas that stays in the atmosphere for over a century and is 265 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. It’s the third-largest contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, behind carbon dioxide and methane, accounting for 6% of the country’s total climate pollution. About three-quarters of the nation’s nitrous oxide emissions stem from synthetic nitrogen fertilizer applications.

Most of the rest of U.S. agricultural emissions were associated with animal farming. The specific sources are “enteric fermentation,” which refers to the methane released by ruminant livestock like cattle, primarily in their burps, and manure management. Overall, greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. agriculture have remained relatively stable over the past several decades.

What’s happening with methane

Carbon dioxide was responsible for nearly four-fifths of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, but methane accounted for a further 11%. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, especially over short timescales, but it breaks down in the atmosphere into less-potent carbon dioxide and water vapor over time. As a result, experts often identify reducing methane emissions as a way to significantly slow climate change in the short term.

Animal agriculture accounted for about one-third of U.S. methane emissions in 2023, primarily from cow burps, with leakage from natural gas systems causing another 22%, and landfills being the third-largest source at 17%. The EPA reports that U.S. methane emissions were 23% lower in 2023 than in 1990 due to the installation of landfill gas collection systems and reduced leakage from the distribution, transportation, and storage of natural gas.

That trend in declining gas industry methane leakage was poised to accelerate with new regulations from the EPA, combined with a fee penalizing noncompliance, passed in the Inflation Reduction Act. But Congress voted in February to prohibit the EPA methane rule from taking effect and has proposed to freeze the methane fee in the so-called ‘one big beautiful’ budget reconciliation package.

The U.S. is making slow, steady progress at curbing its climate pollution

Over the past decade, U.S. climate pollution has declined at an average rate of 1-1.5% per year, mostly due to the replacement of coal power with cheaper and cleaner sources of electricity. A continuation of that trend would leave the U.S. about halfway short of its Paris commitment by 2030. U.S. emissions fell faster than the long-term average in 2023, but preliminary estimates suggest that they didn’t budge very much in 2024.

That’s in large part because American demand for power increased in 2024 – a trend that is expected to continue in the foreseeable future due to expanding data centers, artificial intelligence, increased air conditioning use in a hotter climate, and electrification of vehicles and buildings. If Congress repeals most of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives, as proposed by the House of Representatives, fewer new low-carbon power would be deployed to meet that growing demand. That scenario would translate into higher emissions and household energy bills, combined with declining domestic manufacturing and economic activity, according to modeling by energy systems experts at Princeton, Energy Innovation, and Rhodium Group.

The nation’s 2023 climate pollution reductions are a good news story that the Trump administration didn’t want to tell, but it’s a story that’s poised to sour in the future as administration officials roll back climate regulations and Congress aims to slash the financial incentives that contributed to rapid deployment of clean energy resources in 2023.",https://yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/0625_Zeldin_1600.png,N,,2025-06-04 18:16:07.010455

Increasingly, it’s happening at popular culture convenings — music festivals, amphitheaters, and concert venues — places where trust, emotion, and culture collide.

At Generation180, we’ve seen firsthand how artists are using their platforms to not just entertain, but activate their fan base to support and embrace clean energy. In partnership with REVERB, we’ve teamed up with the Dave Matthews Band and Tyler Childers to turn their concerts into launchpads for climate action. These artists are proving what behavioral science tells us: people are more likely to change when the message comes from someone they trust, admire, and relate to.

Musicians as Trusted Climate Messengers

For years, the clean energy movement has struggled to break through the noise — especially in spaces where climate messages are too often politicized or overly technical. But musicians offer something different. They cut across demographics. They reach people where they are. And when they speak authentically about their own lifestyle shifts — from electric vehicles to induction cooktops — their fans pay attention.

Artists don’t need to be policy experts to move the needle. They just need to talk about their values and choices. When Tyler Childers says he’s excited about cleaner technologies for the next generation, or Dave Matthews shares his concerns about fossil fuels, their words create a ripple effect — one that Generation180 helps turn into individual action.

From Lyrics to Lifestyle: Clean Energy in the Eco-Village

At the heart of this strategy is the REVERB Eco-Village — a pop-up sustainability hub that travels with tours across the country. Generation180 staff and volunteers set up next to food trucks and merch tables, offering fans a chance to learn how to electrify their lives — from EVs and rooftop solar to heat pumps and clean energy tax credits.

The conversations are practical and curiosity-driven:

“Can an EV work for my commute?”

“Is solar feasible for my home?”

“As a renter, what’s the best way to adopt more clean energy in my life?”

At each show, we also invite fans to sign the “Going Electric” pledge — a simple commitment to take a next step toward clean energy. Whether it’s scheduling a test drive, replacing a gas appliance, or exploring solar financing, these pledges are an entry point to lasting change. Last summer, we gathered hundreds of signatures from several Dave Matthews Band tour stops — each one representing a conversation and a potential conversion.

Smaller Venues, Bigger Impact

It’s not just stadium headliners driving change. Generation180 recently teamed up with Dar Williams to engage fans in a more intimate setting. These smaller, community-based events can offer even deeper engagement — allowing for real-time mythbusting, longer chats, and immediate connections to local resources. Whether you’re at a massive amphitheater or a cozy performing arts center, the power of music to mobilize is real.

Why It Works — and Why It Matters

This approach isn’t just a feel-good tactic. It’s grounded in what we know from decades of research: people are more likely to take climate action when they believe their peers are doing the same. By partnering with cultural influencers who already hold trust, we’re closing the gap between awareness and action.

In a moment where the stakes for clean energy adoption couldn’t be higher — and the opposition to progress is increasingly coordinated — we need every tool available. That includes guitars, lyrics, and encore moments.

Join the Movement: Volunteer at a Concert This Summer

Want to help move the needle on clean energy adoption — and catch a show from your favorite artist?

Generation180 is looking for volunteers to join us on tour this summer. We’re partnering again with the Dave Matthews Band and Tyler Childers Summer 2025 tours and need volunteers to help staff the REVERB Eco-Village to have real conversations with fans about clean energy solutions. Volunteers help answer questions, share personal experiences with electrification, and invite concertgoers to take the “Going Electric” pledge.

Here’s what you can expect:

The Village is active and open through any opening acts, then volunteers are released to watch the headlining performance.

A short training session before the show — no climate expertise required.

The opportunity to be on the front lines of public engagement, helping people make meaningful choices for a better future.

A chance to be part of a community of advocates turning culture into climate action.

This is a unique way to combine your passion for climate solutions with your love of live music — and meet people who are ready to learn, listen, and act.

Volunteer with us and be part of the 2025 Summer clean energy tour:

Because climate action doesn’t just happen in courtrooms or Congress — it also happens between sets, in merch lines, and under festival lights.

This article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Ford Louisville Assembly Plant expansion to make electric vehicles","A development plan filed with the city provides some detailed insight into an expansion of Ford Motor Co.'s Louisville Assembly Plant.

In a letter submitted to Louisville Metro Planning and Design Services on June 2, architecture firm Luckett & Farley said there are three building projects planned for LAP, at 2000 Fern Valley Road.

The three projects would create 52,000 square feet of new building development, according to records filed with the city.

The first project would include a 10,000-square-foot addition to an existing space to create six new dock positions and three replacement docks. To accomplish this, the existing employee parking and truck paths will be rerouted.

A second project will bring an electric vehicle charging station to the plant that includes 12,000 square feet of canopy to shelter 16 charging units and a substation, according to the records.

Another 30,000-square-foot addition of dock space will also take place at LAP.

More: Ford Louisville Assembly Plant to undergo retooling, possible worker layoffs. What to know

Why is Ford expanding its Louisville Assembly Plant?

Earlier this year, UAW Local 862 President Todd Dunn who represents workers at LAP and the Kentucky Truck Plant, told The Courier Journal the factory would undergo retooling, a standard renovation operation used when a facility transitions from making one type of vehicle to another, and is something LAP has experienced before.

During the retooling, LAP workers will be temporarily laid off, Dunn said.

It remains unclear how long workers will be laid off and when exactly the retooling process is expected to start. Additionally, Ford has yet to release details on what new EV product will be made at LAP. To date, Ford has not confirmed the retooling.

This development at LAP comes as a result of the 2023 UAW and Ford national master agreement, reached after a weekslong strike at Ford plants across the U.S., including at Ford's larger Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville.

The labor contract specifically committed a $1.2 billion investment for LAP over the life of the four-year agreement. It will bring the end of production to both the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair after 2025, and LAP will transition to producing an ""all-new EV product,"" The Courier Journal previously reported.

In 2023, International UAW President Shawn Fain and Dunn in Louisville repeatedly told The Courier Journal that securing a future of product at LAP was crucial to reaching a contract agreement.

LAP is one of three Ford assembly plants with a committed EV product in the 2023 labor agreement.

A Ford spokesperson called the plans ""a routine filing to enable the reworking of some loading docks.""

US Energy Information Administration, Petroleum Supply Monthly and Short-Term Energy Outlook, May 2025, forecasts production of both fuels to increase as the year progresses but biodiesel production to remain less than in 2024.

US renewable diesel production averaged about 170,000 b/d in 1Q25, down 12% from 1Q24. The decrease in renewable diesel production was not as large on a percentage basis as the decrease in biodiesel production, mostly because renewable diesel production increased at a greater rate than biodiesel production in 2024. Reduced output at renewable diesel plants was partially offset by the nearly 20% increase in renewable diesel production capacity since 1Q24. However, compared with 4Q24, when renewable diesel production capacity was comparable to current levels, 1Q25 production was down almost 25%.

Poor profitability in 1Q25 contributed to production declines. Diamond Green Diesel, Phillips 66, and Marathon all reported operating losses from renewable diesel in the quarter. In addition, trade press has suggested negative margins for biodiesel.

Another reason US production of biomass-based diesels declined in 1Q25 was uncertainty about federal biofuel tax credits. Before 2025, producers and importers of biomass-based diesel received a $1 per gallon (gal) blender's tax credit (BTC) for each gallon blended with petroleum diesel. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the BTC was slated to be replaced with the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit in 2025. This new credit would change the flat $1/gal tax credit to a value based on the carbon intensity of the feedstocks used. However, delays in releasing final guidance for the tax credit has left biofuel producers unsure about their profitability, causing some producers to idle operations.

''In our May Short-Term Energy Outlook, we forecast 2025 annual renewable diesel production to increase about 5% from 2024 because of increased capacity. We forecast 2025 annual biodiesel production to be 15% lower than in 2024 because of low production early in the year and an assumption that some biodiesel plants with less favourable economics may close,'' said the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

of the “dangerous and irreparable consequences” if Senate Republicans overrule the Senate Parliamentarian’s decision on California’s waivers.
Padilla and Schiff previously slammed the Trump Administration’s intent to roll back dozens of the EPA’s regulations that protect California’s air and water.","WASHINGTON — In the wake of the abolishment of California’s Advanced Clean Trucks rules, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, is announcing his intent to place a blanket hold on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) nominations, including proceeding with his objections to the four EPA nominations currently pending on the Senate’s Executive Calendar and holding three additional EPA nominations.

“The Trump Administration and the Republican majority plowed ahead with an unprecedented power grab at the expense of the health of millions of children and families in California and many other states,” Padilla said.

In his Congressional Record Statement, Padilla stated he will maintain these seven holds until Republicans make appropriate accommodations so that California can protect its own environment and the health of its residents.

“The Senate’s constitutional role to Advise and Consent regarding executive branch nominations is an important check on agency leadership’s abuse and overreach, and raising these objections regarding EPA nominations is my duty on behalf of the people of the State of California,” Padilla said. “I am objecting to expedited consideration of EPA nominees in response to the Trump Administration EPA’s abuse of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) by submitting three waivers issued to the State of California to Congress and claiming they are ‘rules’ under the CRA despite the Government Accountability Office’s clear determination they are not.”

Overruling the Nonpartisan Senate Parliamentarian Decision

Padilla’s objections come in response to Republicans overruling the nonpartisan Senate Parliamentarian’s decision and going nuclear on the Senate rulebook in order to rescind California’s clean air waivers that allow the state to implement more protective air quality standards, according to a press release from Padilla’s office. The Senate Parliamentarian determined that any resolutions aimed at overturning California waivers would not be entitled to the Congressional Review Act’s (CRA) expedited procedures and would therefore require 60 votes to secure Senate passage. However, Senate Republicans bypassed the filibuster to rescind these waivers by overruling the Parliamentarian.

Disastrous Impacts

Padilla stressed that revoking California’s waivers will cause disastrous public health and environmental impacts, highlighting California’s unique air quality challenges and critical efforts to reduce harmful emissions. He also emphasized that EPA’s reckless actions by abusing the CRA fly in the face of longstanding Senate procedures to target California’s waiver authority.

“The Trump Administration and the Republican majority plowed ahead with an unprecedented power grab at the expense of the health of millions of children and families in California and many other states,” Padilla said. “They took advantage of EPA’s abuse of the CRA to throw out the rulebook, first by overriding the procedural limits in the text of the CRA itself and then by overturning the Parliamentarian’s decision, all in their quest to take away California’s authority under the Clean Air Act.”

The seven Senate-confirmable nominations Padilla is holding include four pending on the Senate floor and three working their way through the committee process.

Unacceptable Decision

“This is unacceptable,” Padilla said. “California has done nearly all it can do to reduce emissions from stationary sources of air pollution within its jurisdiction. Given our unique air quality challenges and the worsening impacts of climate change, it is essential for our state to reduce pollution from mobile sources such as cars and trucks if the federal government will not do so itself. That is why Congress has provided this waiver authority to our state for decades and it has been used over 100 times. But now, as a result of the Trump EPA and Senate Republicans’ abuse of the CRA, the people of California will be forced to breathe more toxic air pollution and suffer increasingly devastating impacts of climate change.”

Padilla also circulated a memo to his Senate colleagues outlining the broad implications of Republicans going nuclear on the Senate rules, detailing that the Senate majority went nuclear by:

Overriding the text of the CRA, which bars points of order (which they then raised).

Overruling the Parliamentarian’s determination by ignoring her and “submitting the question” to the Senate as opposed to overruling the Chair.

Breaking CRA Precedent

According to Padilla’s press release, the memo makes clear that by defying their previous commitments and breaking 30 years of CRA precedent with the first successful use of the nuclear option on the legislative filibuster, the CRA is now open to being applied to any agency action that is submitted to Congress going back to 1996, opening up a large new window to force votes in the Senate. In addition, Senate Republicans have now permanently undermined the legislative filibuster that they have claimed to defend on the eve of budget reconciliation, where they are under pressure to overrule the Parliamentarian yet again to avoid a filibuster on legislation that would eliminate health care and nutrition assistance for millions of Americans to cut taxes for the ultra-wealthy.

Sounding the Alarm

Senator Padilla has been a leading voice in pushing back against Republican attacks on California’s Clean Air Act waivers. Over the last month, Padilla has spoken on the Senate floor repeatedly to sound the alarm on Senate Republicans’ revocations of these critical waivers. Padilla, along with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), also led Democratic Ranking Members in strongly warning Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) of the “dangerous and irreparable consequences” if Senate Republicans overrule the Senate Parliamentarian’s decision on California’s waivers. Many of his Democratic colleagues voiced similar opposition to Republicans’ “unprecedented dismissal of the Senate rulebook.”

In April, Padilla, Whitehouse, and Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) welcomed the Senate Parliamentarian’s decision that the waivers are not subject to the CRA.

Energy prices may soon increase in Tennessee.

The U.S. Senate is expected to vote on President Donald Trump’s massive tax policy, known as the “big beautiful bill,” within a month. It affects a broad range of domestic policy, ranging from increased military spending to reduced Medicaid, food stamps and taxes.

A key target in the bill is repealing most tax credits for clean energy.

Analysts say this will raise energy costs in Tennessee, threaten manufacturing jobs and increase planet-warming pollution.

Trump’s tax bill could slow clean energy growth

In the bill’s current form, consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, heat pumps, solar panels and energy efficient windows will be phased out within a year. These tax credits were introduced under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

The bill also decimates tax credits for renewable energy, which has been the most common and often cheapest form of new electricity. Last year, 94% of new electricity capacity in the U.S. came from solar, wind or batteries.

At the same time, electricity demand is starting to increase after remaining flat for decades. National electricity demand surged 3% last year, largely due to a hotter summer and partially because of new data centers used for artificial intelligence. U.S. exports of fracked gas are also expected to increase, which could raise domestic prices for heating and electricity.

American households could consequently pay as much as $400 more each year on energy bills within a decade, according to analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group.

Tennessee is forecasted to have one of the highest electricity increases in the nation. One analysis found that annual electricity bills could increase by more than 10%, or roughly $200 for the average home, by next year.

The state has already faced higher monthly bills as the Tennessee Valley Authority, the utility that provides nearly all electricity to Tennessee and parts of six other states, has been rapidly expanding its fossil fuel footprint with new gas plants and pipelines. TVA raised electricity rates by 9.75% between 2023 and 2024.

Trump’s bill could impact another part of the local energy economy: Tennessee’s manufacturing boom. In the past three years, the state has seen billions of dollars in investments for factories creating clean tech like EV batteries. Some analysts say these factories and their estimated 5,000 jobs in the state could soon be at risk.

“Jobs have been created and electric bills have been lowered. We urge members of Congress to maintain these tax incentives so that the people of Appalachia can continue to reap their benefits,” Chelsea Barnes, a director with the environmental group Appalachian Voices, said in a statement. The group cited specific examples of tax credits helping communities in the state, like a money-saving rooftop solar installation at the First Presbyterian Church of Oak Ridge, in a new report.

Ultimately, as climate change accelerates, the bill could delay the transition to cleaner energy, which has been ramping up in recent years. The bill also contains goodies for the fossil fuel industry, including an end to taxing excess methane emissions and expedited approval for new oil and gas projects.",https://wpln.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/06/matthew-henry-yETqkLnhsUI-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 18:14:30.675321

KILL the BILL,” Musk said in a series of tweets Wednesday.
“America is in the fast lane to debt slavery.” Musk stated in his initial criticism Tuesday that the “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.
Other Republicans have taken Musk at his word, which largely aligns with concerns expressed by budget deficit hawks such as Sens.","“He’s lost all of the EV credits. He’s going to lose billions of dollars by this,” said Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-WY), adding that Congress also rolled back the ability for states to phase out gas-powered vehicles. “We defeated all of those, and those are all going to cost Elon Musk.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has also cited Musk’s apparent conflicts of interest.

“I know that the EV mandate is very important to him. That is going away because the government should not be subsidizing these things as part of the Green New Deal. I know that has an effect on his business, and I will admit that,” Johnson said.

The Washington Examiner could not reach Musk for comment.

The bill would phase out EV tax credits of up to $7,500 after 2026, claw back spending to boost battery manufacturing, and impose an annual $250 fee for EV drivers to offset the loss of gas taxes paid at the pump. The House passed the measure last month and is currently being considered by the Senate.

Rep. Rich McCormick (R-GA), who’s mulling a Georgia Senate run against Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), offered a curt assessment of whether Musk’s opposition might stem from the bill nixing clean energy components: “I’m sure. Of course.”

Emphasizing Musk’s bottom line offers Republicans an avenue to downplay his defection as leaders work behind the scenes to quash any fallout. But it also exposes an admission that the party was previously unwilling to concede about the benefits the world’s richest man stands to gain from his proximity to the administration and government policies.

For his part, Musk says his opposition is centered on numerous projections showing the bill would grow the deficit by around $2.5 trillion over the next decade and went so far as to say Republicans should start from scratch. Musk departed from his government cost-cutting role at DOGE just days before a barrage of criticism on social media.

“Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,” Musk said in a series of tweets Wednesday. “America is in the fast lane to debt slavery.”

Musk stated in his initial criticism Tuesday that the “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”

Johnson and Barrasso, who unpromptedly cited Musk’s business ties to government subsidies, stopped one step short of listing them as the explicit reason for his revolt.

Johnson claimed on Wednesday that a reporter first brought up the subject during his initial response on Tuesday.

“I don’t subscribe motive to anybody. I try not to do that,” the speaker said.

Other Republicans have taken Musk at his word, which largely aligns with concerns expressed by budget deficit hawks such as Sens. Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Rand Paul (R-KY).

“I think that he just spent 90 to 100 days looking at gobs and gobs of spending porn, which triggered his gag reflex, and he wants to do something about it,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) said.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who voted against the bill in the House last month, believed Musk changed his mind because it failed to meet promises made by GOP leadership to slash federal spending and the deficit.

“I think his trust was misplaced,” said Massie, according to Fox News. “I think he has a right to be upset with our leadership. It may be why he left his role in the government. He started to figure out [that] most guys aren’t serious about cutting spending. They never were.”

The elimination of the EV credits and other green energy tax incentives from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act is designed to help offset the cost of extending the Trump-era income tax credits, which are poised to expire this year.

But the clean energy components have created consternation among some Republicans in Congress, such as Sen. John Curtis (R-UT), who put Musk’s sway over him at “zero.”

“I want Republicans to be thoughtful but not reactive,” Curtis said. “Just because it was in the IRA doesn’t make it bad.”

ELON MUSK TURNS CONGRESS UPSIDE DOWN AFTER TORCHING TRUMP’S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’

Other theories abound for Musk’s public rebellion, including Trump withdrawing Jared Isaacman, an ally of Musk, from nomination as NASA administrator.

“I think they’ve suggested [the EVs] because they’re trying to blunt the criticism,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) speculated. “I bet the Trump team deciding not to go forward with that NASA guy might’ve been the last straw.”

This kind of extreme heat is the result of climate change exacerbated by emissions from the continued burning of fossil fuels, which reached a record high in 2024.

The need to transition to clean energy is clear, and upgrading to clean energy is important for two reasons:

Generating electricity from solar is less than half the cost of the lowest-cost fossil alternative.

Clean energy has substantially fewer emissions than fossil fuel-fired power plants, which is important for mitigating climate change.

But, the clean energy transition is under threat. On May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a budget bill that guts the climate provisions that went into law in August 2022, including the clean energy incentives.

This is hard to believe because in April Rep. Amodei publicly threw his support behind clean energy incentives. He described them as a “red line.” He also signed on to several letters to House Republican leadership supporting the clean energy tax credits. But when it was time to vote, he chose to toe the party line, joining the majority of his Republican colleagues to vote to end the incentives he had previously supported. There is no doubt that Rep. Amodei was under enormous pressure to vote with his party, but the cost to Nevada–and the planet–is high.

There’s no denying that federal tax credits, specifically designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the United States, have been incredibly effective. Since August 2022, the Clean Investment Monitor estimates that Nevada’s 2nd Congressional District–represented by Amodei–has seen a remarkable inflow of $7.5 billion. Investment in advanced clean manufacturing in Nevada since 2022 is the second highest of any state in the U.S.

The benefits from these tax credits have overwhelmingly flowed to Republican-held districts. A staggering 78% of the funding has supported projects in rural and suburban GOP areas.

Northern Nevada is a prime example. According to E2, investments totaling $6.6 billion have been announced in Rep. Mark Amodei’s district since August 2022. Examples include battery recycling and manufacturing by Aqua Metals and Redwood Materials; solar recycling by Comstock; manufacturing semi batteries by Tesla.

But this success is now teetering on the brink, with stark consequences if these cuts are finalized. Experts are already warning that eliminating the clean energy tax credits would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution, and threaten the growing economic investments we’ve seen in Nevada.

On the other hand, keeping the clean energy tax credits promises a vibrant economic future for Nevada over the next decade. Analysis from American Clean Power and ICF forecasts that preserving these incentives will add $18 billion to the state economy by 2035, create 126,000 new jobs, and spur tens of billions in economic activity within the state. This represents real jobs for real people.

So what comes next? The Senate must pass its own version of the budget bill. Some Republican senators are already speaking out against the draconian cuts, writing that repealing the clean energy tax credits would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

The numbers are clear: clean energy tax credits are a winner for Nevada. To toss them out now, as the House just voted to do, would be detrimental. I implore Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto to work with their colleagues in the Senate to preserve these critical tax credits.

If they are successful, the House and the Senate will need to reconcile the differences between their respective versions of the bill. It’ll be time for Rep. Amodei to get back into the fight and deliver the message he’s had from the beginning: We need those clean energy tax credits to preserve Nevada’s economic momentum.",https://sierranevadaally.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/evcharging_schurz_NVgoe.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 18:14:46.240438

The unwillingness to switch to an EV can be attributed to various factors, such as the cost of an EV, high battery repair costs and the range an electric vehicle can travel on a single charge, according to AAA.

But it’s impossible to ignore the degree to which political considerations have colored the debate over electric vehicles. Other factors that the auto club cites, like the lack of accessible public charging stations and the reduction or elimination of tax credits and rebates, highlight the precarious position the electric vehicle industry finds itself in amid President Donald Trump’s return to office and Republicans’ control of Congress.

On the first day of his second term, Trump issued an executive order that, in part, aimed to “eliminate the ‘electric vehicle mandate’” by seeking to end the “unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions” directed at making EVs more affordable, and immediately pausing funds worth billions of dollars for the creation and expansion of EV charging stations appropriated through former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, among other things.

These actions followed up on Trump’s campaign promise to scrap Biden’s “EV mandate” and the Republican president’s long-held aversion to electric vehicles – despite the fine line he has walked in his relationship with Tesla CEO and Republican megadonor Elon Musk.

In addition, congressional Republicans followed through on Trump’s desire to end EV tax credits in their “One Big Beautiful Bill” that was passed by the House and is currently in the Senate, as the House’s version of the bill would essentially end Biden-era subsidies for EVs by the end of this year and add a $250 annual fee for electric vehicle drivers, NPR reports.

Trump highlighted the bill’s impact on EVs and their tax credits in a post on social media on Monday, saying the legislation will “restore Choice and Affordability for Car purchases by REPEALING Biden’s EV Mandate, and all of the GREEN NEW SCAM Tax Credits and Spending.”

Such commonplace rhetoric from Trump and the bill’s proposals to end subsidies for EVs in the works when AAA’s survey was conducted may explain why respondents cited the elimination of tax credits and rebates as a barrier to buying an electric vehicle.

The survey this year also found that taking advantage of these tax credits and rebates significantly decreased as a reason for being interested in EVs compared to last year, dropping from 60% of U.S. adults reporting this as a reason last year to only 39% this year.",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/3d4d7d4/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F9b%2Fcf%2F9f2bb58a4d4e9aa47ddf4eba45e7%2Fgettyimages-2152561480.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 18:14:38.994813

Adoption of vehicles with all-electric powertrains has failed to meet industry expectations, with them comprising about 8% of annual U.S. sales.
Traditionally, replacement rates average about 15% in the industry.
Car Wars predicts rates at about 11% in 2026 and 2027.
The report predicts the Detroit Three's replacement rate from model year 2026 to 2029 will fall around the industry average of 16%, indicating a likely stagnant market share.","Farmington Hills — Bank of America's annual ""Car Wars"" report forecasts a ""rough ride"" for the U.S. industry in the next couple of years because of low model replacement rates and struggling electric vehicle growth.

The annual study led by analyst John Murphy predicts automaker performance in the U.S. market by looking at product launches over the next few years with the premise that automakers with higher showroom replacement rates will perform better. The report predicts those rates in the next couple of years will be historically low ahead of major truck launches from the Detroit Three later this decade, and because of cutbacks in electric vehicle products from low demand.

""What's wild this year is that we expect 159 models to be launched over the next four years,"" Murphy said before the Automotive Press Association. ""Last year, it was over 200. Traditionally, it's over 200"" over a four-year stretch.

He added: ""This year, at 159, is a dramatic decline from above 200 last year. We have never seen this kind of change before.""

Murphy noted there are 29 new model launches this year, the lowest in decades. He attributed the declines to a pullback in EV investment. Adoption of vehicles with all-electric powertrains has failed to meet industry expectations, with them comprising about 8% of annual U.S. sales. Limited access to charging stations, higher prices of EVs compared to gas-powered alternatives, range anxiety and more have limited adoption.

Car Wars is predicting 71 EV nameplates being offered over the next four years. That's about half of what the forecast had expected two years ago.

""There are a lot of tough decisions that are going to be made,"" Murphy said. ""Based on the study, I think we're going to see multi-million dollar write-downs that are flooding the headlines for the next few years.""

Ford Motor Co. last year wrote off nearly $2 billion when it canceled plans for a three-row all-electric SUV, saying it wasn't going to be profitable within the first year.

Murphy underscored that automakers will best serve their shareholders by emphasizing their core business — which is gas- and diesel-powered SUVs and trucks — and leveraging connectivity to get customers returning to smaller, strengthened dealer franchises. From those revenues, then, it can invest in future technologies like EVs, autonomy and other software applications and brave threats like tariffs and Chinese competition.

""I do think, as we look at this, although we've said lower product intros, that these core products that generate a lot of profit for the companies, including the D3, will likely create a pretty profitable next few years for the industry,"" Murphy said. ""So although it looks a bit scary at the moment, I do think we're looking at a pretty good upside to earnings, and potentially stocks over the coming years.""

Traditionally, replacement rates average about 15% in the industry. Car Wars predicts rates at about 11% in 2026 and 2027.

""It's gonna be a little bit of a rough ride for these two years,"" Murphy said.

The report predicts the Detroit Three's replacement rate from model year 2026 to 2029 will fall around the industry average of 16%, indicating a likely stagnant market share. Ford's was at 16.1%, General Motors Co.'s was 15.7% and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV's was at 15.4%.

Ford Motor Co. spokesperson Mike Levine emphasized the Dearborn automaker has new product in the marketplace today, including the full-size Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs that recently went on sale.

""Ford is committed to offering our customers vehicles that they love and can’t live without,"" he said in a statement. ""We are investing in all-new ICE, hybrid and electric vehicles to provide customers with freedom of choice to find the best vehicle to meet their needs.""

Representatives for GM and Stellantis declined to remark on the report.

On the upper end of replacement rate, meanwhile, is Tesla Inc. It has a 22.4% replacement rate, indicating the Texas EV maker could grow its market share in the coming years. But the rate is also a bit ""dubious,"" Murphy declared, noting Tesla has postponed launches and favors more frequent updates to its vehicles versus total redesigns.

""That's questionable whether that all will happen,"" Murphy said, ""given their track record of not really introducing new-generation models.""

On the lower end is Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. with a 12.3% replacement, indicating it could lose market share. The automaker is under financial stress, has cut jobs and is losing market share in the United States with aging product.

""Nissan remains a mess,"" Murphy said. ""It's just unclear what their commitment is, in their current form, to the U.S. market.""

An MPCA statement says the CAF “sets a vision for how the state will address and prepare for climate change.","Another summer-like day, another air quality alert. Now almost an annual recurrence, hazy skies from Canadian wildfire smoke beg the question: If the underlying cause is climate change, what are we doing about it? In Minnesota, it’s quite a lot.

While efforts to address climate have faced a setback in Congress — where a massive budget bill would cut tax credits for green energy projects in Minnesota — state agencies, communities and citizens continue to plan and initiate projects that implement the state’s Climate Action Framework, an initiative created to help prepare the state for climate change.

Leading that effort is Kate Knuth, the climate director with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA).

In 2007, Knuth was elected to the Minnesota House. She served three terms, introducing or seeing through several climate- and environment-related bills. Knuth later served on Minnesota’s Environmental Quality Board and as the chief resilience officer for the city of Minneapolis.

She earned a doctorate in conservation and started her own consultancy aimed at revitalizing democratic institutions to empower them to fight climate change. In 2021, Knuth ran for mayor of Minneapolis, and the campaign highlighted her Minneapolis Green New Deal proposal encouraging Minneapolis residents to take climate action.

In addition to addressing the causes of climate change, much of the work focuses on mitigating its impacts. For wildfire smoke, people can stay indoors or wear a mask outdoors. To deal with increasing rains, cities can improve stormwater and wastewater systems.

Now entering its third year, the Climate Action Framework is undergoing an update to be rolled out this fall. Changes may include ideas from a public comment period that received about 200 responses, Knuth said.

“People are excited to help move the state forward on climate, they are really engaged,” she said. Knuth said many have attended information meetings in-person and virtual.

From large cities to small towns, from all colors on the political spectrum, the trend toward a warmer and wetter climate affects everyone.

“Climate cuts across all departments in state government,” said Knuth, who will be talking about the framework June 16 at a joint event with Th!ird Act Minnesota at Valley Community Presbyterian Church in Golden Valley.

“Working together, we can do a better job of reducing the impacts of climate change and be better prepared. It pays a lot of benefits.”

Grants For City Projects

If differing ideologies and less enthusiasm about addressing climate change are evident at the federal level, significant funding remains available in Minnesota, though Knuth said, “We don’t have a federal partner the way we did before. We have to fight for the funding.”

For instance, the state received $200 million from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program for “climate-smart” food systems projects in Minnesota. This includes agriculture, with grant applications due July 9 to the Minnesota Department of Agriculture for the market development of cover crops, a tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2023, meanwhile, the state Legislature set aside $100 million for MPCA grants for infrastructure planning and projects addressing greenhouse gas emissions and wastewater and stormwater management. This helps to make communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change. An interactive map shows grant locations, amounts and types.

Stormwater Management Challenges

The majority of climate grants to communities address stormwater. With increasing rainfall and severe storms, managing stormwater becomes more challenging for cities, particularly smaller ones in rural areas.

Perched on a bluff above the Minnesota River in southern Renville County, the small town of Franklin (population 513) sees heavy stormwater gushing from city storm sewers into a ravine, carrying tons of sediment into the river.

The city received a grant of more than $2.1 million from the MPCA to build a system that will better control stormwater from the city and down the river bluff. “It’s a big deal,” said Kevin Kokesch, who manages public works for the city. The total cost will be $2.35 million, with the city contributing 10%.

The project will create holding ponds and a pipe that will slow the water and greatly reduce erosion. “It will be nice to prevent sediment from getting into the Minnesota River, and keep the ravine from sloughing down,” said Shane Traulich, engineer with Bolton and Menk working on the project.

In addition to benefiting water quality in the Minnesota River, the project is located in the Lower Sioux Agency service area, meeting the grant program’s criteria for environmental justice.

'Stronger Focus on Collaboration'

More than 3,000 Minnesotans helped shape the Climate Action Framework. An MPCA statement says the CAF “sets a vision for how the state will address and prepare for climate change. It identifies immediate, near-term actions to achieve the long-term goal of a carbon-neutral, resilient, and equitable future for Minnesota.”

The main goals of the CAF include: “Clean transportation, climate-smart natural and working lands, resilient communities, clean energy and efficient buildings, healthy lives and communities, and clean economy.”

An MPCA statement about the CAF update says it will “include a more comprehensive set of actions with a stronger focus on collaboration, community benefits, and workforce needs. We have made progress since the original framework was published in 2022. But we must increase the pace and scale of our actions to achieve our vision of a carbon-neutral, resilient, and equitable Minnesota.”

The MPCA is hosting a June 16 webinar about the updates to the Climate Action Framework.

Adoption of vehicles with all-electric powertrains has failed to meet industry expectations, with them comprising about 8% of annual U.S. sales.
Traditionally, replacement rates average about 15% in the industry.
Car Wars predicts rates at about 11% in 2026 and 2027.
The report predicts the Detroit Three's replacement rate from model year 2026 to 2029 will fall around the industry average of 16%, indicating a likely stagnant market share.","Farmington Hills — Bank of America's annual ""Car Wars"" report forecasts a ""rough ride"" for the U.S. industry in the next couple of years because of low model replacement rates and struggling electric vehicle growth.

The annual study led by analyst John Murphy predicts automaker performance in the U.S. market by looking at product launches over the next few years with the premise that automakers with higher showroom replacement rates will perform better. The report predicts those rates in the next couple of years will be historically low ahead of major truck launches from the Detroit Three later this decade, and because of cutbacks in electric vehicle products from low demand.

""What's wild this year is that we expect 159 models to be launched over the next four years,"" Murphy said before the Automotive Press Association. ""Last year, it was over 200. Traditionally, it's over 200"" over a four-year stretch.

He added: ""This year, at 159, is a dramatic decline from above 200 last year. We have never seen this kind of change before.""

Murphy noted there are 29 new model launches this year, the lowest in decades. He attributed the declines to a pullback in EV investment. Adoption of vehicles with all-electric powertrains has failed to meet industry expectations, with them comprising about 8% of annual U.S. sales. Limited access to charging stations, higher prices of EVs compared to gas-powered alternatives, range anxiety and more have limited adoption.

Car Wars is predicting 71 EV nameplates being offered over the next four years. That's about half of what the forecast had expected two years ago.

""There are a lot of tough decisions that are going to be made,"" Murphy said. ""Based on the study, I think we're going to see multi-million dollar write-downs that are flooding the headlines for the next few years.""

Ford Motor Co. last year wrote off nearly $2 billion when it canceled plans for a three-row all-electric SUV, saying it wasn't going to be profitable within the first year.

Murphy underscored that automakers will best serve their shareholders by emphasizing their core business — which is gas- and diesel-powered SUVs and trucks — and leveraging connectivity to get customers returning to smaller, strengthened dealer franchises. From those revenues, then, it can invest in future technologies like EVs, autonomy and other software applications and brave threats like tariffs and Chinese competition.

""I do think, as we look at this, although we've said lower product intros, that these core products that generate a lot of profit for the companies, including the D3, will likely create a pretty profitable next few years for the industry,"" Murphy said. ""So although it looks a bit scary at the moment, I do think we're looking at a pretty good upside to earnings, and potentially stocks over the coming years.""

Traditionally, replacement rates average about 15% in the industry. Car Wars predicts rates at about 11% in 2026 and 2027.

""It's gonna be a little bit of a rough ride for these two years,"" Murphy said.

The report predicts the Detroit Three's replacement rate from model year 2026 to 2029 will fall around the industry average of 16%, indicating a likely stagnant market share. Ford's was at 16.1%, General Motors Co.'s was 15.7% and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV's was at 15.4%.

Ford Motor Co. spokesperson Mike Levine emphasized the Dearborn automaker has new product in the marketplace today, including the full-size Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs that recently went on sale.

""Ford is committed to offering our customers vehicles that they love and can’t live without,"" he said in a statement. ""We are investing in all-new ICE, hybrid and electric vehicles to provide customers with freedom of choice to find the best vehicle to meet their needs.""

Representatives for GM and Stellantis declined to remark on the report.

On the upper end of replacement rate, meanwhile, is Tesla Inc. It has a 22.4% replacement rate, indicating the Texas EV maker could grow its market share in the coming years. But the rate is also a bit ""dubious,"" Murphy declared, noting Tesla has postponed launches and favors more frequent updates to its vehicles versus total redesigns.

""That's questionable whether that all will happen,"" Murphy said, ""given their track record of not really introducing new-generation models.""

On the lower end is Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. with a 12.3% replacement, indicating it could lose market share. The automaker is under financial stress, has cut jobs and is losing market share in the United States with aging product.

""Nissan remains a mess,"" Murphy said. ""It's just unclear what their commitment is, in their current form, to the U.S. market.""

What qualifies as a rule change is decided traditionally by the Senate Parliamentarian -an unelected, nonpartisan interpreter of Senate rules- who determines if the resolution qualifies as a rule change under the Congressional Review Act.
""If the Trump EPA and Senate Republicans are successful at this ploy, the Senate will have no choice but to accept this as status quo in the future.""
And it won’t be long before Democrats are back in the driver’s seat again,"" warned Senator Padilla.
In May, Senator Padilla stated his intent to block four pending nominations to the federal environmental agency if Senate Republicans continued to challenge California's waivers for more stringent emissions standards by presenting them as rule changes.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Padilla vowed to block all nominations to the Environmental Protection Agency in response to the decision by Congressional Republicans to overrule the Senate Parliamentarian and alter Senate rules to allow the rejection of California's emissions waivers Tuesday.

""Republicans are overruling a thirty-year tradition of state policies that bolstered a new sector of the economy, helped domestic automakers fend off China’s manufacturing dominance, improved the quality of the air we breathe, reduced planet-warming carbon pollution, and protected the health of American families,"" argued a joint statement in late May from Democratic Senators Padilla, Schumer, and Whitehouse.

Section 209 of the Clean Air Act allows states -such as California- to request a waiver of federal preemptions the law created concerning vehicle emissions standards that differed from state to state.

California has used this waiver process to receive over 100 federal preemption waivers for its stricter vehicle emissions requirements and, as of 2025, 17 states and Washington D.C. have adopted the golden state's higher emissions standards.

Waivers for vehicle emissions standards that were different than federal standards had to be submitted and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before state-specific standards could be enforced.

Those EPA-granted state waivers could be rejected by the Senate with a majority vote, but any one Senator could hold up floor votes unless a 60-vote threshold is met under most conditions.

While the Senate functionally needs 60 votes to reject federal agency decisions, a simple majority vote is required to change rules in the Senate.

What qualifies as a rule change is decided traditionally by the Senate Parliamentarian -an unelected, nonpartisan interpreter of Senate rules- who determines if the resolution qualifies as a rule change under the Congressional Review Act.

Senate Republicans introduced a repeal of the EPA's approvals for California's waivers made during the Biden Administration as rules on April 4 of this year.

""I will continue to address all options available to strike down these rules and eliminate the consequential impact they would make across our country,"" vowed Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia who authored the resolutions that considered the California waivers as rules and therefore, subject to a majority vote.

According to Senator Padilla's Office, none of California's waivers have ever been submitted to Congress as a rule since the waiver authority was established in 1967 and Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough confirmed that California's waiver requests did not qualify as rule changes and were not entitled to the majority vote process.

""Here, for the first time in the history of the CRA [Congressional Review Act], an agency submitted matters that they knew were not rules. Some of my Republican colleagues are now arguing that the Parliamentarian should have no role to limit this partisan gamesmanship, and the Senate should throw out the rulebook and overturn the Parliamentarian,"" said Senator Padilla. ""If the Trump EPA and Senate Republicans are successful at this ploy, the Senate will have no choice but to accept this as status quo in the future.""

The decision to alter Senate rules to make changes with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote threshold necessary to invoke cloture, or stop any lone Senator's decision to hold the floor and prohibit any actions in the chamber -also known as a filibuster- are not a new topic and the change is known as 'the nuclear option' or 'going nuclear'.

During the Obama Administration, Senate Democrats voted 52-48 to allow the approval of judicial nominations with a simple majority vote and Senate Republicans during the first Trump Administration changed voting requirements to break a Democratic filibuster of Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court.

Senator Padilla noted in a floor speech last month that changes to Senate rule submissions could result in an unprecedented expansion of executive authority into the chamber that could include revoking the broadcast licenses for media outlets with unfavorable coverage, rescinding Food and Drug Administration approvals of vaccines, and the targeting of organizations that draw the ire of any occupant of the White House going forward.

""Republicans have crossed the red line and gone nuclear. As the saying goes, 'what goes around comes around.' And it won’t be long before Democrats are back in the driver’s seat again,"" warned Senator Padilla. ""We will not forget what happened here. History won’t forget. And California will not forget.""

Any U.S. Senator, even ones in the minority party, can hold up nominations that require Senate approval by preventing the use of unanimous consent during consideration of nominees in the chamber.

In May, Senator Padilla stated his intent to block four pending nominations to the federal environmental agency if Senate Republicans continued to challenge California's waivers for more stringent emissions standards by presenting them as rule changes.

""I stated that I would continue these objections unless the Trump Administration’s EPA withdrew the waivers it knowingly and falsely submitted as rules, or the Majority Leader committed to not overturning the Senate Parliamentarian’s determination that these waivers are NOT rules entitled to expedited consideration in the Senate under the CRA [Congressional Records Act],"" explained Senator Padilla in a Congressional Record Statement on June 3 of this year. ""I want to make clear to my colleagues that I intend to object to the Senate proceeding to all nominations for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), except for the vacancy for the EPA Inspector General, unless acceptable accommodations are reached for the State of California’s to protect the health of its people.""

“Demand for public charging only continues to grow, and EVgo is building a connected network of public fast chargers to meet that need,” EVgo Communications Director Katie Wallace told this paper. “EVgo has 15 years of experience deploying fast chargers and we’re committed to a seamless and safe experience for our customers and our communities.

“Our anticipated charging station in the Bay Ridge community will increase charging options for local drivers and provide critical charging infrastructure in support of the state’s zero-emission vehicle goals.”

For safety, its website says it unveiled EVgo ReNewTM, an “enhanced and comprehensive maintenance program created to bolster reliability and convenience of the charging experience across our network.”

However, some aren’t convinced and remain fearful of fire safety and traffic concerns.

A rally was held June 2 where a group of people protested the proposal outside of the site.

“Call you Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok!” Musk wrote on X on Wednesday. “KILL the BILL.”

The effort from Musk against the megabill marks an escalation of the biggest rift yet between Musk and the White House, which he departed from just last week as his role as special adviser came to an anticlimactic close. It’s also the most public break between the tech mogul and President Donald Trump, who has called the bill “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.”

The White House was “perplexed, unenthused, and disappointed” by Musk’s bashing of the bill, a senior official told POLITICO on Tuesday. Allies of the Trump administration argue that Musk’s criticism — and his less-than-veiled threat of retaliation — is tied to his business interests with car company Tesla, which will take a hit after the bill axes tax credits for electric vehicles.

But Musk received more evidence to help hammer home his larger point about the bill increasing spending: the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office announced Wednesday that the megabill could add over two trillion dollars to the federal deficit over the next decade.

“A new spending bill should be drafted that doesn’t massively grow the deficit and increase the debt ceiling by 5 TRILLION DOLLARS,” Musk wrote on X on Wednesday.

Republican congressional leadership has been pushing back against Musk’s missives, after the billionaire’s comments came up at a closed-door meeting early Wednesday. Speaker Mike Johnson said that he has tried to call Musk, and said following the House GOP conference meeting that they can’t “go back to the drawing board.”

“We don’t have time for a brand new bill,” he said. “And I want Elon and all my friends to recognize the complexity of what we’re doing.”

But other Republicans, including some deficit hawks, are aligning themselves with Musk, with the SpaceX founder reposting comments from Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rep. Scott Perry (R-Penn.) and Rep. John Rose (R-Tenn.) about Congress’ “wasteful spending.”

Top congressional Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., says President Trump's request that Congress claw back billions of dollars already set aside for foreign aid and public broadcasting is ""bad on all accounts.""

""The funding that this rescissions package is cutting is critical to the health and safety of people around the world,"" Jayapal told Morning Edition. ""There are some researchers that estimate that over 300,000 people have already died just in four months as a result of the USAID cuts to humanitarian assistance and to PEPFAR, which is HIV/AIDS prevention.""

The president wants Congress to take back more than $8 billion it has already appropriated for the U.S. Agency for International Development, the dismantled agency that provided assistance to foreign countries, as well as $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funnels money to local stations and the public media networks, for the next two years.

PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger warned Tuesday that clawing back these funds would disproportionately impact local public media stations in rural areas and communities. NPR CEO Katherine Maher echoed the sentiment, adding that local radio stations would face immediate budget shortfalls.

""The attack on public broadcasting is a direct attack on free press in this country,"" said Jayapal, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and is a member of the Congressional Public Broadcasting Caucus.

The process of taking back this money is technically known as a ""rescission request,"" and Congress has 45 days to approve or deny it. Republicans have slim majorities in both the House and Senate, so they can not afford many defections.

Trump and his Republican allies accuse NPR and PBS of partisan bias. In a memo from the White House to Congress, they also claim that federal foreign aid has been used for ""radical"" projects and that the cuts are part of an effort to ""eliminate wasteful foreign assistance programs.""

In her conversation with NPR's Steve Inskeep, Jayapal discussed the president's rescission request and the negative effects she said it could have on millions of people in and outside of the U.S.

The following interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Steve Inskeep: I want to ask some bottom line questions here on foreign aid, first. We've documented on NPR that pausing the aid already affected a lot of people overseas. Some people died. But part of the case against this aid is it's not America's business, not America's problem what happens overseas. In your view, what is our interest in paying for health clinics or AIDS drugs for Africa, for example?

Pramila Jayapal: I worked in global health for many years before coming to Congress, and I think that this has always been in America's interest for us to make sure that we are addressing the spread of global diseases that cross borders, making sure that we're investing in helping people to be healthy in those countries. And at the same time, using what's called our 'soft power' to help governments around the world and to build relationships and partnerships. The funding that this rescissions package is cutting is critical to the health and safety of people around the world.

And I would just say it's a tiny, tiny fraction. The entire package is a tiny fraction of what we actually spend at the federal budget.

Inskeep: That is true. I guess public broadcasting is an even tinier fraction. But let me ask a bottom line question about that. This money fundamentally goes to local stations. It provides a lot of local news. But there are other points of view about this. I talked with a conservative radio host. I think he sees public broadcasting as competition, doesn't like subsidized competition, in his view, in addition to disagreeing with what he sees as bias. What would you say to him?

Jayapal: Well, the attack on public broadcasting is a direct attack on free press in this country, because this is the way in which we ensure that 99% of Americans have access to emergency alerts, to local programming, to weather reports, that all comes through these public broadcasting stations. And I would just say that out of the grants, which are about 70% of the funding, 245 of the of the total 544 radio and TV grantees are considered rural. These are stations that have a harder time raising outside dollars. And by the way, it's $1.60 per American that goes to fund this public good, which is called the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

The projects — Kings Mountain and Liberty Owl — increase lithium processing in the United States. Currently, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) controls 70% of the market, with lithium as a key component in many energy storage and defense applications. Once completed, these projects will help to develop more secure domestic supply chains, strengthening our national security and our economic security.

The Kings Mountain, NC Project is owned by Albemarle Corporation, a leading provider in lithium that has established extensive capabilities in chemical manufacturing. The Kings Mountain Lithium Material Processing Plant is receiving a $150 million federal award through DOE’s Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC). This project supports the construction of a new, commercial scale processing facility that will have the capacity to produce 350,000 tons per year of lithium oxide concentrate.

But the restart — which the utility company said was needed in order to meet summer energy demands — was called off almost as soon as it began.

On Sunday, workers who “began methodically returning the batteries to service” discovered “a clamp failure and coolant leak” in a Tesla Megapack battery unit on site, PG&E spokesman Paul Doherty said in a statement Monday.

“Out of an abundance of caution we are deferring the facility’s return to service until a later date,” Doherty said.

Renewable energy vs. safety

The situation in Moss Landing highlights some of the underlying tensions of California becoming more reliant upon renewable energy, electric vehicles and battery-powered devices.

State officials have aggressively pushed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by switching to clean energy sources. But the Vistra blaze has prompted calls for additional safety regulations around battery storage — as well as more local control over where storage sites are located.

The Elkhorn facility — which is owned by PG&E and maintained by both the utility company and Tesla — is one of two adjacent battery energy storage systems at the Moss Landing power complex near Monterey Bay. The other is owned by Texas-based Vistra Corp. The batteries store excess energy generated during the day and release it into the power grid during times of high demand, including evening hours.

Surging summer energy demands

Both facilities have been offline since Jan. 16, when a Vistra-owned building containing 99,000 LG battery modules caught fire.

The Elkhorn site includes 256 stationary Tesla Megapacks — essentially shipping container-sized units filled with battery modules. The facility did not burn but automatically shut down when its safety equipment detected the fire in the Vistra building.

PG&E announced last month that it planned to restart the Elkhorn facility by June 1 because, during the summer, “that power is necessary to effectively manage the demands of the California power grid.”

Tesla and the utility company, two PG&E vice presidents wrote in a letter to the county supervisors, “performed extensive inspection and clean-up” at the Elkhorn site.

After the discovery of problems at the Elkhorn facility Sunday, Monterey County Supervisor Glenn Church, whose district includes Moss Landing, called it “a good sign” that PG&E quickly paused the restart. But, he said, he still wants the utility company to wait until the fire investigations are complete to try again.

“That PG&E encountered problems as they recharged their batteries points out the volatility of this technology,” Church told The Times in an email Monday night.

Widespread health issues after the fire

In a survey of nearby residents conducted by the Monterey and Santa Cruz county health departments, 83% of respondents said they experienced at least one symptom — most commonly headaches, sore throats and coughing — shortly after the fire.

Nearly a quarter of respondents said they had trouble breathing, and 39% reported having a metallic taste in their mouth.

The survey, conducted in February and March, was completed by 1,539 people who lived or worked in the region at the time of the fire. The results were released Monday.

LAP is one of three Ford assembly plants with a committed EV product in the 2023 labor agreement.","The project includes a new EV charging station, expanded dock space, and rerouting of employee parking and truck paths.

The retooling is part of a $1.2 billion investment agreement between Ford and the UAW, and will result in temporary layoffs for LAP workers.

The specific EV model to be produced at LAP has not yet been revealed by Ford.

A development plan was filed with the city that provides some detailed insight into an expansion of Ford Motor Co.'s Louisville Assembly Plant.

In a letter submitted to Louisville Metro Planning and Design Services on June 2, architecture firm Luckett & Farley said there are three building projects planned for LAP, at 2000 Fern Valley Road.

The three projects would create 52,000 square feet of new building development, according to records filed with the city.

The first project would include a 10,000-square-foot addition to an existing space to create six new dock positions and three replacement docks. To accomplish this, the existing employee parking and truck paths will be rerouted.

A second project will bring an electric vehicle charging station to the plant that includes 12,000 square feet of canopy to shelter 16 charging units and a substation, according to the records.

Another 30,000-square-foot addition of dock space will also take place at LAP.

Why is Ford expanding its Louisville Assembly Plant?

Earlier this year, UAW Local 862 President Todd Dunn who represents workers at LAP and the Kentucky Truck Plant, told The Courier Journal the factory would undergo retooling, a standard renovation operation used when a facility transitions from making one type of vehicle to another, and is something LAP has experienced before.

During the retooling, LAP workers will be temporarily laid off, Dunn said.

It remains unclear how long workers will be laid off and when exactly the retooling process is expected to start. Additionally, Ford has yet to release details on what new EV product will be made at LAP. To date, Ford has not confirmed the retooling.

This development at LAP comes as a result of the 2023 UAW and Ford national master agreement, reached after a weekslong strike at Ford plants across the U.S., including at Ford's larger Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville.

The labor contract specifically committed a $1.2 billion investment for LAP over the life of the four-year agreement. It will bring the end of production to both the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair after 2025, and LAP will transition to producing an ""all-new EV product,"" The Courier Journal previously reported.

In 2023, International UAW President Shawn Fain and Dunn in Louisville repeatedly told The Courier Journal that securing a future of product at LAP was crucial to reaching a contract agreement.

LAP is one of three Ford assembly plants with a committed EV product in the 2023 labor agreement.

Ford representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new plans.

The order affects the PJM power grid, which covers 13 states including Virginia.

The Eddystone Generating Station near Philadelphia includes two units that were supposed to shut down on May 31. But PJM, the regional grid operator, asked the federal government to allow the plant to stay online to help meet peak electricity needs during the summer.

The Department of Energy approved the request on May 30, using emergency authority under federal law.

“Americans should never be left wondering whether they will be able to turn on their lights or air conditioning. This emergency order helps keep money in consumers’ pockets while keeping their homes and businesses fully powered. Energy shortfalls or unnecessary price increases are not options in this Administration,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in a statement.

Although the order applies to a single site in Pennsylvania, the conditions behind it affect the entire PJM grid. Virginia is part of that grid and has seen similar trends — including more electricity demand, fewer dispatchable power sources like gas plants, and delays in bringing new projects online.

PJM projects that electricity use will rise sharply in the next 15 years, especially in areas with fast-growing data centers like Northern Virginia. The grid operator’s latest forecast shows peak summer demand increasing from 154,000 megawatts in 2025 to 220,000 megawatts by 2040.

In Virginia, more than 1,800 megawatts of electricity generation were shut down in 2023. At the same time, most new energy projects being proposed in the state are solar or battery storage. PJM has said these resources may not always be available during peak demand without backup from other types of generation.

Virginia has also become the largest importer of electricity from other states, according to federal data previously reported by The Center Square. In 2023, the commonwealth imported the most electricity from Pennsylvania — the same state affected by the Department of Energy’s emergency order.

The emergency order will remain in effect as long as PJM determines the plant is needed to keep the grid stable during periods of high electricity use.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fairfieldsuntimes.com/content/tncms/custom/image/d034bece-aa1f-11e8-89d5-631de6079630.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-06-04 20:08:49.422845

At the same time, aging power infrastructure means there’s a years-long wait to connect and tap power from electric grids.
But many data centers, including Stargate, don’t have easy access to nuclear power, and concerns about the reliability of renewable power led many developers to favor gas-fired power, which can run 24-7.
But the increasing reliance on gas-fired power creates fresh concerns about the climate impacts of AI’s gargantuan need for power.
“You have to secure that power.” Photo: Power transmission lines near Austin, Texas.","If Stargate’s first AI data center is completed next year as planned, the 900-acre site will need enough round-the-clock electricity to support 300,000 homes. But securing that power isn’t as simple as plugging into the grid.

Unlike arch rival Meta Platforms Inc., which Tuesday announced a 20-year deal to buy electricity from an Illinois nuclear plant, Stargate is relying on a technology that’s largely been relegated to the sidelines of power production: small, single cycle natural gas turbines.

That’s because the AI boom – which has supercharged electricity demand – is unfolding faster than power plants can be built and new grid connections established.

The venture by OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank is bridging that gap by stringing together a dozen of the small generators to power the Texas megafactory. Other city-sized data centers, including Elon Musk’s xAI and Alphastruxure, a joint venture between Carlyle and Schneider Electric, are doing the same.

The trend has sparked an unlikely comeback for a type of gas turbine that long ago fell out of favor for being inefficient and polluting. It also lays bare a critical disconnect between the growth of AI and the state of the US power sector. The next three years are key to the expansion of AI computing, and technology companies that had pledged to go green are racing to erect the city-sized data centers that will fuel it. At the same time, aging power infrastructure means there’s a years-long wait to connect and tap power from electric grids. And nuclear — now in huge demand from tech giants — is unlikely to provide much new power anytime soon.

“There is a high level of urgency in the industry to get power fast,” said Cully Cavness, co-founder and chief operating officer of Crusoe, which is building the first Stargate project. “We have tried to be creative about the energy component of data centers.”

Stargate and its rivals say they’re also exploring zero-carbon forms of energy, such as solar, batteries and even nuclear, to help meet the tremendous and constant electricity requirements of data centers. Constellation Energy Corp., the biggest US operator of reactors, agreed this week to sell nuclear power to Meta and last year said it would restart the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant and sell the electricity to Microsoft Corp.

But many data centers, including Stargate, don’t have easy access to nuclear power, and concerns about the reliability of renewable power led many developers to favor gas-fired power, which can run 24-7.

Consequently, orders for bigger, more efficient gas plants – called combined-cycle turbines – have surged, creating a manufacturing backlog of three to five years, with an additional year to bring them online. So data center developers are scrambling to snag whatever turbines they can, which usually means single-cycle, in the range of 100 to 200 megawatts.

Mitsubishi Power Americas and Siemens Energy AG are seeing buyers clamor for smaller units, typically 70 megawatts or lower, for delivery as early as 2025-2026. And GE Vernova has seen increased demand for simple cycle units with the option to upgrade them to the more efficient combined cycle equipment.

Its the biggest frenzy for gas turbines in the US since Enron collapsed over two decades ago, said Rich Voorberg, president of Siemens Energy North America, which produces the machines. Even orders for small turbines are starting to back up, spurring developers to snap up ever-tinier machines, such as off-the-shelf jet engine turbines, with capacities of as little as 5 megawatts.

“A lot of these guys want to build in chunks because then you can have more flexibility,” said Shannon Miller, chief executive officer of Mainspring, which makes units so small that 100 of them are needed to produce 25 megawatts.

Projects such as Stargate that ultimately plan to connect to the local grid will at that point start using these smaller gas turbines as back-up power and to provide services to help keep that grid stable, said Cavness.

But the increasing reliance on gas-fired power creates fresh concerns about the climate impacts of AI’s gargantuan need for power. Big tech firms set ambitious climate pledges years ago after facing pressure from their employees, but Amazon, Microsoft and Google have all since acknowledged that the race to build new data centers and develop AI could complicate their long-term climate objectives.

Single-cycle turbines emit an average 1,389 pounds of carbon per megawatt-hour, compared with 839 pounds for combined-cycle machines, according to BloombergNEF estimates. What’s more, tech companies often rely on corporate power purchase agreements for their decarbonization efforts — buying clean power for some of their operations while siting their energy-intensive data centers in areas with fossil fuel-heavy power grids.

That means data-center demand overwhelmingly relies on gas and coal generation and slows the coming decline in carbon emissions, according to BloombergNEF.

For now, developers are simply focused on securing megawatts, until they can get gigawatts.

“The world can’t wait,”said Sebastian Bonneau, a lawyer leading the data center practice at McDermott Will & Emery. “You have to secure that power.”

Freetown faces a range of serious climate risks—including deforestation, sea level rise, coastal erosion, flooding and landslides. Also, rural agriculture has been affected by climate change. Crop harvest failure is driving rural-urban migration which has led to a population explosion. This population growth has led to informal settlements established at an alarming rate. The growth of these informal settlements, accompanied by widespread deforestation for charcoal burning and for formal housing construction, leads to vulnerability.

What action are you taking to address climate change?

The campaign ‘Freetown the Treetown’ is a flagship climate adaptation and mitigation initiative. It aims to plant five million trees by 2030 to restore forests, reduce flood risk, improve air quality, and capture carbon. The initiative includes digital tools to monitor tree survival and create green jobs in local communities. Complementing this initiative is the city’s transition to clean energy. Freetown has built its first-ever wastewater treatment plant and introduced the use of technology to convert liquid waste into briquettes. Efforts are now underway to fully mechanize briquette production, making it a more affordable and sustainable alternative to charcoal, currently used by 82 per cent of Freetown residents as their primary cooking fuel.

What are the benefits? Why is it important?

Freetown the Treetown is a powerful example of locally-led climate action. It enhances urban resilience, provides economic opportunities, and mobilises residents—especially young people—to protect and restore nature. This initiative proves that even with limited resources, cities can lead the way in tackling the climate crisis. Clean cooking alternatives help reduce dependence on firewood and charcoal, curb deforestation and improve access to household energy.",https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/field/image/2025/06/freetown-header-image.png,N,,2025-06-04 22:04:53.331504

Capital markets are likely to continue to expand in both availability and cost-competitiveness, but require a stable and constructive policy environment to do so.","Crux has released its first debt capital report on lending and investment dynamics in the U.S. clean energy and manufacturing sector. This report comes at a time when surging energy demand and policy uncertainty presents both opportunities and challenges for American developers and manufacturers. Crux is addressing today’s critical need for greater transparency into capital costs, project availability and investor appetite.

Transferable tax credits are driving hundreds of billions in private investment into American energy and manufacturing projects. The credits have also presented an opportunity to centralize otherwise disparate project finance markets for advanced manufacturing, bioenergy, battery storage, critical minerals and clean energy.

“As we face unprecedented energy demands and shifting geopolitics, the efficiency and transparency of capital markets will determine whether America can successfully build the energy infrastructure of the future,” said Alfred Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Crux. “This report pulls back the curtain on financing trends that have historically been opaque, giving project developers and manufacturers the insights they need to structure competitive financing packages.”

Critical timing amid policy uncertainty

The report’s release comes as potential changes to federal tax credit policies could reshape the financing landscape. If transferable tax credits are scaled back or repealed for certain market segments, clean energy developers and manufacturers will face an even greater need to source alternative financing through debt capital markets. Private debt markets are opaque, illiquid and inefficient.

“The interconnected nature of clean energy financing means that changes in one area ripple throughout the entire market,” explained Johnson. “For example, our data shows that tax credit bridge lending — which allows projects to pull forward the value of future tax credits — has become increasingly accessible, with terms largely driven by advance rates and the presence of committed investment-grade tax credit buyers. If tax credit policies change, understanding these debt market dynamics becomes even more critical for project success.”

Key market findings:

Capital markets are increasingly open to a wider variety of projects, but availability varies based on technology, strength of the sponsor and contracted offtake. Capital is most widely available for solar and storage projects; and nearly all investors at all stages of the development process indicated that solar was a technology that they invest in. Less established technologies — like advanced manufacturing, biofuel, carbon capture and nuclear — have historically faced challenges accessing debt financing, but in recent years have seen growing interest from investors supported by ​​transferable tax credits.

Investment structures like tax and preferred equity are highly dynamic and evolving. Tax equity structures have evolved to hybrid structures, or t-flips, which explicitly contemplate the sale of a portion of tax credits in the transfer market. These structures comprised about 60% of the tax equity committed in 2024, and that share is expected to rise. This trend has already expanded the availability of tax equity to a broader range of projects.

For construction/term lending, projects with contracted offtake generally have greater capital availability and lower cost of capital. However, the data indicates a smaller but meaningful group of lenders are open to merchant or partially contracted projects. While more than 70% of investors indicated that they were more willing to invest in a fully contracted project, some lenders view merchant or partially contracted projects as a better fit for their return requirements.

Capital markets are likely to continue to expand in both availability and cost-competitiveness, but require a stable and constructive policy environment to do so. Policy volatility is unconstructive for risk-averse project finance lenders, and is likely to disrupt investment. This effect is particularly concentrated in newer technologies, such as nuclear, manufacturing and biofuels. Whether the market continues its cycle of expansion or whether it recoils back to the most well-established wind and solar projects will be a function of ongoing political processes.

The Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners and Permian Basin Petroleum associations note that multi-billion dollar investments are being made in CCS.

“Despite strong opinions from both sides of this debate, we will likely see continued investment in carbon capture and storage with private partnerships enhancing financial certainty for related projects while many in Congress aim to preserve the 45Q tax incentives,” TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said from Austin.

“As an example, construction for Oxy’s STRATOS plant outside Odessa is nearing completion and ExxonMobil is advancing the Rose CCS project in Jefferson County (near Beaumont). ExxonMobil recently secured the largest U.S. offshore CO2 storage lease while Chevron, TotalEnergies and Equinor are collaborating on the Bayou Bend project along the Gulf Coast.

“Operators say these initiatives, primarily focused on large-scale storage, are complemented by projects with commercial reuse potential such as Fidelis New Energy’s AtmosClear facility at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge, which signed the world’s largest carbon dioxide removal agreement with Microsoft.”

Longanecker said some operators have stated that commercial applications like enhanced oil recovery and synthetic fuel production can offer additional revenue potential.

“Proponents say the momentum behind CCS is complementary to the oil and gas industry and it can evolve into a meaningful secondary stream as carbon markets mature while further reducing emissions and supporting private sector decarbonization goals,” he said.

“Others call for the end of all related government subsidies and emphasize that markets should determine the future of energy. It’s evident that the energy landscape will continue to evolve from a policy perspective under the new administration and that viable technology solutions will ultimately succeed.”

Offering credits from $60 to $180 per metric ton, the 45Q credit was first focused on carbon dioxide, but it was expanded to include other carbon oxides. It’s designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by offering tax credits for the capture, geological storage or utilization of captured carbon oxides.

PBPA President Ben Shepperd said Occidental Petroleum’s Ector County plant is an example of CCS moving from the drawing board to real-world deployment at a massive scale.

“But they aren’t the only company exploring CCS,” Shepperd said. “Several international companies have announced multi-billion-dollar investments in CCS and carbon removal technologies.

“If this is a technology that proves itself to be economically viable, even those companies lacking the capital to lead on billion-dollar infrastructure projects could partner with larger firms, leverage emerging carbon hubs or utilize tried and tested models with learned cost efficiencies as the market matures.”

Shepperd said CCS and direct air capture offer not only emissions reduction potential but also commercial applications that help defray costs and potentially open new revenue streams.

“CO2 is already utilized in the Permian Basin for enhanced oil recovery,” he said. “Along with this more traditional use of captured CO2, captured carbon can be used to produce low-carbon fuels, chemicals and building materials.

“However, many have voiced concerns about the viability of these technologies without the benefit of the 45Q federal tax credits.”

Writing for the Texas Public Policy Foundation on Monday, Texas Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian said the credits should be eliminated.

“This tax credit isn’t about climate responsibility or innovation, it’s about corporate welfare,” Christian said. “It’s another example of Washington handing taxpayer dollars to powerful companies under the guise of environmental progress while distorting markets and propping up technologies that can’t stand on their own.

“The U.S. oil and gas industry has long taken pride in its independence and innovation, but in recent years some of the largest players have begun mimicking the subsidy-seeking behavior of the green energy sector, seeking taxpayer handouts to support technologies like CCS that cannot compete without government support.”

He said the Petra Nova CCS project southwest of Houston opened amid much fanfare in 2017 but shut down three years later because it was economically unsustainable once its subsidies dried up.

“It reopened only after the Biden administration showered the industry with new CCS funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act,” Christian said. “Now major international oil companies are lining up for billions in new federal subsidies. One CCS project with the Calpine power company could net $270 million in taxpayer support.”

Referring to Oxy, he said, “Another is receiving $500 million for a CCS facility in South Texas and it is advancing a new $1-billion project in West Texas that’s being branded as the world’s largest carbon capture facility.

“These projects would not be viable without federal support. If a technology requires permanent subsidies to function, it is not a market-ready solution.

If your head is spinning around trying to make heads or tails out of this loopy conspiracy theory, it should be. If this were true, these asset managers must be capable of pulling off the equivalent of a triple bank shot in billiards. They allegedly invested in coal companies, then partnered with climate change groups to bankrupt coal companies, which then drove up the price of coal. If that tactic worked to make money, Kellogg’s would stop making Frosted Flakes so that the price of the last boxes on the grocery store shelves sold for $100.

What’s laughable about this lawsuit is that the Vanguards of the world didn’t need to conspire to restrict coal production; that’s what Democrats such as Joseph R. Biden and environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, have been doing for years. They are the ones who are guilty of any conspiracy to rip off consumers, bankrupt an American industry, put blue-collar workers out of jobs and raise energy prices. They ran multimillion-dollar campaigns to “kill coal” by advancing a “net zero” fossil fuel energy policy on America with the explicit goal of shutting down coal plants. Their plan, at least temporarily, succeeded wildly.

Over the past 15 years, 63 major coal companies have closed their mining operations. Where exactly are these “supra” profits that the FTC and the state attorneys assert? It’s true that for a short while in 2022 and 2023, coal and oil profits soared because of Mr. Biden’s war on energy, but coal is often valued lower than other sectors. As Yahoo Finance put it recently: “While the coal industry has traded at different valuations over the past decade, the industry is generally valued at a lower multiple compared to other sectors” partly because of its “lower earnings.”

Maybe this isn’t taught in the top law schools, but money management firms with trillions of dollars in assets such as BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard don’t invest in companies and then try to steer them into bankruptcy. That’s a money-losing proposition every time, except in Mel Brooks’ Broadway show “The Producers,” in which two scammers conspire to make a show that would intentionally flop. That was a make-believe comedy. This lawsuit is too, but no one is laughing.

Even the claim that the three firms on trial here worked with environmental groups to reduce coal output is highly suspect. Some of the large investment companies indeed promoted the radical climate agenda, and, just like Bud Light, they paid a hefty price for their political activism.

Unleash Prosperity, a group I co-founded, has done the seminal analysis over the past several years on how investment firms voted on radical green agenda shareholder resolutions dealing with, among other things, shutting down coal. State Street has indeed been a strong and persistent supporter of some of these shareholder resolutions aimed at advancing the radical anti-coal green agenda, but Vanguard hardly ever votes in favor of resolutions hostile to the industry and BlackRock has sworn off the ESG investing fad in recent years.

They can’t all be guilty here because their shareholder activism runs in opposite directions. Apparently, their real crime was not owning coal stocks.

If this lawsuit succeeds, then three of America’s largest investors would pay a giant penalty for that sin. The biggest loser will be the coal industry itself. A guilty verdict would chase billions of dollars of desperately needed investment out of the industry for many years, meaning coal miners would lose their jobs.

This may explain why many of the state attorneys general from coal-producing states such as Kentucky and Ohio didn’t join this flimsy case.

Sadly, Andrew Ferguson, the chair of the FTC, may do more to destroy the coal industry than all of the radical climate change groups put together.

But wait. President Trump has run for president and signed executive orders to support King Coal in America. He wants an American coal renaissance. How can that happen when the FTC stands ready to sue these companies’ investors if they dare make “supra profits?”

If Mr. Trump wants to make American coal great again, he might want to call his handpicked FTC chair and get him to cease and desist.

The House-passed megabill represents the president’s chief — and potentially only — major legislative priority this Congress. But Elon Musk’s opposition suggests that the coalition that vaulted Trump to the White House is still facing internal disagreement over it as it makes its way through the Senate. It marks another dust-up between the MAGA and Tech Right. And it raises the possibility some members face pressure from Musk if they ultimately support it.

Among other criticisms, Musk posted to X on May 29 that the bill would not “change tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar,” and Tesla Energy has also come out against the bill. ·

The legislation terminates multiple tax credits that Tesla — as one of the largest electric vehicle manufacturers in America — currently qualifies for: a $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, the $4,000 credit for used EVs, and a $1,000 credit for Level 2 charger installation. The bill would also impose a $250 yearly federal registration fee for EV owners only.

If the bill is passed as currently written, Tesla’s $11.4 billion in regulatory credits would expire at the end of 2025.Those credits contributed to Tesla’s profitability in the first quarter this year.

Axios first reported some of the recent tension points between Musk and White House aides.

The White House allies urged a more critical look at Musk and Tesla’s claims about the megabill.

“When businessmen criticize legislation, journalists don’t take them at their word, they look at how the legislation would impact their business interests,” said a Republican close to the White House. “They should be doing that in this case.”

Musk’s broadsides against the bill angered the White House, which came amid a critical effort this week to line up support for the package in the Senate.

At a Tuesday briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt downplayed the criticism, saying Trump “already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill.”

But privately, aides cast the attack as an attempt at retaliation after Musk failed to convince Republicans to preserve an electric vehicle tax credit in the megabill that would benefit Tesla, said one person familiar with the situation who was granted anonymity to describe internal thinking.

The billionaire had also recently suffered a setback in a separate attempt to further enrich his businesses, after the administration rejected his push for the Federal Aviation Administration to incorporate his Starlink satellites into the nation’s air traffic control system.

Further heightening tensions, the person familiar said, was that Musk’s departure from the White House came despite his efforts to convince aides to let him to stay — even though he had hit his mandated 130-day limit as a special government employee.

Though Musk’s latest tweets came as a surprise — landing for maximum impact in the middle of Leavitt’s briefing and Senate Republicans’ group lunch — the broader scorched-earth exit was seen by many Trump advisers and allies as an inevitability, said a second person familiar with the situation.

Financial Stability Regulations Are Not Genius And there’s one more looming problem with the Senate’s approach—it doubles down on “financial stability” regulation.
And the payments sector, though heavily regulated, already relies on many private sector companies.","Financial Regulation Should Focus on Fraud Protection

Financial regulation does not have to be based on restricting what people can do with their money, especially not because government officials think certain products or behaviors are “too risky.” It would be a very different approach from what the United States has done for the past 100 years, but financial regulation should be based on rules that mainly protect people from fraudulent behavior.

In the case of stablecoins, regulation that protects from fraudulent behavior would be straightforward, focusing on the reserves they use to maintain a stable value.

Most stablecoins try to achieve a stable value by using cash and short-term securities (often U.S. Treasuries) as collateral. In these cases, anyone holding a stablecoin is supposed to be able to convert back to dollars seamlessly, without losing value. So, verifying that a stablecoin issuer really has the “reserves” it advertises is a key regulatory function.

It really should be that simple, but it seems the GENIUS Act negotiations are headed in the wrong direction.

Making the GENIUS Act Smarter

As my colleague Jennifer Schulp has pointed out, at least two problems run counter to the goal of fostering innovation and competition in the payments sector. (By the way, the GENIUS acronym stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.)

First, the Senate is effectively prohibiting large nonfinancial firms—Walmart, Google, Apple, etc.—from issuing stablecoins. Some elected officials want to explicitly prohibit everyone other than federally insured banks from issuing stablecoins, so I suppose this provision could be worse. Still, the hostility toward large nonfinancial companies is a harmful restriction on competition, one that fails to create a neutral regulatory environment or create a level playing field for issuers.

Another problem is that the Senate wants to make the Fed, the Treasury, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation part of a “Stablecoin Certification Review Committee.” This committee would, among other things, have to sign off on state regulatory regimes for “smaller” stablecoin issuers to operate under a state-based regulatory framework.

This feature is dangerously close to violating Vice President Vance’s recently espoused principles and surely violates the spirit of a free enterprise system. It also runs counter to the goal of fostering innovation and competition in the payments sector.

Financial Stability Regulations Are Not Genius

And there’s one more looming problem with the Senate’s approach—it doubles down on “financial stability” regulation. For instance, the GENIUS Act requires the Comptroller of the Currency to issue regulations to “ensure financial stability.” Unfortunately, this approach fits perfectly with the grossly ineffective regulatory framework we already have. Federal regulators have been trying to ensure financial stability for decades, long before the 2008 financial crisis. It does not work.

At best, it gives federal officials the discretion to dictate behavior based on virtually any conceivable potential risk. It gives them the ability to tell people what they can do with their money to reach a regulatory goal that can only be achieved by prohibiting people from taking risks.

The history of financial regulation has clarified the problems with this approach, but somehow that history still gets badly distorted. The federal financial regulatory framework has repeatedly failed to maintain financial stability or protect taxpayers, so it makes little sense to keep doubling down on the failed approach.

Still, critics of crypto want more government involvement to maintain stability, and this is a source of problems in both the overall financial regulatory framework and the approach shaping up in the GENIUS Act.

It’s also a problem that comes from the fear of allowing private sector companies to operate too freely with people’s money. But the monetary system, though heavily regulated, already consists mostly of privately created money. And the payments sector, though heavily regulated, already relies on many private sector companies.

In many respects, crypto is a response to the inefficiencies in the payments sector caused by too much government involvement, so it would be counterproductive to squash this new technology before it can improve the payments system.

Many critics want a fully public system, but a private system, with strong property rights and government fraud protection, would be superior to a fully public system. Payments systems are not an exception to the superiority of free enterprise.

Simplicity is Genius

Providing a simple framework for fully backed stablecoins, one that prohibits fraud and makes it easy to verify reserves, should be a no-brainer. It’s a great way to let people determine if the technology is worthwhile, just like Vice President Vance suggests. If the fully backed tokens work as some people think they will, it will only strengthen the payments system and the status of the U.S. dollar.

Members of Congress should recognize that it makes little sense to double down on the overly paternalistic and prescriptive federal regime that’s already in place.

The current approach trusts regulators’ judgment instead of the judgment of people using the markets every day. Expanding that approach will ensure that regular Americans continue to lose their ability to do what they want with their money.

It will not prevent financial crises, but it will deliver even more rules and directives that enrich the well-connected and harm regular Americans. Surely Congress can do better.

Then, they can work with the administration to apply Vice President Vance’s principles to the rest of the economy.",https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/styles/optimized/public/2025-04/GettyImages-2197822022.jpg?itok=HyWyMPYw,N,,2025-06-04 17:13:51.579785

These actions are critical to ensuring a stable, reliable electricity system that supports new housing, businesses and industries while keeping energy costs affordable for people.

“We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the world in clean energy and we’re acting with urgency to make sure every British Columbian benefits,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Energy and Climate Solutions. “By expanding our clean-power supply and increasing energy efficiency, we’re securing our power grid, building a resilient electricity system and creating sustainable jobs that drive economic growth.”

The first RFEOI focuses on expanding B.C.’s long-term capacity to meet peak electricity demand as consumption patterns evolve. BC Hydro is seeking ideas on capacity and baseload energy projects, including geothermal, pumped storage and hydroelectric resources. Capacity and baseload projects can reliably deliver firm power and provide backup for intermittent energy projects, such as wind and solar that rely on external, uncontrollable conditions such as the wind blowing or the sun shining to deliver power.

The second RFEOI targets innovation in energy efficiency by identifying partners capable of delivering market-ready technologies that help conserve energy in homes and buildings. Through the RFEOI, BC Hydro seeks to collaborate with industry leaders and forward-thinking organizations to help people in British Columbia save energy and lower costs.

Energy efficiency is the cleanest and least expensive way to meet increasing demand for power. The energy-efficiency RFEOI supports BC Hydro’s comprehensive Power Smart energy savings program and complements BC Hydro’s $700 million expanded Energy Efficiency Plan, which increases investments in tools, technologies and rebates. These initiatives encourage energy-conscious decisions and help customers reduce electricity consumption. BC Hydro estimates that this plan will save customers $80 million annually and deliver more than 2,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity savings by 2030, the equivalent of powering more than 200,000 homes.

“We are looking beyond the near term and opening up exploration of the next chapter of B.C.’s energy future by advancing the dialogue with industry participants and potential partners around clean-technology investments and expanding our leading energy-efficiency programs,” said Chris O’Riley, president and chief executive officer of BC Hydro. “With BC Hydro’s long-standing legacy of delivering clean, reliable power, these initiatives will drive growth, sustainability and energy security, creating new opportunities across British Columbia.”

The information gathered from both RFEOIs will guide future energy planning and procurement strategies. Submissions will close in September 2025.

Both initiatives are part of the recently announced Clean Power Action Plan, an ambitious strategy to strengthen energy security, enhance system resilience and accelerate the transition to clean power. The plan also includes:

launching a second call for power to acquire a target of as much as 5,000 gigawatt-hours per year of energy from large, clean and renewable projects, which builds on the success of the 2024 call for power and resulted in 10 new renewable-energy projects, with First Nations asset ownership between 49 per cent and 51 per cent, capable of powering about 500,000 new homes;

investing more than $12 million from the B.C. Innovative Clean Energy fund in a targeted three-year call for new, made-in-B.C. clean-energy technologies that will combat climate change and create sustainable jobs; and

streamlining connections to B.C.’s grid to enable new homes and businesses to access clean electricity faster and less expensively.

Through these actions, BC Hydro is reinforcing its commitment to delivering clean, reliable energy, supporting British Columbia’s transition to a low-carbon economy and ensuring electricity remains affordable, sustainable and accessible to all residents.",https://www.richmondsentinel.ca/uploads/article/BCHydro_250604.jpg?q=1749085568,N,,2025-06-04 21:06:10.423434

But the gas lawn mowers, leaf blowers and weed eaters that have been used for over a century to keep lawns manicured are not only noisy—in the past few years, researchers have discovered that they also pose an outsized risk to the environment and to human health.

In response, cities across the U.S. are experimenting with incentive programs to encourage their residents to opt for more environmentally friendly electric lawn equipment. The shape these programs take is not one-size-fits all: From bans to rebates to tax credits offered at a variety of price points and stops along the customer journey, each program has made its own calculations that take into account what the location can afford and what will best attract residents to take action, Reasons to be Cheerful says. But across the board, these relatively new programs are producing promising results.

""I think the most important thing is that it's really exciting to see that so many cities and counties and states and utilities and communities across our country are taking action to tackle the really polluting, really loud, gas-powered lawn equipment,"" says Kirsten Schatz, clean air advocate for Colorado Public Interest Research Group (CoPIRG). ""It's a real mix of approaches [that are being taken] with, I think, some mixed results. But altogether, things are moving in the right direction.""

Anything that runs on gas—think cars, planes, stoves and water heaters—releases greenhouse gases that contribute to the warming of the planet. An important step in curbing emissions is to transition these machines to electric whenever and wherever possible. You might think that saving up to tackle the biggest items would make the biggest impact on reducing your carbon footprint. But physical size does not always correlate to impact. Gas-powered lawn mowers and leaf blowers may be smaller than cars and used less frequently, but they produce a shocking amount of pollution because their engines are less efficient than those used in more technologically advanced products.

In 2023, Environment America Research & Policy Center published a report based on 2020 EPA data that found that gas-powered lawn equipment produced the same amount of fine particulate pollution in a year as 234 million cars and more carbon dioxide than the entire city of Los Angeles. In addition to polluting the environment, the toxic byproducts of running gas equipment have been linked to negative health impacts ranging from cancer and reproductive issues to mental health problems.

The benefits of going electric are many: In addition to being better for the environment and better for human health, battery-powered equipment has the potential to save money and is quieter. But, like all electrification efforts, switching requires what may at first seem like a hefty investment in new equipment—which is where incentives and rebates come in.

As with many environmental issues, California was a leader in addressing the problem, choosing both a carrot and a stick approach. In October 2021, the governor signed into law a ban on new gas-powered equipment that took effect in January 2024. In the lead-up to the ban, the state offered generous incentives covering more than 50 percent of the cost of new equipment and batteries. In just two years, Assemblymember Marc Berman estimated that 90 percent of the $30 million allotted to these rebates had already been paid out.

While several other communities have also adopted bans, including Washington D.C., Palm Beach, Florida, and Burlington, Vermont, a larger number of programs across the country have taken an incentive-only approach. These incentives can help cost-conscious residents make the leap.

""We know that electric lawn equipment is increasingly popular, particularly in recent years as the prices have come down, the performance has improved, and it's much more widely available,"" says Luke Metzger, executive director of the nonprofit Environment Texas. ""We know that certainly over several years, given that electricity is cheaper generally than gas, [switching] more than pays for itself. But still there's that upfront cost … and so those incentives can make a big difference.""

Efforts in Texas have been a bit of a rollercoaster. In 2022, Dallas was considering banning gas-powered lawn equipment. But the next year, the Republican-led state government ruled that bans were illegal. The city is now working on launching an incentive program. In the meantime, roughly 200 miles south in Texas, Austin’s publicly-owned utility provider, Austin Energy, has operated a seasonal rebate program since 2020. At participating retailers, customers can get a $15 discount on weed trimmers and leaf blowers and a $25 discount on lawn mowers taken off the price of purchase at the cash register during certain times of the year.

In the past six months, Austin Energy has offered rebates on 2,053 lawnmowers, 1,008 weed trimmers and 578 leaf blowers. “I’m excited to see people participating,” says Donylle Green, environmental program coordinator at Austin Energy. “Participation is above the forecast and has been growing steadily since 2020. Not growing astronomically, but I would say by at least a few hundred per product.”

In the past year and a half, Colorado has also been experimenting with various strategies. A state-wide program went into effect on Jan. 1, 2024, giving residents a 30 percent off discount at participating retail locations. This is in addition to a variety of local and utility company-based rebates offered throughout the state. The Colorado Public Interest Network has tracked 200 initiatives across 26 states—20 of them are in Colorado.

Schatz says the decision to implement a statewide program was all about improving air quality. While she doesn’t have data yet as to the success of the program, in her role working with retailers to offer the discounts and educating customers about their existence, she says, “The vibe is good. Anecdotally, it feels like it’s been a great success.”

Not only has Colorado been encouraging private homeowners to make the electric leap, but it has also been tackling the problem of getting commercial landscapers to invest in a greener business model. This has been a harder segment to convert given the logistical issues that come with electric battery capabilities and cost. While a new electric battery can easily last for an entire session maintaining the yard of an average private home, the costs and inconvenience of charging can rack up for businesses that are using their equipment all day long.

Though businesses can take advantage of the state rebate programs, new regulations set to take effect this summer will also impose bans on gas-powered equipment use on public property. This means any lawn care company with state or federal land as a customer will have to switch to electric to keep their clients. This is also where efforts to educate and sway both private citizens and companies converge—as more homeowners learn about the effects of gas-powered equipment, consumer opinion begins to change. ""I would say about two-thirds of my customers reach out to me specifically because I am fully electric,"" Jordan Champalou, owner of Electric Lawn Care in the Denver suburb of Westminster, told Denver7.

Electric equipment is undeniably a win for the environment, for public health and for peaceful neighbor relations. But on the financial side, it isn't quite as simple as a one-time investment that will pay off once and for all. Incentives can get new adopters in the door, and those investments will eventually save them additional money, once the cost of buying gas for their old equipment surpasses the cost of buying new equipment and powering it with electricity. (Consumer Reports published a tool that allows readers to see when and how their new electric-equipment will start saving them money over a five-year period.)

But there are still some kinks to work out. Electric batteries eventually wear out (current estimates are three to five years), and new batteries can be costly. Some users also claim that electric equipment isn't quite as powerful as gas, though not all agree and many tout the greater reliability of electric as an added bonus.

While incentives and bans are helping customers make the switch, achieving the goal of widespread lawn equipment electrification may come down to something even simpler: Equipment manufacturers and retailers control the products available for consumers to buy. In June 2023, Home Depot announced a company goal that 85 percent of all its lawn equipment sales will be battery-powered by 2028. On a recent trip to a local Lowe's in Austin, there were twice as many electric lawn mowers available versus gas, and prices were close if not on par. Ultimately, if manufacturers and retailers make the pivot to electric, incentives and bans will no longer be necessary—though they could still encourage customers to retire their gas equipment earlier than they otherwise might have.

Austin Energy re-evaluates its rebate programs every year, with the goal of making sure it’s offering the best options to raise customers’ awareness about energy efficiency and electrification savings opportunities. If electric equipment is all or most of what retailers are selling, and therefore most of what customers are buying, then Green says Austin Energy may decide to discontinue its lawn equipment rebates and shift its efforts to a new product category that needs the help more.

But while the choice still sits in customers’ hands, a growing number of incentive programs will give them the nudge they need to go electric. As Schatz of CoPIRG says, “We know things are moving in the right direction, but we want to accelerate it, because it just doesn’t make sense to tolerate this much harmful pollution and noise from cutting grass and blowing leaves around when we have better ways.”

The third-generation Leaf is expected to offer about 300 miles in the EPA cycle thanks to a larger battery and greater aerodynamic efficiency.

The new model will offer faster charging, in contrast to the current version's 50-kW rate, and will also offer advanced tech like a dimming panoramic roof as an option, once only offered in much more exclusive cars.

Ahead of its formal debut later this month, Nissan has revealed more about the next-gen Leaf as it prepares for one of its most crucial EV debuts of the decade.

The third-gen model promises to be different in almost every way, starting with the fact that it has evolved into a crossover. But it will still keep plenty of distance from the Ariya, which arrived earlier this decade to a somewhat lukewarm reception, even though the two will share the group's AmpR Medium platform, as it's now known internally.

Among other gains, the new Leaf will feature a drag coefficient of 0.26 in US and Japanese spec, and an even more slippery 0.25 in European market form thanks to different door mirrors and wheels.

By comparison, the second-gen Leaf featured a 0.28 drag coefficient.

""Every design choice was optimized for aero and energy efficiency, even the panoramic glass roof contributes to exceptional aerodynamics,"" said Program Design Director, Nobutaka Tase.

""It allowed us to reduce the vehicle height at critical air detachment points by 12 mm, while maintaining ample headroom inside, courtesy of the e-dimming functionality.""

That panoramic roof will come in a dimming version with heat shielding as an option, featuring electrochromic technology that will permit users to vary the amount of light that enters the cabin. It's a piece of technology we've seen in much more expensive cars not long ago, but it will make its way into the new Leaf.

An active grille shutter will be one other piece of tech that to date has mostly offered in much more expensive cars, and it will squeeze out more aerodynamic efficiency.

Another major step forward will concern its range, of course, with the first two models having offered enough miles for short trips out of town, but not much more.

The latest preview video from Nissan highlights a few crucial elements of the new Leaf's design and features.

The next-gen Leaf is expected to offer north of 300 miles of range in the WLTP cycle in its longest form, which should be well above the 212 miles of EPA maximum range of the current model.

Official figures won't be known until closer to its US-market launch, but Nissan has hinted that the new model will permit trips between 300 and 500 kilometers (understood to be referring to the WLTP cycle), which translates into a window between 186 and 311 miles.

A quick glance at the Ariya's EPA numbers, which top out at 289 miles in the EPA cycle, offers a solid hint as to what we can expect in the US, though in a smaller and lighter package, so the US numbers could yet top 300 given how important this metric has become for EVs.

Speaking of price, the new Leaf isn't expected to stray too far from the $29,280 starting price of the outgoing model, though we don't see it landing north of the $35,000 mark in base form. It will be a larger EV, after all, with larger batteries.

Another gain will concern charging speeds, as the outgoing Leaf was limited to 50-kW rates.

The new model is promised to be able to add 155 miles of range in 14 minutes, according to Nissan, which will be a welcome change given the current availability of DC fast-chargers.

""Beyond EV intenders and innovators we wanted the all-new Nissan Leaf to offer a truly credible alternative to combustion vehicles,"" said Richard Candler, Vice president global product strategy.

""We wanted it to balance emotional and rational appeal, ensuring it looks sleek and bold, whilst meeting the real-world needs of families with thoughtful design.""

Still, the Leaf will land in a very busy segment once it goes on sale in Europe and the US, one now populated by quite a few choices from multiple automakers.

One element of the design the latest video does not reveal, if you pay close attention to the video above, is what the crossover will look like from the rear. The automaker is certainly saving a few things for the reveal.

The new Leaf will be seen in full on June 18.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nissan-4-684060b70d02e.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.893xh;0,0.107xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-06-04 18:14:42.866223

“Since we began tracking interest in fully electric vehicles, we’ve seen some variability,” AAA Director of Automotive Engineering Greg Brannon said. “While the automotive industry is committed to long-term electrification and providing a diverse range of models, underlying consumer hesitation remains.”

Survey respondents cited the high cost of battery repairs and vehicle purchase price as the main barriers to making the jump to electric. Electric vehicles, according to the survey, also appeared to respondents as unsuitable for long-distance travel.

Respondents also pointed to a lack of available charging stations, difficulty installing a home charger and the potential for government tax credits and rebates to be reduced.

AAA acknowledged interest in electric vehicles may also be waning due to decreased gas prices. Gas prices in 2022 reached $5 per gallon, making electric vehicles appear cost effective. The average price of gas per gallon now ranges from $3 to $3.50 nationwide.

“Despite advancements in the EV industry and the growing availability of models, public perception regarding the future of EVs remains uncertain,” AAA wrote. “Many consumers may find hybrid or plug-in hybrid vehicles more appealing.”

The broadside, which Musk issued on his social media platform X, came just days after the president gave him a celebratory Oval Office farewell that marked the end of his work for the administration, where he spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency.

“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Musk posted on X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”

The legislation, which has passed the House and is currently under debate in the Senate, would curtail subsidies that benefit Tesla, Musk’s electric automaker.

The tech billionaire followed his criticism with a threat aimed at Republicans.

“In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,” he wrote in another X post.

It’s a sharp shift for Musk, the world’s richest person, who spent at least $250 million supporting Trump’s campaign last year. He previously pledged to help defeat Republican lawmakers deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump, but now he’s suggesting voting them out if they advance the president’s legislative priority.

However, it’s unclear how Musk will follow through on his criticism. He recently said he would spend “a lot less” on political campaigns, though he left the door open to political involvement “if I see a reason.”

The tech titan’s missives could cause headaches for Republicans on Capitol Hill, who face conflicting demands from Trump and their party’s wealthiest benefactor.

Alex Conant, a Republican strategist, said “it’s not helpful” to have Musk criticizing the legislation, but he doesn’t expect lawmakers to side with Musk over Trump.

“Senate Republicans are not going to let the tax cuts expire,” Conant said. “It just makes leadership’s job that much harder to wrangle the holdouts.”

Trump can change the outcome in Republican primaries with his endorsements, but Musk doesn’t wield that level of influence, Conant said.

“No matter what Elon Musk or anybody else says — and I don’t want to diminish him because I don’t think that’s fair — it’s still going to be second fiddle to President Trump,” said Republican West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.

Musk’s business interests stand to take a hit if lawmakers approve Trump’s bill, which would slash funding for electric vehicles and related technologies. Musk is the chief executive of Tesla, the nation’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, and SpaceX, which has massive defense contracts.

Last month, Musk said he was “disappointed” by the spending bill, a much milder criticism than the broadside he leveled Tuesday.

The budget package seeks to extend tax cuts approved in 2017, during Trump’s first term at the White House, and add new ones he campaigned on. It also includes a massive buildup of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security.

To defray some of the lost tax revenue to the government and limit piling onto the nation’s $36 trillion debt load, Republicans want to reduce federal spending by imposing work requirements for some Americans who rely on government safety net services.

Musk’s post threw another hurdle in front of Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s already complex task to pass a bill in time for Trump to achieve his goal of signing it by July 4. The South Dakota Republican has few votes to spare in the GOP’s slim 53-seat majority.

Two of the Senate’s most fiscally hawkish Republicans quickly backed Musk.

“We can and must do better,” Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul wrote on X. Utah Sen. Mike Lee said “federal spending has become excessive,” adding that it causes inflation and “weaponizes government.”

Still, Trump enjoys fierce loyalty among the GOP base, and in the end, his opinion may be the only one that matters.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt played down Musk’s criticism.

“The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,” Leavitt said, and Musk’s post “doesn’t change the president’s opinion.”

The tension in the GOP delighted Democrats, who found themselves in the unlikely position of siding with Musk. Democrats are waging an all-out political assault on GOP proposals to cut Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments to help pay for more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts — with many lawmakers being hammered at boisterous town halls back home.

“We’re in complete agreement,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said of Musk. The New York Democratic lawmaker stood alongside a poster-sized printout of Musk’s post during a Capitol news conference.

The last time Musk weighed in significantly on legislation, the scenario was far different. His power was ascendant after the election, with Trump joining him for a rocket test in Texas and appointing him to spearhead DOGE.

During the transition period, Musk started whipping up opposition to legislation that would prevent a government shutdown, posting about it repeatedly on X. Trump soon weighed in, encouraging Republicans to back out of a bipartisan deal. Lawmakers eventually patched together a new agreement.

This unprecedented growth marks a transformative chapter in the state’s clean energy transition, as California continues to strengthen the reliability of the grid while advancing its ambitious climate and clean air goals.

California has installed a record amount of clean energy – faster

In 2024 alone, California added approximately 7,000 megawatts (MW) of new clean energy nameplate capacity —representing the largest single-year increase in clean energy capacity added to the grid in state history. This new figure broke the previous records set in both 2022 and 2023, marking a third consecutive year of unprecedented clean energy growth.

“California has set ambitious clean energy goals, and utilities and community choice aggregators have stepped up to deliver clean resources to communities up and down the state,” said California Public Utilities Commission President Alice Reynolds. “We are bringing renewable energy online at an unprecedented scale and pace never seen before.”

This rapid expansion of clean energy capacity is the result of procurement orders from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) aimed at bolstering grid reliability while advancing the state’s clean energy targets and meeting Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements.

Building energy infrastructure is a key part of the Governor’s build more, faster agenda delivering infrastructure upgrades and thousands of jobs across the state.

On track for further clean energy expansion

More than 75,000 MW of new clean energy capacity is expected to come online by 2040. To make this vision a reality, California’s electric grid will continue to evolve to unlock access to new clean energy capacity and power. At the same time, utilities and community choice aggregators are actively contracting with projects that can be built using existing electric infrastructure, helping accelerate the pace of development, at least cost to customers.

Currently, more than 20,000 MW of clean energy projects are already under contract and in development to serve California customers by 2030.

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period.

The state continues to set clean energy records. Last year, California ran on 100% clean electricity for the equivalent of 51 days – with the grid running on 100% clean energy for some period three out of every five days.

The labs in Warren, Michigan, just north of Detroit, are top-secret facilities. They have long, empty corridors illuminated with bright white lights. Each corridor is spotless, feeling clinical and eerie. Few windows offer a glimpse at the scientists working in full safety suits.

It’s a strikingly futuristic setup for a company that has a long history of making combustion engines. But what those scientists are working on is, in many ways, even more important: the next-generation lithium manganese-rich (LMR) batteries that will power GM’s future electric vehicles.

About 30 miles from this facility, Ford is also developing its own LMR batteries at its Ion Park research hub in Romulus, southwest of Detroit. The Dearborn automaker has been working on these batteries for four years and recently reached a breakthrough, announcing the start of pilot production in Michigan. This is when automakers make small-scale versions to test and refine them before full-blown manufacturing begins.

If either American automaker can pull this off—or, ideally, both—then the United States may have a chance to outmaneuver China in the EV and battery race.

As China has run away with a massive technology lead, America’s auto giants are grappling with unpredictable regulations, tariffs and the end of emissions rules that promised to accelerate EV adoption. Even before the Trump administration threw the Biden-era EV initiatives into chaos, automakers struggled with profitability and high costs—often because of the batteries themselves and also due to China’s stranglehold on supply chains.

U.S. automakers are now looking to carve out an electric future of their own. GM and Ford say LMR can help them achieve that goal. This new chemistry should reduce the cost of EVs, making them more accessible without sacrificing range and performance.

InsideEVs interviewed engineers from both companies to understand what exactly these novel LMR batteries are and how they’re overcoming engineering challenges.

Welcome To General Motors’ Battery Kitchen

Making EV batteries is, in many ways, harder than building internal combustion engines. They are chemically complex with far more variables on the molecular level. Even for R&D and small-scale testing, they require large halls full of equipment, millions of dollars in investments and deep technical skills—an area where China, Japan and Korea have huge advantages.

Inside GM’s Kettering R&D lab—named after legendary American inventor Charles Kettering—material scientists showed the machines they work on all day. Waist-high metal boxes line the rooms. Each one is a testbed for the powders and slurries that make up a battery cell. Large tubes flow from the ceiling for ventilation, air filtration and to supply specific gases or compressed air for the chemistry experiments.

One engineer showed me a machine used for “cathode material synthesis,” the scientific process of making the powder-like mix that makes up the cathode. Another explained “electrolyte development and characterization,” which involves developing the material that sits between the anode and cathode. A third engineer described the process like chefs in a restaurant.

The electrode slurry, a thick black material, turns into a “cake batter” in what she jokingly called a KitchenAid mixer. Once it reaches a “honey-like texture” in the mixer, it's smeared onto thin sheets of metal and baked in an oven, “just like cookies.”

The wet slurry or ""cake batter"" that's made of cathode active materials, a binder and solvent which goes on to form the energy storing part of the battery cell.

When the cells developed here meet certain criteria, they go to the Wallace Battery Innovation Center—named after Bill Wallace, who spearheaded battery development for the Chevy Volt, Bolt EV and Malibu Hybrid—within the same campus for advanced testing.

Getting Ahead Of China

For the past five years, GM engineers have been using their research labs to develop the LMR cells, starting at the small coin cell level—smaller than a penny—to building their first automotive-grade cells this year. These cells aren’t radically different from the nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cells currently dominant in GM EVs. But they should solve the cost issues that plague many current batteries, GM claims.

China holds a commanding grip on the raw materials that power most electric vehicles sold in the U.S. and around the world. Today’s EV batteries rely heavily on nickel and cobalt—China dominates the supply chain at every step.

Roughly 85% of global battery cell production happens there, along with 65% of the world’s nickel refining and an overwhelming 75% of cobalt refining, according to a recent report from the International Energy Agency.

LFP vs NMC battery adoption

The cheaper lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are a promising alternative to nickel-based ones, but China’s lead in LFP battery production is even bigger, with nearly all EVs with LFP batteries sold in the U.S. and Europe in 2024 using packs made in China.

It’s a strategic advantage that no other country can replicate. What adds to the challenge is that both nickel and cobalt are not only in high demand but also more difficult and costly to mine and refine.

GM engineers said manganese, by contrast, is more abundant, easier to process and far less expensive, making it an increasingly attractive alternative to counter China’s chokehold on battery materials.

Over the years, automakers have moved from using traditional NMC batteries, which use equal portions of nickel, manganese and cobalt, to high-nickel batteries, which use less cobalt and manganese, but higher nickel content. The next logical step towards cost reduction, GM says, is to reduce the nickel content and increase the portion of manganese, giving birth to what’s called the lithium manganese-rich (LMR) battery.

There’s not a lot of manganese production in North America, but it’s an opportunity to finally start producing it here to move away from China’s dominant supply chains.

The automaker loaned $85 million to manganese supplier Element 25 in 2023. At the time, GM said Element 25 will mine the manganese in a “vertically integrated” and “traceable” way from Australia. The materials will then be processed in the U.S. at what’s expected to be the first plant of its kind to produce battery-grade manganese—a huge step towards localization that has remained elusive for America.

GM estimates the LMR cells to offer 33% more energy density than current LFP cells at comparable costs. Packaging them into the prismatic form factor, which is either a square or a rectangular box, will result in 50% fewer parts on the pack level. Prismatic cells stack neatly together and require fewer structural components. GM believes these types of cells have advantages over the traditional cylindrical cells, which have lower packaging efficiency. Hundreds of pounds of weight savings are expected on the vehicle level with prismatic cells.

Above all, the LMR battery is expected to deliver over 400 miles of range on GM’s full-size SUVs and trucks.

“This is something we've made. We've got a partner [LG Energy Solution] that's ready to go with us on this,” Kurt Kelty, the vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability at GM, said during a roundtable with reporters at the GM Technical Center. “We're going to actually see this in the marketplace.""

Kelty, who worked at Tesla for 15 years before moving to GM, acknowledged that all batteries have pros and cons. LMR cells historically suffer from capacity fade and loss of voltage over time, but GM engineers claim to have solved this issue to keep the cells stable and energy dense.

“Batteries are a bunch of trade-offs,” Kelty said. “You can optimize on fast charge, on range, on cost, but what we've got here is a nicely balanced cell that meets all our needs, so we can deploy it and get that great range at an affordable cost,” he added.

“It's a game-changing battery for electric trucks, setting a new bar for performance in this important vehicle segment.”

Ford Moving 'Full Steam Ahead' With LMR Cells

Ford's Ion Park is its new global battery research and development center located in Romulus, Michigan.

Across town, Ford is comparatively tight-lipped about its LMR plans, but we have some details nonetheless. “LMR is going to be the LFP of the western hemisphere,” Charles Poon, Ford’s director of electrified propulsion engineering, told InsideEVs in an interview.

At Ford’s Ion Park R&D center in Romulus, Michigan, a team of 135 battery engineers is working like a “small skunkworks team,” as Poon described it, to bring this new chemistry to life. Just days before GM made its own LMR ambitions public, Ford announced it had achieved a similar breakthrough: It’s now running cells off a pilot production line.

While both companies are chasing LMR technology, their approaches vary. GM is targeting large trucks and full-size SUVs with prismatic LMR cells. Ford, on the other hand, is eyeing lower-cost EVs, with the flexibility to use cylindrical or pouch formats.

“We can do it with any format that exists today,” Poon said.

Ford currently uses two main battery types. There's an LFP battery for the entry-level Mustang Mach-E, and an NMC pack for the F-150 Lightning, E-Transit and rest of the Mach-E lineup.The LFP battery is sourced from Chinese battery giant CATL, while the latter reportedly comes from LG Energy Solution.

The U.S.-made LMR battery is intended to slot right between them, offering more range than LFP, at a lower cost than NMC, without losing any substantial range. “LMR is the answer to ‘what next?’” Poon said.

But scaling the chemistry comes with technical hurdles. Ford had to solve three key challenges before moving toward industrialization. The first is what Poon labeled “manganese dissolution.” Manganese tends to dissolve into the electrolyte. When that happens, the battery gradually loses energy, meaning you get less range over time.

The second is what he called “gas generation.” As manganese dissolution happens, oxygen can react and produce gas inside the battery. Too much gas buildup can lead to swelling or even early battery failure. Managing this gas generation is critical to battery health and safety, he said.

Voltage was the third big challenge. LMR cells run at very high voltages, even higher than traditional NMC batteries. But high voltage can speed up wear and tear. So the challenge, Poon said, was to design a battery that could safely handle the voltage without degrading quickly.

The automaker claims to have largely solved these problems and is aiming to achieve an energy density between 550-700 watt hours per liter, or more than 200 watt hours per kilogram. That is similar to current nickel-based batteries, which generally have 200-300 Wh/kg of energy density.

Poon also added that LMR cells are ""agnostic to charging."" In other words, LMR batteries won’t inherently charge slower or faster. Depending on which vehicle segment Ford uses them in and the voltage architecture of the pack, charging speeds could match or even exceed today’s benchmarks.

Since fast-charging physics primarily happens on the anode side, usually made of graphite or a graphite-silicon blend, the choice of cathode chemistry (whether LFP, NMC, or LMR) doesn’t directly constrain charging speed.

Speaking of the segment, Ford seems to be targeting the pocket between entry-level LFP and high-end NMC models. So LMR won't necessarily replace LFP or NMC batteries, but enable automakers to target U.S.-specific use cases with better packaging and costs, while crucially establishing a more local supply chain that's less centered around China.

“Cost is really one of the biggest hurdles for EV adoption,” Poon said. “Our approach is not necessarily to introduce this for premium vehicles, it's to replace a bulk of where we currently have both high-nickel and mid-nickel chemistries,” he added.

Race To The Finish Line

GM said it intends to become the first automaker to introduce LMR cells in a production truck at the start of 2028. (The automaker didn’t disclose which truck will use this battery.)

It is already the largest producer of cells in North America. And Kelty said he believed GM is now also making cells at a lower cost than its competitors on the continent. With support from Korean battery giant LG Energy Solution, already GM’s largest battery supplier, the two companies plan to scale the production of LMR cells in about two years.

Ford is also planning to bring these cells to life by the end of the decade.

There are reasons for caution. We haven’t seen the tech on the roads yet. But Kelty made a strong case for why LMR cells are headed towards commercialization. In addition to the benefits in terms of cost and range, he said America should strive to localize the battery supply chain if it wants to produce competitive EVs. “It has nothing to do with tariffs,” he said.

Kelty experienced the complex logistics of importing cells from overseas when he was at Tesla. “We were buying cells from Japan. You put them in a container. Then they get on a boat and they sit on the water for three or four weeks. You're paying for that material before it even arrives, which is really painful,” he said.

Tesla famously went on to mass produce batteries at its Gigafactory Nevada in 2017, integrating Panasonic’s operations within the campus in Reno, long before rivals even had any plans to localize.

The second reason to localize cells is far more consequential. “Believe it or not, sometimes battery cells have quality issues,” Kelty said. “You won't find that out right away because you usually get a week or two weeks of inventory, and then you find out that you have to trash it all. It's just no good.”

Strong local supply chains helped Asian manufacturers pull ahead in battery innovation. Now, with LMR breakthroughs, Ford and GM may have a real shot at closing the gap by developing U.S.-made cells that could lower costs, maintain range and performance and finally step out of China’s shadow.

If they deliver on their promises, it could unlock the next phase of growth for America’s EV industry.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/9meRvl/s1/ford-and-gm-s-lmr-ev-battery-plans.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 16:07:38.457891

The company said it had decided to close Eddystone after PJM determined that closure would not hurt grid reliability.
Constellation is separately working to restart one unit at Three Mile Island, the nuclear power plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that partially melted down in America’s worst nuclear power accident in 1979.
The restart, exclusively to provide energy for a Microsoft data center, had been scheduled for 2028 but since the latest DOE order has been accelerated to 2027, Myers said.
“Saying that you are going to keep a dirty power plant open during the summer means that you are directly contributing to more failed air-quality days.","A half-century-old Pennsylvania power plant fueled by oil and natural gas will keep running beyond its scheduled shutdown date following an order from the Trump administration just one day before it was due to retire.

The Eddystone Generating Station near Philadelphia was to close permanently last Saturday because its owner determined it no longer made economic sense to run.

But an order from the U.S. Department of Energy on Friday directed the plant’s owner, Constellation Energy, and grid manager PJM Interconnection to take “all measures necessary” to ensure that the two remaining generation units at the plant are available to operate. The order is effective until Aug. 28 and can be extended.

“Operational availability and economic dispatch of the aforementioned Eddystone Units 3 and 4 is necessary to best meet the emergency and serve the public interest,” said the order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright. He said the 90-day duration of the order was also intended to “minimize adverse environmental impacts.”

The order said the continued operation is justified by a national “energy emergency” declared by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, and by PJM’s responsibility to ensure electric reliability. On April 8, Trump issued another executive order saying that all available electricity supplies “must” be used to meet an unprecedented increase in national demand for power, especially to run artificial intelligence data centers. At the same time, the Trump administration has cracked down on efforts to expand renewable energy, including an executive order to freeze development of new offshore wind projects.

The new order is the second of its kind from Trump’s DOE. In late May, Wright directed the 1,560-megawatt J.H. Campbell Plant in western Michigan to stay open past its scheduled closure date, also last Saturday. The agency said action was needed to minimize the risk of blackouts and improve grid security.

Environmentalists blasted the new order as another sign of the Trump administration’s support for fossil fuels and said it would do little or nothing to improve grid reliability. They noted that PJM determined in February 2024 that closing the plant would not hurt reliability, a finding that triggered the start of the closure process.

“There is no reason to believe that this plant that had been operating infrequently during times of peak demand will be needed over the next 90 days for reliability purposes, but it will be increasing costs,” said Robert Routh, Pennsylvania policy director for climate and energy at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Routh predicted that ratepayers will end up bearing the cost of a last-minute scramble to keep the plant running, suddenly reversing a process that may have involved draining fuel tanks or avoiding unnecessary maintenance. “None of that is going to come cheap,” he said.

It’s unclear whether the administration had the authority to use section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to issue its order, according to Caroline Reiser, senior attorney with NRDC. The statute was designed to give the DOE the power to seek energy corrections to one-off events such as hurricanes, but Eddystone’s market does not meet that standard, she said.

“This is not the way that 202(c)s are meant to be used, and historically have been used,” Reiser said. “It’s an emergency authority for DOE. Congress granted the DOE this authority, originally in time of war, and it has been extended into other emergency situations such as hurricanes.”

Even though PJM told Congress in March this year that the grid faces a “growing resource adequacy concern,” that doesn’t constitute the emergency for which the law was designed, Reiser said.

DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. PJM also did not respond to a request for comment but issued a statement on Saturday supporting the DOE’s move to “defer the retirements of certain generators” in PJM’s territory, which spans 13 states plus the District of Columbia.

Constellation confirmed it will work with PJM and the DOE to keep Eddystone running. The company said it had decided to close Eddystone after PJM determined that closure would not hurt grid reliability.

“Eddystone Units 3 and 4 remain in ‘ready’ status and we are working quickly to retain necessary staff and perform necessary maintenance to allow for safe and reliable operations this summer and beyond,” said Constellation spokesman Jeffrey Myers. He said the units run just 1.5 percent of the time, only when called on by PJM. The plant had been planned for closure for “economic reasons,” he said.

The company has owned the units, which can generate a combined 760 megawatts, since they were installed in the late 1960s.

On Tuesday, Constellation announced a deal with Meta, the parent company of Facebook, to supply 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power over 20 years to help meet the tech giant’s surging need for power for artificial intelligence. The power will be generated by Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois.

Constellation is separately working to restart one unit at Three Mile Island, the nuclear power plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that partially melted down in America’s worst nuclear power accident in 1979. The restart, exclusively to provide energy for a Microsoft data center, had been scheduled for 2028 but since the latest DOE order has been accelerated to 2027, Myers said.

Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of the nonprofit Delaware Riverkeeper Network, said that keeping the plant running in the summer would raise emissions of harmful pollutants like particulates and volatile organic compounds in the Philadelphia area, and add to greenhouse gases at a time when the planned closure would have cut them.

“Saying that you are going to keep a dirty power plant open during the summer means that you are directly contributing to more failed air-quality days. It’s going to exacerbate our failure to meet clean-air standards, and there are consequences of that for people’s health,” she said.

Carluccio added: “It is an environmental injustice to allow this pollution to continue.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Eddystone.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 16:07:21.520861

Future wind and solar projects must break ground within 60 days of the budget bill’s passage and begin operations by 2029 to qualify for the clean energy incentives.
Colorado utilities, however, say the timeline doesn't give them enough time to adjust their current plans to expand energy production.
Why utilities say the Republican proposal could inflate energy bills Gabriel said United Power‘s expansion plans help illustrate the importance of renewable energy incentives.
Kenney said the loss of federal clean energy credits would increase the cost of those projects and the price ultimately paid by Xcel Energy customers.","The U.S. Senate is debating a multi-trillion-dollar megabill meant to enact President Trump’s domestic agenda after House lawmakers approved the legislation last month. At the same time, Colorado utility leaders are warning the plan could upend their operations and lead to higher energy prices for their customers.

Mark Gabriel, the CEO of Brighton-based electricity cooperative United Power, is leery of the potential rollbacks within the bill, but not for ideological reasons.

“I don’t have Birkenstocks and dreadlocks,” Gabriel told an in-person round table held by Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet last Thursday. “ As a dumb, old utility guy, I just want to make sure we safely keep the lights on and do it at an affordable price.”

If the sprawling proposal becomes law, Gabriel said United Power will have to increase rates to pay for the solar and wind projects necessary to keep up with rising energy demand. That’s because the current version of the bill would end clean energy tax credits Democrats approved in the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate law signed by former President Biden in 2022.

The legislation would sunset the tax credits over time rather than scrapping them immediately. Future wind and solar projects must break ground within 60 days of the budget bill’s passage and begin operations by 2029 to qualify for the clean energy incentives. Colorado utilities, however, say the timeline doesn't give them enough time to adjust their current plans to expand energy production.

It’s unclear exactly how much the bill could increase Colorado energy prices. New York-based Rhodium Group, an energy research firm, has estimated the tax credits would save U.S. consumers 2 to 4 percent on their electricity bills by 2030. A separate analysis from Princeton University’s ZERO Lab estimates the average U.S. household’s energy costs could increase by roughly $100 to $160 per year by 2030 if the Republican proposal becomes law.

The D.C.-based Clean Energy Buyers Association, an advocacy group representing large businesses committed to buying renewable energy, released a report in May estimating that cutting the incentives would increase the average Colorado household’s electricity bill by 4.7 percent by 2032.

Why utilities say the Republican proposal could inflate energy bills

Gabriel said United Power‘s expansion plans help illustrate the importance of renewable energy incentives.

The cooperative utility delivers electricity to a 900-square-mile service territory covering parts of the suburbs north and west of Denver. Its customer base includes a rapidly growing number of households and oil and gas operators, which he said account for nearly a third of its revenue.

The utility isn’t only counting on renewables to meet its growing electricity demand. United Power has financed the construction of a natural gas power plant on the Eastern Plains and will continue relying on fossil fuels as part of its mix for power production.

But it has also signed contracts with developers building new solar, wind and battery storage projects, which Gabriel said is the cheapest way to add capacity to the energy grid. The electricity cooperative was counting on tax credits to help mitigate the overall cost of its expansion.

Without federal support, Gabriel said there’s a good chance the projects won’t move forward unless the cooperative agrees to pay higher prices. He said customers will ultimately end up covering those additional expenses.

“We don't have shareholders, we don't have anyone else to bear those increased costs if we want these projects to proceed to fruition,” Gabriel said.

Robert Kenney, the president of Xcel Energy Colorado, also joined the round table organized by Sen. Bennet. The utility is by far the state’s largest electricity provider, serving 1.6 million electricity customers around Metro Denver and Colorado’s Western Slope.

Xcel is also counting on clean energy to meet rising energy demands and Colorado’s strict climate goals. To cut its carbon impact, the massive investor-owned utility plans to close all of its coal-fired power plants by 2031.

To manage the transition, Xcel Energy has already won approval from state regulators to build $12 to $13 billion of new projects to meet its forecasted energy demand through 2028. Those projects include wind, solar and battery storage, plus a smaller proportion of new natural gas plants. Many of those projects are eligible for the federal tax incentives to encourage renewable energy development and production.

It’s now seeking permission for another investment blueprint to deliver electricity through 2031, when the company expects Colorado’s electricity demand to soar due to new data centers, electric vehicle adoption and a shift to all-electric heat pumps to warm and cool buildings. Kenney said the proposal could greenlight up to 14,000 megawatts of electricity capacity, with the vast majority of the new generation coming from wind and solar. The utility could also explore the possibility of building new nuclear and geothermal power plants.

Xcel Energy’s initial proposal doesn’t lay out the location of any projects or the plan’s exact price tag. If regulators sign off on the proposal, the utility would return to regulators with a more detailed plan for specific power plants, renewable energy sites and transmission lines.

Kenney said the loss of federal clean energy credits would increase the cost of those projects and the price ultimately paid by Xcel Energy customers. The company is also relying on federal tax incentives to spur adoption of energy-efficient home technology, solar panels and electric vehicles.

“These projects—I won't say they're made possible, but they're made more affordable for our customers by virtue of the production and investment tax credits,” Kenney said. “Our customers are able to achieve our collective climate goals at the lowest possible cost.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/10/241018-electric-power-lines-hv-0019.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 15:17:52.723884

Cost and high repair costs were cited as the reasons. But the actions of Elon Musk and the pushback on Tesla could also be a factor.

There have never been more electric vehicle options for consumers — but demand for the gas-alternative cars and trucks hasn’t been this low since 2019.

A new report from AAA shows buyers are increasingly hesitant to buy EVs, with only 19% of the people surveyed saying they were “likely” or “very likely” to purchase one as their next car. The number who are adamantly against buying an EV was up, however. Some 63% of respondents said they were “unlikely” or “very unlikely” to buy an EV. That’s the highest number since 2022.

While buyers are still as interested as ever in saving money on gas (74% of the people said that would be their primary reason to buying an EV) and a notable 59% cited concern for the environment, AAA said high battery repair costs (62%) and high purchase prices (59%) were among the key barriers to going electric.

Not mentioned in the AAA report, but almost certainly a factor is the pushback that has emerged in the past year against Tesla, one of the largest EV brands – and more specifically, its CEO Elon Musk.

Musk’s political activities and antics (such was waving a chainsaw or making a gesture that many likened to a Nazi salute) have soured support from many consumers, which has resulted in a significant sales slump at Tesla. Last quarter, the company reported a 13% drop in vehicles sales and 71% drop in profits.

Musk, who was largely absent from Tesla during his time at the White House and running the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has recently resumed his executive duties at the automaker.

Earlier this year, research firm McKinsey forecast that data centers would require close to $6.7 trillion in global investment to meet the rising demand.
Both Eaton and Siemens Energy have been participants in the annual Microgrid Knowledge Conference.","Two of the energy industry’s biggest players are joining their particular areas of expertise to build a fast-track approach to providing more easily scaled on-site power for future data centers.

German-based Siemens Energy and Irish-American power management technology firm Eaton are collaborating on new options for future data center projects. These offerings would include grid-independent energy supplies, such as gen-sets and on-site renewables, as well as standardized modular systems to help speed up data center construction.

Under the partnership aiming for modularity to circumnavigate long grid interconnection delays, Siemens Energy’s standard power configuration would generate 500 MW from its SGT-800 gas turbines. The data center package also could include battery storage systems and perhaps hydrogen fuel at some point.

“We offer hyperscalers, co-locators and investors a unique package, enabling them to reduce the time-to-market by up to two years in many places, which leads to significant revenue gains,” Andreas Pistauer, global head of sales for Siemens Energy’s gas services business, said in a statement. “Our power plant design is built with redundancy, eliminating the need for backup diesel generators, and reducing CO2 emissions by about 50 percent.”

Eaton’s electrical equipment would balance and manage the power system with medium and low-voltage switchgear, UPS, busways, racks and containment systems. The company also could provide engineering and software services to protect chips at the data centers.

“Our approach of letting customers pick the right balance of energy sources is very flexible and construction to start-up time is swift with options to reduce emissions in both the short and long term,” Cyrille Brisson, global segment leader for data centers at Eaton, said in a statement. “Crucially, our approach offers data center owners and developers the opportunity to build capacity and bring it online fast in any location where they have land available that is close to gas, water and fiber.”

The data center industry is expanding at a rapid pace in both the U.S. and around the world, driven by the rise in artificial intelligence, hyperscale and cloud-based capacity projects. Earlier this year, research firm McKinsey forecast that data centers would require close to $6.7 trillion in global investment to meet the rising demand.

McKinsey’s forecast also anticipates that total AI and non-AI workload would increase from 82 GW to more than 200 GW globally by 2030.

Tech firms are investing big to capture future energy capacity to meet new construction needs. The anticipated future load growth is leading companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta to consider nuclear energy partnerships, both conventional existing plants and future small modular reactors, none of which have been built yet in the U.S.

Eaton has broadened its development of microgrids in the recent past, including a 2024 project completed in Puerto Rico. Siemens also has participated in microgrid development worldwide.

You can see in the graph below that much of California’s growing clean energy capacity comes from solar and batteries.
In 2022, the US passed the single largest investment in climate and clean energy to date, named the Inflation Reduction Act.
Aside from trying to cancel federal funding, Trump’s erratic tariff regime is also raising costs for renewable energy projects.
California could lose even more, 35,700, according to an analysis published yesterday by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).","For three years in a row, California has added a record amount of new clean energy capacity. The amount of renewable energy and storage (i.e. batteries) added since 2020 is roughly equivalent to how much electricity the state has used on average on a daily basis — around 25,000 megawatts, according to new data from Governor Gavin Newsom’s office and the California Public Utilities Commission shared with The Verge.

California is expecting that growth to continue, although the road ahead is looking increasingly bumpy with the Trump administration trying to make it harder to build new green energy infrastructure in the US.

“We’ve never added so much capacity to our grid in such a short amount of time.”

“We’ve never added so much capacity to our grid in such a short amount of time, transforming our power grid to be cleaner and more reliable and resilient than ever before,” Newsom said in a statement emailed to The Verge. His office declined to comment on proposals in President Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” that could stymy renewable energy development if Congress passes it in its current form.

California added nearly 7,000 megawatts of renewable electricity and storage last year. That beats previous records set in 2023 and 2022 of 5,542 and 4,082 megawatts added respectively.

Looking ahead, another 20,000MW in green energy projects are under contract and expected to be complete by 2030. Fast forward even more, and current projections estimate 75,000MW of new capacity by 2040.

Renewable energy has taken off as more affordable alternatives for generating electricity than fossil fuels. California now generates more than 50 percent of its electricity from renewables. That’s more than the US as a whole, which gets about 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources.

But oil production and refining is still a big industry for California, and other states have even greener power grids. South Dakota, for example, generates more than three-quarters of its electricity from renewables thanks to abundant wind resources. You can see in the graph below that much of California’s growing clean energy capacity comes from solar and batteries.

Wind and solar produced more electricity than coal for the first time in the US last year thanks in large part to falling costs and policies meant to fight climate change by transitioning to renewable energy.

In 2022, the US passed the single largest investment in climate and clean energy to date, named the Inflation Reduction Act. It included roughly $369 billion in incentives for climate action, funding that the Trump administration is now attempting to claw back. Aside from trying to cancel federal funding, Trump’s erratic tariff regime is also raising costs for renewable energy projects. Companies have already canceled or delayed more than $14 billion in investments in clean energy and vehicle factories since January, according to a report last week.

To heighten the stakes, House Republicans passed a version of the “big, beautiful” spending bill in May that would slash Biden-era tax credits for renewable energy projects. Now the Senate is wrangling with the bill, which Republicans reportedly hope to pass before the July 4th holiday. Energy incentives have been a hot-button topic — alongside proposed Medicaid cuts and other dicey proposals within the sweeping bill — considering Republican districts stood to gain the most from projects benefiting from those tax credits.

Texas — the fastest growing solar market in the US — could lose 34,100 jobs in that industry by 2030 if the House version of the bill were to become law. California could lose even more, 35,700, according to an analysis published yesterday by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/gettyimages-1558525665.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.4135337268098%2C100%2C93.17293254638&w=1200,N,,2025-06-04 16:07:06.642177

LITTLETON, Colorado, June 4 (Reuters) – U.S. power producers have lifted output from both fossil fuels and clean energy sources to new highs so far in 2025, on the back of steadily rising energy demand from data centers, businesses and households.

Average retail electricity prices have risen in tow, and are hovering near record highs in a majority of U.S. states.

Below are five charts on U.S. power generation and electricity prices to help keep track of these key trends.

POWERING UP

Over the first five months of 2025, U.S. power producers lifted total output by 2% from the same months in 2024 to a new record of 69.3 million megawatt hours (MWh), according to data from LSEG.

Generation from both clean and fossil fuel energy sources has scaled new highs so far this year, with clean power output rising by 3% and fossil fuel output by 2% from the same months a year ago.

The slightly faster growth pace of clean power production has lifted the clean power share of the U.S. generation mix to a new high of 45%, up from 44% for the same months last year.

US power generators boost both clean & fossil fuel output to record highs so far in 2025

Natural gas remains the primary power source within the U.S. system, and accounted for around 37% of total power production so far this year.

However, a sharp jump in gas prices to two-year highs during the opening months of the year spurred generators to cut back on gas use in some areas, leaving overall gas output roughly 4% lower so far this year.

To offset lower gas-powered supplies, power firms cranked coal-fired production 18% higher from the January to May 2024 period to the highest in three years.

On the clean energy side, output from solar firms jumped by 34% from the same period in 2024 while wind output climbed 2%. Output from both hydro dams and nuclear plants was roughly 1% lower, LSEG data shows.

Electricity production trends from January through April broadly matched those of power generation, although clean electricity output outpaced clean power production thanks to a large swell in utility solar generation.

Coal and hydro-powered electricity output have also posted strong year-over-year increases so far in 2025, data from Ember shows.

PRICE PULL

Average commercial retail electricity prices climbed to new highs across several parts of the country during the opening quarter of the year.

Of all U.S. states, Hawaii posted the highest average commercial retail electricity price during January to March, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Hawaii’s average of 37.6 cents per kilowatt hour (KWh) during the opening quarter of 2025 was actually 9% less than during the same months of 2024 due to lower crude oil prices, but was still more than twice the national average.

The lowest electricity prices this year were recorded in North Dakota, which averaged 7.3 cents/KWh during January to March.

Commercial electricity costs vary widely across the US, with businesses in North Dakota paying over 80% less per KWh than businesses in Hawaii

The U.S. average commercial retail electricity price during the first quarter of 2025 was around 13 cents/KWh, which was around 4% more than in the same quarter in 2024.

The state with the largest year-over-year rise in retail electricity costs was Rhode Island (+24% to 25.3 cents/KWh), followed by Connecticut (+22% to 25.15 cents/KWh).

RISING TIDE

Climbing electricity costs are not just a recent phenomenon, as average U.S. retail prices have posted increases every year since 2021.

However, the extent of cost increases varies widely across the country.

California, which has ambitious climate policies and faces a sprawling generation network exposed to floods, wildfires and desert conditions, has seen the steepest climb in electricity costs among all states since 2019.

Average electricity costs in California during the first quarter of this year were 62% more than during the opening quarter of 2019, EIA data shows.

However, several other major U.S. states have also recorded double-digit electricity price hikes over the same period, including New York (+56%), Pennsylvania (+36%) and Florida (+23%), which all have very different power generation markets.

While commercial electricity costs vary by state, they are all trending higher and most have risen notably since 2019

And nearly all U.S. states can expect to see further increases in average retail electricity costs in the months ahead, as electricity prices and demand both tend to hit their annual peaks during the summer air conditioning season.

US electricity prices and demand tend to peak during the summer when use of power-hungry air conditioners peaks

Many states may see a minor retreat in electricity prices again once the summer is over.

But with most U.S. utilities on the hook to upgrade transmission networks and boost power generation to keep up with rising energy demand, electricity consumers across the country can expect further increases in their power bills going forward.

On May 21, 2025, Acting EPA Assistant Administrator Peggy S. Browne issued a memorandum, “Clarification Regarding the Application of Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification,” to “reiterate the EPA’s longstanding position” that the CWA cannot be used as a “weapon to shut down projects for reasons with no basis in the statute or applicable regulations.” The memorandum further explains that the states’ or authorized tribes’ certifying authority is “limited to considering adverse impacts to water quality, and only such impacts insofar as they prevent compliance with applicable water quality requirements.”

Under the CWA, states and authorized tribes must decide within a “reasonable period of time,” not to exceed one year, whether to certify that a proposed project seeking a federal license or permit will comply with their water quality standards. In September 2023, the EPA promulgated revised regulations of CWA Section 401 (2023 Rule). As discussed in our previous legal alert, the 2023 Rule allowed states and authorized tribal authorities to review a project “as a whole,” seemingly broadening their authority over activities that may not typically be viewed as related to water quality issues. This memorandum was issued due to stakeholders’ concerns over the 2023 Rule and the use of it by states and authorized tribes to deny projects based on “potential impacts to air quality, traﬃc, noise, project preference, or economic impacts.” The memorandum reinforces that “CWA Section 401 is limited to addressing only water quality-related impacts” connected to a specific water quality requirement and that the 2023 Rule does not authorize states or tribes to deny or condition a 401 Water Quality Certificate based on generalized concerns about water quality or potential impacts not connected to water quality.

The memorandum goes on to say that the EPA will use “future Federal Register notice and recommendations docket to identify additional areas of implementation challenges and regulatory uncertainty” related to the 2023 Rule.

These “woke” corporations undermine Trump’s America First energy agenda, and Congress is enabling them by stalling the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act’s green handouts.
The grip that the Paris Accords hold on our energy system is a betrayal of Texas values and American priorities.","The 2016 Paris Climate Accord is more than a bad deal — it is a globalist straitjacket that President Trump has rightly called a “rip-off.”

But even though Trump has pulled America out of it (twice), Paris still haunts our national security, our economy and the president’s “energy dominance” agenda. Despite Trump’s unwavering commitment to withdrawing from this “unfair, one-sided” pact and his condemnation of Biden’s rejoining as a “disaster,” powerful interests — big oil, big tech, manufacturers and industrial electricity users — are perpetuating the accord’s influence.

In Texas, these forces are fighting long-overdue grid reliability reforms that would force unreliable wind and solar generators to pay for the chaos they cause, costs that are dumped onto families and small businesses. This would effectively charge ratepayers to subsidize corporate virtue-signaling tied to climate commitments, leaving Texans to foot the bill for an agenda that undermines energy reliability.

In 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued a clear directive to the Public Utility Commission to “allocate reliability costs to generation resources that cannot guarantee their own availability, such as wind or solar power.” This commonsense reform would force renewable energy providers to internalize their true costs. Yet the commission has so far ignored this directive, leaving Texas families and small businesses to bear what amounts to an electricity tax. In 2023, Texas ratepayers were saddled with a staggering $2.3 billion tab to cover the costs of wind and solar power’s unreliability.

Trump has been crystal clear about the Paris Accord’s harm, stating in the first-term executive order, “This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.” His administration’s withdrawal from the accord was a bold step toward energy dominance. Yet corporate America, bolstered by misguided policies, continues to undermine his vision.

Former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act pours billions in subsidies and tax breaks into inefficient solar, wind and battery technologies, inflating electricity costs and distorting markets. Congress’s latest proposal, the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, delays meaningful cuts to these subsidies. This protracted timeline will spark a frenzy of green tech deployments, further driving up electricity costs for Americans already grappling with what can only be described as an energy emergency. This is not the path to energy dominance; it is a capitulation to the “climate cartel.”

The costs of this agenda are not just financial — they are existential. Texas’s energy grid, ERCOT, once a model of resilience, is increasingly strained due to the variability of wind and solar, which cannot deliver power when it is needed most. The 2021 winter storm in Texas and recent blackouts in Europe exposed the fragility of over-reliance on renewables, yet the same corporate interests that champion Paris are doubling down on these flawed technologies.

The inconsistency is glaring. Big tech giants and industrial users demand grid reliability to power their production, data centers and factories, yet they fiercely oppose market reforms that would reward reliability and hold renewable energy accountable for its variability. Through power purchase agreements, these companies buy “carbon-free” electricity to signal their Paris compliance, but buried in those deals are provisions that let renewable providers pass higher grid costs back to the buyer if and only if new rules or legislation force them to pay for their own unreliability. That is why lobbyists from Big Tech, Big Oil and “woke” utilities have all descended on Austin to oppose reforms. They don’t want their bill to come due.

To break free from the Paris Climate scam and reclaim American energy independence, Texas and the federal government must act decisively. Texas has already led by example — in 2021, the state banned financial institutions that boycott fossil fuels from doing business with the state, striking a blow against the Environmental, Social and Governance or ESG movement, which I have called “Wall Street’s green coercion.” But the fight must go further.

The Public Utility Commission of Texas should swiftly implement Gov. Abbott’s directive to allocate reliability costs to renewable generators, ending the market distortions being fueled by corporate virtue signaling. Companies with Net Zero or Paris Accord commitments — just like those boycotting fossil fuels — should be barred from receiving public contracts, subsidies and tax breaks. These “woke” corporations undermine Trump’s America First energy agenda, and Congress is enabling them by stalling the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act’s green handouts.

We need to reject the timid phasedown in the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act and instead dismantle the Inflation Reduction Act entirely. As I testified before the House Oversight Committee, this agenda diverts resources from reliable, affordable energy in service of globalist elites, threatening both our economic liberty and energy security.

The grip that the Paris Accords hold on our energy system is a betrayal of Texas values and American priorities. We deserve an energy future that puts affordability and reliability first, not one manipulated by liberal executives and unelected climate bureaucrats.

EV adoption in the US is lagging behind much of the world, and the latest annual survey from the American Automobile Association (AAA) helps explain what’s slowing things down. Interest in EVs among US drivers is not just stalling, it’s actually shrinking.

In the 2025 edition of the AAA survey, just 16% of respondents said they are likely or very likely to purchase an EV, marking the lowest percentage recorded since 2019. Meanwhile, 63% reported they are unlikely or very unlikely to go electric. That’s a noticeable shift from three years ago when 25% expressed interest and 51% were against it.

Confidence in the timeline for broader EV adoption is also fading. Only 23% of US drivers now believe most cars will be electric within the next decade, down from 40% in 2022.

Why Americans Are Saying No to EVs

When asked which is the main reason behind their decision not to go electric, 62% of the respondents mentioned high battery repair costs, while 59% cited the overall purchase price. Long-distance practicality was another key issue, with 57% saying EVs don’t suit extended travel, and 56% pointing to the lack of a convenient public charging network. Another 55% simply worry about running out of charge while on the road.

Other issues were mentioned less frequently. About 31% raised concerns about safety, 27% said they couldn’t install a home charging, and 12% noted the potential loss of EV-related incentives.

Those who are still considering an EV say the main draw is savings on fuel. That was the top reason cited by 77% of interested respondents. Another 59% referenced environmental benefits, and 47% said they expect lower maintenance and repair costs compared to traditional vehicles.

Support for federal and state incentives has also declined. Only 39% of respondents in 2025 listed tax credits and rebates as a reason to go electric, down from 60% in 2022. That drop aligns with the direction of the current political landscape, as the Trump administration continues efforts to scale back EV-related subsidies. Interest in EVs for their advanced tech features also dropped, with just 22% citing innovation as a motivator.

Uncertainty About The EV Future

AAA concludes that the public perception regarding the future of EVs remains uncertain. Despite the wide variety of EVs which are now available in the US market, many buyers find hybrids more appealing.

(NEXASTAR) — New York’s electric grid faces growing reliability concerns as old power plants close faster than new ones open and demand for electricity rises sharply, according to a report from the state’s grid operator. The state has less extra power available to meet unexpected needs, representing a shrinking safety net.

The New York Independent System Operator released its “Power Trends 2025” report on Monday. Available to read at the bottom of this story, it details how the amount of extra power available—called reliability margins—continues to shrink. That’s because power plants that burn fossil fuels are being phased out, and new power sources aren’t keeping up with the expected increase in demand for electricity.

“The grid is undergoing rapid and instrumental change,” said Rich Dewey, NYISO President and CEO. “We continue to observe declining reliability margins while forecasting a dramatic increase in load.” Load refers to the total amount of electricity used by consumers and businesses.

New, large electricity users—like factories making computer chips, generative artificial intelligence projects, and data centers—have spiked the projected demand for power. These new industries coincide with programs encouraging greener electricity sources for heating and transportation. Those narrow reliability margins raise the odds of power shortages going forward.

The report also warned that New York still depends on fossil fuel power generators that are 50 years old or more. NYISO said New York will become a winter-peaking system by the 2040s, meaning that the greatest demands for electricity will be in winter. Because more and more homes and cars will be using electricity for heating and travel, fuel supplies will be most limited on the very coldest days of the year.

The report also highlighted that energy efficiency and demand-side management, which are programs that help reduce electricity use, will continue to play an important role. Repowering older power plants—upgrading them to be more efficient and produce fewer emissions—could also help reliably meet rising demands.

NYISO manages the state’s electric grid, runs its competitive wholesale electricity market, and plans for the power system’s future. That’s why NYISO connects new power plants and transmission lines to connect to the grid in a process called interconnection. Emilie Nelson, NYISO Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, said, “We recently streamlined the interconnection process for new generation and launched new market products intended to bring more power onto the grid at the most efficient cost.”

Urey Yarkpawolo, today appeal for joint regional action to protect shared water resources.

Speaking at the Mano Rivee Union Briefing and Sensitization Meeting on the Creation of the Transboundary Water Basins Management Office (TWBMO), held at the Corina Hotel on 26th Street, Sinkor, Dr. Yarkpawolo stressed the urgent need for collaboration among MRU member states—Liberia, Sierra Leone, Côte d’Ivoire, and Guinea.

“We are gathered here for a matter of critical importance: the management of our shared water basins,” Dr. Yarkpawolo told the audience of minister’s representatives, technical experts, and regional delegates. “Our rivers are under serious threat—from pollution, illegal mining, and climate change. We must act together before it’s too late.”

He cited real-world examples to highlight the challenges. He recalled how the Cavalla River—shared by Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire—was polluted by a mining company last year, yet Liberian authorities only learned about the incident a month later. Illegal dredging along the same river, he noted, is still ongoing on both sides of the border, with weak enforcement due to jurisdictional barriers.

Dr. Yarkpawolo also pointed to the Mano River, which borders Liberia and Sierra Leone, as another example. “It once ran clean,” he said, “but today it’s polluted, and the people who once depended on it are suffering.”

He said these stories reflect a larger regional crisis. “This is not just about Liberia. All of us are facing the same problems. That’s why we need a strong, functioning MRU Water Basin Authority.”

Liberia, he noted, has already made water protection a key part of its national climate strategy—NDCs 3.0—but national efforts are not enough.

“Most of our major rivers start in Guinea. If we don’t protect the headwaters, what happens downstream in Liberia, Sierra Leone, or Côte d’Ivoire will not matter.”

Dr. Yarkpawolo recommended that the new regional office focus on setting clear policies and treaties, which member countries would then enforce through their national institutions.

“Let’s be honest—setting up an office is not the hard part. Making it work is where the challenge lies,” he said. “We need our political leaders to go beyond speeches. We need real funding, real authority, and real commitment.”

Through a spate of executive orders, agency directives, and staffing restructurings, the administration is rapidly changing course from many of the climate, clean energy, and environmental justice initiatives established over the last decade.

While the full impacts of these changes will unfold over time—and likely face numerous legal challenges—the strategic direction is discernible: a pivot away from climate mitigation and environmental justice efforts and toward energy independence, including support of fossil fuel development, deregulation, and permitting reform.

For business leaders and their legal counsel, understanding these shifts is essential for successfully addressing compliance planning, identifying litigation risks, and adapting long-term investment strategies. This Insight, based on our Earth Day webinar series, provides an overview of the most significant federal environmental developments to date and offers key takeaways to help companies navigate this rapidly evolving policy environment.

PROMOTING FOSSIL FUEL DOMINANCE

The centerpiece of the administration’s environmental agenda is energy development, particularly domestic fossil fuels. Framed by the declaration of a “national energy emergency,” the administration has empowered federal agencies to fast-track oil, gas, and coal projects, loosen permitting requirements, and prioritize infrastructure development on federal lands.

Key executive orders have

directed agencies to rescind Biden-era environmental rules and review regulations deemed to “potentially burden” domestic energy development;

halted offshore wind leasing and initiated a review of existing wind energy projects;

prioritized the development of Alaska’s natural gas reserves and associated infrastructure;

revoked the waiver under the Clean Air Act with respect to California’s authority to set its own vehicle emissions standards; and

exempted dozens of coal-fired power plants from recent emissions standards under the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) program.

Taken together, these moves reflect an aggressive strategy to boost fossil fuel output by reducing regulatory friction. This could be especially impactful if the administration can effectuate permit reforms that facilitate siting, design, and construction of pipeline and electricity infrastructure.

While the administration expects its reforms to lower costs and enhance energy security, stakeholders should be aware of the potential for public opposition, litigation, and market instability and uncertainty. It is also unknown to what extent oil and gas producers will increase production based on current and projected future commodity prices.

CHANGES TO FEDERAL CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE POLICY

Two of the most prominent areas impacted by the administration’s shift in environmental priorities are federal climate action and environmental justice initiatives.

Climate Regulation Rollback

One of the most consequential steps in the climate change arena is the administration’s reconsideration of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 endangerment finding, which underpins all greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations under the Clean Air Act. If revoked, it would undermine EPA’s authority to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, require reconsideration of existing climate rules, and likely reshape the regulatory framework around climate issues for the foreseeable future.

The administration has performed the following additional actions:

Withdrawn the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement (for a second time)

Paused funding for international climate finance and multilateral adaptation programs

Reconsidered the Clean Trucks Plan and vehicle emissions standards

Revoked various federal rules that subsidized or promoted electric vehicles, EV infrastructure, and renewable energy

Each of these decisions signals a shift from climate mitigation to energy expansion, raising legal and regulatory uncertainty across industries where planning horizons value stability.

Environmental Justice Initiatives Dismantled

The administration has also moved to dismantle the prior administration’s environmental justice framework through several actions:

Revoking Executive Order 12898, the 1994 directive that incorporated environmental justice into federal decision-making

Eliminating the Justice40 initiative, which had earmarked 40% of climate infrastructure funding for disadvantaged communities

Terminating the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice and eliminating hundreds of related positions

Removing environmental justice–related screening tools from federal websites

The administration promotes these efforts as part of its broader push for merit-based and color-blind policymaking. Regardless of the rationale, these steps are a departure from permitting and enforcement decisions that had increasingly accounted for socioeconomic and cumulative pollution factors under prior policy. The loss of dedicated environmental justice funding and infrastructure may also have direct impacts on cleanup, remediation, and development efforts in historically burdened communities.

PERMITTING REFORM AND DEREGULATION

Another cornerstone of the administration’s agenda is reforming environmental permitting processes. At the federal level, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a key focus. A recent DC Circuit ruling, Marin Audubon Society v. FAA, called into question the validity of existing NEPA implementing regulations, and the administration has since moved to rescind all Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations issued since 1977.

New directives

instruct agencies to establish their own NEPA procedures aligned with the Unleashing American Energy initiative;

encourage use of emergency permitting authority to bypass traditional reviews; and

discourage reliance on CEQ guidance currently in legal limbo.

The result is a highly fluid permitting environment, with standards and processes varying between agencies and likely to shift midstream. For project developers and investors, this system may increase the risks of delay, litigation, and noncompliance, particularly for large infrastructure and energy projects.

Further, a slate of deregulatory executive orders aims to reduce federal oversight of emissions sources, water pollution, and power plant operations, including rules that encourage agencies to rescind past guidance or “zero out” entire regulatory budgets tied to clean energy or climate efforts.

LEGAL AND BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS

The volume and scope of the administration’s executive actions in the environmental arena arguably are unprecedented. While many of the policies are still in early implementation phases, several trends are emerging:

Legal Challenges Will Proliferate: Environmental NGOs, states, and even businesses are likely to challenge many of these actions in court. From the reconsideration of the endangerment finding to funding rescissions and NEPA rollbacks, expect heavy litigation that will create delays and uncertainty.

Compliance Landscapes Are Shifting: Companies that rely on environmental permits, emissions credits, or renewable incentives must reassess their strategies and exposure. Deregulation may reduce federal compliance burdens in the short term but could introduce state-level conflicts and long-term planning challenges, with certain states potentially implementing regulations to replace federal ones that were modified or eliminated.

Project Developers Face New Risk/Reward Tradeoffs: The easing of permitting and review requirements may accelerate certain fossil fuel and industrial projects, but at the cost of legal stability and public scrutiny. Companies should be cautious of relying on rapid approvals without accounting for litigation risks or future policy reversals.

Climate-Related Investments May Be Jeopardized: With the rollback of clean energy subsidies and Justice40 earmarks, climate-focused investors may find reduced federal support for certain initiatives, particularly in under-resourced communities.

LOOKING AHEAD

Many of the administration’s goals, particularly those focused on deregulation and fossil fuel expansion, rely on agency rulemaking and interpretation: the most significant impacts may not be felt for months or even years. But the administration’s executive actions are already reshaping how companies evaluate environmental risk, approach compliance, and prepare for enforcement.

Business leaders and their legal advisors should stay closely attuned to regulatory developments and court challenges while also evaluating how their internal ESG, climate, and permitting strategies may need to adapt to a more volatile, less predictable federal landscape.",https://www.morganlewis.com/-/media/images/tiles/energy-environmental/earth-day-webinar-series_478656454_240717_largetile.jpg?rev=ed5aa94be8174b3bb3a7c333c6bc6530&hash=691947489C864498F2DDA69BCCB3FE21,N,,2025-06-04 14:14:57.007028

These actions are critical to ensuring a stable, reliable electricity system that supports new housing, businesses and industries while keeping energy costs affordable for people.

“We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the world in clean energy and we’re acting with urgency to make sure every British Columbian benefits,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Energy and Climate Solutions. “By expanding our clean-power supply and increasing energy efficiency, we’re securing our power grid, building a resilient electricity system and creating sustainable jobs that drive economic growth.”

The first RFEOI focuses on expanding B.C.’s long-term capacity to meet peak electricity demand as consumption patterns evolve. BC Hydro is seeking ideas on capacity and baseload energy projects, including geothermal, pumped storage and hydroelectric resources. Capacity and baseload projects can reliably deliver firm power and provide backup for intermittent energy projects, such as wind and solar that rely on external, uncontrollable conditions such as the wind blowing or the sun shining to deliver power.

The second RFEOI targets innovation in energy efficiency by identifying partners capable of delivering market-ready technologies that help conserve energy in homes and buildings. Through the RFEOI, BC Hydro seeks to collaborate with industry leaders and forward-thinking organizations to help people in British Columbia save energy and lower costs.

Energy efficiency is the cleanest and least expensive way to meet increasing demand for power. The energy-efficiency RFEOI supports BC Hydro’s comprehensive Power Smart energy savings program and complements BC Hydro’s $700 million expanded Energy Efficiency Plan, which increases investments in tools, technologies and rebates. These initiatives encourage energy-conscious decisions and help customers reduce electricity consumption. BC Hydro estimates that this plan will save customers $80 million annually and deliver more than 2,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity savings by 2030, the equivalent of powering more than 200,000 homes.

“We are looking beyond the near term and opening up exploration of the next chapter of B.C.’s energy future by advancing the dialogue with industry participants and potential partners around clean-technology investments and expanding our leading energy-efficiency programs,” said Chris O’Riley, president and CEO of BC Hydro. “With BC Hydro’s long-standing legacy of delivering clean, reliable power, these initiatives will drive growth, sustainability and energy security, creating new opportunities across British Columbia.”

The information gathered from both RFEOIs will guide future energy planning and procurement strategies. Submissions will close in September 2025.

Both initiatives are part of the recently announced Clean Power Action Plan, an ambitious strategy to strengthen energy security, enhance system resilience and accelerate the transition to clean power. The plan also includes:

launching a second call for power to acquire a target of as much as 5,000 gigawatt-hours per year of energy from large, clean and renewable projects, which builds on the success of the 2024 call for power and resulted in 10 new renewable-energy projects, with First Nations asset ownership between 49% and 51%, capable of powering about 500,000 new homes;

investing more than $12 million from the B.C. Innovative Clean Energy fund in a targeted three-year call for new, made-in-B.C. clean-energy technologies that will combat climate change and create sustainable jobs; and

streamlining connections to B.C.’s grid to enable new homes and businesses to access clean electricity faster and less expensively.

Through these actions, BC Hydro is reinforcing its commitment to delivering clean, reliable energy, supporting British Columbia’s transition to a low-carbon economy and ensuring electricity remains affordable, sustainable and accessible to all residents.

Quick Facts:

The following BC Hydro actions will power more than one million new homes in the coming years:

adding the Site C hydroelectric dam, which will generate enough electricity to power 500,000 homes and increase supply by 8%;

bringing new renewable wind and solar projects into service from the recent call for power, collectively powering 500,000 homes and boosting supply by 8%; and,

expanding investments in energy efficiency, expected to save 2,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually, enough to power 200,000 homes.

Hydrogen production is also inextricably linked to fossil fuels, with over 92 percent of hydrogen plants in the US relying on natural gas for production.
This tool focuses mainly on standalone hydrogen production plants and plants that are co-located with liquefaction facilities, a process that cools down hydrogen gas to produce liquid hydrogen.
In addition to the reliance on fossil fuels for hydrogen production processes, 55 percent of hydrogen produced in the US is used in petroleum refining to remove sulfur and other impurities from fuels.
The false promises of clean hydrogen production Decarbonization plans centered around hydrogen typically rely on green or blue hydrogen production.","For the past few years, hydrogen has been proposed as a method of reducing emissions in almost every sector, from energy production, to transportation, to manufacturing. This has led to a boom in proposed hydrogen production plants, mainly focused on so-called low carbon hydrogen. But hydrogen production isn’t new. This gas has long been used in petroleum refining and chemical manufacturing, with 90 percent of hydrogen produced in the US being used in oil refineries and ammonia production. Hydrogen production is also inextricably linked to fossil fuels, with over 92 percent of hydrogen plants in the US relying on natural gas for production.

Clean Energy Group’s new mapping tool, Hydrogen Projects in the US, is designed to visualize the current state of hydrogen production, providing information on production method, end use, amount produced, project status, and carbon emissions for 136 hydrogen production projects across the country. Clean Energy Group (CEG) compiled data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Facility Level Information on GreenHouse gas Tool (FLIGHT), the Energy Information Administration’s Refinery Capacity Report, and looked at construction and investment announcements, press releases, and local news stories to bring together this mapping tool. This tool focuses mainly on standalone hydrogen production plants and plants that are co-located with liquefaction facilities, a process that cools down hydrogen gas to produce liquid hydrogen. The changing landscape of federal investment in hydrogen has led to the cancellation of many announced projects, and so only verifiable projects in the planning and construction stages were included. Comprehensive data on hydrogen production projects in the US had not previously been available for free to the general public.

Hydrogen is produced mainly through fossil fuels

The chart below shows planned and operational hydrogen production projects in the US, summarizing the data found in CEG’s mapping tool, with their production method denoted by color. (See CEG’s hydrogen production color chart for more information about each production method.)

Despite “low carbon” hydrogen production dominating the narrative of hydrogen as a tool for decarbonization, most currently operational hydrogen facilities (92% in the US) produce grey hydrogen, which is made from natural gas using a process called methane reforming. For the purposes of this map, hydrogen produced through coal gasification is also designated as grey hydrogen, though it makes up a very small amount of production in the US. CEG obtained carbon emissions data for 105 out of the 117 grey hydrogen projects mapped, totaling more than 43 million metric tons of CO2 per year. These emissions only capture the carbon dioxide released as a result of the chemical production process. Since methane reforming typically requires ~ 3.2 kg of natural gas for every 1 kg of hydrogen produced, methane leakage throughout extraction and transportation of natural gas feedstocks contributes significantly to the total carbon intensity of the system.

In addition to the reliance on fossil fuels for hydrogen production processes, 55 percent of hydrogen produced in the US is used in petroleum refining to remove sulfur and other impurities from fuels. Demand for hydrogen in refineries has risen with increasingly stringent environmental regulations around the sulfur content of diesel. Hydrogen’s prominence in petroleum refining is reflected in the mapping tool, with 44 hydrogen production plants being onsite at refineries, producing around 2 billion standard cubic feet of hydrogen per day. Another 16 plants produce hydrogen offsite to be transported to refineries. These 60 plants solely rely on methane reforming to produce hydrogen. California, Texas, and Louisiana lead the country in refineries, so it is no surprise that they also house the most hydrogen plants, operating 26, 25, and 16 hydrogen production facilities respectively.

The false promises of clean hydrogen production

Decarbonization plans centered around hydrogen typically rely on green or blue hydrogen production. Green hydrogen is created through electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy. Blue hydrogen is produced through methane reforming paired with carbon capture and storage. While blue hydrogen achieves 9-12 percent lower CO2 emissions than grey hydrogen, it is heavily polluting by any other measure, and relying on natural gas as a feedstock perpetuates the harms of the fossil fuel industry. Green hydrogen doesn’t result in carbon dioxide emissions from production, nor does it use natural gas as a feedstock, but it depends on large amounts of renewable energy and water, often diverting wind and solar resources away from more beneficial direct decarbonization uses and drawing on already limited water supplies.

While proposals for blue and green hydrogen projects are gaining traction, operational production remains a small portion of the total amount of hydrogen available across the country. CEG mapped only six operational green hydrogen and one blue hydrogen plant, with ten more facilities in construction or planning stages. The capacity of individual green hydrogen plants remains low compared to grey hydrogen plants, meaning that more plants would need to be built to replace current production. Proposed end uses for these projects include chemical manufacturing, refueling stations, power generation, and maritime shipping.

CEG also identified two turquoise hydrogen production demonstration projects, a production method using pyrolysis to transform natural gas into hydrogen and solid carbon. A pink hydrogen demonstration project was also mapped, producing hydrogen through nuclear energy using electrolysis at the Nine Mile Point nuclear generating station in New York. Pink and turquoise hydrogen production methods are still emerging technologies. Both methods come with concerns around the use of methane as a feedstock for hydrogen production and the costs, energy use, and water use needed for electrolysis.

A precarious future

Green hydrogen production is expensive, and, as the landscape for federal funding and tax credits for “clean” hydrogen projects continues to be marked with uncertainty, developers and investors are pulling out. The lack of operational capacity for green hydrogen production and the cancellation of countless projects across the country brings into question the viability of decarbonization plans relying on this fuel.

Even if breakthroughs in technology allow for an exponential growth in green hydrogen production, study after study show that green hydrogen should have a narrow role in a carbon-free society, limited to difficult to decarbonize industries like steel manufacturing. Employing renewable energy to produce green hydrogen instead of decarbonizing the grid results in up to a five times smaller emissions reduction. Additionally, hydrogen leakages are detrimental across all production methods and could have devastating climate warming impacts due to its role as an indirect greenhouse gas that extends the life of methane in the atmosphere. Green hydrogen production is the most leak prone, and an increase in production and subsequently in leakages could counteract any potential climate benefits.

With the spotlight on green and blue hydrogen, CEG’s mapping tool helps to visualize the reality of the landscape of hydrogen production in the US. Hydrogen is mainly used in petroleum refining and chemical production and is produced almost exclusively through methane reforming, an extremely carbon intensive process. Broadening hydrogen’s end uses to decarbonize power generation, as many gas companies and utilities are lobbying for, is not possible due to the current capacity of green hydrogen production, and a rapid buildout of green hydrogen plants would only thwart proven decarbonization methods and delay necessary climate action.",https://www.cleanegroup.org/wp-content/uploads/bigstock-Oil-and-gas-industrial-tanks-82899638-scaled-e1749046463463.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 16:07:16.339880

Smoke from Canadian wildfires started making air quality worse in the eastern U.S. on Wednesday as several Midwestern states battled conditions deemed unhealthy by the federal government.

The fires have forced thousands of Canadians to flee their homes and sent smoke as far as Europe.

In the U.S., the Midwest is bearing the brunt. Smoke lingered on the skylines of cities from Kansas City to Minneapolis, and a swath of the region had unhealthy air quality Wednesday, according to an Environmental Protection Agency map.

Iowa issued a statewide air quality alert through early Thursday, urging residents to limit certain outdoor activities and warning of possible health effects due to the thick smoke. Wisconsin officials made similar suggestions as the smoke drifted southeast across the state.

In Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, authorities advised people to shut windows at night, avoid strenuous activity outside and watch for breathing issues.

Parts of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York had areas of moderate air quality concern, and officials advised sensitive people to consider reducing outdoor activity.

New Hampshire authorities hoped conditions would improve by late Wednesday.

“The particle air pollution event is the result of extensive wildfires in central and western Canada,” the state’s Department of Environmental Services said. “Wind patterns are forecasted to transport plumes of smoke from these fires across much of New England and New Hampshire.”

Unhealthy conditions persist in Midwest

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued an alert for almost the entire state into Wednesday, but the Twin Cities area got the worst of it in the Midwest on Tuesday.

“As the smoke continues to move across the state Tuesday, air quality will slowly improve from northwest to southeast for the remainder of the alert area,” the agency said. “The smoke is expected to leave the state by Wednesday at noon.”

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources warned that air quality in a band from the state’s southwest corner to the northeast could fall into the unhealthy category through Thursday morning. The agency recommended that people, especially those with heart and lung disease, avoid long or intense activities and take extra breaks while doing strenuous actions outdoors.

Conditions at ground level are in the red

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow map showed a swath of red for “unhealthy” conditions across Wisconsin and northern Iowa. Northern Michigan was also the site of many unhealthy zones, the agency said. The Air Quality Index was around 160 in many parts of the upper Midwest, indicating unhealthy conditions.

The Air Quality Index — AQI — measures how clean or polluted the air is, focusing on health effects that might be experienced within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air. It is based on ground-level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Particulates are the main issue from the fires.

The index ranges from green, where the air quality is satisfactory and air pollution poses little or no risk, to maroon, which is considered hazardous. That level comes with health warnings of emergency conditions where everyone is more likely to be affected, according to AirNow.

There were areas of reduced air quality all over the U.S. on Wednesday, with numerous advisories about moderate air quality concerns as far away as Kansas and Georgia.

The Canadian fire situation

Canada is having another bad wildfire season. Most of the smoke reaching the American Midwest has been coming from fires northwest of the provincial capital of Winnipeg in Manitoba.

Canada’s worst-ever wildfire season was in 2023. It choked much of North America with dangerous smoke for months.

The smoke even reaches Europe

Canada’s wildfires are so large and intense that the smoke is even reaching Europe, where it is causing hazy skies but isn’t expected to affect surface-air quality, according the European climate service Copernicus.

According to a recent survey conducted by AAA, interest in purchasing a fully electric vehicle has actually fallen to its lowest level since 2019. While only 16% of those polled indicated that they would be either “likely” or “very likely” to purchase an EV as their next vehicle, nearly two-thirds (63%) of respondents indicated the converse — that they would be either “unlikely” or “very unlikely” to do so. The latter figure represents the highest level since 2022, moving 12 points upward from the 51% of those who replied in the negative during the last survey period.

“Since we began tracking interest in fully electric vehicles, we’ve seen some variability,” said Greg Brannon, director of automotive engineering for AAA.

“While the automotive industry is committed to long-term electrification and providing a diverse range of models, underlying consumer hesitation remains,” Brannon added.

Costs Associated With Purchase of Electric Vehicles and Battery Repair Cited as Primary Barriers to Purchase

The reason why many American drivers appear to be tuning out on the concept of purchasing a fully electric vehicle? According to survey data, high battery repair costs (62% said as much) and the initial purchase price of an EV in and of itself (59%) were cited as key factors.

Other notable entries on the list: a perception that EVs may not be entirely suited for long-haul travels (57% of survey respondents indicated as much), a lack of convenient and easily accessible public charging stations (56%), and a general fear of running out of charge while driving (55%).

Rounding out the pack of disincentives surrounding the purchase of an EV were broad safety concerns (31%), issues surrounding the installation of charging stations at one’s residence (27%), and the potential reduction — or elimination entirely — of EV-related tax credits and rebates (12%).

Concern for the Environment, Savings on Gas Costs, Lower Maintenance and Repair Costs Bolster EV Interest

While overall interest in purchasing an EV as their next vehicle is on the wane for drivers surveyed, those who did indicate interest in buying a fully electric vehicle gestured toward a wide array of reasons for doing so.

Up first: saving on gas bills. Nearly three-quarters (74%) of respondents stated that this was the primary reason they might consider buying an EV in the near future. Concern for the environment came in at second place (59%), followed by lower maintenance and repair costs (47%), the advantages provided by EV-linked tax credits and rebates (39%), and the cutting-edge technology afforded by EVs in the first place (22%).

He was joined by company leaders, project engineers, and Bill Gates, founder of Breakthrough Energy, for a firsthand look at one of the most ambitious geothermal developments in the nation.

“Utah is at the forefront of energy innovation, and the Cape Station Geothermal project in Beaver is a powerful example of that progress,” said Senator Curtis. “I believe America’s energy future can be affordable, reliable, and clean—and geothermal will be a critical part of making that vision a reality. This project highlights what’s possible when private investment is matched with government collaboration to provide the right tools for success. I’m hopeful it will drive new opportunity, strengthen rural communities, and showcase the kind of results that come from pairing innovation with Utah’s work ethic. It was a privilege to tour the site and meet the exceptional team leading this effort.”

“Fervo’s Cape Station project is what happens when great science, smart policy, and American entrepreneurship come together,” said Bill Gates. “Enhanced geothermal is one of the most promising solutions for delivering reliable, low-carbon power, especially as demand for affordable energy grows. Breakthrough Energy Ventures invested in Fervo early because we believed in this vision, and it’s exciting to see that potential becoming reality here in Utah.

“Geothermal isn’t a technology of the distant future; it’s scaling today, and Cape Station is proof of that,” said Tim Latimer, CEO and co-founder of Fervo Energy. “This project represents years of hard work by engineers, policymakers, and local partners who believe in the power of innovation to generate solutions. We’re proud to be building this in Utah, creating full-time jobs, and setting a new standard for what geothermal can achieve at scale. With Cape Phase I coming online next year, this is only the beginning for Fervo, for Utah, and for geothermal.”

Background:

Senator Curtis has long championed a responsible and practical approach to clean energy development. He has led bipartisan efforts to modernize permitting, reduce bureaucratic duplication, and accelerate the deployment of geothermal resources. In the 118th Congress, he advanced the GEO Act, legislation to update the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 and streamline the application process for new geothermal projects.

Cape Station is one of the nation’s most advanced geothermal projects. Developed by Fervo Energy, the facility broke ground in June 2023. Once fully operational, the first two phases will provide 500 megawatts of clean, baseload power—enough to support hundreds of thousands of homes.

Musk, who until recently had largely scaled back posting about politics, on Wednesday alone has already posted or helped amplify posts on X criticizing the bill more than 25 times.

""Mammoth spending bills are bankrupting America! ENOUGH,"" Musk wrote in one post.

In another, Musk was more forceful, writing, ""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.""

When asked by ABC News' Mary Bruce if he is worried senators will listen to Musk, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Senate Republicans ""understand kind of the whole, you know, CBO scoring model game here in Washington.""

""At the end of the day, most of our members want to pass a bill that they believe is going to be stimulative,"" he said. ""[The bill is] going to create growth for the economy, create better-paying jobs and therefore generate more government revenue.""

Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Wednesday morning that Musk was ""flat wrong"" about his criticisms on the spending bill and its effect on the deficit -- adding that he tried to call the tech billionaire Tuesday night, but Musk didn't answer.

In a video post on X of Johnson making the comment, Musk responded: ""We need a new bill that doesn't grow the deficit.""

Musk then replied to another video of Johnson, writing: ""No one who actually reads the bill should be able to stomach it""

Johnson responded to Musk's demand for a new bill, saying ""we don't have time for a brand-new bill.""

""And I want Elon and all my friends to recognize the complexity of what we've accomplished here, this extraordinary piece of legislation, record number of savings, the record tax cuts for the American people, and all the other benefits in it,"" Johnson said during a gaggle with reporters outside his office Wednesday.

Multiple people who have spoken to the president and Musk described a widening rift on a range of recent moves by the administration.

Musk has privately expressed frustration about a portion of the spending bill that would cut the electric vehicle tax credit, multiple people who have spoken with the billionaire said.

After the November election, Musk called for ending the tax credit, but more recently, his company, Tesla, has become a vocal opponent of removing the provision.

""Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America's energy independence and the reliability of our grid,"" the company posted on social media.

Musk had also grown increasingly frustrated with the Trump administration striking artificial intelligence deals with his competitor OpenAI, sources tell ABC News.

Behind the scenes, Musk raised objections about a deal that did not include his AI start-up company, but it ultimately moved forward, sources said.

Another source of tension: the withdrawal of Musk ally Jared Isaacman's nomination as NASA administrator over the weekend, according to sources who stated that Musk was deeply disappointed by the move.

There have also been deep disagreements on trade policy. In April, Musk called trade advisor Peter Navarro a ""moron"" and ""dumber than a sack of bricks"" in a series of posts on X.

Americans are naturally skeptical about EVs due to high costs, unreliability, and questionable environmental benefits. Wealthy Americans who can already afford EVs benefit the most from tax credits. Without government support, a typical EV costs $58,000—$13,000 more than a gas-powered car. According to Consumer Reports, new EVs are 79% less reliable than gas-powered cars. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) fared worse, being 146%less reliable than gas-powered cars. EVs could even be worse for the environment–with their brakes and tires releasing 1,850 times more in toxic emissions than regular tailpipes. Despite mandates and available tax credits, only a small share of Americans currently own EVs. Just 1.4% of 292.3 million vehicles—or 4,092,200—on the road today are electric.

Similarly, the government has favored unreliable solar and wind energy at the expense of coal, natural gas, and nuclear in the name of fighting climate change. This decision is not only costly, but dangerous–especially in a time of growing electricity demand. Today, solar and wind optimally operate for just 25% and 35% of the year, respectively. Equally concerning is that solar (3.9%) and wind (10.2%) comprise a small share of our energy mix, despite being heavily subsidized. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in its 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment report that adding more renewables, like solar, will “ introduce more complexity and energy limitations into the resource mix.” Moreover, producing more renewable energy isn’t shown to lower or replace coal, oil, and natural gas. That’s why the Senate must sync with the House to end subsidies for these mature clean energy industries.

Likewise, green subsidies - even those contained in the IRA - don’t create viable long-term jobs. The law promised to create 9 million clean energy jobs by 2032 - or one million jobs annually. As of this writing, only 400,000 new green jobs have been created—well below this projection–with most green jobs created being temporary construction positions.

Before President Trump’s second term, IRA clean energy projects had already faced major economic setbacks. In August 2024, 40% of IRA manufacturing jobs were “delayed, paused, or canceled.” Generally speaking, each IRA- tied job costs $2 to $7 million– a terrible return-on-investment (ROI) for the American taxpayer. Similarly, the IRA deceptively measures employment in job-years—or “one job for one year”— not total jobs created. This misleading figure explains why Biden’s signature climate law will create many more Solyndra’s.

The IRA can’t even deliver on its emissions reduction goals, either. A January 2023 Congressional Research Service report claimed the IRA’s green provisions would reduce emissions 30% to 43% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Without subsidies, the same report found the U.S. was already expected to reduce emissions between 24% and 35% going by the same metric. Therefore, the IRA’s subsidies could fail to make any difference in emissions but will cost taxpayers nearly $2 trillion across the next decade. As a result, American taxpayers will feel serious economic pain for little environmental gain.

Continued reliance on green subsidies for mature clean energy industries invites distortions in energy markets, impairs the development of reliable energy projects–both traditional and renewable–and is expected to saddle American taxpayers with trillions more in debt.

The IRA failed to reduce inflation, lower energy costs, and be deficit-neutral. That’s why no elected Republican voted for it three years ago. Therefore, the Senate should dismantle costly IRA green subsidies for unreliable clean energy projects to save taxpayers at least $1 trillion and direct those monies to better priorities like tax cuts for hard-working Americans.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/68/687045_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-06-04 13:18:14.310377

Carlos Araque, CEO of Quaise and a Co-Founder, commented: “Geothermal energy is available everywhere on massive scales. If you take all fossil, all nuclear, and all other forms of renewable energy combined, they are not even a millionth of a millionth of the thermal stores of energy below the Earth’s surface. It’s mind-boggling, and to get it, we only have to go down 2 – 12 miles. That’s how close we are to infinite clean energy no matter where you are in the world.”

Geothermal energy – the heat beneath our feet – has been around for a long time, but it barely contributes to today’s energy mix. Araque noted: “That’s because the true geothermal resource, the one that matters, is not very accessible. Getting to it is beyond the economic reach of the conventional tool set of oil and gas.”

The mother lode of geothermal energy is some 2 – 12 miles beneath the Earth’s surface where the rock is so hot that if water could be pumped to the area it would become supercritical, a steam-like phase that most people are not familiar with (familiar phases are liquid water, ice, and the vapour that makes clouds). Supercritical water, in turn, can carry some 5 – 10 times more energy than regular hot water, making it an extremely efficient energy source if it could be pumped above ground to turbines that could convert it into electricity.

Today, we cannot access those resources, except in places like Iceland where they are relatively close to the surface. The number one problem is that we cannot drill down far enough. The drills used by the oil and gas industries cannot withstand the formidable temperatures and pressures that are found miles down without becoming exponentially more expensive with depth.

Quaise is working to replace the conventional drill bits that mechanically break up the rock with millimetre-wave energy (cousins to the microwaves many of us cook with). Those millimetre waves literally melt then vaporise the rock to create ever-deeper holes.

Steady progress

The May demonstration at the Nabors facility is only the latest of many in an aggressive timeline to prove the technology. The ultimate goal is to provide a renewable source of energy on parity with oil and gas. Araque explained: “This is not a company built to develop a drilling gadget. We aim to become a geothermal developer. Our aim is to access clean heat and energy that is abundant, reliable, and affordable on a global scale.”

The general technique behind the Quaise drilling approach was developed at MIT over some 15 years. Scientists there showed that millimetre waves could indeed drill a hole in basalt (basalt and granite make up the majority of rock at great depth). This was promising in part because the gyrotron machine that produces the millimetre-wave energy is not new. It has been used for some 70 years in research towards nuclear fusion as an energy source.

Quaise has been developing the technique to drill deeper and deeper holes. The holes drilled at MIT were two in. in diameter by two in. deep. Outside the Quaise lab in Houston earlier this year, engineers succeeded in drilling a hole four in. in diameter and 10 ft deep.

Andres Calabressi, Head of Manufacturing at Quaise, explained that beginning in March 2025, the company lowered columns of granite about nine in. in diameter into a conventionally drilled hole under the rig. Together those columns made a core some 80 ft long that sits inside a metal casing. The latter is outfitted with ports to monitor parameters like heat and pressure data that allow the team to test recipes for optimal drilling.

The Quaise engineers then integrated the millimetre-wave technology with the rig. In the demonstration, millimetre waves were shot into the granite column, deepening a hole four in. in diameter that had already been drilled to ten ft. The following week, the team drilled to 30 ft for the first time and the next goal on this phase of the work is 40 ft.

Key parameters like rock temperature were tracked during the demonstration.

Araque noted that the demonstration was full scale in size but not in power as the gyrotron involved produced 100 KW of power, one-tenth of the power that will be commercially relevant and roughly equivalent to the power of a car.

In June 2025, Quaise expects the delivery of a much larger gyrotron, capable of producing 1 MW of power.

In the meantime, the company is preparing for another demonstration planned for July 2025 in Marble Falls, Texas. There, the team aims to drill multiple holes 130 m (about 425 ft) deep into an actual granite outcrop for the first time.

Additional advances

Quaise has also been tackling other scientific and engineering challenges associated with harvesting the energy from superhot, superdeep rock. In 2024, a team at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédéral de Lausanne reported new insights into what happens when superhot, superdeep rock is exposed to water that can eventually transfer the rocks’ heat to the surface. The work, supported in part by Quaise, was published in the journal Nature Communications. It confirmed earlier modelling work also supported by Quaise.

In addition, Quaise has an in-house engineer who has been working on the design of superhot geothermal power plants.

Towards the future

Araque concluded the demonstration by describing the company’s blueprint for developing a superhot, superdeep geothermal resource available around the globe. It involves dividing the world into three tiers based on geothermal gradient, or how close the resource is to the surface. Tier I, for example, will focus on relatively accessible superhot rock. This means that the first Quaise power plant will probably be located in the American West, perhaps near the Newberry Volcano site in Oregon. Newberry has a long history of geothermal exploration.

Although still a while off, Tier III sites, which will involve drilling as much as 12 miles down hold the key to making superhot geothermal a truly global energy source, according to Quaise. Tier III sites could provide power to more than 90% of humanity.

Several dozen protesters were outside Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage, where U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin were featured speakers. The federal officials were continuing a multiday trip aimed at highlighting President Donald Trump’s push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state.

The trip has included meetings with pro-drilling groups and officials, including some Alaska Native leaders on the petroleum-rich North Slope, and a visit to the Prudhoe Bay oil field near the Arctic Ocean that featured selfies near the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline.

Calls for additional oil and gas drilling — including Trump’s renewed focus on getting a massive liquefied natural gas project built — are “false solutions” to energy needs and climate concerns, protester Sarah Furman said outside the Anchorage convention hall, as people carried signs with slogans such as “Alaska is Not for Sale” and “Protect our Public Lands.”

“We find it really disingenuous that they’re hosting this conference and not talking about real solutions,” she said.

Topics at the conference, which runs through Thursday, also include mining, carbon management, nuclear energy, renewables and hydrogen. Oil has been Alaska’s economic lifeblood for decades, and Dunleavy has continued to embrace fossil fuels even as he has touted other energy opportunities in the state.

Another protester, Rochelle Adams, who is Gwich’in, raised concerns about the ongoing push to allow oil and gas drilling on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Gwich’in leaders have said they consider the coastal plain sacred, as caribou they rely on calve there. Leaders of the Iñupiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling as economically vital and have joined Alaska political leaders in welcoming Trump’s interest in reviving a leasing program there.

“When these people come from outside to take and take and take, we are going to be left with the aftereffects,” Adams said, adding later: “It’s our health that will be impacted. It’s our wellness, our ways of life.”

Zeldin, during a friendly question-and-answer period led by Dunleavy, said wildlife he saw while on the North Slope didn’t appear “to be victims of their surroundings” and seemed “happy.”

Burgum, addressing a move toward additional drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, said wildlife and development can coexist. His agency during the Alaska trip announced plans to repeal Biden-era restrictions on future leasing and industrial development in portions of the petroleum preserve that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.

Wright bristled at the idea of policy “in the name of climate change” that he said would have no impact on climate change. Stopping oil production in Alaska doesn’t change demand for oil, he said.

“You know, we hear terms like clean energy and renewable energy. These are inaccurate marketing terms,” he said. “There is no energy source that does not take significant materials, land and impact on the environment to produce. Zero.”

Officials court Asian countries to support gas project

Joining for part of the U.S. officials’ trip were representatives from Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and United Arab Emirates. Asian countries are being courted to sign onto the Alaska gas project, which has floundered for years to gain traction amid cost and other concerns. The project, as proposed, would include a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from the North Slope to port, with an eye largely on exports of liquefied natural gas.

Wright told reporters a goal in inviting them to the Prudhoe Bay stop was for them to see the oil pipeline infrastructure and environment and meet with residents and business leaders.

Glenfarne Alaska LNG LLC, which has taken a lead in advancing the project, on Tuesday announced expressions of interest from a number of “potential partners.” Costs surrounding the project — which have been pegged around $44 billion for the pipeline and other infrastructure — are in the process of being refined before a decision is made on whether to move forward.

Below are Senator Schumer’s remarks, which can also be viewed here:

One of Donald Trump’s core promises on the campaign trail was that he would lower energy costs, he said, by 50%.

But the opposite is happening: energy costs are soaring across the country.

People are paying more on their monthly electricity bills.

Small businesses are struggling just to keep the lights on.

And Donald Trump and the Republicans’ “Big, Ugly Energy-Killer” bill is about to make energy costs go even higher.

Under the Republicans’ bill, the average national electricity prices would go up by about 10%.

American families will pay $32 billion more in household energy costs.

Clean energy projects that would lower costs would face massive new taxes.

And that’s not to mention the hundreds of thousands of jobs – hundreds of thousands, it's estimated as much as 800,000 –would be lost. And they would occur especially in red states.

Republicans, did you hear that? You're throwing hundreds of thousands of people working in your states in good-paying jobs out of work, all to embrace the ideology of the extremists in the fossil fuel community.

The bottom line is simple: the oil and gas magnates and the fossil fuel community hates clean energy, because they know it's the future, because they know it's cheaper, because they know it's the quickest way to get more energy.

Are Republicans truly so beholden to the fossil fuel industry, who harbors blind hatred of clean energy, because they know it’s the future? Are they so beholden? If we need more energy because of AI and everything else, why cut off one of the main ways we can get new energy, in terms of wind, solar, hydro, and things like that?

Are Republicans really willing to send energy costs for families skyrocketing, just to satisfy the ideological hatred the fossil fuel industry has for clean energy? The fossil fuel industry knows its days are numbered and wants to cut off an alternative. And that’s going to make prices go up and let China become the leader in clean energy, which our children and grandchildren will pay a dear price for.

So, Senate Democrats are going to fight this bill with everything we’ve got, so families don’t have to foot the bill for Donald Trump’s disastrous energy policies.

A cargo ship carrying around 3,000 vehicles across the Pacific Ocean caught fire on Tuesday. The Morning Midas, a 600-foot cargo ship, was in the middle of a voyage from Yantai, China to Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico when the fire broke out.

Zodiac Maritime, the ship's London-based operator, noted that smoke was first spotted on a deck carrying 800 electric vehicles. Once the blaze got out of control, the vessel's 22 crew members abandoned ship via lifeboat. With the ship roughly 300 southwest of Alaska, the U.S. Coast Guard dispatched aircrews and a cutter to respond to the emergency, according to Bloomberg. The evacuating crew on the lifeboat was transferred by the USCG to one of the three other merchants at the scene, helping to fight the fire. Zodiac Maritime wouldn't comment on which automaker's vehicles were burning to a crisp. This is an ongoing story, and we will update when we know more about the fate of the Morning Midas.

The inferno on Morning Midas will remind many of the Felicity Ace fire in 2022. The 650-foot cargo vessel burst into flames while carrying 4,000 cars built by Audi, Bentley, Lamborghini, Porsche and Volkswagen. Despite the hope of towing the ship to port once the fire was put out, Felicia Ace sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The lithium-ion batteries fitted to the EV onboard kept the fire burning much longer than expected. One of the cars that ended up on the seafloor was a Porsche Boxster Spyder ordered by Matt Farah, host of The Smoking Tire. He was just glad that the ship's crew escaped unharmed.

Fighting EV fires in the middle of an ocean is a tall task for any crew. It often takes tens of thousands of gallons of water to douse a burning lithium-ion battery. While it might seem straightforward to put a pump over the side and use saltwater to put out the flames, it's not a viable option. The salt in ocean water is electrically conductive and would fuel an ongoing blaze. Current guidelines for crews emphasize early detection and limiting water use by letting EVs burn while containing any potential spreading.

The numbers don’t lie: these investments helped create more than 400,000 clean energy jobs.
Clean energy is creating real economic opportunities – jobs, investments, growth – in red states and rural communities.
These are boots-on-the-ground jobs—American jobs—that support families, strengthen small businesses, and drive local economies.
It’s not too late Let’s continue to put American jobs and energy independence first.","Congress is weighing a decision that could pull the rug out from under one of the fastest-growing sectors of the American economy. In fact, if Congress rolls back renewable energy tax credits, they won’t just be shifting dollars on a spreadsheet—they’ll be cutting real, good-paying jobs in communities across the country.

For years, politicians on both sides have talked about the need for American energy independence. But real independence comes from investing in energy diversification, not tripling down on fossil fuels. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, drove over $600 billion in private investment into clean energy projects across the country. These are investments and technologies we can produce and control here at home – things like solar panels on homes and businesses, battery storage systems and smart grid technology. That’s not just good for the environment – it’s a reduces our reliance on foreign oil and insulates our economy from global energy volatility.

The numbers don’t lie: these investments helped create more than 400,000 clean energy jobs. These aren’t just jobs in Silicon Valley or big coastal cities— and they are certainly not jobs that can be outsourced to China or eliminated by AI. They are good-paying jobs in places like Georgia, Texas, and Ohio. They’re manufacturing and construction jobs, requiring skilled workers —exactly the kind of work that supports families and builds communities.

Small business owners, in particular, have been thriving under these incentives. Local solar installers, electricians, HVAC companies, and energy efficiency contractors have seen a surge in demand. If these credits are repealed, many of these businesses will be forced to scale back or shut down, taking good-paying jobs with them and creating a ripple effect that harms the economies of local communities across America.

This investment also helps support and modernize our utility grid. For decades, America’s utility grid has been under strain and as AI and data centers create an ever-growing demand for energy, that strain will only get worse. Clean energy, especially when paired with battery storage, offers a way to modernize the grid, making it more resilient and responsive. These technologies help balance supply and demand, reduce the risk of outages, and lower long-term costs for consumers.

The tax credits under threat have been instrumental in accelerating the deployment of these solutions. Gutting them now would slow progress and leave our infrastructure more vulnerable at a time when climate-related disruptions are becoming more frequent and severe.

Ironically, many of the workers, businesses and communities that have benefited most from clean energy investments are represented by Republican lawmakers now pushing to eliminate the investments. Texas leads the nation in wind energy. Georgia has become a hub for electric vehicle and battery manufacturing. Oklahoma, South Carolina, and other Republican-led states have seen billions in clean energy investment and job creation.

This isn’t – or at least shouldn’t be – a partisan issue; it’s a practical one. Clean energy is creating real economic opportunities – jobs, investments, growth – in red states and rural communities. Rolling back these credits would hurt the very voters many of these lawmakers claim to represent.

Critics often argue that renewable energy shouldn’t need government support. But let’s be honest: fossil fuels have received billions and billions in federal subsidies for decades. In 2023 alone, the U.S. spent more than $20 billion on direct and indirect subsidies for oil, gas, and coal. Meanwhile, clean energy incentives are temporary, performance-based, and designed to phase out as the market matures.

This isn’t just about tax policy, it’s about the kind of future we want to build. The clean energy transition is already underway. It’s creating jobs, lowering costs and making our country more secure.

You can’t ship a solar installation crew overseas. You can’t automate the work of electricians, roofers, and engineers building clean energy projects in our communities. These are boots-on-the-ground jobs—American jobs—that support families, strengthen small businesses, and drive local economies.

If this rollback continues, it’s not just the clean energy industry that loses. It’s the workers who’ve built careers in this space. It’s the small business owners who’ve expanded their teams to meet growing demand. And it’s the communities—many in red states—that have finally started to see the benefits of clean energy investment. We can lead or fall behind. It’s not too late Let’s continue to put American jobs and energy independence first.

In today’s issue, we’re highlighting geothermal and solar energy wins from around the country, and proposals in Congress for tackling carbon emissions globally through a U.S. carbon border adjustment mechanism.

The House and Senate returned from recess this week, and senators are rolling up their sleeves to tackle the budget reconciliation bill. The bill, which passed the House two weeks ago, has far-reaching implications for climate solutions, including programs and incentives provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Join us this Friday, June 6, at noon for the next Rapid Readout, featuring Brookings Senior Fellow Molly Reynolds. We will take your questions about how reconciliation could unfold in the coming weeks and months, and what it might mean for clean energy tax incentives and more.

Semiconductor Bill Propels Forward: The Senate passed the Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act (S.97). Sens. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) reintroduced the bill to increase investment in domestic manufacturing of semiconductors that are critical components in many clean energy technologies. Reps. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) and Cliff Bentz (R-Ore.) led the bill’s House companion (H.R.2480), which passed the chamber last month. It will now move to President Trump’s desk for signature.

Marine Debris Mitigation Gets a Leg Up: The Senate also passed the Save Our Seas 2.0 Amendments Act (S.216). Sens. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) led the bill, which would strengthen the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Marine Debris Program. The program works to accelerate the federal response to marine pollution events, increase international cooperation on ocean cleanup, and drive plastic waste reduction and reuse.

Illegal Fishing Bill Swims Out of Committee: The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation advanced Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Brian Schatz’s (D-Hawaii) Illegal Red Snapper and Tuna Enforcement Act (S.283). The bill would combat illegal fishing, which contributes to fishery depletion and threatens economic and food security, by the traceability of tuna and red snapper entering the United States.

Wildfire Bill Ignites in the House: Reps. Dave Min (D-Calif.) and Young Kim (R-Calif.) introduced the Building Resiliency and Understanding of Shrublands to Halt (BRUSH) Fires Act (H.R.3553). The bill would require the U.S. Forest Service to assess its existing wildfire mitigation strategies. EESI explores other wildfire mitigation tools in our podcast, The Climate Conversation.

Over the past several weeks, local residents and social media users have posted images and videos showing rows of Cybertrucks lined up at Hunter’s Square shopping center on Orchard Lake Road.

The site is adjacent to a Tesla service center in West Bloomfield, leading to speculation that the facility is using the lot as an overflow site to manage unsold inventory. Reports estimate more than 100 vehicles have accumulated in the space.

Tesla employees collecting the trucks told CBS Detroit that the property is owned by the same party that manages the nearby service center and that the vehicles were scheduled for customer delivery. However, the City of Farmington Hills has taken issue with this explanation.

“The City of Farmington Hills code enforcement office has been in communication with the Hunter’s Square shopping center management to resolve the issue,” Charmaine Kettler-Schmult, the city’s planning and community development director, told CBS Detroit.

“They have been notified that storage of vehicles is not a permitted use. The enforcement process is being followed and takes time.”

Tesla’s decision to store the trucks at the site has highlighted the company’s struggles in selling the Cybertruck — a model CEO Elon Musk once touted as a groundbreaking entry into the electric pickup market.

According to data from Cox Automotive, Tesla sold just over 6,000 Cybertrucks in the first quarter of 2025, bringing total deliveries to fewer than 50,000 units since the vehicle’s debut.

Tesla had originally projected annual sales could reach as high as 250,000 units.

In 2024, Tesla delivered around 40,000 Cybertrucks — approximately 10,000 fewer than Wall Street analysts expected.

The gap between forecast and reality has led to a substantial buildup in inventory, with Electrek reporting recently that the company had an estimated 10,000 unsold Cybertrucks on hand.

In response, Tesla has scaled back production of the truck.

The automaker began reassigning workers from the Cybertruck production line to its more successful Model Y operation as early as December 2024, according to employees who spoke to Business Insider.

Tesla sales have also sagged amid widespread backlash over Musk’s active role as head of DOGE in the Trump administration — which has sparked protests and acts of vandalism.

Tesla’s brand, once synonymous with cutting-edge innovation, has become increasingly polarizing as the company navigates a series of public relations and logistical hurdles.

In December, the company’s stock benefited from a “Trump bump” in the wake of the Nov. 5 election — roaring to an all-time high of nearly $480 a share.

Since then, however, the stock tanked by more than 50% — though it has recovered in recent weeks as Musk has indicated he would devote more time to running the company.

The situation is further complicated by a series of recalls that have plagued the Cybertruck since it first reached consumers.

Eight recalls have been issued to date, with problems ranging from faulty windshield wipers to delayed rear camera displays.

The most recent recall affected nearly 46,000 vehicles — virtually every Cybertruck sold to that point — due to concerns that a stainless steel trim panel could detach while the vehicle is in motion.

New insights reveal critical market lending dynamics as potential policy changes threaten capital access for developers and manufacturers

This report pulls back the curtain on financing trends that have historically been opaque, giving project developers and manufacturers insights they need to structure competitive financing packages.”

— Alfred Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Crux

NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, June 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Today, Crux, the capital markets technology company for the clean economy, released its first debt capital report on lending and investment dynamics in the U.S. clean energy and manufacturing sector. This report comes at a time when surging energy demand and policy uncertainty presents both opportunities and challenges for American developers and manufacturers.

Crux is addressing today’s critical need for greater transparency into capital costs, project availability, and investor appetite, just as the company’s authoritative market intelligence reports have done for the transferable tax credit market. Transferable tax credits are driving hundreds of billions in private investment into American energy and manufacturing projects. The credits have also presented an opportunity to centralize otherwise disparate project finance markets for advanced manufacturing, bioenergy, battery storage, critical minerals, and clean energy.

""As we face unprecedented energy demands and shifting geopolitics, the efficiency and transparency of capital markets will determine whether America can successfully build the energy infrastructure of the future,"" said Alfred Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Crux. ""This report pulls back the curtain on financing trends that have historically been opaque, giving project developers and manufacturers the insights they need to structure competitive financing packages.""

Critical Timing Amid Policy Uncertainty:

The report's release comes as potential changes to federal tax credit policies could reshape the financing landscape. If transferable tax credits are scaled back or repealed for certain market segments, clean energy developers and manufacturers will face an even greater need to source alternative financing through debt capital markets. Private debt markets are opaque, illiquid, and inefficient.

""The interconnected nature of clean energy financing means that changes in one area ripple throughout the entire market,"" explained Johnson. ""For example, our data shows that tax credit bridge lending – which allows projects to pull forward the value of future tax credits – has become increasingly accessible, with terms largely driven by advance rates and the presence of committed investment-grade tax credit buyers. If tax credit policies change, understanding these debt market dynamics becomes even more critical for project success.""

Key Market Findings:

There were nearly $340 billion in new American clean energy investments last year, but macroeconomic factors such as interest rate volatility and supply chain inflation continue to impact capital costs. Uncertainty in these variables may dampen appetite for long-duration lending and reduce advance rates, particularly for early-stage projects and those deploying less-established technologies.

For clean energy developers and manufacturers, understanding capital market dynamics has never been more essential.

Key findings from Crux’s market report include:

● Capital markets are increasingly open to a wider variety of projects, but availability varies based on technology, strength of the sponsor, and contracted offtake. Capital is most widely available for solar and storage projects; and nearly all investors at all stages of the development process indicated that solar was a technology that they invest in. Less established technologies — like advanced manufacturing, biofuel, carbon capture, and nuclear — have historically faced challenges accessing debt financing, but in recent years have seen growing interest from investors supported by ​​transferable tax credits.

● Investment structures like tax and preferred equity are highly dynamic and evolving. Tax equity structures have evolved to hybrid structures, or t-flips, which explicitly contemplate the sale of a portion of tax credits in the transfer market. These structures comprised about 60% of the tax equity committed in 2024, and that share is expected to rise. This trend has already expanded the availability of tax equity to a broader range of projects.

● For construction/term lending, projects with contracted offtake generally have greater capital availability and lower cost of capital. However, the data indicates a smaller but meaningful group of lenders are open to merchant or partially contracted projects. While more than 70% of investors indicated that they were more willing to invest in a fully contracted project, some lenders view merchant or partially contracted projects as a better fit for their return requirements.

● Capital markets are likely to continue to expand in both availability and cost-competitiveness, but require a stable and constructive policy environment to do so. Policy volatility is unconstructive for risk-averse project finance lenders, and is likely to disrupt investment. This effect is particularly concentrated in newer technologies, such as nuclear, manufacturing, and biofuels. Whether the market continues its cycle of expansion or whether it recoils back to the most well established wind and solar projects will be a function of ongoing political processes.

Serving the Full Clean Energy Ecosystem:

Unlike previous market analyses that focus primarily on investment-grade sponsors and established technologies, this report provides comprehensive insights into the broader clean energy ecosystem. This includes projects spanning clean fuels, carbon capture, nuclear plants, geothermal, critical minerals production, and advanced manufacturing facilities, by developers and manufacturers ranging from large utilities to regional developers and startups.

Crux launched in early 2023 to supercharge the clean economy by making capital markets more liquid, efficient, and intelligent. The company first tackled the nascent transferable tax credits market: developing the central marketplace for transfers; assembling an expert team; and providing leading market intelligence to help developers and manufacturers exchange tax credits for private sector investment into their companies. By 2024, Crux had expanded its offerings to help developers and manufacturers access liquidity in a range of debt products as well; the Crux debt capital marketplace has a network of over 90 lenders who have collectively issued $1.3B of term sheets, with $700M in term sheets signed, to date.

To date, Crux has facilitated more than 80 transactions totaling billions of dollars in tax credits and loans across advanced manufacturing, battery storage, bioenergy, critical minerals, geothermal, hydropower, microgrids, solar, and wind. More than 630 market participants use Crux’s platform.

The deal sees the tech giant purchasing 1.1 gigawatts of power from nuclear power provider Constellation from its Clinton Clean Energy Center in southern Illinois starting in 2027, Meta said on June 3.
“As we look toward our future energy needs in advancing AI, we recognize the immense value of nuclear power in providing reliable, firm electricity,” Meta added.
Constellation’s agreement with Meta means that the Clinton plant can operate without taxpayer support.
Meta said it is also making progress on requests for proposals to identify other nuclear energy operators to help the firm meet its AI innovation and sustainability goals.","Meta has inked a deal to keep an Illinois nuclear power plant running for the next 20 years so it can power its artificial intelligence and data center ambitions.

The deal sees the tech giant purchasing 1.1 gigawatts of power from nuclear power provider Constellation from its Clinton Clean Energy Center in southern Illinois starting in 2027, Meta said on June 3.

“As we look toward our future energy needs in advancing AI, we recognize the immense value of nuclear power in providing reliable, firm electricity,” Meta added.

Meta, like other tech giants, is heavily leaning into AI amid the continuing hype around the tech and has embedded its own AI models into its flagship social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram. It also plans to fully automate ad creation on those platforms by the end of 2025, The Wall Street Journal reported on June 2.

Currently, AI technology requires vast amounts of energy, which is in high demand. The International Energy Agency reported in April that the power demands of AI data centers are projected to more than double by 2030 to eat up “slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today.”

Meta said the agreement ensures a “critical plant will stay online” and meet growing energy needs while adding 30 megawatts of incremental capacity to the grid.

Meta added that its partnership with Constellation would preserve over 1,100 jobs and contribute $13.5 million annually in tax revenue without tapping into the state’s Zero Emission Credit program — maintaining operations without additional ratepayer support.

Several Illinois lawmakers were pleased to hear about the deal, including Republican Regan Deering, who said it was a “forward-thinking investment” that would boost the local economy.

Clinton almost closed in 2017

The Clinton nuclear facility was set to close in 2017 after several years of financial losses despite being one of the best-performing nuclear plants in the state, Constellation noted in its June 3 statement.

However, it was saved by the enactment of Illinois’ Future Energy Jobs Act, which established the Zero Emission Credit program to support the plant through to mid-2027.

Constellation’s agreement with Meta means that the Clinton plant can operate without taxpayer support.

An analysis from consulting firm Brattle Group in March found that shuttering Clinton would raise emissions by more than 34 million metric tons of carbon over 20 years — equivalent to putting around 7.4 million gasoline-powered cars on the road for a year.

Brattle also estimated that Illinois’ gross domestic product would drop $765 million annually if the Clinton facility were to cease operations.

Meta said it is also making progress on requests for proposals to identify other nuclear energy operators to help the firm meet its AI innovation and sustainability goals.","https://images.cointelegraph.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=90,width=1200/https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-06/0197383a-50a3-7164-9854-34ccf938789f",N,,2025-06-04 13:19:09.780072

Mark Gordon returned to the site in Kemmerer where TerraPower is building its Natrium Plant, for a progress briefing and tour from Eric Williams, TerraPower’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Andy Chrusciel, Director of Construction.

The governor was on hand for the ground-breaking of the project last June. He continues to be supportive of the expansion of Wyoming’s energy portfolio in the nuclear energy space.

“Not surprisingly, TerraPower chose the energy capital of the nation to build their first Natrium plant, Kemmerer Unit 1. If you’re going to produce energy, it’s very likely you’re doing it in Wyoming,” Gordon said during the May 22 meeting. “With the president’s energy emergency declaration and dedication to Unleashing American Energy, nuclear power factors significantly into our plans as a nation for energy independence, abundance and strengthening national security. Wyoming and TerraPower are readying to meet demand.”

According to TerraPower, the Natrium plant is an innovative design that will function on the energy grid in a completely new way, unlike any existing nuclear technologies today.” The plant will feature an advanced, sodium-cooled reactor and molten salt energy storage tanks, providing up to 500 MWe of power.

“It was wonderful to show Gov. Gordon all the progress that has been made onsite over the past year,” said Williams. “He’s been a key supporter of the project since we first expressed interest in bringing a Natrium plant to Wyoming, and we couldn’t be happier with the decision to build our first project here. Our team is working around the clock to bring America’s next nuclear power plant to Wyoming.”

The Natrium project was announced nearly four years ago and was aided when the Wyoming Legislature expanded existing legislation to allow advanced nuclear reactors that provide more than 300 MWe of power to be a part of Wyoming’s energy supply.

Construction on the project began last June and continued through the winter months. The work currently being completed is on the sodium test and fill facility, which is crucial for testing key reactor components.

“It’s great to see the progress here today,” the governor said. “In addition to TerraPower’s efforts to support reestablishing a domestic nuclear supply chain, they have clearly been focused on moving forward without delay on constructing the facilities.”

Work is scheduled to begin next month on the Kemmerer Training Center, which will serve as the primary training location for future Natrium operators, and will be followed by construction of the energy island portion of the plant.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/nmcwyw/original/20250604-091141-6dc-IMG_4958.JPG,N,,2025-06-04 13:20:47.040749

As Congress votes to undermine California’s sovereignty to set supply-side standards on polluting vehicles, CLEE’s research shows why these policies are so effective

In May 2025, both the U.S. House and Senate passed resolutions to revoke California’s Clean Air Act waivers, which allow the state to enforce stricter vehicle emissions rules than federal standards (see Ann Carlson’s post on this issue). If signed by the President—and if successful in the face of court challenges to their dubious legality—these resolutions would nullify California’s authority to set stricter vehicle standards, potentially rolling back decades of environmental progress and affecting other states that follow California’s lead.

Yet California is just one of many jurisdictions around the world that uses supply-side regulations to accelerate clean vehicle markets. These policies require automakers to produce cleaner or more efficient vehicles.

Below is a non-exhaustive overview of jurisdictions around the globe that have adopted supply-side regulations:

Fuel economy/efficiency standards: Brazil, Chile, China,India, Japan, United States (federal)

Greenhouse gas (GHG) or carbon dioxide (CO2) emission standards: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Union (supranational), India, United States (federal and state-level)

Zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales requirements: Canada (federal and province-level), China, United States (state-level), United Kingdom

UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment (CLEE) now has a working paper that seeks to explain why policymakers like in California are choosing this policy approach by examining the evidence and theory underpinning them and the design strategies that have helped to address industry challenges. Among the key reasons, supply-side regulations can:

ensure that automakers invest in new clean technologies over incumbent technologies;

create market certainty to accelerate growth in clean technologies;

encourage the development of supportive fueling infrastructure;

create self-financing markets without reliance on public funding;

support global competitiveness of local industry; and

reduce fossil fuel dependency.

The working paper, submitted at the 38th International Electric Vehicle Symposium (EVS 38), cites several sources to exemplify the 6 key reasons. For instance, supply-side zero-emission vehicle mandates were a key driver of the increased scale of zero-emission vehicles in China, the world’s largest electric vehicle producer, along with an important decrease in battery costs. Another example is Tesla’s early success using its revenue the company earned from the sale of zero-emission vehicle credits (accounting for 5-10% of the firm’s total revenue most years) to finance the clean vehicle markets without reliance on public funding. The credit system also allows other companies to comply with the rules without needing to sell electric vehicles, potentially lowering their compliance costs by letting these firms buy credits from others.

Policymakers have increasingly favored supply-side vehicle regulations as a means to reshape the transportation sector in the public interest. By requiring manufacturers to produce cleaner and more efficient vehicles, these standards help ensure that automakers’ interests are in line with broader societal goals. This approach leverages private investment and technological innovation to deliver cleaner air, lower consumer costs, and advance efforts to meet climate targets. As governments intensify efforts toward zero-emission vehicles, supply-side programs can play a more prominent role.

We are planning follow-up research to incorporate anonymized insights from regulators who have adopted and implemented these policies. While Congress may slow California’s approach to supply-side regulations, the arguments in favor of these types of policies point to continued momentum to adopt them, both in the U.S. and globally.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/All-electric_cars_CRI_12_2021_2352-2.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 13:21:14.681437

77% believe recent clean energy projects will benefit South Carolina, and 66% say the federal government should continue to support these projects.
This is resulting in utilities purchasing electricity from solar farms and paying consumers well for putting building-generated solar energy on the grid.
Sen. Graham has long supported clean energy, especially nuclear, as part of an “all of the above” energy approach.","The budget reconciliation process enables Congress to quickly consider and advance fiscal legislation, with topics spanning the country’s revenues, spending, federal debt limit, and the budgetary surplus or deficit. Throughout this process, the clean energy tax credits, which have created jobs, spurred local investment, bolstered the electrical grid’s reliability, and contributed to lower energy prices for Americans, were front and center in the committee meetings, where legislators placed them on the metaphorical chopping block.

In the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, May 21, the U.S. House narrowly pushed through the reconciliation bill with a 215-214 vote, where unfortunately, House Republicans have taken a sledgehammer to these vital energy incentives. Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) President Heather Reams reacted in a statement, “While we are disappointed that energy tax credits were repealed and substantially cut in the package passed by the House, we are grateful for the champions who have fought to protect critical provisions that incentivize investment and economic growth. As the bill progresses to the Senate, we hope changes will be made to address and protect these important tax credits, which are working to secure American energy dominance. Without these provisions, the United States is at risk of falling behind adversarial nations in the global energy race—not to mention, American jobs and local economies will suffer a tremendous loss.”

Under the bill, clean energy projects would need to start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage, have completely China-free supply chains by January 1, and start operating by 2029 to benefit from the Section 45Y production credit or the Section 48E investment credit, both of which would start being phased out in 2029, thus creating a nearly impossible-to-meet timeline. Other tax credits, such as those used to bolster residential energy efficiency or purchase clean vehicles, would be eliminated outright after this year. If passed by the Senate and signed by the President, the legislation threatens to unwind an incredible amount of investment and energy development across the country, particularly in South Carolina.

Domestic investment is at risk and, if left uninterrupted, would help create a stronger national economy with direct benefits for local communities. A report commissioned by the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and conducted by ICF at the end of 2024, found that between 2025 and 2035, there would be $3.8 trillion in net spending across the American economy due to the tax credits, with a more than fourfold return on taxpayer investment. The energy incentives would ultimately grow the American economy by contributing $1.9 trillion to the national GDP. In South Carolina alone, they would lead to $64 billion in spending and grow the state’s economy by $32 billion.

Since 2022, these tax credits have already spurred $321 billion in investment across the country in clean energy projects and the construction of new industrial and manufacturing facilities, 2,369 of which have since opened their doors for business. The Clean Investment Monitor’s May 2025 report adds that $522 billion in investment remains to be spent on construction and installation at such factories, with 2,217 more plants yet to be built that will support even more American jobs.

Unfortunately, Energy Innovation’s May 2025 report estimated that the reconciliation bill will undercut many of these 7,000 existing and planned projects. The uncertainty regarding federal support for clean energy between January and March of this year has already cost $6.9 billion due to project cancellations, and a significant portion of the planned $522 billion in investment may never come to fruition. The organization calculates that during the reconciliation window from 2026 to 2034, eliminating these incentives will cause the cumulative national GDP to decrease by almost $1.1 trillion. The report also says the bill will cost the country more than 830,000 jobs in 2030 and nearly 720,000 jobs in 2035.

On the other hand, if the clean energy tax credits are maintained, the country would experience a renaissance in energy and manufacturing jobs. ACP and ICF report that over the next decade, these incentives would create 13.7 million jobs in total, or about 1.2 million jobs per year on average, ranging from over 600,000 in 2025 to nearly 1.5 million in 2032. About 19,900 total jobs per year would be created in South Carolina alone.

According to data from the Clean Economy Tracker, many clean energy manufacturing companies setting up shop in South Carolina have committed to or have already created more than 18,000 jobs, over 90% of which were announced since the passage of the clean energy incentives in 2022. For example, at the end of that year, AESC announced an $810 million investment in an electric vehicle battery Gigafactory in Florence, which would bring 1,170 jobs to Florence County. It has since announced an $810 million first expansion that would add another 450 jobs. However, in February, it had to pause a planned $1.5 billion second facility that would have created an additional 1,080 jobs.

In 2022, Enphase Energy announced it would invest $20 million in contract manufacturer Flex’s solar inverter production plant in Columbia, creating 600 jobs, and Redwood Materials announced it would invest $3.5 billion in a Battery Materials Campus near Charleston, creating over 1,500 jobs in Berkeley County. In 2023, Scout Motors announced a $2 billion investment in an electric vehicle production plant in Blythewood that would bring at least 4,000 jobs to Richland County, while Silfab Solar announced a $150 million investment in a solar panel manufacturing facility in Fort Mill that would bring 800 jobs to York County. In 2024, Enersys announced it would spend $500 million to build a lithium-ion cell gigafactory and create 500 jobs in Greenville, and American Battery Technology Co. announced it would use a $150 million federal grant to build a lithium-ion battery recycling facility that would create 1,200 construction jobs and 300 operations jobs. This year, Eaton announced a $340 million commitment to building a three-phase transformer production plant in Jonesville, bringing 700 jobs to Union County, and TS Conductor announced a $134 million commitment to constructing an advanced conductor manufacturing facility in Clarius Park Hardeeville, bringing 462 jobs to Jasper County. ES Foundry also opened a new solar cell factory that will bring 500 jobs to Greenwood County and will support the solar industry’s expansion to 3,315 permanent jobs and $260.9 million in annual labor income by 2035, while Boviet Solar is also exceeding original projections, and rather than 900 new jobs as part of their new manufacturing facility in Greenville, they now expect to create 1,300 new jobs.

Construction and operations roles at energy generation facilities are also threatened, as is the property tax revenue they would contribute to local communities. Bolt Solar LLC, a North Carolina-based company, is placing solar panels in Greenville, which is expected to generate $200,000 in tax revenue each year, compared to the roughly $800 the empty lot is generating now. Silicon Ranch is investing $260 million in its Lambert Solar project, which will create more than 400 jobs with a particular emphasis on former employees of International Paper, whose mill in the area shut down last year. The project will also generate more than $20 million in tax revenue for Georgetown County over forty years. The Nuclear Company is set to create 100 new construction jobs at an engineering and construction office in Richland County as it prepares to deploy a fleet of nuclear reactors, while Santee Cooper is considering reviving and expanding the shuttered V.C. Summer Nuclear Station.

ACP and ICF note that investments resulting from the clean energy tax credits would add $846 billion to disposable household income in the next decade, or nearly $77 billion per year, providing $14 billion in total additional income for South Carolinians; however, if they are stripped away, South Carolinians and Americans will feel more economic pain. Rhodium Group estimates that American energy costs could increase by as much as 7% by 2035, up to $290 more per year, which will translate into an increase in cumulative annual energy costs of more than $16 billion in 2030 and more than $33 billion by 2035.

The increase would be due to the loss of new generation capacity, with 57% to 72% less new clean capacity expected to be installed on the grid over the coming decade, and higher costs for fossil fuels. This comes at a time when the country’s electricity demand forecast is set to increase from 2.8% to 15.8% by 2029, mainly driven by the demands of data centers and domestic industrial facilities. Without support for renewables, we cannot meet Americans’ energy demand, nor can we maintain our energy independence and dominance. The reconciliation bill would cut out the clean energy sector at a time when Americans’ electricity needs are higher than ever and when the country needs every tool in its energy tool belt.

Moreover, polling indicates that most South Carolinians, particularly conservative voters, are in favor of clean energy. A recent study from Sustain South Carolina found that 93% of South Carolinian Republicans and conservative Independents believe it is important for the state to have a diverse range of energy sources and a stable and resilient power grid. 77% believe recent clean energy projects will benefit South Carolina, and 66% say the federal government should continue to support these projects. Another poll jointly released by The Nature Conservancy and Sustain South Carolina found that 73% of Republican and conservative Independent voters agree that it is important to invest in clean energy and believe the state should increase its dependence on diverse energy sources, including biomass, hydrogen, nuclear, and solar.

As the polling shows, there is widespread support for clean energy and the tax incentives in the state. In an op-ed published in the Chronicle-Independent, a representative of the American Conservation Coalition wrote, “Our energy future will depend on an array of energy sources, from nuclear to natural gas to hydroelectric power. Whenever we have clean, reliable electrons ready to be transmitted to the power grid, we should leap at the opportunity… As a lifelong South Carolinian, I could not be prouder of my state for stepping up to diversify our energy portfolio and pursue innovative solutions. With strong leadership, we can continue to be a model for the rest of the nation.”

In a letter to the editor published in The State, Frank Knapp, president and CEO of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, commented on how even local energy incentives have benefited the state: “State law now provides significant tax credits for solar and requires utility companies to promote and use alternative energy. This is resulting in utilities purchasing electricity from solar farms and paying consumers well for putting building-generated solar energy on the grid. I recently put solar panels on my commercial building, saving 23 percent on my electric bill with an anticipated payoff after just four years.” He added that South Carolina’s promotion of alternative energy “won’t crush our economy. It will help it grow as a result of the investments and new jobs created.”

Also in a letter to the editor in The State, John Milko from Charleston wrote, “Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, South Carolina ranks second among all states in clean energy manufacturing investment, with over 27 project announcements bringing $15 billion and 14,000 new jobs to our state. Regardless of your views on climate change, it’s political and economic malpractice to put these projects, and the jobs they provide, in jeopardy.” Both legislative chambers must pass identical bills deciding the fate of the federal energy tax credits before the package can be sent to the President’s desk.

Sen. Graham has long supported clean energy, especially nuclear, as part of an “all of the above” energy approach. After the cancellation of the state’s beleaguered V.C. Summer nuclear project in the state in 2017, he said, “Revitalizing the nuclear industry is a priority to me. Twenty percent of our power comes from nuclear power plants. They are all old and they’re aging. I would like to build new ones all over the country.” In a speech the following year, he advocated for a South Carolina “nuclear renaissance,” commenting, “We’re going to do more, not less, on the nuclear side.”

V.C. Summer is back in the news after Santee Cooper received a massive response to its request for expressions of interest in the two partially constructed units at the station, and Governor Henry McMaster has urged the state’s Congressional delegation to maintain tax credits and federal loans for nuclear projects.

Sen. Graham has also voiced support for the solar industry and the jobs it creates. In a 2018 letter advocating for the exemption of specific solar modules from a tariff, sent to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, he and seven other Republican senators wrote, “Solar manufacturing jobs have surged 58% in the last 5 years… Alternative energy markets across the Southwest and West present additional opportunities for solar job growth as those states seek to diversify energy production sources… Building a skilled American workforce to meet the demand for solar technologies is essential to upholding the utility-scale market while the U.S. develops and integrates innovative, high-voltage technologies into our utility-scale solar sector.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/464319475_8232430950217507_6967957943732167836_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 14:14:39.984835

Lowering energy costs and increasing U.S. energy production are worthwhile goals, especially if associated emissions can be addressed.
The more likely outcome is that factories and data centers will instead be built more slowly or built overseas, unless U.S. trade policy stabilizes.
Across the board, manufacturing energy technologies and building new energy projects will get more expensive.
There is no way around the fact that a recession would slow U.S. energy growth, impairing the strategic industries like AI that require more of it.","President Donald Trump campaigned on steep tariffs, lower energy prices, and “energy dominance” – drastically increasing American energy production and strategically leveraging those resources to achieve strategic goals at home, like developing AI, and abroad, like rebalancing trade.

However, in practice, the wide-ranging tariffs that the Trump administration has sought to impose will make U.S. energy more expensive and disrupt energy security. Far from restoring domestic manufacturing, this tariff regime has instead chilled capital investment and stunted manufacturing growth. Since the tariffs were put into place, the U.S. has seen higher manufacturing input price inflation than any country in the world, and North America is the only region where manufacturing production has fallen.

The energy sector is not immune: The trends toward higher costs will hit consumers’ pocketbooks, delay sorely needed infrastructure upgrades thereby exacerbating concerns over grid reliability, and stunt long-term American manufacturing growth, which itself relies on low-cost electricity. If the administration wants lower energy costs and a more secure energy system, it must find another way forward on trade policy. The disconnect between the administration’s goals and the economic reality underscores the need for a more strategic, coordinated approach to industrial policy – one that strengthens domestic capabilities without sacrificing affordability, innovation, or global competitiveness.

The courts step in – for now

The trajectory of tariffs may be murky, at best, in coming weeks. In late May, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that the Trump administration exceeded its authority in exercising the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) – a statute designed to address national security threats – to impose wide-ranging retaliatory tariffs. The decision strikes at the legal foundation of “Liberation Day” tariffs, which enact sweeping duties on imports from countries running trade surpluses with the U.S.

However, the story is far from over. First, Section 301 tariffs on some Chinese goods and Section 232 tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, among other essential economic building blocks, will remain in place because they are based on other authorities. Second, at the time of publication, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit paused the earlier decision, allowing the Trump administration to keep its tariff posture in place pending further legal proceedings. Third, the case at hand will likely reach the Supreme Court next year. Even if the Court rules against the Trump administration, it still retains access to other authorities – such as Section 232, 301, 201, 122, and 338 tariffs – that can recreate much of the existing tariff policy even though they generally require investigations and cannot be exercised overnight at whatever level the executive branch deems appropriate. While the pending decision may rein in the use of IEEPA, it does not preclude the administration from deploying a patchwork of other tools to achieve similar protectionist aims as it continues down this path. In fact, it will likely compel the administration to accelerate trade investigations to invoke these other authorities.

The energy insecurity premium

The broader problem is that the Trump administration’s intent with tariffs contradicts its other aims. Lowering energy costs and increasing U.S. energy production are worthwhile goals, especially if associated emissions can be addressed. The U.S. benefits from wholesale electricity prices lower than nearly all its developed-country peers, granting a competitive edge in maintaining energy-intensive industries, holding consumer bills low, and keeping inflation in check. However, every energy technology depends on global supply chains and imported components. Economy-wide tariffs on these goods slow deployment, compromise competitiveness, raise consumer prices, and create uncertainty in energy markets, stifling investment.

The scale is staggering: As of June 1, the U.S. effective tariff rate is still the highest it has been in nearly a century, even without “Liberation Day” levies that would impose even steeper tariffs on dozens of countries based on their trade balances with the U.S. Even after consumers and businesses shift their purchases to seek lower-cost options, the average tariff level they face will be an estimated 15%, up from only 2.5% last year, even with the temporary detente with China lowering the additional rate to 30 percentage points. And despite a perceived cooling of trade chaos after that detente, uncertainty continues: the administration has now threatened the European Union with a 50% tariff if a trade deal is not reached by early July.

If the courts ultimately rein in the administration’s use of IEEPA , the Trump administration will be limited to established tariff authorities like Section 232, Section 301, and Section 201, as well as others that it has not previously exercised Even within that narrower remit, much damage can be done. Before Liberation Day, the Trump administration had already imposed Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports at a rate of 25% and plans to double that level. It could also leverage Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows for tariffs of up to 15% for 150 days to address “large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits,” or Section 338 of the 1930 Trade Act, which allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% against countries discriminating against US products. Section 232, 301, and 201 have become commonplace, but no president has levied Section 338 or 122 tariffs in decades.

For now, USMCA-compliant goods are exempt from IEEPA-related levies, and these goods are heavily traded within North America. Canada and Mexico supply 40% of U.S. steel imports, with Canada alone providing the vast majority of U.S. aluminum imports. Further, copper, critical minerals, and semiconductors are temporarily exempted from tariffs. However, the administration has already signaled that the Commerce Department will initiate investigations on those goods that would subject them to similar tariffs. In the meantime, exemptions offer other countries pressure points to target: China has already instituted export controls on rare earths, of which it produces 90% of global supply, though Beijing has likely now paused some of these measures amidst negotiations. Even if the Trump administration quickly cuts deals that waive away steep country-specific levies, Section 232 tariffs may remain, as well as some element of the 10% universal tariff on all countries.

Notwithstanding the patchwork of exemptions and walkbacks, tariffs already in place target the essential building blocks of American energy production. There is hardly a way to produce molecules or electrons that does not require steel, aluminum, copper, or critical minerals. Take solar, for example: photovoltaic cells have become so inexpensive that aluminum frames are among the most expensive components in a solar panel. In the first three months of 2025, even before Liberation Day, nearly $8 billion worth of projects were cancelled, including major battery and hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing plants.

The Trump administration, which excluded renewables from its executive order declaring an energy emergency, very well may not see an issue with decelerating the deployment of intermittent renewables like wind and solar.

However, they will quickly find that doing so will hamstring their other, more popular goals like creating abundant, affordable electricity for AI and advanced manufacturing. Fossil fuels alone will not allow America to reopen its factories, power new industries, and compete in a global economy hungry for cheap, abundantly available electricity. The more likely outcome is that factories and data centers will instead be built more slowly or built overseas, unless U.S. trade policy stabilizes. The U.S. is not the only advanced economy with these goals, but it is the only one undermining its own investment predictability.

Moreover, the U.S. oil and gas industry is not immune to rising steel and aluminum prices— those metals are essential for drilling rigs, pipelines, storage tanks, and virtually every other segment of the supply chain. Energy producers that domestically source materials will likely still face cost increases as miners and metal producers raise prices amidst tariff protection. Higher drilling costs and weaker demand will push U.S. oil and gas companies to batten down the hatches, cutting investment while other countries like Saudi Arabia produce more.

Paying more to fall behind

The blow to expanding existing modes of U.S. energy production is likely staggering, but it could be even worse for earlier-stage energy innovations like advanced geothermal and nuclear that Energy Secretary Chris Wright and other senior administration officials have prioritized and pledged to support. The administration’s Earth Day message called out efforts to support “cutting edge” new industries including geothermal, nuclear, and carbon capture. While the U.S. has fallen behind in the most mature clean energy industries like wind, solar, and lithium-ion batteries, recent industrial policy and private sector investment have positioned it to catch up – and potentially lead – in new ones. But as costs rise and uncertainty chills investment, any comparative advantage that the U.S. has in these new technologies will slip away as competitors like China capitalize.

Batteries

The battery sector is among the fastest-growing energy industries, projected to more than double in value to $322 billion globally by 2030. It also intersects directly with core U.S. national security interests: The same batteries that underpin the resilience and stability of an increasingly complex electric grid are also underlying components of virtually every advanced technology defining global competition, from AI and data centers to electric vehicles and military systems like drones and other autonomous vehicles.

However, the industry is largely captured by China, which accounts for 75% of global production and dominates the refining of critical mineral inputs, including 90% of rare earths. It may seem sensible to compel the U.S. battery industry to forcefully and fully decouple from the Chinese supply chain, but the current posture would shoot its domestic infant industry in its crib. It is an industry worth protecting and paying to compete in, but tariffs on batteries and possibly critical minerals from the world’s largest supplier will cripple every key downstream industry, and tariffs on critical inputs will prevent a domestic industry from emerging.

Even without additional 232 tariffs on critical minerals, China has already implemented retaliatory export controls on minerals that it most dominates. Deterioration in trade and the investment environment has already taken its toll, and will likely continue to chill investment: two billion-dollar factories to expand U.S. battery manufacturing capacity have already been cancelled.

Batteries are heavily reliant on foreign supply chains and tariffs: Chinese and South Korean firms directly export to the U.S. or provide inputs for U.S. automakers. Korean battery makers are taking advantage of IRA incentives to manufacture in the U.S., but threats to those incentives, coupled with duties on upstream inputs, may compromise those investments. Shifting battery supply chains away from Chinese supply chains and refined metals will take time and require partnerships with allies, partners, like Chile, and even Chinese firms themselves. Chinese battery-makers are increasingly leading on innovative chemistries like lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that require fewer hard-to-obtain minerals like cobalt. U.S. manufacturers of electric vehicles may do well to take a page from their Chinese competitors’ playbook and elicit technology transfer from innovative firms overseas. It may be the quickest path to catching up on the latest innovations and sidestepping critical mineral chokepoints.

The U.S. should also be clear-eyed about how to compete in the battery industry: while the U.S. is far behind in lithium-ion batteries, it has a chance to compete in solid-state and other emerging technologies. A more subtle strategy may empower allies like South Korea to compete on today’s technologies while investing in commercializing emerging tech. But competitiveness, even in the technologies of the future, will require tapping into international supply chains and partners’ resources. Today’s tariff regime risks splintering those opportunities.

Next-generation geothermal

Next-generation geothermal benefits from strong policy alignment with the Trump administration and a stronger comparative advantage than the U.S. has in most other clean energy technologies. The nascent U.S. geothermal industry builds on the American technological and industrial edge in drilling. As a global leader in drilling innovation and home to many of the world’s top geothermal vendors, the U.S. is well-positioned to compete and potentially export in the future. Next-generation geothermal power – and longer-term advancements such as superhot rock geothermal – can unlock huge amounts of reliable, inexpensive, and clean energy capacity across regions, and do so with a small land footprint. As a clean, firm power source, geothermal is an ideal technology with which to power data centers and other electricity-intensive assets, and to help provide reliable power supply relatively immune to seasonal variation.

Even though the U.S. geothermal industry is largely composed of domestic service providers, they rely on many components which are frequently produced outside the U.S., including turbines, drill bits, high-temperature/high-pressure sensing and power electronics, large-diameter well casings and drill string components. Further, because the current U.S. tariff posture is wide-reaching, the geothermal industry also remains vulnerable to tariffs that affect all energy sectors, particularly those on steel, cement, and copper, as well as broader indirect impacts.

If trade fragmentation results in accelerated inflation, higher capital costs, and reduced demand due to recession, next generation geothermal will suffer a fate that stymies the transition of many technologies in the demonstration stage. Geothermal and other firm power technologies have benefited from the promise of new power demand from artificial intelligence and data centers, the electrification of the economy, and other new, high-intensity industries. Major technology companies had made huge plans and commitments to construct gigawatts worth of new data centers across the United States and Europe. But so far this year, Microsoft has already cancelled 2 GW of data centers and Amazon has paused commitments for new data center leases. The dropoff of potential new demand sources, coupled with the loss of government support, may narrow opportunities for enhanced geothermal technologies to commercialize. And while collaboration with longtime allies such as Iceland and Japan would likely help U.S. companies develop more rapidly, tariffs instead push them away, giving competitors more opportunity to catch up.

Advanced Nuclear

Nuclear power has been one of the rare areas of bipartisan agreement in clean energy over the past few years, with both parties supporting legislation to enable nuclear restarts and new builds in the United States. However, as it stands today, Russia and China dominate the industry globally: As of December 2024, 55.5 GW of the 69.5 GW total nuclear power under construction globally is being built by Russian or Chinese companies. China is expected to overtake the U.S. nuclear power fleet as early as 2030. And, as tariffs cloud nuclear’s planned resurgence in the United States, China’s State Council has approved plans for 10 additional new reactors, pursuing both GW-scale reactors for bulk electricity generation and small modular reactors for industrial decarbonization. It is in the United States’ interest, both economic and geostrategic, to lead globally, including nuclear fuel supply which has been systematically undercut by low-cost Russian imports.

Trade fragmentation and policy uncertainty could seriously undermine conventional, large reactors and advanced, modular technologies alike. Reactors are, after all, behemoth infrastructure projects with massive amounts of reinforced steel and concrete, as well as components primarily fabricated abroad. Additionally, a number of nuclear technologies originating from the U.S. are currently pursued for deployment in the European markets.

The U.S. could construct a nuclear supply chain without adversaries like Russia and China, but not without allies like Canada, Japan and South Korea. Despite uranium’s exclusion from increased tariffs, new reactor construction is likely to see major cost increases, especially if there is further action on steel, cement, and copper imports. For an industry plagued by cost overruns that have cooled investment and raised the cost of capital – the most recent nuclear build in the U.S. at Vogtle came in at over double its budgeted cost – additional cost inflation and uncertainty will not help push the industry forward. The industry’s capital intensity exposes it even more to investment uncertainty and cost of capital changes than other industries. Over the past decade, Russia and China have both established robust policies and unwavering support for the nuclear industry that resulted in a series of new builds, competent workforce, efficient supply chains and ultimately increased cost-competitiveness of their technologies. The U.S. cannot compete if cost inflation worsens further.

Carbon capture and storage

Trump administration officials generally support carbon capture and storage (CCS), although the fate of carbon management DOE demonstration programs, crucial for lowering investment risk, is still unknown. Furthermore the administration has delayed the publication of updated carbon dioxide safety rules, first issued by the Biden administration in January this year, slowing progress in states like California that have moratoria in place dependent on those new rules. Tariffs risk decelerating already slow progress. Because capturing carbon dioxide from flue stacks adds costs to existing projects, developers rely upon either policy incentives like 45Q tax credits or knock-on value such as enhanced oil recovery to achieve commercial viability. CCS projects are therefore highly exposed to any policies that cut into margins or raise prices across the board. Like any infrastructure project, policy uncertainty and rising input costs are likely to slow investment and industry commitment to technologies and projects that require a premium – whether from policy incentive or a market signal – to pencil.

Across the board, manufacturing energy technologies and building new energy projects will get more expensive.

Tariffs are untethered from strategy or competitiveness

The price of uncertainty

It is difficult to imagine the current trade uncertainty playing out as the administration has envisioned if the primary goal is bringing back U.S. manufacturing. First, tariff protection is hardly guaranteed. The U.S. has swatted away deals from Vietnam and Israel so far, but Trump has touted forthcoming “tailored deals,” under which the U.S. could roll back trade measures, like that already reached with the UK. The business community has no reasonable expectations that tariff protection promised today will exist by the time their factories open, leaving them without the certainty necessary to invest in domestic manufacturing.

Second, even if the administration were to freeze tariffs in place, it will take more than four years for many businesses to obtain permits, put steel and the ground, and open their doors to manufacture most advanced energy technologies. By then, someone other than Trump will be president.

Third, even if construction time were a non-factor, existing manufacturers have seen their input costs balloon or at least become harder to estimate. If this trade war triggers global economic downturn, a growing possibility, businesses may rather hold on to capital than deploy it to meet uncertain, tepid demand. There is no way around the fact that a recession would slow U.S. energy growth, impairing the strategic industries like AI that require more of it. Constrained, high-cost supply paired with recession-depressed demand hardly spells energy dominance.

Fourth, it is possible that the bell cannot be unrung–even after reaching a deal with the UK. The Trump administration may have already created an irreversible trust deficit with some U.S. allies that feel mistreated and disrespected by the U.S. That is, Liberation Day may have worsened U.S. trade relations to such a degree that there is no scenario in which American trade negotiators roll back the clock to early April. It remains to be seen whether the promised slew of bilateral trade deals materializes, or which industries may win or lose from a new patchwork.

Negotiations could come to naught if countries perceive they have little to gain from making concessions, especially if they now see U.S. tariffs as legally dubious and less of a credible threat given the recent court ruling. The Trump administration’s theory of success is murky at best and likely hinges on a wide swathe of countries making massive concessions— lowering their own tariff rates on U.S. goods, committing to purchasing U.S. goods, and potentially aligning with the U.S. on non-economic issues of foreign policy, all while accepting a higher U.S. tariff on their goods than when Trump took office in January. To be sure, the Trump administration will likely reach framework agreements and deals with some countries that include concessions, but it’s possible— perhaps likely— that many U.S. allies and adversaries will not make meaningful deals at any political and economic cost or at the expense of national interest. The complete reversals of fortunes for the Liberal Party in Canada and Labor Party in Australia suggest that conceding would be more political liability than relief for some world leaders. In a worst-case scenario, some of America’s longstanding economic partners may instead write off the U.S., turning to other markets and economic partners while retaliating directly with tariffs or export controls of their own.

Even if such a scenario does not come to pass, tariff talks with many large trading partners could drag on for months if not years. It traditionally takes as long for trade officials to determine their positions before they engage in negotiations. The reasonable expectation is that it will take a long time for the U.S. to reach agreements with the roughly seventy countries that have expressed interest in doing so, each of which may be specifically tailored to provide investment and purchases of U.S. goods. And every month of dragged-out negotiations is another month of paralyzing uncertainty for U.S. industry.

Swapping sledgehammers for scalpels

Tariffs could nonetheless still prove a useful tool despite the myriad concerns with how the Trump administration is currently wielding them. If the administration is lucky, the U.S. has not squandered its longstanding goodwill across the world with its “might makes right” rhetoric. The possible upside is that this aggressive trade posture compels U.S. trading partners to lower their trade barriers amidst negotiations, giving way to freer flowing trade. The UK seems to have made such a deal, potentially lowering its tariffs on U.S. farm products and other goods.

The backlash from financial markets and partner countries has been so severe that the Trump administration may feel compelled to back down from its maximalist approach and adopt a more rational one that applies tariffs more strategically. Such may already be the case. The U.S. has seemingly blinked and said tariffs on China are too high and come down to 30%.

It is clear that tariffs alone will not make America energy dominant or lower energy costs. In fact, they are more likely to have the opposite effect without adjustments and complementary policies by stymying downstream industries dependent on imports like steel, aluminum, and copper. Maximizing effectiveness and impact requires tailoring tariffs and aligning them with other industrial policies. To do so, the administration would need to:

Make tariffs targeted, predictable, and time-bound. The recent ruling against the administration’s use of IEEPA is a strong step toward a more rational trade policy. The U.S. should only impose tariffs in sectors and supply chain segments in which it has a real ability and intention to compete, while taking advantage of cheap imports in sectors where it does not. Applying tariffs to industries where the U.S. has close to no capacity or short-term plans to build it will result in near 100% pass-through prices without creating new U.S. manufacturing capacity. Predictability is also critical to allow companies to make capacity and investment plans based on stable policy expectations. Building in a sunset date— one that can be extended if necessary— ensures that domestic producers are incentivized to innovate and become more competitive globally, rather than atrophying behind a protective moat. Indefinite tariffs send the wrong signal that U.S. companies can sell at higher prices without the need to innovate and compete with foreign firms, leaving the U.S. consumer worse off.

Pair tariffs with robust industry policy support. Tariffs are a blunt tool: they can buy time and protect domestic industries from foreign competition, but they do not ensure that those industries will innovate, become competitive, or even materialize. Subsidies reduce the risks for companies to invest in bringing emerging technologies to market and scaling production lines. They can bring R&D from American labs into the marketplace. To some extent, this path requires little departure from Trump’s first term. He can continue leveraging government tools to strengthen U.S. industrial capacity as he did in his first term, and Biden continued, though it would also require Trump to integrate some Biden-era initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits into his own. These technologies are vital for emissions reductions and are increasingly central to strategic economic competition.

It will be important that the U.S. focus on innovative, game-changing clean tech that China does not yet dominate, including long-duration energy storage, geothermal, advanced nuclear, and carbon capture. The U.S. can lead these sectors by accelerating domestic deployment and eventually taking on international leadership as a technology provider to the world. Ignoring these industries would be a mistake that risks ceding influence and market opportunity to China and worsening the U.S. trade balance in the long term as these technologies grow in prominence. The administration’s proposed budget would do just that, by cutting billions from various Energy Department R&D budgets and $15.2 billion in spending from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that would support EV battery production, CCS deployment, and a slew of other critical programs. Cutting innovation at the knees will instead surrender that leadership in favor of short-term bravado, with value destruction to boot.

Leverage, rather than spurn, foreign economic partners. To continue diversifying from Chinese supply chains, the United States should strengthen industrial partnerships with third countries rather than antagonizing them. The U.S. will likely never outcompete China in low-margin, low-tech industries, nor should it try if investing in them does not drive the creation of well-paying jobs, high-value-added economic growth, or strategic goals. Rather than aim for autarky, the U.S. can work with allies to strategically plan industrial strategies around their comparative advantages in battery materials and critical mineral processing, among other strategic supply-chain segments. Possible measures could include encouraging them to invest in the U.S., thereby transferring technologies and reaping profit to reinvest at home, and offering concessional U.S. finance in their complementary manufacturing capacity up and down supply chains with the Development Finance Corporation and other relevant U.S. agencies.

Creating a trade and industrial strategy that prioritizes U.S. competitiveness and growth is possible. To position U.S. firms competitively in the global export market, the administration can align commercial diplomacy, export finance, and development dollars with U.S. market power, domestic job creation, and geopolitical opportunity. There is an estimated $130 trillion market opportunity in clean energy technology through 2050, and yet the U.S. accounts for only 6% of those exports today.

If this or any future administration wants to make good on the promise of American energy dominance and industrial revival, tariffs must become instruments of strategy, not symbols of brute strength. That means abandoning the blunt-force approach of trade wars in favor of a smarter playbook: one that matches targeted tariffs with industrial investment, innovation-driven competitiveness, and the might of America’s economic alliances. The next phase of U.S. trade and energy policy must not be about retreating from globalization, but rather reshaping it in American competitive interest, with partners and a long game in mind.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/03150455/shipping-port.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 13:19:46.648226

Reasons consumers aren’t interested in EVs

In AAA’s latest surveys about consumer attitudes towards electric vehicles, 63% say they’re “unlikely or very unlikely” to purchase an EV for their next car purchase. This is the same as last year.

The main reasons continue to be the high battery repair costs (62%) and the higher purchase price compared to traditional vehicles (59%). Other concerns identified in this year’s survey are the perceived unsuitability of EVs for long-distance travel (57%), a lack of convenient public charging stations (56%), range anxiety – the fear of running out of charge while driving (55%), and safety concerns about electric vehicles (31%). Other issues are challenges installing charging stations where they live (27%), and the potential reduction or elimination of tax credits and rebates (12%).

“Perceptions of EVs can vary widely by area. Drivers in states like Oregon where electric vehicles are popular often find EVs to be an attractive alternative and the appeal is fueled by an interest in saving on gas, environmental reasons, and lower maintenance costs.

Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on building out a grid that can support Massachusetts’ clean energy and electrification ambitions.","A pesky question has long stalled efforts to expand U.S. power grids in the face of growing demand and surging renewable energy: Who should pay for the upgrades?

An under-the-radar breakthrough in Massachusetts may finally provide a template for answering that question.

Over the past year or so, the state’s largest utilities and regulators have approved plans for dividing grid costs between customers and the companies that build solar arrays.

It’s been a long time coming. The plans in question have gone through numerous iterations since utilities, regulators, and solar developers started working on them about six years ago, making progress hard to track. And the name they settled on — ​“Capital Investment Projects,” or CIPs — isn’t exactly an attention grabber.

But behind the staid name lies a significant advance for a state striving to fairly allocate the costs of shifting to clean energy, said Kate Tohme, director of interconnection policy at Massachusetts-based community solar developer New Leaf Energy. In fact, advocates working on similar efforts in states from New York to California are ​“all trying to use the Massachusetts framework as a model,” she said.

The roughly $334 million in CIP grid projects from utilities Eversource and National Grid that have been approved or are being considered by regulators are doing something rare in the world of regulated utilities. Instead of forcing distributed solar and battery projects to pay up-front for grid improvements that allow them to connect to the utility system, the CIPs spread those costs onto customers’ future utility bills. Under the old system, clean energy projects regularly died on the vine because up-front grid costs were prohibitively high.

That doesn’t mean developers are getting a free ride, however. They’ll still have to pay a portion of those costs back as they’re connected to the grid, reducing the burden on customers over time. And every project in question had to prove to regulators that the grid improvements at large also deliver customer benefits, whether through improved grid reliability, enabling access to cheaper community solar power, or both.

Massachusetts can’t avoid these kinds of grid investments if it’s to meet its clean energy and electrification goals, according to Tohme, a former official at the state Department of Public Utilities who was directly involved in some of the earliest CIP work. The state has committed to cutting emissions 50% below 1990 levels by 2030, which will require building lots of renewable energy and electrifying vehicles and home heating.

“In the short term, it’s going to increase our costs,” Tohme said. But ​“once the grid is modernized and we get distributed energy interconnected, it’s going to drastically decrease our electricity costs” by replacing expensive fossil-fueled power with cheaper renewable energy and batteries.

Sharing costs to solve the solar logjam

The landmark plan emerged as a response to what might be seen as a clean-energy success story — Massachusetts had too much community solar trying to get onto an overly crowded grid.

The launch of the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target program in 2018 had created lucrative incentives for community solar developers, spurring a rush of applications to connect to utility distribution grids. As available capacity was used up, the cost of upgrading those grids to accommodate more solar power started to rise.

“For a while, the cost to interconnect was tens of thousands of dollars, something a project could absorb,” said Mike Porcaro, director of innovative grid solutions at National Grid, one of the state’s largest utilities. ​“But eventually the modifications grew so large — hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars — that it was hard for projects to move forward.”

National Grid was encountering the same kind of interconnection backlog and upgrade cost challenges that have tied up utility-scale solar and wind projects on high-voltage transmission grids across the country. The main difference is that community solar projects connect to lower-voltage grids that carry power from big substations to end customers. Similar backlogs have dogged other states with lots of community solar, including Minnesota and New York.

One of the best-established ways to relieve interconnection stresses is for utilities and grid operators to stop painstakingly studying each project one at a time and batch them instead. Such ​“group” or ​“cluster” studies of multiple projects seeking interconnection in a particular region allow utilities to conduct a speedier and more holistic assessment of the impacts they’ll cause and upgrades that will solve them.

It also allows grid-upgrade costs to be shared among the projects in the cluster, rather than foisting them on whichever project engineers determined would push that part of the grid over its existing capacity limit, thus triggering an upgrade, Porcaro said.

But the approach has its limits. ​“You’re still sharing the costs among that group,” he said — and forcing projects to pay even a portion of those costs up front can still make them too expensive to move forward.

To deal with that disconnect, the Department of Public Utilities launched its ​“provisional system planning program,” the precursor to the CIPs, in 2021. The idea, Porcaro said, was to allow utilities to move faster on solving the fundamental problem for all of those community solar projects — a grid that wasn’t being built out quickly enough to match the exploding demand for capacity.

National Grid and other utilities already plan ahead to accommodate growing electricity demand from customers or to serve big new developments like housing subdivisions or factories, Porcaro noted. The goal of the provisional system planning approach was to find a way to similarly pay in advance for proactive grid investments to bring community solar projects online.

“The review and discovery to get these CIPs approved was no small feat,” Porcaro said. ​“It wasn’t a quick decision.”

Figuring out a fair share

In late 2022, the Department of Public Utilities approved its first test case for CIPs — a cluster of projects put forward by utility Eversource, known as the ​“Marion-Fairhaven Study Group” after two of the Southeastern Massachusetts towns in the area being considered for upgrades.

Eversource estimated at the time that it would cost about $116 million in distribution grid upgrades to enable roughly 140 megawatts of community solar to connect to the grid. To avoid the chicken-and-egg problem of requiring projects to pay up front for the upgrades — something they couldn’t afford to do — Eversource proposed charging them about $370 per kilowatt of solar they connected once the grid work was done.

The risk of this approach is that some of the projects involved in the group study would end up dropping out, leaving customers on the hook for their unpaid share, Lavelle Freeman, Eversource’s vice president of distribution system planning, told Canary Media in a 2023 interview. That put the burden on Eversource to plan a grid upgrade that didn’t just make room for the solar projects but benefited customers as well.

Fortunately, the same kinds of upgrades that expand capacity for community solar also improve customer reliability and provide headroom for growing electrical loads.

“We’re also improving the substations, adding new capacity, adding new transformers and feeders, making the system more robust,” Freeman said. ​“We developed a very rigorous algorithm to calculate the reliability benefits,” which ended up showing a roughly 50-50 split in the benefits between customers and solar developers. ​“That went a long way toward convincing regulators that the cost-allocation principle would work.”

To be clear, there are significant risks to committing utility customers’ money to building out grid infrastructure to serve the needs of community solar projects. In Massachusetts, the state Attorney General’s Office is tasked with protecting utility customers’ interests in regulatory proceedings like these.

A senior official at the Attorney General’s Office who was involved with the CIP process told Canary Media that the office ​“took serious issue” with how Eversource first proposed splitting grid-upgrade costs. ​“Not only were ratepayers paying more than they should have, it created a lot of risk for ratepayers,” said the person, who was granted anonymity to discuss matters outside the official regulatory process.

On the other hand, the official said, ​“being able to have more homegrown generation is going to be important for Massachusetts. It is a cost risk. But how do we minimize those cost risks to ratepayers, and maximize those benefits to ratepayers, as we bring this solar online?”

These concerns from the Attorney General’s Office pushed the finalized version of CIP to shift more of the cost of new grid investments onto community solar projects as opposed to utility customers. That’s not ideal from the perspective of solar developers, obviously, but it’s far better than being stuck with the unaffordable upgrade costs they faced before.

Having a known per-kilowatt cost locked in well in advance is also helpful, said Mike Judge, currently undersecretary of energy for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who spoke to Canary Media in 2023 when he was vice president of policy for the trade group Coalition for Community Solar Access.

Developers often need to secure interconnection rights before they can secure the financing and start signing up subscribers that allow them to move forward with projects, he said.

“There’s so much value for a developer to know I’m going to pay $370 a kilowatt to connect,” Judge said. ​“You’re not waiting a year, year and a half for a utility to come back with study results to say, it’s $5 million — and you have to cancel your project.”

From reactive to proactive

The model that Eversource established for the Marion-Fairhaven project is largely mirrored in the 10 other CIPs that it and National Grid have submitted to regulators. All told, Eversource has identified six groups with more than 250 MW of community solar or battery storage capacity. Porcaro said that National Grid has five CIPs that will enable about 300 MW of new projects — ​“that’s huge.”

Massachusetts isn’t the only state working on policies that aim to spur grid expansion while keeping customers’ power costs in check, Tohme said. Similar efforts are now underway in states including California, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, and New York.

But to Tohme’s knowledge, no other state has accomplished what Massachusetts has with its CIP structure. New York is closest, she said, with a cost-sharing framework that allows community solar developers to split up the costs of necessary upgrades rather than bearing them alone. But that still doesn’t include the same ​“build in advance, pay later” structure that the CIPs have, she said.

At the same time, Tohme pointed out, the CIPs remain a response to a problem that’s been hounding the state for years now: projects stuck behind an inadequately upgraded grid. The next logical step is to figure out where grid upgrades should be made before that kind of situation happens again.

That’s one of the goals laid out for the state’s three major investor-owned utilities under a sprawling grid-modernization mandate created as part of a major energy and climate law passed in 2022. It’s called the Electric Sector Modernization Plans process, and the Department of Public Utilities is now reviewing the proposals submitted by utilities last year to determine next steps, Porcaro said.

CIPs are a part of that broader plan, he said. But the modernization plans are ​“going above that and saying, ​‘plan for everything’ — for everyone having an EV, and electrifying their homes, and specific goals for how much energy storage we need. It’s a tall order.”

Given how long it took to figure out CIPs, clean energy developers have reason to worry that this even more sweeping and complicated planning task could take even longer. Clean-energy industry group Advanced Energy United has urged state regulators to keep doing CIPs while it undertakes this broader new effort.

Porcaro highlighted other work that can help get more clean energy connected even before the grid gets built out. He pointed to National Grid’s Active Resource Integration pilot, launching this year, which is looking at ways community solar and battery projects can connect to grids that can safely absorb their power output during all but a handful of hours of the year. If those solar farms can curtail their output during those hours, they could connect years ahead of utility grid upgrades.

Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on building out a grid that can support Massachusetts’ clean energy and electrification ambitions. Later this year, the Department of Public Utilities is expected to issue its ground rules on how utilities should start to calculate the fair sharing of costs between their customers and the community solar and battery projects trying to connect to their grids under the Electric Sector Modernization Plans, Tohme said.

Once that’s done, utilities and other stakeholder groups will bring cost-sharing proposals to the regulator and start to hash them out, she said. ​”So we have a long way to go before we have proactive proposals.”

But just because it’s going to be hard doesn’t mean it isn’t worth doing, she said. ​“We have to modernize our grid. Right now we’re doing it anyway — we’re just reacting. We’re just doing it non-strategically. And that’s just as expensive,” Tohme said — if not more so.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-893158026.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ba402f445f47bee636cf0a223260d545,N,,2025-06-04 13:20:04.144864

In a terse press release on May 30, the DOE cited “a thorough and individualized financial review” in its justification for canceling the awards, asserting the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment.” Nearly 70% of the projects, the agency noted, had been signed between Election Day and Jan. 20.

Over the past week, speculation has mounted about which projects were terminated. The DOE shared the names of the projects with POWER on June 3, but it did not provide project-specific justifications or documentation supporting its economic viability claims.

Power Sector Projects Among Hardest Hit

Among the rescinded awards are four major carbon capture initiatives tied directly to coal-fired and natural gas–fired power plants. These fall under the $2.537 billion Carbon Capture Demonstrations program and the $937 million Carbon Capture Large-Scale Pilots program, which are part of the DOE’s mandate under the 2021-enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).

Terminated awards under the Carbon Capture Demonstration Program include at least two projects that the Biden administration picked in December 2023 following a merit review.

Sutter CCUS ($270 million)—Yuba City, California. Led by Sutter CCUS, an indirect Calpine subsidiary, the project proposed for Yuba City, California, received $8.6 million for Phase 1 of the project on August 2024. Sutter will capture up to 1.75 million metric tons of CO2 each year, using ION Clean Energy solvent, from the 550-MW Sutter Energy Center (SEC), transport it and sequester it permanently underground in saline geologic formations. The gas-fired project consists of two combustion turbine generators, two heat recovery steam generators with duct burners, and a single condensing steam turbine generator.

Calpine Texas CCUS Holdings, LLC ($270 million)—Baytown, Texas. Calpine Texas CCUS Holdings received $270 million for Phase 1 of the project in July 2024. The Baytown, Texas, project was set to seek to capture up to 2 million metric tons of CO2 annually from the 810-MW baseload NGCC in Baytown, Texas, using Shell’s CANSOLV technology. The project, composed of three combustion turbines with three heat recovery steam generators, is set to demonstrate the first full-scale implementation of CCS technology at a natural gas combined cycle power plant in the U.S. The project planned to sequester the CO2 in saline storage sites on the Gulf Coast. The year-long first phase will involve completing an integrated FEED, workforce planning, project permitting, and environmental reviews.

Two terminated awards are affiliated with the DOE’s Carbon Capture Large-Scale Pilot Projects Program. The DOE announced the projects were selected in February 2024 following a merit review process.

Cane Run 7 Carbon Capture Project in Kentucky. PPL Corp.’s Cane Run Generating Station in Louisville, Kentucky, in September 2024, received $4.9 million from a total OCED award of up to $72 million to kick off Phase 1 activities. The project aims to capture 95% of CO2 emissions from a portion of the gas power plant’s flue gas using advanced heat-integrated technology developed by the University of Kentucky, targeting 67,000 metric tons of CO2 per year. Phase 1 activities, which will span 18 to 21 months, include a front-end engineering design (FEED) study, workforce planning, project permitting, and environmental reviews. The project, a key step toward assessing carbon capture viability on natural gas units, involves collaboration with EPRI, Siemens Energy, and Koch Modular Process Systems.

Dry Fork Carbon Capture Pilot in Wyoming. TDA Research and Schlumberger Technology Corp. are slated to receive up to $49 million in OCED funding to pilot TDA Research’s sorbent-based technology. The project received $5 million under the program in August 2024 to kick off Phase 1. The Dry Fork pilot project, located at the Wyoming Integrated Test Center near Basin Electric’s 405-MW Dry Fork Power Station, will capture over 90% of CO2 emissions from coal flue exhaust at high purity levels (+95%). The system aims to capture up to 158,000 metric tons of CO2 per year. Phase 1 activities, which will span 18 to 22 months, include a front-end engineering design (FEED) study, workforce planning, project permitting, and environmental reviews. The captured CO2 will be evaluated for sequestration options, including through Wyoming CarbonSAFE.

Distributed Power, Microgrids, and Clean Fuels Also Targeted

While not tied to utility-scale fossil generation, several terminated DOE projects represented investments in power infrastructure, including onsite generation, microgrid integration, and electrification of hard-to-abate sectors. All were aligned with broader decarbonization mandates under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and proposed near-term emissions reductions through system-level power solutions.

Kohler Co. ($51.2 million)—Casa Grande, Arizona. Awarded in October 2024, Kohler’s Vikrell Electric Boiler & Microgrid System project proposed to replace natural gas boilers with electrified thermal systems and integrate onsite renewables. The installation included 21 MW of solar PV and a 20.5-MW battery energy storage system, intended to power manufacturing operations and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 7,865 metric tons per year. The project was designed as a replicable template for industrial electrification and behind-the-meter decarbonization.

Ørsted Star P2X LLC ($99 million)—Chambers County, Texas. This advanced Power-to-X demonstration—selected in March 2024—sought to build out the Star e-Methanol facility, which would convert renewable electricity and captured CO₂ into up to 300,000 metric tons of e-methanol per year. The project targeted decarbonization of the maritime and aviation sectors, while also leveraging grid infrastructure and industrial power integration along the Gulf Coast. It was considered one of the nation’s most ambitious clean fuels projects at the time of cancellation.

Nevada Gold Mines, LLC ($95 million)—Eureka County, Nevada. Announced in November 2024, this project aimed to deploy 100 MW of solar PV and 248 MWh of battery energy storage across multiple gold mining operations. The goal: to offset fossil fuel use in mining operations and cut 2 million metric tons of CO₂ emissions over the project’s lifetime. Developed by Barrick and Newmont, it represented one of the most significant clean power transitions in the domestic extractive sector, with lessons applicable to energy-intensive industries nationwide.

Industry Response to the Sudden Shift

The abrupt termination of the federal awards has prompted new uncertainty for the power sector, which is grasping for near-term, scalable solutions to decarbonize dispatchable generation as demand growth looms. The DOE has not released project-specific evaluations, nor has it said whether canceled projects will be reconsidered under revised rules.

The decision arrives as carbon capture and storage (CCS) was gaining momentum in the power sector. Proponents argue that CCS remains essential to any realistic decarbonization pathway, especially for dispatchable fossil assets. Experts have, however, acknowledged that even with advances in solvent efficiency and flexible operation, most projects still depend heavily on federal tax incentives like the 45Q credit, carbon pricing frameworks, or long-term offtake contracts to close financing.

However, the future of 45Q is now also uncertain. In March 2025, a bipartisan House bill—the 45Q Repeal Act, introduced by Representatives Scott Perry (R-PA) and Ro Khanna (D-CA)—proposed eliminating the credit entirely, citing $30 billion in projected savings. At the same time, other bipartisan proposals have emerged to expand or reform the credit, including efforts to increase the value to $120 per ton and adjust its inflation indexing. Meanwhile, the House-passed budget reconciliation bill preserves 45Q but phases out credit transferability, a move industry groups warn could stall financing and jeopardize the economics of dozens of carbon capture projects already in development. As the Senate prepares to weigh the future of the incentive, project developers are now facing shifting ground under what had long been considered the financial backbone of carbon capture in the U.S.

The regulatory uncertainty is a major upheaval for an industry that has long struggled to align high capital costs, solvent stability, and complex permitting for pipelines and storage. As of May 2025, only a handful of Class VI underground injection well permits—required for long-term CO₂ storage—have been issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), while more than 160 applications remain under review, many languishing well beyond the agency’s 24-month target. Although the EPA approved its first Class VI permits in Texas in April, the broader backlog has spurred a nationwide push for “state primacy,” allowing states to take over the permitting process. North Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana, and most recently West Virginia have secured this authority, while Texas and Arizona are still navigating the approval process—prompting state officials and business leaders in Texas to press the EPA for swifter action.

For now, developers, utilities, and their partners are being forced to reassess. PPL Corp, which has been developing Cane Run 7, confirmed it had received formal notice of the award termination. “Together with our project partners, we will review our options for advancing this important research moving forward,” it said.

“Together with our research partners, PPL’s Kentucky utilities have spearheaded the research and development of carbon capture for 20 years and have developed industry-leading capabilities in this space,” a spokesperson told POWER. “While we are disappointed that the U.S. Department of Energy funding for this project has been terminated, we remain focused on driving innovation and important research and development in this space. And across PPL, we remain focused on advancing a safe, reliable, affordable and cleaner energy future, ensuring sufficient supply to meet rising electricity demand 24/7 and powering economic development in the communities we serve.”

The broader carbon management community is also sounding the alarm. Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, a nonpartisan alliance of more than 100 companies, labor unions, and environmental groups, called the termination of 24 DOE-funded projects “a major step backward in the nationwide deployment of carbon management technologies.” In a statement to POWER, Stolark stressed that these were rigorously vetted projects “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.” She warned that canceling them could undermine U.S. leadership in carbon management just as other countries accelerate their own frameworks: “Moves like this risk ceding America’s energy and technological leadership to other nations.” Above all, she added, “businesses require certainty to plan and execute projects, and carbon management is no different.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fig1-petra-nova-carbon-capture-ccs.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 11:08:09.971574

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) says Florida could lose potentially up to 21,800 solar and storage jobs if the current bill isn’t altered before making its way to President Donald Trump’s desk and into law.

Among the provisions included in the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that would severely alter the solar power industry are the removal of tax credits.

Fees collected from the penalties will be used to fund an incentive program to help consumers purchase zero-emission appliances, such as electric heat pumps.
What’s more, she said the plan encourages people to purchase zero-emission appliances only when their current unit breaks or they need a replacement, and that consumers ultimately still have a choice.","Southern California’s air quality regulators are set to vote this week on new rules aimed at phasing out the sale of gas-powered furnaces and water heaters in the region.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District, or AQMD, which covers all of Orange County and large swaths of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, is scheduled to vote Friday on two proposed regulations designed to limit emissions of nitrogen oxides, or NOx — the key pollutants that form smog.

If approved, the AQMD’s Proposed Amended Rules 1111 and 1121 would set zero-emission sales targets for manufacturers, distributors and installers of the appliances beginning in 2027. The targets ramp up over time, beginning with a 30% sales target the first year, increasing to 50% in 2029 and ultimately ending at 90% in 2036. The rules would affect an estimated 10 million units across the region, the majority of which would be in residential properties.

The gas-powered appliances would still be available for sale, but manufacturers would be forced to pay surcharges for those units — costs that probably would be passed on to consumers.

Officials say the plan is crucial for reducing air pollution and improving public health in the South Coast region, which continues to suffer from the worst smog in the nation and falls far below many federal health-based standards for air quality.

“This rule is a really important component of our strategy to clean up the air and be able to meet those health-based standards,” said Sarah Rees, deputy executive officer of planning and rules with the AQMD. “We wanted to focus on where there were the biggest chunks of NOx emissions, and space and water heating are actually a fairly significant chunk that’s left on the table for us to address.”

Environmental groups say the rules — nearly two years in the making — are long overdue and should be even more aggressive. But opponents, including gas-appliance manufacturers, fossil fuel companies and some local government and commerce groups, say the measure will strain the electric grid and drive up costs for consumers.

Prices for zero-emission units vary and can depend on factors such as the size of the home, local labor and installation costs, and whether electric panel upgrades also are required.

The estimated equipment and installation cost of an electric heat pump, for example, is $17,200, compared with $11,000 for a natural gas furnace, according to the AQMD’s socioeconomic impact report on the rules. However, because heat pumps can provide both heating and cooling, the agency notes that the cost of the electric unit is comparable to the cost of replacing a complete air conditioning and natural gas furnace system, which is about $20,600.

Heat pump water heaters are projected to cost an average of $3,700 for equipment and installation, compared with $3,300 for natural gas units, according to the AQMD.

State Sen. Tony Strickland (R-Huntington Beach) said affordability is one of his primary concerns about the rules. He is urging his constituents to weigh in against them.

“Families living paycheck to paycheck can’t afford this kind of mandate,” Strickland said, adding that the cost of living in California is 42% higher than the national average. “I want to rein in some of these boards, like [the California Air Resources Board, or CARB,] and AQMD, because they are making decisions that are detrimental to the people of California.”

Officials stressed that the proposal is not a mandate. Although the original iteration of the rules called for an eventual ban on the sale of new gas-powered appliances, the final amended rules call for a slower phase-in of the clean technology that still allows consumers to purchase natural gas units if they wish.

But there will be additional fees imposed on manufacturers for the sale of gas-powered units. The fees include an additional $100 for gas-powered furnaces and $50 for gas-powered water heaters, which increase to $500 and $250, respectively, if manufacturers sell more gas units than allowed by their sales target.

Fees collected from the penalties will be used to fund an incentive program to help consumers purchase zero-emission appliances, such as electric heat pumps.

“It’s kind of a weaker policy, but it’s still a very important policy,” said Adrian Martinez, director of the Right To Zero campaign at the nonprofit Earthjustice. “Because even though it’s not as strong of a signal to get to zero-emission appliances, it still is a signal.”

The potential air quality improvements from the switch to electric are substantial, including an estimated reduction of 6 tons of NOx per day by 2061. By comparison, cars in the region currently emit about 9 tons of NOx per day, Martinez said.

NOx isn’t only responsible for smog. As a leading source of indoor air pollution, the emissions also have been linked to respiratory infections, increased childhood asthma and other adverse health issues from exposure in homes, particularly those without proper ventilation, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“What we’re really talking about here is public health,” said Chris Chavez, deputy policy director at the nonprofit Coalition for Clean Air. “The fact is that if you are going to continue choosing to use polluting technology, there are going to be public health impacts — and we’re going to be paying for that through asthma attacks, we’re going to be paying for that through premature deaths, we’re going to be paying for that in hospitalizations, either personally or through our tax dollars.”

According to the AQMD’s impact report, the rules would prevent approximately 2,490 premature deaths, 10,200 cases of newly onset asthma, and 1.17 million days of limited or reduced physical and outdoor activity from 2027 to 2053.

More than 14,000 public comments have been submitted to the AQMD in response to the proposal, many of them in opposition.

“If these rules are adopted, it is crucial to recognize that consumer choice will be impacted and homeowners and renters, rather than industry, will be the ones forced to reach deep into their pockets to comply with these rules,” wrote Kevin Barker, a senior manager with the Southern California Gas Co., in a comment letter to the board.

Opponents also expressed concern that the electric appliances will add more strain to the region’s aging energy grid— or as one public commenter wrote, “we will face further electric grid brownouts due to the increased electricity use and make life in this state worse than it already is.”

Rees of the AQMD said the slow ramp-up of the rules should ensure that the grid has enough time to meet demand. The state is working to implement electrification initiatives, and officials at CARB also are moving toward a statewide ban on gas furnaces and water heaters by 2030.

And although she has heard the concerns about cost, she said zero-emission technology is more efficient — and thus more cost-effective to run — and will continue to come down in price over time. The incentive program is designed to assist customers who are struggling to meet up-front costs.

What’s more, she said the plan encourages people to purchase zero-emission appliances only when their current unit breaks or they need a replacement, and that consumers ultimately still have a choice.

“It’s really about promoting the zero-emission technology and, frankly, following existing market trends,” Rees said, noting that electric heat pumps already account for nearly a third of furnace sales in California. “We’ve worked very hard, we think, to try to craft a regulation that is going to advance adoption of these cleaner technologies but still preserves consumer choice, still allows for cases where it’s not affordable or practical for a consumer to adopt these types of equipment, but still get us the emission reductions at the end of the day.”

Still, some advocates said they wish the rules were more aggressive, including several who spoke during the AQMD’s most recent board meeting on the matter in May.

“This rule, while it’s not as strong as we wish it could be, is a step forward,” said Jennifer Cardenas, a campaign organizer with the Sierra Club. “You cannot put a price on being able to breathe clean air.”

Others pointed to the San Francisco Bay Area as an example of what’s possible. That region’s air quality management district passed its own more stringent version of the rules two years ago, which includes a total ban on the sale of new gas-powered water heaters in 2027 and furnaces in 2029.

However, Martinez of Earthjustice noted that NOx is the single-largest category of emissions under the South Coast AQMD’s authority, and said that the agency would be remiss not to take action on it.

“I think the best assessment is, are we better off with or without the rule?” he said. “Emphatically, all the evidence is showing we’re better off with the rule.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7223330/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4240x2226+0+303/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F43%2F81344f6940e9bcf2813bfc0197bd%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2169894284,N,,2025-06-04 14:15:23.546668

The defunding of the Center for Heat Resilient Communities came as a surprise to the group’s own leaders, who said they will continue collaborating with cities on their own.
In an ideal scenario, the Center for Heat Resilient Communities could have developed a universal heat plan for every city in the country.","Straddling the border with Mexico along the Rio Grande, the city of Laredo, Texas, and its 260,000 residents don’t just have to deal with the region’s ferocious heat. Laredo’s roads, sidewalks, and buildings absorb the sun’s energy and slowly release it at night, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. That can make a hot spell far more dangerous than for people living in the surrounding countryside, where temperatures might stay many degrees cooler. The effect partly explains why extreme heat kills twice as many people each year in the United States than hurricanes and tornadoes combined.

To better understand how this heat island effect plays out in Laredo, the nonprofit Rio Grande International Study Center partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last summer and enlisted more than 100 volunteers to drive around the city taking temperature readings. Edgar Villaseñor, the center’s advocacy campaign manager, worked with a company called CAPA Strategies, which created the map below. (Red shows where it’s hottest in the afternoon and blue where it’s coolest — notice the disparities between neighborhoods.)

But Villaseñor wanted a more interactive map to make it easier to navigate. He also wanted to hire someone to take thermal pictures on the ground in the hottest neighborhoods so that the center could create an interactive website for Laredo’s residents. He reckoned the city council could use such a site to figure out where to install more shading for people waiting at bus stops, for instance. So he applied for a $10,000 grant through NOAA’s Center for Heat Resilient Communities, which was funded through the Biden administration’s landmark climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA.

The research center was ready to announce on May 5 that the Rio Grande nonprofit, along with 14 city governments, had been selected to work closely with its researchers to tailor plans for addressing urban heat, according to V. Kelly Turner, who co-led the Center for Heat Resilient Communities. But the day before the announcement, Turner received a notice from NOAA that it was defunding the center. Turner says it sent another termination-of-funding notice to a separate data-gathering group, the Center for Collaborative Heat Monitoring, which was created with the same IRA funding. (When contacted for this story, a NOAA representative directed Grist to Turner for comment.) “The funding just stopped,” Villaseñor said. “I’m stuck with this valuable data that not a lot of people have.”

It’s the latest in a flurry of cuts across the federal government since President Donald Trump took office in January. The Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, has canceled hundreds of grants meant to help communities curb pollution and make themselves more resilient, such as by updating wastewater systems. NOAA announced last month that it would axe a database that tracks billion-dollar disasters, which experts said will hobble communities’ ability to assess the risk of catastrophes. Major job cuts at NOAA also have hurricane scientists worried that coastal cities — especially along the Gulf Coast — won’t get accurate forecasts of storms headed their way.

The defunding of the Center for Heat Resilient Communities came as a surprise to the group’s own leaders, who said they will continue collaborating with cities on their own. Though its budget was just $2.25 million, they say that money could have gone a long way in helping not just the grantees, but communities anywhere in the U.S. “There’s a lot of enthusiasm and momentum for doing this kind of work, and we’re not going to just let that go,” said Turner, who’s also associate director of heat research at the Luskin Center for Innovation at the University of California, Los Angeles. “We’re going to continue to interface with [communities], it’s just going to be incredibly scaled down.”

The program would have been the first of its kind in the U.S. In an ideal scenario, the Center for Heat Resilient Communities could have developed a universal heat plan for every city in the country. The challenge, however, is not only that heat varies significantly from neighborhood to neighborhood — richer areas with more green spaces tend to be much cooler — but also that no two cities experience heat the same way. A sticky, humid 90 degrees in Miami, for example, will feel a whole lot worse than 90 in Phoenix.

Turner and her colleagues at the research center had planned to work with a range of communities — coastal, rural, agricultural, tribal — for a year to craft action plans and discuss ways to construct green spaces, open more cooling centers for people to seek shelter, or outfit homes with better insulation and windows. “If the community was in a heavily vegetated, forested area, maybe urban forestry wouldn’t be the strategy that they’re interested in learning more about,” said Ladd Keith, director of the Heat Resilience Initiative at the University of Arizona, who co-led the center. “It might be something more about housing quality.”

The researchers had also planned to help communities determine who’s most at risk from rising heat, based on local economies and demographics. Rural economies, for example, have more agricultural workers exposed in shade-free fields, whereas office workers in urban areas find relief from air conditioning. Some cities have higher populations of elderly people, who need extra protection because their bodies don’t handle heat as well as those of younger folks.

While each city has a unique approach to handling heat, the 15 communities chosen represented the many geographies and climates of the U.S., Keith said. With this collaboration, the researchers would have been able to piece together a publicly available guide that any other city could consult. “We would have also learned quite a lot from their participation,” Keith said. “We would have had a really robust roadmap that would be really applicable to all cities across the country.”

The funding from NOAA might be gone, but what remains is the expertise that these researchers can still provide to communities as independent scientists. “We don’t want to leave them completely hanging,” Turner said. “While we can’t do as in-depth and rigorous work with them, we still feel like we owe it to them to help with their heat-resilience plans.”

Villaseñor, for his part, said his work won’t stop, even though that $10,000 grant would have gone a long way. He might rely on volunteers, for instance, to take those thermal images of the Lardeo’s hot spots. “I’m still trying to see what I can do without funding,” Villaseñor said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1242303266f.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-06-04 14:15:30.202894

The deal ensures the closest nuclear plant to Bloomington-Normal will remain open after being at risk for closure.

Constellation Energy President and CEO Joe Dominguez said the company was proud to pair with Meta. He said the tech company determined that ""supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy.""

“Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards,” Dominguez said.

This partnership will ensure long-term operation of the nuclear plant, add 30 new megawatts of capacity, and will help maintain 1,100 jobs, the companies said Tuesday. That 30-megawatt boost would be about 3% of the existing capacity.

""And that is essentially done through advanced monitoring and technical procedures which allow us to safely increase the output of the plant,"" said Mason Emnett, Constellation senior vice president of public policy.

""Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, said in a statement. “We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.”

The Clinton Clean Energy Center began operating in 1987. It's located about 30 miles southeast of Bloomington-Normal.

The plant was first headed for closure in 2017 after years of financial losses, despite being one of the best performing nuclear plants in Illinois, according to Constellation.

State lawmakers saved the plant — at least until 2027 — with passage of the Future Energy Jobs Act and its Zero Emission Credit program. But that state program ends in mid-2027. The deal with Meta keeps the plant operating beyond that date.

""So, it's effectively allowing us to transition from state support to private support, achieving the same clean energy benefits from the state but having a private contracting entity supporting us with the clean energy attribute transaction,"" said Constellation's Mason Emnett.

Emnett declined to say whether Meta will be paying more than the state pays to support the plant.

The plant won't directly power Meta's data centers.

""The power purchase agreement [PPA] will enable the Clinton Clean Energy Center to continue to flow power onto the local grid, providing grid reliability and low-cost power to the region for decades to come,"" the companies said. ""Meta is purchasing the plant’s clean energy attributes as part of its commitment to match 100% of its electricity use with clean and renewable energy.""

The plant directly employs over 530 people and generates enough carbon-free electricity to power over 800,000 homes.

Consumer impacts

Michael Brown, executive director of Ecology Action Center in Normal, said the Meta deal is not good for consumers, who are already seeing much higher prices for electricity.

“We’re looking at further price increases and perhaps shortages,” Brown said in an interview on WGLT’s Sound Ideas.

Brown said the expansion of AI will drive up energy demand to unsustainable levels.

“It is a game that is coming with significant costs to our local energy supply,” Brown said.

Utility company Ameren says about 14% of its energy for Illinois comes from nuclear power, 40% from natural gas, 27% from coal, 15% wind and 2% solar.

Brown said McLean County has been a strong adopter of wind and solar energy, which he hopes will continue to expand to meet future energy needs.

He mentioned Ecology Action Center has several initiatives that aim to boost solar production, including Grow Solar Bloomington-Normal and Community Solar.

Second reactor in Clinton?

It's not just Meta's AI that is driving demand. Gov. JB Pritzker is openly courting new data centers, which support IT infrastructure in several ways including storage, managing, processing, connectivity, security, and disaster recovery. All that takes significant amounts of electricity.

Emnett said renewable energy generating capacity will continue to grow as will energy storage options. He said Constellation believes there will be enough growth in demand for the company to consider building a second reactor at Clinton.

Back in the 1980s, then-owner Illinois Power Company received federal approval for a second reactor, but high costs associated with the first plant ended construction. It's possible some of those early permissions could be reused, he said, though it would take a years-long process to get Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval to proceed.

Emnett said it is unclear whether Constellation would want to build a reactor of a comparable capacity to the existing generator or a smaller one. It could depend on the needs of a dedicated customer.

Nuclear skeptics have pointed to huge cost overruns at a new large scale nuclear plant in Georgia, the first new plant in the nation since the 1980s. But Emnett said there has been a learning curve there by both the utility company and regulators who had to stand up review processes unused for decades. Emnett noted the second reactor in Georgia cost 30% less than the first to build.

He said there is no particular timeline for Constellation to decide on a second Dewitt County reactor.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07077cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4841x2542+0+955/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F7c%2F5cd8464a4bbdab4bb06331a3d2dc%2Fclintonnuclearpowerplant-bollinger59.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 13:20:13.985117

The agreement supports Meta’s clean energy objectives and regional operations by providing 1,121MW (1.12GW) of emissions-free nuclear energy.

From June 2027, the agreement backs the relicensing and ongoing operation of Constellation’s Clinton nuclear facility for an additional 20 years following the conclusion of the state’s ratepayer-funded zero emission credit (ZEC) programme.

The agreement will enhance Clinton’s clean energy production by 30MW through plant upgrades, safeguard 1,100 local jobs, generate $13.5m in annual tax revenue, and contribute $1m in donations to local nonprofits over five years.

Constellation CEO and president Joe Dominguez stated: “We are proud to partner with Meta because they asked that important question, and even better, they figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy. Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.”

The Clinton Clean Energy Center faced the threat of early closure in 2017 due to ongoing financial difficulties.

Its shutdown was averted by the Future Energy Jobs Act, which introduced a Zero Emission Credit (ZEC) programme to provide financial assistance to the plant until mid-2027.

Constellation’s agreement with Meta has now introduced a market-based solution that replaces the ZEC programme, ensuring the plant’s long-term operation without relying on ratepayer support.

This PPA allows the Clinton Clean Energy Center to continue supplying power to the local grid, thereby maintaining grid reliability and offering affordable energy to the region for years to come.

Meta’s purchase of the plant’s clean energy attributes aligns with the tech company’s goal to match 100% of its electricity consumption with renewable energy sources.

John Curtis, R-Utah, pushes to preserve clean energy tax credits and boost domestic energy production, the junior Utah senator is getting an assist from a well-known figure: Bill Gates.

Curtis met with Gates in the Beehive State last week as the pair toured Cape Station, a newly developed geothermal site run by energy company Fervo Energy in southwest Utah. The visit came at a crucial time: While Republicans look to enhance energy production, many federal tax credits incentivizing alternative resources are on the chopping block in President Donald Trump’s tax bill.

“Utah is at the forefront of energy innovation, and the Cape Station Geothermal project in Beaver is a powerful example of that progress,” Curtis said in a statement. “I believe America’s energy future can be affordable, reliable, and clean — and geothermal will be a critical part of making that vision a reality.""

Fervo Energy, a green energy supplier based in Houston, is pouring more than $2 billion into the rural Utah site for what is expected to become the world’s largest enhanced geothermal project. The undertaking is being backed by Breakthrough Energy, which was founded by Gates in 2015 to boost sustainable energy production.

“Enhanced geothermal is one of the most promising solutions for delivering reliable, low-carbon power, especially as demand for affordable energy grows,” Gates said in a press release. “Breakthrough Energy Ventures invested in Fervo early because we believed in this vision, and it’s exciting to see that potential becoming reality here in Utah.”

The geothermal site is expected to become fully operational by 2028 — although that timeline could be delayed if Republicans in Congress vote to repeal clean energy tax credits established by the Biden administration.

Without those subsidies, which incentivize clean energy production, completing the geothermal project could be punted to the next decade.

“The difference is, will we bring gigawatts on the grid this decade or will it be next decade?” Tim Lattimer, CEO and co-founder of Fervo Energy, told The Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report on the trip. “And that’s what the tax credits mean.”

Gates has long pushed for deeper investments in geothermal energy, arguing federal support is necessary to keep production costs affordable to produce the alternative energy source.

Much of that support comes from credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joe Biden’s signature clean energy bill.

The IRA created significant tax credits for renewable energy projects such as solar, wind and geothermal. These Investment Tax Credits are meant to incentivize households and businesses to install renewable energy systems by allowing them to deduct a percentage of the cost from federal taxes.

Cape Station has benefited from those tax credits, lowering its operational costs over the last two years since its inception.

However, some Republicans and conservative organizations argue the federal subsidies actually raise prices while reducing the reliability of power systems. As a result, several Republicans are pushing to repeal the law in full as part of Trump’s massive tax reconciliation package making its way through Congress.

Curtis is among those pushing to preserve some of those policies, particularly those dealing with nuclear energy, net-zero emissions, battery storage and geothermal. The first-term senator has long centered his climate policies on clean energy solutions, suggesting last week he will push for those changes as the Senate considers the bill.

Geothermal energy is a rare renewable energy source that has garnered bipartisan support over the last several years. Unlike wind and solar energy, which Republicans have often criticized as being unreliable, geothermal energy can generate constant power.

Most of the resources necessary to produce geothermal energy are located on federal land, prompting Republicans and Democrats to team up on legislation expanding access to those resources.

The Senate is set to vote on the reconciliation package in the coming weeks, with Republican leaders pushing to get the bill to Trump’s desk before the Fourth of July.",https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/33MBIVDD25BPVAKMENLFBBRXZY.jpg?focal=0%2C0&auth=5630fc5d25b8186bd65a8b0a9f939f0d9ee7a4269821a7fca335e27413cade71&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-06-04 13:20:24.342683

Meanwhile, the civilians have been trying to protect the environment, Grynchuk said.
Millions of Ukrainians lost access to water supply when Russian forces destroyed the Kakhovka dam in the Kherson region on 6 June 2023.
Kyiv attempted to restore the water supply to the people and industrial sites, but many consequences still remain unresolved, Grynchuk said.
Ukraine‘s environmental EU aspirations If it were not challenging enough to try to restore environmental losses under constant attacks, Kyiv also has to do so according to EU norms and regulations.","Since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s Ministry of Environmental Protection had to change its focus from managing the country’s natural resources and addressing climate change to tracking each case of the environment being deliberately attacked.

From February 2022 until today, Kyiv has registered and documented over 8,000 cases of Russia’s crimes against Ukraine’s environment, the country’s minister told Euronews.

“We call it crimes against the environment because there is pollution of water resources, destruction of water infrastructure, water supply infrastructure and soil pollution, soil mining and forest fires. All this is a result of Russia’s war”, Svitlana Grynchuk said.

Grynchuk told Euronews that Kyiv’s estimates of these 8,000 cases ""in monetary terms to (amount to) more than €85 billion"" — a figure that does not include the damage to the territories Russia currently occupies and therefore Ukraine cannot access.

These losses also do not yet include the most recent attack on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the damage to its safety confinement, Grynchuk noted.

“More than 45 countries have contributed throughout this period since the Chernobyl disaster. And only in 2017 we completed the construction of the new safe confinement for more than €1 billion, which was recently damaged in a Russian attack,” she explained.

A Russian drone hit the confinement over the fourth nuclear reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on February 14 2025. The drone exploded upon impact with the sarcophagus, causing a fire that took approximately three weeks to extinguish.

Grynchuk pointed out that while it is possible to rebuild and restore civilian infrastructure, resuscitating the environment will be much more difficult, as ""some ecosystems and some natural objects will not return to the pre-war original state.""

Environmental concerns in wartime

Dealing with daily Russian missile and drone attacks for three and a half years, Ukraine has been primarily focusing on air defence systems to protect civilians. Meanwhile, the civilians have been trying to protect the environment, Grynchuk said.

“You will not find a single Ukrainian who will tell you that it is not a priority now, because it is exactly during Russia’s war that we felt how important the natural resources are”, she pointed out.

This issue is of particular importance to those who have lost access to essential services, such as water.

Millions of Ukrainians lost access to water supply when Russian forces destroyed the Kakhovka dam in the Kherson region on 6 June 2023. Its reservoir supplied water to cool the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — the largest nuclear facility in Europe — and provided water for irrigation in southern Ukraine.

Kyiv attempted to restore the water supply to the people and industrial sites, but many consequences still remain unresolved, Grynchuk said.

“First of all, these are complex and expensive projects, and these are projects in regions that are constantly under attack,” she noted.

Ukraine‘s environmental EU aspirations

If it were not challenging enough to try to restore environmental losses under constant attacks, Kyiv also has to do so according to EU norms and regulations.

Ukraine is set to undergo a key environmental and climate screening with Brussels on 16 June, when Kyiv will have to demonstrate its alignment with EU legislation.

“This is the largest and most extensive screening process in terms of volume and duration, because it affects every sector of Ukraine's economy. This includes agriculture, infrastructure, healthcare, and education,” Grynchuk said.

Brussels previously stated that Ukraine is making steady progress towards the EU, particularly by demonstrating the highest screening rate in the history of enlargement. Grynchuk says environmental and climate protection aspects and sectors must be ready for European integration.

To demonstrate its commitment, Ukraine ensured that its recent minerals deal with the US aligns with Kyiv’s efforts to join the EU.

“The agreement clearly states that its implementation should take into account the principles and ambitions of Ukraine to join the European Union and should not contradict the rules and regulations that we have to follow”, Grynchuk said, explaining that the US deal will ultimately bring benefits for the EU as well.

“The supply chains of certain materials are highly dependent on imports from other countries. This is the same problem for both Europe and the US,"" she pointed out.

""That is why it is very important to replace elements in these supply chains with raw materials and elements that are produced in the European Union, in Ukraine, in friendly countries, in civilised countries.""

""This is primarily a matter of national security for the European Union and Ukraine, as well as for the United States,” Grynchuk concluded.",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/31/44/69/1200x675_cmsv2_68400d69-cedc-5da2-93e4-12d88f2f50e7-9314469.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 13:22:45.950745

Among these, turquoise hydrogen is gaining attention as a potential game-changer.
Produced through methane pyrolysis, turquoise hydrogen splits natural gas into hydrogen and solid carbon.
While still in early stages and not yet proven at scale, turquoise hydrogen combines the cleaner profile of green hydrogen with the efficiency of fossil-fuel-based methods.
Together, these two initiatives position Virginia Tech as a driving force in the effort to revitalize Appalachia through innovation in energy and sustainable economic development.","Virginia Tech is leading two major research initiatives aimed at transforming the economic and environmental future of the Appalachian region, thanks to nearly $9 million in new funding. With a $1.3 million grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and a $7.5 million award from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the university is launching high-impact projects that focus on hydrogen innovation and critical mineral resource development.

The first project, supported by the ARC, seeks to establish a hydrogen innovation hub in southwest Virginia by developing turquoise hydrogen—a clean energy source produced from methane without carbon dioxide emissions. Spearheaded by Sheima Khatib, PhD, associate professor of chemical engineering, the initiative uses catalytic methane decomposition to convert natural gas into hydrogen and solid carbon, turning an abundant regional resource into a pathway for clean energy production and economic diversification.

“We are utilizing natural gas, a relatively cleaner fossil fuel compared to oil, and converting it into hydrogen, which not only is a clean energy carrier but is also used as feedstock for manufacturing in many large-scale industrial processes,” Khatib said.

The Hydrogen Color Spectrum

Hydrogen may be colorless, but the energy industry uses a rainbow of labels to distinguish how it’s made—and how clean it is. Among these, turquoise hydrogen is gaining attention as a potential game-changer.

Produced through methane pyrolysis, turquoise hydrogen splits natural gas into hydrogen and solid carbon. Unlike grey hydrogen, which emits greenhouse gases; or blue hydrogen, which requires costly carbon capture; turquoise offers a middle path: it avoids CO₂ emissions entirely if powered by renewable energy and the carbon byproduct is permanently stored or repurposed.

While still in early stages and not yet proven at scale, turquoise hydrogen combines the cleaner profile of green hydrogen with the efficiency of fossil-fuel-based methods. If production methods become sustainable and cost-effective, it could play a key role in decarbonizing heavy industry and transportation.

Other hydrogen “colors” include green (from renewables), blue (with carbon capture), pink (from nuclear power), and brown or black (from coal—the dirtiest options). As technologies evolve, these hues help track progress toward a cleaner energy future.

Unlike conventional hydrogen production methods that generate carbon dioxide as a byproduct, Khatib’s process directly produces hydrogen and solid carbon, eliminating the need for energy-intensive gas separation. The resulting hydrogen is essential for applications ranging from fuel cells to industrial manufacturing, while the carbon byproduct has potential in advanced materials.

“While there are alternative methods used currently in industry to produce hydrogen, they often result in hydrogen mixed with other gases, including carbon dioxide, requiring expensive and energy intensive separation processes,” Khatib noted. “Our method eliminates this issue, representing a major advancement in producing clean hydrogen from an existing abundant resource.”

Beyond clean energy, the project emphasizes workforce development and community engagement. Amy Price Azano, PhD, a professor of rural education, is leading efforts to design K-12 educational modules and professional development programs for teachers, focusing on sustainable energy literacy.

“This grant provides a meaningful opportunity to support teachers as they develop place-based lessons designed to strengthen student learning and rural sustainability,” Azano said.

Industry collaboration is also key. Robert Hart, R&D leader at Shepherd Chemical Company, is heading economic feasibility studies and technology transfer efforts to bridge research with commercial application.

“Carbon doesn’t belong in the atmosphere. It belongs in high-value, durable materials that bring value to peoples’ lives,” Hart said. “Catalytic methane decomposition to make hydrogen and carbon needed a breakthrough to achieve this goal, and Professor Khatib’s team has found one.”

Virginia Tech’s second major effort focuses on mapping and developing critical mineral resources across the broader Appalachian region. Led by Richard Bishop, PhD, a professor of practice in the Department of Mining and Minerals Engineering, the $7.5 million Expand Appalachia CORE-CM project aims to identify unconventional sources of minerals vital for electronics, clean energy, and national security.

“We’re identifying critical minerals that can be recovered from unconventional resources,” Bishop said. “These critical minerals are essential for alternative energy applications, such as solar panels and electric vehicles, as well as for components in modern electronics like smartphones, batteries, and semiconductors.”

The project brings together more than a dozen partners—including universities, state geological surveys, and industry consultants—to analyze materials from legacy mines, coal basins, and other underutilized sources across 11 states. Workforce development, community engagement, and the creation of regional innovation centers are central to its long-term goals.

Nuclear power is having a moment, playing a central role in Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s plans and getting plenty of attention (and some support) from Big Data firms. There is good reason for this: nuclear offers clean, safe and highly reliable energy. So why are we not building dozens of reactors today? In part, the regulatory process is slow and unpredictable — both at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and through local reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, and nuclear development takes a long time and poses high investment risk.

But mostly, nuclear power is expensive, slow to build, and recent large reactor plants (like Vogtle in Georgia) have suffered from disastrous delays and cost overruns. Large-scale reactors in France, the UK and Finland have experienced similar problems, and the United States has plenty of other more compelling sources of energy. There is therefore little likelihood that large reactors will become fully competitive in the U.S., as large reactors are fundamentally not a strategic industry here: They create no upstream tiers of suppliers, will generate few jobs themselves and have little potential to create downstream users for whom nuclear power is critical — that energy could be replaced by many other sources if necessary (unlike chips for example, a key input into many other industries).

Small modular reactors could be different. SMRs are powered at 1 MW to 300 MW, instead of around 1,000 MW like traditional reactors. They are “modular,” meaning they can be stacked in different configurations depending on need, and they can be built either partially or entirely in factories, where economies of scale can potentially reduce costs by 10% to 15% each time production doubles. SMRs could become an important industry, and could have both upstream and downstream impacts. China and Russia are working hard to dominate this potentially significant industry. Hence the interest from data centers and others.

SMR investors face four core risks: technological risks — new designs may not pan out, or competing energy sources could suddenly become better or cheaper (as solar and gas have done); market risks — on the demand side, we don’t know whether the projected boom in energy demand is going to last, or even occur at all, or whether nuclear’s advantages will really matter; on the supply side, we don’t know if fuel will be readily available or whether plants can be built on time and on budget; regulatory risks — the pathway to approval for new nuclear designs is currently unpredictable, even though the NRC is working to improve it. International coordination, meanwhile, remains in its infancy; and political risks — nuclear needs bipartisan support because builds take so long, and development depends heavily on government backing. Sudden shifts in strategy would be disastrous.

Since nuclear takes such a long time to develop and deploy, these risks are magnified. TerraPower (a nuclear startup) was founded with funding from Bill Gates in 2006, and it still hasn’t delivered its first commercial reactor and won’t operate at scale until the mid-2030s. It takes companies a long time to move their technologies across the four basic stages of technological development and deployment:

Basic and applied research, where early-stage funding is key, as investors will avoid projects that are many years away from the market. Expertise — in the form of support from national labs — and, where possible, shared facilities will also be needed, along with sustained funding.

Development (also known as the ""valley of death""), the stage after research funding runs out but before deployment funding becomes available. This phase remains a critical bottleneck in the nuclear innovation chain.

Initial deployment, which is currently supported by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. While OCED has suffered from misguided congressional mandates to support technologies not yet market-ready (e.g., clean hydrogen), it can still play a critical role. The office needs reform — not elimination.

Scaleup, which has historically been left to the market, although achieving scale is both essential and difficult. Funding from the Loan Programs Office, focused on scaleup, costs the government little or nothing. It too requires reform, not elimination, and other mechanisms to de-risk deployment will be needed as well.

Governments across the globe (including the U.S.) have helped fund and develop SMRs across the whole development cycle. This range of support is important: basic and applied research help through National Labs matters just as much as commercial demonstration funding or loans for scaleup from the LPO. Taken as a whole, the varied supports it has already provided is substantial, but now we need to forge them into a coherent, consistent, bipartisan strategy that addresses all of the four fundamental stages of industry development and supports SMRs to the point where they reach price/performance parity with fossil fuels.

Today, no federal government capacity exists to implement and then enforce either strategic choices about which nuclear pathways to follow, or more specifically a strategy for SMRs. Different DOE components (and other agencies) operate in their own silos, but effective long-term development of SMRs requires a more coordinated approach. That must include strategic direction from the Office of the Secretary of DOE aligned with clearly defined White House support, and covering many agencies including DOE, NRC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Defense, the Environmental Protection Agency, Commerce and State. Accelerated reform at NRC and FERC needs to be part of that strategy.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/PxQ6-z9e8llYNae8IrAm6t8c-rxRT7gPNpyyRZodPhY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjA3OTQ2NjMxLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-04 13:20:54.951298

Meta and energy company Constellation announced the deal today, which helps the plant expand its operations while Meta uses it to try to shrink its carbon footprint. It’s the latest in a flood of recent partnerships between Big Tech and the nuclear energy industry, and part of a larger strategy Meta has in the works to bring more nuclear reactors online that can power AI data centers.

The plant, called the Clinton Clean Energy Center, is in Illinois and was initially slated to close in 2017 “after years of financial losses,” according to Constellation. A tax credit that the state established for carbon pollution-free energy allowed the plant to keep running, but only until 2027. Meta is stepping in to provide some financial security beyond that date, although it declined to disclose the amount it’s spending on the deal.

It’s the latest in a flood of recent partnerships between Big Tech and the nuclear energy industry

It’s apparently enough money to help the plant carry out updates that will increase its energy output by 30 megawatts, for a total capacity of 1,121MW. For comparison, the first offshore wind farm in the US — albeit a small operation with just 5 turbines off the coast of Rhode Island — has a 30MW capacity and can generate enough electricity for 17,000 homes.

Keeping the Clinton power plant open is also supposed to save 1,100 local jobs and generate enough electricity for 800,000 homes. It was first licensed in 1987, and Constellation applied last year to renew its license through 2047.

This is Meta’s first power purchase agreement for nuclear energy, the kind of deal companies often strike with renewable energy projects to try to cancel out the impact their greenhouse gas emissions have on the climate. The plant generates electricity and so-called “clean energy attributes” that are like certificates representing the environmental benefits of generating carbon-free energy. The extra income stream from such certificates is supposed to incentivize the buildout of more clean energy, reducing power grid emissions in the long-run — although the real-world benefits are often overblown.

Meta is purchasing an undisclosed amount of those attributes to match a portion of its electricity use. The company has a goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. But its latest sustainability report shows that the company’s carbon footprint has actually grown since 2019 as it focuses more on AI.

Google and Microsoft have also seen their emissions rise with growing energy demand from AI. Meta faces pushback over plans to build its biggest data center yet in Louisiana. The local utility there has proposed building out three new gas plants to support that data center.

The tension between meeting AI energy needs and the impact that has on power grids and the environment has helped to revitalize the nuclear power industry in the US. Microsoft announced a deal with Constellation last year that’s supposed to bring a shuttered Three Mile Island reactor back online.

Meta also followed Amazon and Google in supporting the development of next-generation reactor technology. It put out a request for proposals for nuclear projects that would add 1,000-4,000MW of new generation capacity in the US by the early 2030s. Meta says that effort is ongoing, and that it’s in “final discussions” with a shortlist of projects after receiving more than 50 proposals. Constellation says it’s also considering developing an advanced nuclear reactor at the Clinton site.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/STK043_VRG_Illo_N_Barclay_1_Meta.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-06-04 11:08:14.013814

The program is authorized by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia had previously submitted plans to the United States Department of Justice for FYs 2022 through 2025.

The Federal Highway Administration is stated to have previously issued a Memorandum which announced the cancellation of all previously issued guidance for the NEVI Formula Program and the suspension of all state plans previously submitted under the Program. Until new guidance is issued, and new state plans are submitted and approved, it is alleged that no new obligations for the Program can be incurred. However, expenditures pursuant to existing project agreements are stated to be able to continue.

Sierra Club alleges that what they characterize as an “indefinite freeze” of NEVI funds is unlawful. Further, it is alleged that:

The investment with Meta will also expand the output of a Constellation Energy Illinois nuclear plant.

The agreement announced Tuesday is just the latest in a string of tech-nuclear partnerships as the use of AI expands. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed.

Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center was actually slated to close in 2017 after years of financial losses but was saved by legislation in Illinois establishing a zero-emission credit program to support the plant into 2027. The agreement deal takes effect in June of 2027, when the state's taxpayer funded zero-emission credit program expires.

With the arrival of Meta, Clinton's clean energy output will expand by 30 megawatts, preserve 1,100 local jobs and bring in $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the companies. The plant currently powers the equivalent of about 800,000 U.S. homes. George Gross, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois. estimates that 30 additional megawatts would be enough to power a city with about 30,00 residents for one year.

""Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,"" said Urvi Parekh, Meta's head of global energy.

Surging investments in small nuclear reactors comes at a time when large tech companies are facing two major demands: a need to increase their energy supply for AI and data centers, among other needs, while also trying to meet their long-term goals to significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Constellation, the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, said in September that it planned to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft could secure power to supply its data centers. Three Mile Island, located on the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of the nation's worst commercial nuclear power accident in 1979.

Also last fall, Amazon said it was investing in small nuclear reactors, two days after a similar announcement by Google. Additionally, Google announced last month that it was investing in three advanced nuclear energy projects with Elementl Power.

U.S. states have been positioning themselves to meet the tech industry's power needs as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and gutting regulatory obstacles.

Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy, and lawmakers this year have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, according to the trade association Nuclear Energy Institute.

Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government's regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms.

Still, it's unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production within the next 25 years, like the White House wants. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

Additionally, Gross recommends that the U.S. invest more in the transmission grid that moves that power around.

""That's my biggest concern,"" Gross said, adding that spending on the grid has actually fallen off in recent years, despite the voracious demand for energy.

Amazon, Google and Microsoft also have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions.

This is the latest investment for the MMV Climate Technology Fund. Crux sits at the nexus of two of our fund’s focus areas — climate intelligence and clean power.

Macro Trends

The Surge in Power Demand. For the first time in decades, the US is experiencing a spike in power demand driven by new data centers, electrification, and manufacturing. Over 90 percent of new power capacity added to the US grid in 2024 came from renewables, with over 80 percent from solar and storage projects. This trend is expected to continue, given that renewables projects make up the vast majority of projects in interconnection queues. For US power supply to keep pace with rising demand, it will be critical to accelerate the construction of renewables and storage projects — an effort that will require more efficient and scalable financing mechanisms.

The Drive for Domestic Manufacturing. The push to re-shore critical supply chains and revitalize US manufacturing has gained bipartisan momentum in recent years. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021) and the CHIPS and Science Act (2022) reflect the growing consensus that domestic manufacturing is a national security priority. While there are differences in how policy makers prioritize sectors, there is broad alignment on the need to encourage capital investment toward US-based production of semiconductors, batteries, critical minerals, and other strategic technologies.

Financing for Clean Energy and Manufacturing Projects. Despite strong macroeconomic and policy tailwinds, many developers and manufacturers struggle to access capital efficiently. The issue is not a lack of capital — there’s an estimated $1 trillion in energy transition infrastructure dry powder waiting to be deployed. The real challenge is inefficiency in the form of high transaction costs, fragmented markets, and opaque diligence processes that can delay execution and inflate budgets. Unlocking this capital at scale will require innovation in financial tools and platforms that streamline deployment and reduce friction across the project lifecycle — especially as the policy landscape continues to evolve.

The Role of Federal Tax Policy. For over 40 years, the US federal tax code has supported tax equity investing — generally defined as partnerships between tax inefficient project developers and tax efficient corporations. The trend, which started in real estate and expanded to energy in the 2000s, has been a consistent feature during both Republican and Democratic administrations. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) broadened the scope of tax equity by creating new credits for energy storage, nuclear, hydrogen, biogas and advanced manufacturing, while also allowing for transferability, making it possible for project developers to sell their credits directly to third parties for cash for the first time. These changes to the tax code effectively doubled the size of the tax equity market and had a significant economic impact across the country, generating ~$131 billion of private sector investment across 379 projects in 42 states, and creating 117k jobs in 2023–24. As many analysts have pointed out, most of the economic benefits of these projects have occurred in Republican-controlled congressional districts.

Currently, the Trump Administration and Congressional Leadership are focused on extending the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (2017), while balancing concerns about the federal budget deficit and other priorities. Through this process, the details of IRA specific tax credits will change. We expect that the federal government will continue to use parts of the tax code to encourage private investment in selected areas of power generation, critical infrastructure, and domestic manufacturing. Regardless of how specific credits are reshaped, project developers and manufacturers will continue to seek efficient access to capital. That is where Crux comes in.

Why We Invested in Crux

Crux launched in 2023 to address the opportunity of transferability of tax credits (TTC). Crux built the leading platform, bringing transparency, price discovery, and scale to this new market. In just two years, they facilitated over 70 deals, unlocking billions in clean energy investments. This year, Crux expanded into infrastructure debt, a natural complement to their core platform. The infrastructure debt market is ~10x the size of the TTC market and is ripe for modernization. The Crux debt platform is gaining momentum and has positioned the company to support project developers across the financing lifecycle.

Since launching our Climate Technology Fund, we have spent time with many entrepreneurs creating solutions for renewable developers. Those conversations have given us a deep appreciation for the need to reduce project soft costs — the transaction costs, legal fees, diligence timelines, and administrative burdens that inflate budgets and slow projects down. As hardware costs have fallen, soft costs have grown to account for 40–70% of total renewable project costs. Crux reduces financial soft costs by streamlining transactions and introducing transparency into what had previously been complex, opaque processes. Crux stood out for their leading position in the TTC market and their ability to scale horizontally and provide additional financial solutions to both project developers and investors. As a transactions hub, Crux sits on a massive amount of data and can leverage LLMs across the full project finance lifecycle, further improving deal efficiency. For example, they are currently working on embedding artificial intelligence workflows into the platform to accelerate contracting and diligence, without sacrificing quality.

We’re excited to be backing a standout team building this platform. Crux’s founders, Alfred Johnson and Allen Kramer, are experienced entrepreneurs who bring a unique blend of experience across policy, software, and project finance. They’ve recruited a high-caliber team of experts from across the energy, finance, and technology sectors. Recent hires include Yonette Chung McLean, a veteran of the industry with over 20 years of experience at RBC; Andrew Hsiung, formerly of Blackrock and Carlyle Group; and Hasan Nazar, former head of federal policy at Tesla.

At MassMutual Ventures, we invest in transformative technologies that address the most pressing challenges in climate and energy. By leveraging market data and AI to accelerate the development of renewables, storage, mining, and manufacturing, Crux sits at the intersection of two of our priority investment themes — climate intelligence and clean power. Our unique relationship with our sole LP, MassMutual, enabled us to quickly build perspective and conviction in Crux. MassMutual’s expertise in corporate tax, its partnerships with project developers Low Carbon and Counterpointe, and its relationship with Barings, an expert in infrastructure debt, helped us to appreciate the potential of the Crux platform. We look forward to leveraging our expertise and connections to support the company in the next stage of its development.",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*KBaOxPf2xkappA25Sw1vLQ.jpeg,N,,2025-06-04 13:20:38.698113

Ethanol has become a key part of America’s energy strategy. Initially used in vehicles in the 1920s, ethanol demand grew in the early 2000s due to oil import concerns and environmental issues with gasoline additives. In 2007, a major energy act set goals for renewable fuel, boosting ethanol’s growth.

By 2024, the US produced 16 billion gallons of ethanol, with Iowa leading in production. Most gasoline in the country contains 10% ethanol (E10), and special vehicles can use up to 85% ethanol (E85). Canada is the largest importer of US ethanol, receiving nearly half of US exports.

Although the number of ethanol plants peaked in 2011, production has increased due to technology and efficiency. Farmers now grow more corn per acre, and plants produce more ethanol from each bushel. One example is POET’s plant in Missouri, which improved output from 50 to 80 million gallons in just over a decade.

Direct federal subsidies for ethanol ended in 2011, but some tax incentives remain. States like Missouri offer credits for blending ethanol, supporting production indirectly.

The US mainly uses corn for ethanol, while Brazil uses sugarcane but is now investing in corn ethanol too. Cellulosic ethanol, made from plant waste, remains limited due to high costs, but new projects are exploring its potential.

Modern ethanol plants make more than fuel. They also produce animal feed, corn oil, dry ice, and electricity, improving their economic value.

In 2023, the ethanol industry supported 72,400 direct jobs and over 322,000 indirect jobs in the US. It generated $32.5 billion in income and added $54.2 billion to the GDP, proving its strong impact on rural America.

Jared Polis and legislative leaders, Colorado has built a strong reputation for advancing innovative solutions to support affordable clean energy.

In 2004, Colorado became the first state in the nation to pass a renewable portfolio standard by popular vote. More recently, the legislature last year passed Senate Bill 218, a first-of-its-kind law to modernize Colorado’s electricity grid through smart distribution system planning and the use of virtual power plants, making it easier and more affordable for consumers to connect advanced energy resources, like rooftop solar and electric vehicles, to the grid.

To preserve Colorado’s leadership in the clean energy transition, we must take additional steps to make our electricity grid work even better, starting now, by using proven technologies that help our grid operate more efficiently and planning smartly for the long term. Updating our grid is critical for keeping energy affordable and reliable, managing new energy demand from data centers, and unleashing even more clean energy in Colorado.

For several reasons, the 2025 legislative session stood apart from previous years and underscores why this urgency is needed. Faced with new complexity in the state’s energy landscape, budget constraints, uncertainty and looming funding freezes at the federal level, lawmakers had to make tough decisions. Though this year was an outlier, understandably so, important policies that would have accelerated clean energy deployment, improved energy affordability, and advanced timely grid upgrades failed to move forward.

Coloradans now face overlapping challenges of rising energy costs, grid reliability concerns and an outdated electricity system. Without action from state leaders, these risks will compound and increase the chances of not meeting our energy needs, ultimately costing us more in the long run.

We’ve come too far to stall now, and the stakes are high. All corners of Colorado’s government must stand together with a shared clarity of vision and urgency of purpose to meet these challenges — and unrealized opportunities — head-on.

To remain a leader for years to come, Colorado must double down on modernizing our electricity grid, starting with near-term actions that ensure we continue down the right path. One step we can take is to upgrade our existing electricity grid using advanced transmission technologies, or ATTs, which can double the capacity of existing electricity lines.

These technologies relieve grid congestion, reduce costs and deliver clean power to homes and businesses more efficiently. Deploying these technologies would make it easier to keep the lights on, all without having to wait decades for new electricity lines to be built.

ATTs are a no-regrets solution, as these technologies deliver nearly immediate benefits while laying the groundwork for more robust and resilient energy infrastructure. These technologies are key for rural regions, including the San Luis Valley, where the economic potential of solar and wind projects are currently limited by transmission bottlenecks. ATTs can unlock this potential without delay and at a fraction of the cost of building new infrastructure, which is also needed.

At the same time, Colorado must plan ahead if we are to reach the governor’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040. The legislature can do its part to provide a North Star for getting there by codifying this target into law, while requiring a comprehensive approach that enables better planning processes that build more wind, solar, energy storage, geothermal and other zero-carbon resources in coordination with the transmission infrastructure to deliver that power where it’s needed.

This means leveling up the state’s framework for how we proactively plan for new energy projects and grid updates simultaneously, preparing for big increases in electricity demand from data centers, and supporting bringing new, diverse advanced energy resources online.

Maintaining Colorado’s clean energy leadership also means continuing to push forward new, innovative solutions.

One of the biggest emerging opportunities Colorado can lead on is coordinated gas-electric system planning. This innovative approach would allow the state to evaluate gas and electric infrastructure together, preventing wasteful spending and leveraging data to better guide decisions on building out infrastructure that maximizes reliability and affordability.

With thoughtful leadership, Colorado can again lead and plan an energy system that works more efficiently, costs less and can benefit everyone.

The good news is that Colorado doesn’t need to start from scratch — we already have robust and well-vetted ideas in place that will enable an affordable and smart clean energy transition. What we need is strong political will and leaders to follow through on the promises we’ve made to ensure households, businesses and communities across the state are able to receive clean, affordable and reliable energy.

Ford's employee pricing helped the sales volume as did consumers wanting to get ahead of future price hikes.

Ford Motor Co. reported sales gains in May as its employee pricing program continues and consumers looked to get ahead of future tariff-driven price hikes.

A year-over-year 16.3% gain in Ford's monthly sales allowed some on Wall Street to exhale even though the road ahead remains uncertain.

""The monthly sales were better than feared and is a small step in the right direction,"" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, told the Detroit Free Press on June 3. But there's ""still a lot of wood to chop ahead for (CEO) Jim Farley and Ford with tariffs and demand issues.""

For the month, Ford reported total sales rose 16.3% to 220,959 vehicles sold compared with the year-ago period. Sales of its SUVs surged 25% when compared with May 2024 to 94,595 SUVs sold. Sales of pickups rose 11.2% to 121,354 units sold. But sales of Ford's electric vehicles plunged 25% to 6,723 EVs sold as overall consumer demand for EVs has slowed. Ford's F-150 Lightning EV sold just 1,902, a 42% decline, which also brought down the segment.

Ford's luxury brand, Lincoln, reported a 39% increase in sales to 11,573 vehicles sold.

Year to date, Ford Motor's total sales are up 6.1% to 930,925 vehicles sold compared with the first five months of 2024. Of the Detroit-based automakers, only Ford reports monthly sales.

'Momentum in Dearborn'

The automaker has been offering employee pricing to all U.S. customers since April 3. Analysts said the program, which runs to July 6, is driving volume. Also, there are car buyers who want to get ahead of possible price increases if President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and parts stick.

""In terms of straight up sales volumes, Ford has been gaining momentum in 2025 — the brand grabbed sales gains in February, March, April and now May; volume in May was the best in more than five years,"" Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive, told the Free Press. ""In Dearborn, the marketing team is likely celebrating their new American Made campaign, which may well be driving sales.""

Since January, Ford has continually beat the drum in the media about how it is the most ""American"" car company of all with 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States also being assembled here.

""There's no denying Ford's success this spring,"" Chesbrough said. ""Smart pricing, good product, the right marketing campaign — it's all come together for them recently. There is definitely momentum in Dearborn right now.""

Ford sales helped by discounts

Ford's employee pricing program isn't just appealing to one type of buyer either, considering that many vehicles across the board and at an array of price points all saw sales gains, said Ivan Drury, director of Insights at Edmunds.com.

For example, sales of the the 2025 Ford Escape, which starts at $28,150, soared by 24% to 17,395 sold in May. Likewise, the 2025 Ford Explorer, which starts at $40,050, saw its sales surge to 20,504 units, a 23% gain compared with May 2024.

""The messaging didn't just resonate with the super budget conscious buyer,"" Drury said. ""Also, last I recall, Ford had some of the most bloated inventories with vehicle lot times still in the 80-plus days range until being sold; therefore, this is certainly helping dealers get some dusty vehicles off the lot.""

Drury said Ford's strong monthly sales, however, are not indicative of what is to come for the rest of the year given that Ford announced future price hikes.

""But that, too, could be playing into the psyche of buyers who are watching the market,"" Drury said. ""Pull ahead sales, why wait when you know you're staring at a higher price in the future?""

Average prices remain strong

In early May, Ford hiked the prices on three of its Mexico-produced models, becoming one of the first major automakers to adjust sticker prices in response to Trump's tariffs. Prices on the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pickup and Bronco Sport rose by as much as $2,000 on some models.

Still, in May, Ford sold 4,724 Mach-E EVs, an 11% gain compared with the year-ago period. May sales of the Maverick rose 14% to 15,508 units sold and sales of the Bronco Sport surged to 14,472, a 46% increase.

Ford said in its first-quarter earnings last month that Trump's trade war would add about $1.5 billion in net costs for 2025. Last week, Ford Chair John Lawler said the automaker will adjust its operations and footprint over the next 12 to 24 months to find ways to mitigate the costs of tariffs.

Despite the employee pricing program, Drury said Ford's prices have held up. The average transaction price across Ford and Lincoln in May was $54,314, with an average discount of $3,962. That compares with April, when the average transaction price was $53,398, with a discount of $3,792 and March when it was $53,909 and a discount of $2,481.

""The mix of pricier vehicles is holding up the average despite the deeper discount,"" Drury said.

Looking for a slowdown

Still, Morningstar's auto analyst David Whiston said carmakers' sales provide little insight into the health of their overall operations.

""The sales chart itself only tells you so much because it tells you nothing on pricing/incentives,"" Whiston said. ""Pricing likely was not as good as it could have been due to employee pricing. Light truck numbers looked great, new Navigator did well, and (hybrid) won out over (all electric).""

Whiston noted how the the publicly traded auto dealership companies were optimistic in their first quarter earnings that new car sales and pricing would remain solid for the rest of the year. He is more skeptical.

""I think they’ll be a bit of a slowdown but not a crash,"" Whiston said.",https://www.freep.com/gcdn/-mm-/fbf42a3b90352e01f7edbf9e545429a747136417/c=63-0-2937-1624/local/-/media/2017/06/16/DetroitFreeP/DetroitFreePress/636332225367594902-GTY-683854832.jpg?width=2874&height=1624&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,N,,2025-06-04 13:22:08.960347

A nationwide study of gas leak incidents, published in Risk Analysis, has revealed that gas leaks in one state have measurable impacts on neighboring states.
Stringent environmental regulations are shown to reduce hazardous gas leaks and improve safety.
So, even if your state is doing everything right, gas leaks in neighboring states can still worsen your air quality.""","In March 2022, 14 residents of a four-story apartment building in Silver Spring, Maryland, were hospitalized when a gas leak from a cut pipeline caused a major explosion. Every year in the United States, there are hundreds of natural gas (or methane) pipeline leaks—caused by corrosion, equipment malfunctions, and construction activities. Methane leaks are not only dangerous; they contribute to air pollution and climate change.

A nationwide study of gas leak incidents, published in Risk Analysis, has revealed that gas leaks in one state have measurable impacts on neighboring states. For example, gas leaks in Texas, a state with extensive pipeline infrastructure and frequent incidents, were found to raise levels of PM2.5 in neighboring states like Oklahoma and Louisiana.

""Pollutants like methane and its by-products (PM2.5) travel across state borders,"" says Younes Ben Zaied, co-author of the study and professor of finance and sustainability at EDC Paris Business School.

He and colleagues used spatial econometric modeling to analyze the impacts of gas leak incidents from 2009 to 2019 in all 50 states, recorded by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA).

Included in that database are the 2015–2016 Aliso Canyon Leak in California (one of the largest methane leaks in U.S. history); the 2018 Merrimack Valley Explosions in Massachusetts, which impacted over 40 homes; and numerous New York City underground leaks.

Other data used in the analysis were annual average PM2.5 concentrations (for every state) over the same 10-year period from the Social Economic Data and Application Center (SEDAC) at Columbia University's International Earth Science Information Network Center (CIESIN).

The results demonstrate that PM2.5 levels in a state are influenced by the energy intensity of neighboring states. For example, Illinois has moderate energy use per GDP but is surrounded by states like Indiana and Kentucky, which rely more heavily on coal and fossil fuels. This means that PM2.5 levels in Illinois can be partially explained by the energy consumption patterns of its neighbors.

Stringent environmental regulations are shown to reduce hazardous gas leaks and improve safety. Examples of high-performing states are California, New York, and Massachusetts. These states had lower reported leak incidents over time, higher pollution control investment per unit of industrial output, and beneficial spillover effects on neighboring regions, encouraging cleaner practices.

""We were surprised to find that even states with strong environmental regulations and cleaner energy practices are still affected by the energy intensity of nearby states,"" says Zaied.

""For example, an energy-efficient state with low energy consumption per GDP may still suffer from elevated PM2.5 levels if neighboring states are energy-intensive and leak-prone. So, even if your state is doing everything right, gas leaks in neighboring states can still worsen your air quality.""

The message, adds Zaied, is that ""cleaner air and safer infrastructure require interstate collaboration, not just local solutions.""",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2023/natural-gas-pipeline.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 13:22:48.709768

The role of infrastructure and water-wise design in helping Lethbridge adapt to climate change was the focus of a special session of the Southern Alberta Council on Public Affairs on Tuesday, part of a two-day wellness event the LSCO is hosting.

Environment Lethbridge executive director Kathleen Sheppard and the organization’s urban watershed ambassador, Amber Murray, discussed efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change through various methods on both a community-wide and individual scale.

The strategic priorities of Environment Lethbridge include waste reduction, climate action, green neighbourhoods and water conservation.

Key risks identified in the City’s climate adaptation strategy and action plan, the audience heard, include extreme heat and increased drought.

“Lethbridge, like every other community on the planet, is currently facing the impacts of climate change and when it comes to those impacts in Lethbridge, we’re looking at a couple of key climate risks that will be increasing,” said Sheppard.

One of those risks is the city becoming hotter in summer and with that heat, Lethbridge will also get drier, meaning more droughts, Sheppard said.

“How we respond as a community we need to look at ways we can conserve water, in particular, not just today and for the summer, but for the long term,” which is how the Living Cities project of Environment Lethbridge comes into the picture, noted Sheppard.

Over the past 18 months, the City has completed two documents highlighting priorities, including the climate adaptation and action plan as well as a water conservation plan.

A living city utilizes green infrastructure, such as the use of natural vegetation, to replace or mimic grey infrastructure, which is things made out of rock and cement, said Sheppard.

When looking at green infrastructure, three criteria come into play including whether it’s available to everyone in the community, abundant and whether it’s thriving, Sheppard said.

It encompasses a range of projects including parkland such as the river valley but also urban forests. Sheppard noted all the city’s trees above the river bottom were planted, so “managing that urban forest and making sure it lasts into the future is a really important aspect of green infrastructure.”

Ways to manage storm water without using concrete is also part of the concept through the use of permeable pavement, rain gardens and natural ponds.

Community gardens, green roofs and green walls are also strategies.

Community planting projects that have been undertaken are at Fleetwood Bawden School, Winston Churchill High School and Tartan Park.

Storm ponds such as found at Sunridge and Firelight ponds use natural vegetation to control water and provide natural habitat while floating islands have been created in ponds at parks such as Canyoncrest and Coulee Creek to help improve quality of water.

A project being undertaken through next spring is focused on supporting homeowners who want to improve outdoor water conservation in their own yards, said Murray. She pointed out it’s difficult to change over from Kentucky blue grass turf because if the root isn’t removed, the grass will grow back as soon as water hits.

Murray’s focus moving forward will be on offering education, support, facilitation and community outreach for those who want to build a resilient lawn here.

Resiliency, said Murray, means not only using less water but being less reliant on it.

Murray noted if people plan a landscape that includes water-wise plants and mulch, they will be almost impervious to drought.

Water-wise landscape design involves several factors, with the first being small, gradual change, said Murray. Ripping out a large portion of turf and putting in a new garden is heavy on water and soil amendments, not to mention the energy of the people doing the work.

“So it’s better to make a five-year plan if you’re doing a large landscape and build in tiers,” added Murray.

Turf is tricky, and ways exist to transform a Kentucky blue grass lawn which either involves a lot of work, or patience. or both, Murray said.

Only a couple of times a year can people change out a lawn: spring and late fall. It can’t be done in mid-summer because turf needs lower temperatures to germinate. But people can start on a patchy lawn by raking and constantly over-seeding with native varieties, including micro-clovers, Dutch clovers, wildflower ground cover and native fescues which will almost make a garden type of turf, Murray said.

The best water-wise design of turf is to use it as a pathway or a sitting area in the shade because it will require virtually no maintenance, she added.

Water capture is the future of backyard gardening with North America being far behind Australia and Europe. That means using rain barrels and turf hydration as well as hardy perennial hydration. Turf only needs a half inch of water a week to stay green, Murray said. If people want to keep lawns green, they should mow them high and put a frisbee under a sprinkler. When it fills up, that’s a half inch, Murray said.

And people should never water in the sun, Murray added.

THE TOP FIVE

1. White House takes aim at climate programs in rescission package

The White House on Tuesday formally asked Congress to rescind $9.4 billion in federal funds to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency’s spending cuts. The 24-page proposal includes clawing back $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds PBS and NPR, as well as $8.3 billion from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the African Development Foundation. Congress has 45 days to pass the measure.

Of particular note to Heatmap readers is the proposed recission of $1.7 billion of the $3.6 billion appropriated for the Economic Support Fund which, in the words of the State Department, “promotes the economic and political foreign policy interests of the United States by providing assistance to allies and countries in transition to democracy.” That has historically included working with partners to mitigate the impacts of climate change, although the White House said it aims to “refocus remaining resources on activities that align with an America First foreign policy.” Similarly, the White House asked Congress to rescind $125 million from the Clean Technology Fund, which provides financial resources for developing countries to invest in clean energy projects, arguing that it does “not reflect America’s values or put the American people first.” The White House also asked Congress to pull the full $460 million appropriated to Assistance for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia, which, it argued, has become a “mechanism for funding wasteful programs, including … climate programming.”

2. Constellation, Meta sign 20-year Illinois nuclear deal

Facebook and Instagram’s parent company, Meta, has agreed to a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to purchase the output of its Clinton Clean Energy Center, an Illinois-based nuclear plant. The deal, which begins in June 2027, includes a power purchase agreement that will entitle Meta to roughly 1.1 gigawatts of energy from the plant’s single nuclear reactor. It also allows the company to “buy the clean attributes of the nuclear-power generation to offset its less-green electricity use elsewhere” — including powering natural gas-reliant data centers in other parts of the country, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Though the financial terms weren’t disclosed, Constellation Chief Executive Joe Dominguez said, “It’s billions of dollars of capital that you’re signing up for to run a plant for 20 more years.” Meta will support the continued operation of the plant as well as upgrades and relicensing, which will prevent the facility’s premature closure, the companies said.

3. California Supreme Court to hear solar rate challenge

The California Supreme Court will hear arguments today brought by environmental groups in a lawsuit against the California Public Utility Commission for slashing the credits customers receive for selling electricity generated by rooftop solar back to the grid. The new financial structure, called NEM 3, went into effect in 2023, and in some cases cut credits by 80%. This has “stymied efforts to expand rooftop solar in the state, particularly in communities of color and low-income neighborhoods and led to huge layoffs in the solar industry,” Solar Power World explains. NEM 3 encouraged customers to use battery storage systems with their rooftop solar installations, a move viewed as friendlier to California utilities.

The Center for Biological Diversity, the Environmental Working Group, and the San Diego-based Protect Our Communities Foundation attempted to overturn NEM 3 after it went into effect, bringing their case to the California Court of Appeals, which ultimately upheld CPUC’s decision, leading to the California Supreme Court case. “It’s a fight that’s likely to continue, given that the Supreme Court appears poised to rule narrowly — and perhaps not even on the policy debate itself,” Politico’s California Climate newsletter notes.

4. Texas lifts boycott of BlackRock after it backs off climate action

Texas has removed BlackRock from a list of firms the state says “boycott” the fossil fuel industry, thereby allowing public agencies and pension funds to once again hire the firm, invest in its funds, and purchase shares of the asset manager, Bloomberg reports. State Comptroller Glenn Hegar specifically cited BlackRock’s retreat from climate action as influencing the decision.

BlackRock was first placed on the Texas divestment list in 2022 due to its involvement in the Climate Action 100+ initiative to reduce corporate greenhouse gas emissions, as well as Net Zero Asset Managers. Since then, BlackRock has removed itself from both programs. “We never set out to punish any of these firms, and the hope was always that any firm we included on the list would eventually take steps to ensure they were removed,” Hegar said in his remarks.

5. National Weather Service looks to hire new forecasters after mass layoffs

The National Weather Service is looking to hire back 125 meteorologists and specialists to its understaffed forecast offices, some of which have ceased around-the-clock monitoring and weather balloon launches due to lack of personnel, CNN reports. The move follows the NWS losing more than 560 employees this year due to the Trump administration’s efficiency cuts and early retirement offers, and functionally means lifting the federal hiring freeze for the agency so it can bolster its workforce heading into the fire, drought, extreme heat, and hurricane seasons. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is also looking to transfer 155 employees from better-staffed offices to “critical” positions at sparser offices, CNN adds.

But as I’ve reported, it is not so simple to restaff federal agencies after major layoffs. In addition to the deep staffing shortages that preceded and were exacerbated by Trump’s layoffs, the government has also damaged the appeal of working in the public sector. Most people don’t want to work for the government for the paycheck, Don Moynihan, a professor at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, told me last month, but rather for the “opportunity to do meaningful work, and for job stability and security” — both of which have been damaged by the administration’s ongoing hostility toward federal workers.

According to Constellation, the new agreement will essentially replace the ZEC program, and will also add 30 MW of capacity through plant uprates.
The agreement follows a deal last year between Constellation and Microsoft enabling the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania.
Earlier this year, Meta, alongside companies including its tech giant peers Amazon and Google signed a pledge to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050.
Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta, said: “Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions.","Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp owner Meta announced that it has signed a new agreement with Constellation Energy, extending the life of a nuclear energy facility in Illinois for 20 years, with its 1.1 GW of output supporting Meta’s operations in the region, as well as the company’s clean energy goals.

The new agreement, beginning in June 2027, will allow Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in DeWitt County, Illinois to be relicensed and to continue operating for another 20 years. The site entered commercial service in 1987, and was slated for premature closure in 2017 after years of financial losses, although the closure was postponed through mid-2027 by the state’s Future Energy Jobs Act, through support from a zero emission credit (ZEC) program.

According to Constellation, the new agreement will essentially replace the ZEC program, and will also add 30 MW of capacity through plant uprates. The company added that it is also evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit from the to pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor (SMR) at the site.

The agreement follows a deal last year between Constellation and Microsoft enabling the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania.

Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said:

“Last year, Constellation’s announced plan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center became national news, but despite all of the interest and overwhelming support, a key question was missed: why did we let such a valuable plant close in the first place? We all know that the closure cost our community jobs, tax revenue, more pollution and higher prices. We are proud to partner with Meta because they asked that important question, and even better, they figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy. Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.”

The announcement is the latest in a series of moves by Meta to turn to nuclear power to address the need for a rapid increase in electricity production to accommodate the growth in AI-driven data center capacity and power consumption, while protecting its goals to reduce the emissions impact of its operations.

Meta has set targets to reach net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2030, and to continue to match 100% of the electricity used in its data centers and offices with renewable energy. In the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report, Meta said that while it has maintained net zero in its operations since 2020, its 2030 net zero value chain goal will be significantly harder to achieve, adding that “the challenge of reaching our sustainability goals given the increased demand for energy and resources driven by AI is not unique to Meta.”

In late 2024, the company announced the launch of a request for proposals (RFPs) for nuclear energy developers in the U.S. to provide new nuclear capacity, targeting the addition of between 1-to-4 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear generation, with delivery to begin in the early 2030s. In an update provided with the Constellation announcement, Meta said that it has received more than 50 qualified submissions to its RFP from utilities, developers and nuclear technology manufacturers, and that it has shortlisted projects across multiple states representing the most feasible opportunities., with priority given to sites where nuclear development can be advanced quickly with high degrees of certainty on execution and timeline.

Earlier this year, Meta, alongside companies including its tech giant peers Amazon and Google signed a pledge to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050.

Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta, said:

“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions. We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 13:21:06.863339

Trump signs executive orders to boost nuclear power, speed up approvals

MATTHEW DALY

Associated Press

Published: June 4, 2025

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed executive orders recently intended to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, a goal experts say the United States is highly unlikely to reach.

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The order comes as demand for electricity surges amid a boom in energy-hungry data centers and artificial intelligence. Tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others are competing for electricity and straining the nation's electric grid.

""We've got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,"" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said. ""What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50"" years in the industry.

Still, it's unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production in the time frame the White House specified. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

The nation's 94 nuclear reactors supply about 19% of U.S. electricity, compared to about 60% for fossil fuels and 21% for renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump is enthusiastic

At the Oval Office signing, Trump, surrounded by industry executives, called nuclear a ""hot industry,"" adding, ""It's time for nuclear, and we're going to do it very big.""

Burgum and other speakers said the industry has stagnated and has been choked by overregulation.

""Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,'' said Burgum, who chairs Trump's newly formed Energy Dominance Council.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 — 13 months from now — and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has enough uranium and other reactor fuel for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

The NRC is assessing the executive orders and will comply with White House directives, spokesperson Scott Burnell said.

Jacob DeWitte, chief executive officer of the nuclear energy company Oklo, brought a golf ball to the Oval Office. He told Trump that's the amount of uranium that can power someone's needs for their entire life.

""It doesn't get any better than that,"" he said, holding up the ball.

""Very exciting indeed,"" Trump said.

Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal that warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. Nuclear reactors generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Trump said reactors are safe and clean, but did not mention climate benefits. Safety advocates warn that nuclear technology still comes with significant risks that other low-carbon energy sources don't, including the danger of accidents or targeted attacks, and the unresolved question of how to store tens of thousands of tons of hazardous nuclear waste.

The order to reorganize the NRC will include significant staff reductions but is not intended to fire NRC commissioners who lead the agency. David Wright, a former South Carolina elected official and utility commissioner, chairs the five-member panel. His term ends June 30, and it is unclear if he will be reappointed.

Critics have trepidations

Critics say the White House moves could compromise safety and violate legal frameworks such as the Atomic Energy Act. Compromising the independence of the NRC or encouraging it to be circumvented could weaken the agency and make regulation less effective, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

""Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority,"" he said.

Gregory Jaczko, who led the NRC under President Barack Obama, said Trump's executive orders look like someone asked an AI chatbot, ""How do we make the nuclear industry worse in this country?""

He called the orders a ""guillotine to the nation's nuclear safety system"" that will make the country less safe, the industry less reliable and the climate crisis more severe.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Last year, Congress passed legislation that President Joe Biden signed to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors.

Valar Atomics is a nuclear reactor developer in California. Founder and CEO Isaiah Taylor said nuclear development and innovation in the United States has been slowed by too much red tape, while Russia and China are speeding ahead. He said he's most excited about the mandate for the Energy Department to speed up the pace of innovation.

The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies and a utility that want to build small nuclear reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. Currently, the NRC expects its reviews to take three years or less.

Tori Shivanandan, chief operating officer of Radiant Nuclear, a California-based startup, said the executive orders mark a ""watershed moment"" for nuclear power in the U.S., adding that Trump's support for the advanced nuclear industry will help ensure its success.

In the Indian context, strong government backing is accelerating the growth of the domestic battery ecosystem. Under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cells (ACC), India is targeting 50 GWh of domestic manufacturing capacity by 2026, a move designed to reduce import dependence and promote value chain integration. Furthermore, the FY2025–26 Union Budget introduced customs duty exemptions on 35 capital goods specifically used in EV battery production, thereby lowering the capital investment barrier for local manufacturers.

One of the primary demand-side drivers for SSBs is the increasing global adoption of electric mobility. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), 10 million EVs were sold globally in 2022, marking a 55% year-on-year growth. Projections suggest that EVs could account for 60% of new car sales by 2030, significantly boosting demand for next-generation batteries like SSBs, which offer both higher safety and better performance than traditional lithium-ion solutions.

Government policies continue to play a pivotal role in shaping the battery value chain. For instance, India’s Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme 2024 (EMPS 2024) has earmarked INR 500 crore to accelerate EV adoption through targeted subsidies across different vehicle segments. Such initiatives are expected to drive both consumer adoption and upstream investments in battery technology.

Additionally, efforts toward supply chain localization are gaining traction. To secure raw material availability, the Indian government removed customs duties on waste and scrap of 12 critical minerals, including lithium-ion battery waste, in early 2024. This step ensures an uninterrupted supply of essential inputs for battery manufacturing while fostering circular economy practices within the sector.

Restraints

High Production Costs and Manufacturing Challenges Hinder Widespread Adoption

One of the significant challenges facing the lithium solid-state battery market is the high production cost associated with manufacturing these advanced batteries. Unlike traditional lithium-ion batteries, solid-state batteries require complex fabrication processes and expensive materials, which contribute to their elevated costs.

For instance, the production of solid-state batteries involves the use of solid electrolytes, which are more costly to produce than the liquid electrolytes used in conventional batteries. Additionally, the manufacturing process demands stringent environmental controls to prevent contamination, further increasing operational expenses. These factors collectively result in solid-state batteries being significantly more expensive, making it challenging for manufacturers to achieve cost parity with existing battery technologies.

Moreover, scaling up production to meet commercial demands presents additional hurdles. The current manufacturing infrastructure is primarily designed for traditional batteries, and adapting it for solid-state battery production requires substantial investment. This includes the development of new equipment and processes tailored to handle the unique requirements of solid-state materials.

Despite these challenges, governments and industry stakeholders are actively working to address these issues. For example, the Indian government has introduced policies to support battery manufacturing, including customs duty exemptions on capital goods used in the production of electric vehicle batteries. These initiatives aim to reduce manufacturing costs and encourage the adoption of advanced battery technologies.

One of the most significant growth opportunities in the lithium solid-state battery market lies in the robust support from government-backed manufacturing initiatives. These initiatives are fostering an environment conducive to innovation and large-scale production, particularly in countries like India.

The Indian government has launched the National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage, approving a substantial budgetary outlay of ₹18,100 crore (approximately USD 2.4 billion). This program aims to establish a competitive domestic battery manufacturing ecosystem, reducing reliance on imports and promoting self-reliance in energy storage technologies.

Additionally, the Ministry of Heavy Industries has signed agreements with major industry players, such as Reliance New Energy Battery, to set up cell manufacturing facilities. These collaborations are expected to accelerate the development and commercialization of solid-state battery technologies in India.

These government initiatives are complemented by policy measures like reduced Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on electric vehicles and batteries, as well as import duty exemptions on critical raw materials. Such incentives are designed to make battery manufacturing more affordable and attractive for investors and manufacturers.

The report, conducted by the Solar Energy Industries Association, found that the tax bill being considered by lawmakers could eliminate 330,000 industry jobs by 2028, including 2,700 in Utah. The GOP-led reconciliation bill would repeal clean energy tax credits previously passed by the Biden administration through the Inflation Reduction Act as Republicans look to end federal subsidies related to green energy.

“Lost jobs in every single state are a recipe for disaster for American families, businesses, and the U.S. economy,” said SEIA president Abigail Ross Hopper in a statement.

“Axing energy jobs means shuttered U.S. factories, canceled local investments, and energy shortfalls nationwide. We hope that U.S. senators won’t let their constituents lose their livelihoods on their watch,” Hopper said.

If the tax credits are overhauled, clean energy groups warn that hundreds of factories across the country could be closed and “erase $286 billion in local investment in American communities.”

The IRA creates significant tax credits for renewable energy projects such as solar, wind and geothermal. These Investment Tax Credits incentivize households and businesses to install renewable energy systems by allowing them to deduct a percentage of the cost from federal taxes.

However, some Republicans and conservative organizations argue the federal subsidies actually raise energy prices while reducing the reliability of power systems.

The Club for Growth has spoken out against green energy subsidies, arguing renewable energy sources struggle to remain competitive with other energy sources without government support. The group has also pointed to studies that show the tax cuts resulting in job growth over the next decade.

“This is an obviously biased report on an industry that is being subsidized by American taxpayers,” David McIntosh, president of Club for Growth, said in a statement to the Deseret News. “It would be unfortunate if Sen. (John) Curtis put his liberal environmental benefactors above basic economics and good energy policy.”

The Club for Growth is targeting Curtis for his efforts to protect green energy tax credits currently on the chopping block in President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”

Curtis is among those pushing to preserve some of those policies, particularly those dealing with nuclear energy, net-zero emissions, battery storage and more. The first-term senator has long centered his climate policies on clean energy solutions, suggesting earlier this week he will push for those changes as the Senate considers the bill.

“We must build a thoughtful, principled bill that doesn’t pull the rug out from under American innovators,” a spokesperson for Curtis told the Deseret News. “Doing otherwise risks freezing investment, delaying domestic production, increasing costs, and forfeiting our energy edge and national security to China and Russia.”

Meanwhile, some senators — including Curtis’s counterpart, Utah Sen. Mike Lee — have pushed to repeal all green energy tax credits passed under the Inflation Reduction Act.

“The government shouldn’t use the tax code to pick winners and losers in the marketplace: Americans should choose what works for them,” Lee, who is chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, told the Deseret News. “Right now, we’re crafting a reconciliation bill that will create tens of thousands of jobs, while ensuring Utah families have reliable, affordable, and abundant energy.”

The Senate is set to vote on the reconciliation package in the coming weeks, with Republican leaders pushing to get the bill to Trump’s desk before the Fourth of July.",https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/36ZGZQNSYNDMPP6G2KV4PBXYEE.JPG?focal=0%2C0&auth=b66ba25931eb4e03e3f25baa2c137db3351fa205878b83d6017eddcc0f8eed6b&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-06-04 09:06:59.719129

Looking ahead, the SEIA notes that, prior to the announcement of the bill, solar PV was largely considered to be a fundamental part of the US’ efforts to meet a growing energy demand.
SEIA has called on senators to act to limit some of the most damaging components of this bill, to ensure solar power continues to play a role in the US’ energy future.
“Axing energy jobs means shuttered US factories, cancelled local investments and energy shortfalls nationwide,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.","SEIA notes that industry leaders California, Texas and Florida would be expected to lose the most jobs, with losses of 35,700, 34,100 and 21,800 solar and storage positions, respectively, and that some of the most severe losses would take place in states that voted for Donald Trump in last year’s election.

Both Texas and Florida voted for Trump, as did Arizona, which is set to lose 9,400 solar and storage jobs, the fifth-most in the US. Notably, Arizona was one of the states flipped by Trump following Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, and is the latest piece of data to suggest that Republican states could stand to lose the most from the passage of this bill.

Earlier this year, the SEIA published figures on job losses on a national level, and found that 80% of the manufacturing facilities that would be put under threat by the passage of the bill voted Republican in the 2024 election.

SEIA’s latest figures also suggest that more manufacturing facilities could be at risk; last month, the trade body suggested 287 manufacturing facilities could face closure, a figure that has since been updated to 331. This revision follows this week’s proposal of a new Department of Energy (DOE) budget that would obliterate renewable energy funding, with the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) alone facing a 74% cut in funding.

The combination of job losses and a shutdown in new manufacturing facilities, a potential source of new jobs amid the energy transition, will translate to massive economic impacts for US citizens, according to SEIA. The trade body estimates that the passage of the bill would trigger the erasure of US$286 billion in local investments, and drive up the cost of energy for US consumers by US$51 billion, following the news that under the Trump administration, the US has already delayed or cancelled US$14 billion in clean energy investments.

Other potential impacts on US consumers includes bringing forward the end date of Section 25D residential energy tax credits from 2035 to 2026, an initial component of the bill that has since progressed to review by the Senate.

Meeting energy demand

The potential scrapping of new solar projects – both in manufacturing and deployment – would be a sudden change from recent trends in the US solar sector. Figures from SEIA and Wood Mackenzie found that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes many proposals that the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” seeks to repeal or limit, had encouraged a fourfold increase in new US solar manufacturing capacity.

Indeed, figures from those same companies show that new capacity additions had seen an exponential growth in the US, particularly in the first quarter of 2025 and the fourth quarter of 2024, with the utility-scale sector seeing the greatest growth. This is shown in the graph below.

Looking ahead, the SEIA notes that, prior to the announcement of the bill, solar PV was largely considered to be a fundamental part of the US’ efforts to meet a growing energy demand.

Using figures from the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA’s) Annual Energy Outlook, SEIA notes that the US expects to have 200GW of new electricity demand by 2030; without solar and storage, the US will add just 66.6GW of new capacity, and while Trump’s latest bill will unlikely torpedo every planned solar project in the country, it is clear that the US will struggle to meet this energy demand without the capacity added by the solar industry.

Indeed, EIA figures, published prior to the announcement of the bill, forecast solar to see the largest growth in cumulative capacity between 2024 and 2030, with the solar sector set to add more than 100GW of new capacity by the end of the decade. This trend is shown in the graph below.

Crucially, the forecast growth in solar is stronger than the growth in wind power, and the marginal growth in combined cycle generation, and a sharp contrast to the declines in cumulative capacity expected in the nuclear and coal sectors. SEIA has called on senators to act to limit some of the most damaging components of this bill, to ensure solar power continues to play a role in the US’ energy future.

“Axing energy jobs means shuttered US factories, cancelled local investments and energy shortfalls nationwide,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “We hope that US Senators won’t let their constituents lose their livelihoods on their watch.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/arizona-public-service.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 09:07:04.087949

AI and data center demand are supercharging interest in nuclear energy as stable, carbon-free baseload power regains favor.

Policy support is accelerating, with the U.S. preparing to invoke the Defense Production Act and fast-track reactor approvals, while global players from China to France accelerate nuclear expansion.

Investor momentum is strong across the nuclear value chain, but risks remain—from overvalued early-stage stocks to project delays, cost overruns, and lingering public skepticism.

Note: This content is marketing material.

Nuclear energy stocks are experiencing a significant resurgence, propelled by escalating electricity demands from AI data centers, supportive regulatory shifts, and strategic partnerships with tech giants.

Catalysts behind the nuclear revival

1. Policy momentum

The U.S. government is signaling strong support for nuclear energy. President Trump has included nuclear energy in his recent executive orders and appointed nuclear advocate Chris Wright—a former board member at SMR developer Oklo—as Energy Secretary. Wright has named the “commercialization of affordable and abundant nuclear energy” as one of his department's top priorities. Reports also indicate plans to invoke the Defense Production Act to reduce dependence on foreign uranium and expedite domestic reactor approvals. This policy pivot aims to bolster national energy security and stimulate the nuclear sector.

2. AI and data center energy demands

The rapid expansion of AI technologies and data centers is driving unprecedented electricity consumption. With solar and wind facing storage and reliability challenges, nuclear energy's consistent output positions it as a viable solution to meet this surging demand.

3. Tech industry collaborations

Major tech companies are entering long-term agreements with nuclear energy providers to secure sustainable power sources. For instance, Amazon Web Services acquired a data center powered by Talen Energy's Susquehanna nuclear plant, highlighting the tech sector's commitment to nuclear energy. Meta has also signed a 20-year nuclear deal with Constellation Energy to meet its AI ambitions.

4. Global momentum

France, Japan, South Korea, and even China are accelerating nuclear plans. Attendance at the Nuclear Energy Institute’s finance summit surged 50% this year—evidence of fast-rising institutional interest.

What are the risks?

While the long-term story looks promising, investors should tread carefully. The nuclear sector carries significant risks:

Sky-high valuations: Start-up nuclear firms like Oklo and NuScale Power have surged 300–700% over the past year—despite no commercial plants yet built. The risk of overpaying is high.

Cost overruns and delays: The last major U.S. nuclear plant expansion ran $15B over budget. The industry is now lobbying for federal guarantees to backstop such risks—a crucial but unresolved issue.

Commercial viability of SMRs: Small Modular Reactors are seen as the future—but most are at least a decade away from widespread deployment. Near-term benefits may be limited.

Public sentiment and political cycles: Nuclear still faces lingering public skepticism and policy whiplash depending on who's in office. Long-term stability is not guaranteed.

Waste disposal and safety concerns: These remain unresolved in many regions and could resurface as public opposition.

ESG considerations: While nuclear power is low-carbon and increasingly included in some green taxonomies (like the EU’s), ESG-focused investors remain divided. Concerns over radioactive waste, accident risk, and long-term storage can lead to exclusion from ESG funds or indices.

A critical group of moderate Republicans say the Senate should reconsider the House’s rapid phase down of tax credits for wind, solar and battery manufacturing, among other clean energy sources. But GOP leaders are facing pressure from fiscal hawks to make deeper spending cuts. And the White House is pushing for legislation to land on President Donald Trump’s desk this summer.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk weighed in Tuesday and called the House bill a “disgusting abomination” filled with pork on X, prompting Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and other Republicans to back him up with social media posts agreeing the bill should be changed.

In response to Musk, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday “it doesn’t change the president’s opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill.”

For the two energy industries adding the most capacity to the electric grid this year — solar power and utility-scale batteries — the outcome in the Senate couldn’t be more critical for their futures. As the policy debate revs up on Capitol Hill, here are four questions answered on how the budget reconciliation process may affect solar, onshore wind and batteries.

Which provisions would most affect wind and solar?

There are multiple provisions in the House megabill that would hinder solar and wind, but two in particular are cited frequently by analysts.

One involves tight timelines to start and complete projects. Currently, the language calls for projects to commence construction within 60 days of the bill becoming law to qualify to receive technology-neutral investment and production tax credits. The timeline would block most initiatives, according to analysts.

Developers also would have to ensure a project is placed in service by 2028 to receive credits, rather than an earlier plan to phase out incentives after 2031.

Secondly, “foreign entities of concern” requirements that would kick in by 2026 could stymie projects. The language mandates that projects not receive “material assistance” with minerals and key components from countries such as China, Russia and North Korea to obtain tax credits.

Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation: Policy and Technology, said either provision alone — the timelines or “foreign entity” language — would be enough to block most wind and solar installations from receiving tax credits. To comply with the language, industries would have to set up a complex tracing system for their supply chains within a few months.

“There’s no way the industry will ever be able to set that up on that time frame,” said Orvis.

Sylvia Leyva Martinez, a solar analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said that “there is more work to be done in the Senate,” as the foreign entity language is vague, adding to confusion for developers.

Without more clarity, the language could be “impossible” to implement at the Treasury Department, according to the Battery Materials & Technology Coalition, American Critical Minerals Association and Battery Advocacy for Technology Transformation group.

Another obstacle for wind and solar is text blocking tax credit eligibility for projects financed through leasing arrangements in the residential sector. Currently, many rooftop solar projects operate through leasing, allowing customers to utilize panels even though they don’t own the system.

If the language remains, it could force the residential solar industry to “reevaluate its entire business model,” said a research note from the law firm Paul Hastings.

How would axed tax credits change deployment?

It depends on the industry, and there are varying numbers, but most analysts agree that the effect on renewables, including solar and wind, could be devastating. Research firm BloombergNEF called the bill’s effects a “nightmare scenario” for clean energy advocates. Wood Mackenzie said it is a “sledgehammer disguised as a scalpel.”

Rhodium Group found the bill language as it is today would reduce the amount of clean capacity added to the grid by 2035 by 57 to 72 percent. An analysis from Princeton University researchers concluded the House text could increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions annually by 1 billion metric tons in a decade.

The House megabill is “tantamount to a full repeal” of the Inflation Reduction Act, said Orvis.

The Solar Energy Industries Association released a report Tuesday breaking down potential job losses in every state if the House package became law. The group has said there could be 300,000 lost jobs overall. “Lost jobs in every single state are a recipe for disaster for American families, businesses, and the U.S. economy,” said SEIA president and CEO Abby Ross Hopper in a statement.

But Martinez, the Wood Mackenzie analyst, said the solar industry would not be fully decimated if tax credits were to be repealed. She noted that solar’s levelized cost of electricity is competitive with other fuels and there are existing challenges with bringing natural gas online, such as backlogs of turbines.

If full rollbacks of credits occur, it would most affect smaller solar developers who don’t have much flexibility to renegotiate power purchase agreements, she said. Larger players “that have the ability to pass on costs” likely would be able to continue solar projects. But she noted it could mean utilities pass on higher costs to ratepayers.

BloombergNEF has projected that under a full tax repeal, more than 80 percent of wind and solar projects would still get built.

“Still, a 17% cut in renewables construction at a time when electricity demand is growing and gas turbine infrastructure is increasingly scarce is a recipe for spiking power prices,” the firm said in a research note.

What about grid batteries?

The hit to grid batteries could be greater than to wind and solar generally.

“Battery storage is absolutely one of the hardest hit, if not the hardest hit” under the House language, said Morgan Brummund, advocacy manager at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES).

On the deployment side, many of the same provisions that would affect wind and solar, such as rollbacks of technology-neutral tax credits, could affect storage. The battery supply chain is heavily reliant on Chinese minerals and components, which would kick in the foreign entity requirements.

The foreign entity provisions alone could reduce battery storage deployments approximately 89 percent by 2035 in comparison to where the industry would be otherwise, according to C2ES modeling. Any decline could have implications not just for renewables but grid reliability, as storage can help meet electricity demand peaks. The House language also could affect battery manufacturers.

“The vast majority of U.S. solar and battery factories — which together account for the bulk of the clean-tech manufacturing pipeline — are downstream solar module and battery cell factories. Their relatively higher reliance on upstream components renders all the more fraught efforts to comply with the anti-China provisions,” BloombergNEF analysts said.

The industry already has been under strain because of tariffs, shifting policy at regional grid operators and pushback against some projects at the local level.

How will provisions change in the Senate?

It’s unclear. According to an analysis last month from E2, the majority of clean energy projects since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act have been in Republican congressional districts. That didn’t change the outcome in the House, even though some members said they thought the cuts were too deep.

Some Senate Republicans have been supportive of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits. In April, GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas sent a letter to Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) saying a full-scale repeal of tax credits, including for renewable power, could lead to “significant disruptions for the American people.”

“Moderation may be likely simply because senators represent entire states, and diverse sectors’ multiplier effects can stretch across district boundaries,” ClearView Energy Partners said in a research note after passage of the House bill. The analysts noted that Thune hails from a state with a stake in wind energy and biofuels.

On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, senators offered a few clues on which way they may go. Tillis, for example, called for changes to the foreign entity provisions and said he would not back the House bill language (see related story).

The timelines for rolling back tax credits, the foreign entity language and the fate of “transferability” provisions for selling tax credits to third parties, which helps with project financing, are all areas of ongoing debate.

Advocates are also watching the timeline for a phaseout of advanced manufacturing tax credits that have helped bring U.S. solar and battery plants online.

Yet Republicans will be under pressure to toe the Trump line on “the Green New Scam” and give the party a legislative victory.

In a research note Tuesday, research firm Jefferies said support from key lawmakers like Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) for potentially softening cutbacks to hydrogen tax credits won’t necessarily translate to other incentives that could affect wind and solar. “It seems that the budget hawks are eyeing anything and everything,” it said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d6/7d/f7fab3a548729d0558f0f3643538/u-s-congress-13412.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 09:07:08.129305

The Tri-County Landfill in Grove City, closed since 1990, may reopen under new ownership, sparking fears it will accept fracking waste that can contain radioactive materials.

Local group Citizens’ Environmental Association of the Slippery Rock Area (CEASRA) argues the landfill’s reactivation would threaten public health and nearby waterways, citing the presence of Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (TENORM) and past environmental violations.

Pennsylvania regulators approved the landfill’s permit after previously denying it, despite ongoing concerns about pollution and legal loopholes that exempt oil and gas waste from hazardous classification.

Key quote:

“We realized we didn’t only have a trash problem, but we had a radiation problem.”

— Beverly Graham, recording secretary, CEASRA

Why this matters:

Pennsylvania produces massive volumes of waste from oil and gas drilling — especially from fracking — which is often laced with radioactive isotopes like radium-226 and -228. These byproducts, known as TENORM, can accumulate in landfill leachate and wastewater, posing long-term environmental and health risks when released into waterways. Yet thanks to regulatory exemptions dating back decades, fracking waste is not legally classified as hazardous, despite containing substances that fit the scientific definition. That leaves communities vulnerable, especially when such waste is buried in municipal landfills not designed for radioactive material. As waste from the state’s booming gas industry looks for new disposal sites, the battle over the Tri-County Landfill may foreshadow similar conflicts across the region.

In short:

The Bureau of Land Management approved Anfield Energy’s Velvet-Wood uranium mine in just 11 days using emergency energy provisions, skipping normal environmental review procedures.

Despite regulatory acceleration, industry experts say uranium prices remain too low to justify large-scale domestic production, and many projects still lack the needed capital and permits.

Locals from nearby Moab and environmental groups remain wary, citing past contamination and limited public input, while global uranium supply mostly comes from Canada, Australia, and Kazakhstan.

Key quote:

“This is all being done under the assumption there is some energy emergency and that is just not true.”

— Amber Reimondo, energy director of Grand Canyon Trust

Why this matters:

Uranium mining in the U.S. has long walked a tightrope between national energy interests and environmental fallout. Communities like Moab, Utah, bear scars from past uranium booms, where tailings seeped into the Colorado River and left behind a toxic legacy still being cleaned up today. Now, a push from President Trump to fast-track mines under a national energy emergency is rekindling old tensions. While nuclear power offers a low-carbon energy source, the mining and milling of uranium come with heavy environmental costs — especially for water quality and public health. Critics warn that cutting public input and environmental review could repeat past mistakes, with lasting consequences. Meanwhile, market conditions may do more to slow uranium’s return than policy: Current prices don’t support a boom. But that doesn't mean they won't in the future.

In short:

The U.S. is restoring deep-sea coral reefs in the Gulf of Mexico, damaged by the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill that released 134 million gallons of oil and devastated nearly 2,000 square kilometers of seafloor.

The NOAA-led project uses remotely operated vehicles and divers to plant coral fragments and monitor their survival, while labs in Texas, Florida, and South Carolina successfully breed corals, achieving the first-ever spawning of deep-sea corals in captivity.

Despite $273 million in funding from the BP settlement, the effort faces challenges from climate change, commercial fishing, oil spill risks, and recent staffing and contract delays at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Key quote:

“These corals are the next level of difficulty. … A lot of work has been done with shallow corals, but for these mesophotic and deep, it’s definitely a brave new world and these folks are on the cutting edge.”

— Chris Gardner, NOAA fisheries biologist

Why this matters:

Deep-sea corals are ancient architects of marine ecosystems. Growing for millennia in the ocean’s twilight zone, they form complex, three-dimensional habitats that nurture marine life — from fish larvae to crabs and starfish. These corals are crucial to sustaining biodiversity and commercial fisheries, yet they are largely invisible to the public and dangerously vulnerable to oil spills, bottom trawling, and ocean warming. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster revealed just how much damage an offshore blowout can inflict below the surface. Since then, scientists have found oil compounds embedded in coral tissues and witnessed vast underwater forests go silent. Restoration is difficult, slow, and costly, particularly at depths exceeding 300 feet. And while cutting-edge science is helping to bring these ecosystems back to life, the same waters remain at risk from ongoing drilling and industrial pollution.

In short:

Musk criticized a House Republican megabill that guts tax credits for solar and batteries, aligning briefly with clean energy advocates who fear grid reliability and industrial growth are at risk.

Some Democrats see value in Musk’s star power and proximity to President Trump, though others doubt his sincerity or political influence after months of GOP alignment.

Polling suggests Musk has polarized Democrats against pro-EV policies without increasing Republican support, muddying public sentiment around clean energy.

Key quote:

“Welcome back, but I think it’s just too little, too late. People really question his sincerity. Where has he been all these months?” — Margo Oge, former director of EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality and chair emeritus of the International Council on Clean Transportation, an automotive think tank

Why this matters:

Clean energy policy in the U.S. is increasingly caught in the crossfire of partisan politics and powerful personalities. Elon Musk, once hailed as a green innovator, has become a divisive figure — admired for transforming the auto and solar industries, yet criticized for undermining climate legislation and aligning with Trump. As Congress debates a sweeping rollback of clean energy incentives, the stakes are high for renewable energy growth, grid reliability, and decarbonization. Solar, wind, and EV markets rely on stable policy support, and the repeal of federal tax credits could stall industrial momentum just as it was gaining bipartisan traction. Meanwhile, public trust and perception matter: When a polarizing billionaire wades into the political fray, it can dampen enthusiasm for technologies that are otherwise broadly popular.

In short:

A report from the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis finds that most U.S. natural gas pipeline projects are designed to support liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, not domestic use.

Emissions from these projects — both carbon dioxide and methane — could exceed those from all current U.S. coal-fired power plants, particularly as methane regulations are rolled back by the Trump administration.

Economic and permitting uncertainties may stall some projects, but industry support and government acceleration could embed fossil fuel dependency for decades.

Key quote:

“We know from hundreds of thousands of aerial and satellite measurements that methane leaks from oil and gas production are far worse than we previously realized, which makes the climate footprint of natural gas as bad as coal in many regions of the country.”

— Danny Richter, senior fellow with the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis and the report's lead author

Why this matters:

The rapid expansion of natural gas infrastructure across the United States is a climate gamble with global consequences. Export-oriented gas projects intensify carbon emissions abroad while leaving behind a trail of local environmental risks, including air pollution from compressor stations and methane leaks. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, traps more heat than carbon dioxide over the short term and escapes the gas system through poorly regulated wells, pipes, and shipping facilities. As the U.S. doubles down on exports, critics warn this infrastructure could undercut climate goals by prolonging fossil fuel dependency and delaying investments in cleaner, renewable energy. Meanwhile, regulatory rollbacks may weaken oversight of methane pollution just as field measurements reveal emissions are far higher than official estimates.

In short:

The Pentagon emitted 48 megatons of CO₂ in 2023 — more than some nations — making it the largest institutional greenhouse gas emitter globally.

Trump’s renewed militarization, including threats and strikes, is expected to raise military emissions and spur a parallel buildup by allies and adversaries.

The U.S. exempted military emissions from international climate rules decades ago, and the Trump administration has begun hiding Pentagon fuel data that enables accountability.

Key quote:

“Getting a handle on the scale, scope and impact of the world’s military emissions is extremely important, so that there is accountability and a path toward reduction … but the US is shutting things down. It’s becoming a black hole of information. It’s authoritarianism.”

— Neta Crawford, Montague Burton professor of international relations at the University of Oxford

Why this matters:

The U.S. military not only produces massive emissions through operations, exercises, and base maintenance, but also spurs emissions worldwide by provoking buildups among allies and adversaries. When governments prioritize war over welfare — diverting funds from education, health, and clean energy — there's a climate price to pay. Military action also devastates ecosystems, burning forests, bombing buildings, and killing carbon-capturing life in oceans and on land. Despite warnings from its own analysts that climate instability threatens U.S. security, the Pentagon has historically fought to keep its emissions hidden and unregulated. With Trump’s return to power, transparency is collapsing further, and his massive defense budgets and climate policy rollbacks threaten to send emissions spiraling.

In short:

Researchers tracked flooding using sensors and cameras in three North Carolina towns and found significantly more flood days than federal tide data indicated, with Sea Level logging 128 flood days in a single year.

Many floods occurred on sunny days due to factors like groundwater and outdated drainage systems, highlighting how government tools underestimate real-world flood conditions.

The study’s authors argue that local measurements of land-based flooding should supplement tide gauge data to better prepare infrastructure for rising seas.

Key quote:

“If you don’t know where it’s flooding and why it’s flooding, you might create expensive designs for infrastructure that are counterproductive.”

— Katherine Anarde, a lead author of the study and assistant professor of coastal engineering at North Carolina State University

Why this matters:

Across the southeastern United States, rising sea levels are making high-tide floods more common, even in the absence of storms. What used to be occasional nuisance flooding now occurs regularly, overwhelming streets, sewers, and homes. Federal tide gauges — the primary tools used to guide infrastructure and insurance policy — are increasingly inadequate. They don't capture inland water sources like rain runoff or high groundwater that push water onto roads and into neighborhoods. Many coastal towns were built for a world with lower seas and different weather patterns, and their aging infrastructure isn’t keeping up. The result is not just damage but growing financial and health insecurity, as residents face lost time, property risk, and insurance premiums they can’t afford.

Our elected officials in Washington need to understand that we’re counting on them to support and encourage the transition to clean energy because our children’s future depends on it.","(The author is an East Lansing resident who used the clean energy residential credit to put solar panels on her roof.)

I am deeply disappointed in my new representative in the U.S. Congress, Republican Tom Barrett. For reasons I can’t begin to understand, he just cast the deciding vote to wipe out the federal clean energy tax credits that helped my family reduce our energy bill by putting solar panels on the roof of our home.

That’s not all. By voting for the so-called “big, beautiful” budget bill that Trump and his billionaire friends are trying to shove down our throats, Barrett voted to kill thousands of good-paying jobs in our state’s growing clean energy economy and to sacrifice Michigan’s global leadership in the development of new clean energy technologies like electric vehicles and battery storage.

Tom, selling out your constituents because you’re afraid of the misguided madman currently occupying the Oval Office isn’t just a bad look, it’s a terrible way to begin your service to the people of the 7th Congressional District.

The facts speak for themselves. Over 90% of new energy production in the United States last year was from solar and wind developments. Our inevitable transition away from fossil fuels to cleaner, more affordable renewable energy is well underway and it makes no sense to try and block it.

We now have a choice: We can either lead the way in the clean energy revolution or get run over by foreign competitors. In casting the deciding vote for the federal budget reconciliation bill, Barrett made the wrong choice for our district, for Michigan and for the nation.

Pulling the rug out from the residential clean energy tax credit alone will cost Michigan thousands of jobs and deny access to more affordable energy for residents across the state. Eliminating the tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles will only slow down our transition to the future of mobility and leave us miles behind the competition, which will cost us even more jobs. And wiping out federal support for new investments in clean energy projects and the technologies of the future is an enormous mistake.

Barrett’s vote also enables the federal government to claw back a $500 million federal grant that would have helped General Motors retool the Lansing Grand River Assembly plant for EV production, which would save 650 good jobs and create 50 more.

It’s no secret why Trump and MAGA Republicans like Barrett want to wreck our clean energy economy and wipe out thousands of good-paying jobs: It’s time to pay back the Big Oil donors who funded Trump’s campaign. They want to force us to continue buying their dirty fossil fuels and driving gas-powered cars so they can make even more money at the expense of cleaner air, cleaner water and more affordable energy for the rest of us.

We didn’t put solar panels on the roof of our home just to save money on our electric bill. We did it for our children and our grandchildren. We did it to leave them a better planet than we inherited from our own parents. Our elected officials in Washington need to understand that we’re counting on them to support and encourage the transition to clean energy because our children’s future depends on it.

Now that the Republican reconciliation abomination has moved on to the U.S. Senate — thanks to Tom Barrett — let’s make sure our Democratic U.S. senators, Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin, do the right thing and fight back against this ugly, ill-advised attempt to dismantle Michigan’s clean energy progress.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/citypulse/original/20250604-070806-6e0-Ann%20Headshot%20profile%20pic%202020%20copy.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 08:04:43.433146

Numerous smaller organizations would also be affected by the elimination of the clean energy tax credits.
“Schools, churches, nonprofits, municipalities, libraries, and others will lose access to affordable, reliable clean energy options,” says Angermeier.
In addition to the Democratic caucus, several Republican senators have raised issues with the OBBBA, which include the full-scale elimination of clean energy tax credits.
“Local voices can still make a difference and ask their senators to stand up for these critical investments in clean energy.” Virginia Sens.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that narrowly passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22 includes provisions that could jeopardize billions of dollars in Virginia green energy projects.

Charlottesville-headquartered Southern Environmental Law Center reports federal agencies have put more than $5 billion into 350 clean energy projects in the commonwealth since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. The private sector has also made significant investments in clean energy efforts, with $2.3 billion supporting 99,614 jobs in Virginia.

That investment was bolstered, at least in part, by clean energy tax credits that are now on the chopping block in the sweeping plan that has moved to the U.S. Senate. Notable credits terminated or phased out by the House version of the bill include the advanced manufacturing production credit, clean fuel production credit, and clean electricity production and investment credits.

Each credit significantly cuts costs for investors in clean energy, with the advanced manufacturing production credit applicable to components used for solar energy, wind energy, inverters, electrode active materials, specific battery components, and some critical minerals. The clean fuel production credit, which went into effect at the beginning of 2025, incentivizes the domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel and other fuels as determined by emissions factors.

“The effective repeal of these clean energy tax credits will hamstring clean energy progress, innovation, and job growth that we’re seeing in the South,” said SELC Senior Legislative Associate Bonnie Angermeier at a May 20 media briefing. “Energy developers, municipalities, and communities have been depending on these credits to move their projects forward, and the effective repeal of the credits will create business uncertainty and halt that clean energy progress.”

If passed as-is, the bill could have long-term impacts on Virginia’s economy and drive up costs for consumers, according to Angermeier.

“From a business standpoint, the bill creates severe uncertainty in clean energy markets, increases costs for utility-scale solar and wind projects, and makes projects unworkable,” she says, adding that the bill “will halt forward-looking progress in Virginia in its tracks. If this bill becomes law, Charlottesville-area residents will likely see increases to their utility bills, and job losses in their communities when projects are shuttered.”

The nonprofit is tracking potential impacts to projects across the commonwealth, including the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project from Dominion Energy, Charlottesville’s primary energy provider.

Upon its anticipated completion in 2026, the project is slated to be “the largest commercial offshore wind project and able to power over 600,000 homes.” However, funding for expansions and related projects has come into question.

Numerous smaller organizations would also be affected by the elimination of the clean energy tax credits. “Schools, churches, nonprofits, municipalities, libraries, and others will lose access to affordable, reliable clean energy options,” says Angermeier. “For instance, the historic Wesley Union [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion Church plans to continue using the tax credits to add energy storage, but this will be made extremely difficult, if not impossible, by this bill.”

The Charlottesville First United Methodist Church filed for a refund through the same program earlier this spring, according to the Virginia Independent. Solar panels were installed on top of the church in August 2024.

While the current version of the legislation is expected to be dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate, it is unclear if language slashing clean energy investments and tax credits will make it into the final version of the bill. In addition to the Democratic caucus, several Republican senators have raised issues with the OBBBA, which include the full-scale elimination of clean energy tax credits.

To pass the Senate, the legislation will need support from at least 50 of 53 Republican senators if all Democratically aligned members vote against the bill.

In an April 9 letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican Sens. Lisa Murkow­ski, John Curtis, Thom Tillis, and Jerry Moran all expressed support for energy tax credits. In addition to the four Republican senators in favor of keeping the tax credits, others have voiced concern about changes to Medicaid, food stamps, and the debt ceiling.

“Even though the bill passed the House, it’s not too late for Virginians to weigh in. As this moves to the Senate, they should be very concerned about how this bill will affect energy bills and hurt the local economy and jobs,” says Angermeier. “Local voices can still make a difference and ask their senators to stand up for these critical investments in clean energy.”

Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner publicly criticized Republican efforts to rollback clean energy investments from the Inflation Reduction Act in a May 20 statement, voicing concern about the long-term effect on Virginia’s economy. “Rolling back these investments would not only endanger these jobs but also hinder our progress toward a more sustainable and affordable energy future,” said Kaine and Warner. “We must protect the investments that are creating jobs and lowering costs for Virginians. The Republican plan puts our economic future at risk.”

The Senate debate over the legislation was ongoing at press time.

Solar PV Woodmac said that the current tariff regime would “significantly” increase costs in the US solar PV market.
“An increase in tariff levels will only worsen this premium US energy consumers need to pay to access renewable energy.
Woodmac’s “trade war” forecast (seen in graph above) would impose steep price increases on energy storage, in particular.
Yesterday, our sister site, Energy-storage.news, reported that Chinese firm Hithium and South Korean battery manufacturer LG Energy Solution had begun producing energy storage products in the US.","Chris Seiple, vice chairman of Power and Renewables at Wood Mackenzie said: “In a business with 5-to-10-year planning cycles, not knowing what a project will cost next year or the year after is disruptive and causes massive uncertainty for US power industry participants.”

He continued: “As a result, we could see potential delays in project development and rising power purchase agreement (PPA) prices. We will definitely see impacts on power sector capital projects. The severity depends on what scenarios play out.”

Most of Donald Trump’s broad, “reciprocal” tariffs are paused until the start of July. The US Court of International Trade’s ruling that the president overstepped his authority in imposing the tariffs has been temporarily suspended by a federal appeals court. However, levies on steel imports have been imposed.

Tariff costs are almost always paid by importers and passed on to buyers and end consumers through higher prices.

Solar PV

Woodmac said that the current tariff regime would “significantly” increase costs in the US solar PV market. The US already receives some of the most expensive solar modules in the world, thanks to its historic trade barriers against China and changeable, sometimes eye-wateringly steep, antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) tariffs on products arriving from Southeast Asia.

Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, and particularly tense trade relations with China, are set to make US solar even more expensive.

Under its “trade tensions” forecast, which assumes that the effective US tariff rate settles at 10% by the end of 2026, with a 34% rate on China, a US solar project will be 54% more expensive than in Europe and 85% more expensive than the same plant built in China.

Woodmac’s “trade war” forecast, where the US takes an aggressive tariff line, up to an overall rate of 30% through 2030, the construction cost of a solar project would increase by around 15%, compared with around 5% under the more measured “trade tensions” scenario.

“The tariffs that have been in place on solar modules along with an inefficient transmission policy that exacerbates interconnection costs have made construction costs for solar higher in the US than in most other markets,” said Seiple. “An increase in tariff levels will only worsen this premium US energy consumers need to pay to access renewable energy.

“While the full impact remains uncertain, it’s clear that industry participants need to prepare for increased costs and potential disruptions to their supply chains.”

Energy storage

Woodmac said that the US energy storage market would be hit much harder than any other power sector due to its exposure to China.

While China dominates global solar module production, the US has successfully built domestic manufacturing capacity and can source input products like cells and wafers from other regions of the world. By contrast, Woodmac said that “nearly all” battery cells used in US utility-scale storage projects in 2024 came from China.

The report estimates that cost increases for US utility-scale storage could range between 12% and 50%, depending on the severity of tariffs. Woodmac’s “trade war” forecast (seen in graph above) would impose steep price increases on energy storage, in particular.

Seiple said that, while US battery cell manufacturing is expanding, “it is not expanding at a pace nearly fast enough to meet even a small fraction of battery projects in the US.

“In 2025, we estimate there is sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity to only meet about 6% of demand and, by 2030, domestic manufacturing could potentially meet 40% of demand,” he continued.

Yesterday, our sister site, Energy-storage.news, reported that Chinese firm Hithium and South Korean battery manufacturer LG Energy Solution had begun producing energy storage products in the US. US battery gigafactories have already faced delays and cancellations amid the uncertainty brought about by Trump’s tariff regime; read more of that in a guest post on our sister site, here.

A war on two fronts

As well as uncertainty and increased costs from tariffs, the US is facing the rollback of domestic incentives for clean energy deployments and manufacturing.

Thirty-one percent of those undecided or unlikely to buy an EV have safety concerns. Twenty-seven percent reported challenges installing charging stations at their homes, and 12% cited the potential reduction or elimination of tax credits and rebates.

According to AAA’s 2024 “Your Driving Cost” analysis, EVs had the second-highest total ownership costs due to depreciation, purchase prices, and finance charges.

In 2022, gas prices reached $5, prompting many Americans to consider transitioning to EVs. Of those AAA surveyed that year, 77% cited gas savings as their top motivation to purchase.

Now, the national average for a gallon of regular gas ranges from $3-$3.50, higher in some states, according to AAA.

This year, the primary reasons for buying EVs were similar: gas savings, environmental concerns, and anticipated lower maintenance costs of EVs.

According to last year’s “Your Driving Cost” analysis, EVs had the lowest “fuel” cost of any vehicle type, based on a national average electricity price of 15.9 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). EVs also had the lowest maintenance costs among all models.

The percentage of U.S. drivers who believe that most cars will be electric within the next 10 years has significantly declined from 40% in 2022 to 23% this year. Interest in EVs to take advantage of tax credits and rebates has also decreased, dropping from 60% of those who said last year they were likely to buy an EV to 39% this year.

“Many consumers may find hybrid or plug-in hybrid vehicles more appealing,” AAA said. “These vehicles combine the advantages of traditional internal combustion engines with electric power, reducing range anxiety while providing an environmentally friendly alternative. This combination meets today’s diverse needs and preferences for drivers, allowing them to enjoy electric driving without losing the familiarity of conventional gas-powered vehicles.”

EV purchasing was up nationwide by year-end 2024, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation’s “Get Connected Electric Vehicle Quarterly Report 2024 (Q4).”

EVs represented 10.9% of new light-duty vehicle sales in Q4 2024, up from 10.6% in Q3 and 10.2% in Q4 2023. Light truck sales represent 81% of the EV market, up from 80% in Q3.

There are 5.8 million EVs on the road and 194,824 publicly available charging outlets in the U.S., meaning there are 30 EVs for every public port.

During Q4, four states had EV registrations above 20%, including Colorado (26.4%), California (26.2%), Washington (21.3%), and the District of Columbia (20.3%).

Nationwide, 433,843 EVs were registered in Q4 but only 9,701 new public chargers were added — a ratio of 45 new EVs for every new public port.

For full-year 2024, EVs made up 10.2% of new light-duty vehicle sales, up from 9.5% in 2023 and 7% in 2022.

Emily Jones reports for Grist.

In short:

Thomasville, Georgia, lost a $19.8 million U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant intended to modernize its failing wastewater system, build a health clinic, and improve historic homes after federal officials abruptly canceled the award in May.

The EPA says the grants no longer align with the Trump administration’s priorities, part of a broader rollback of environmental justice initiatives that focused on disadvantaged communities.

Other Georgia cities, like Athens and Savannah, have had grants suspended or canceled, leaving local governments in limbo and financially strained after investing significant time and resources in the application process.

Key quote:

“They are causing project costs to skyrocket because they keep freezing and unfreezing and refreezing projects.”

— Zealan Hoover, advisor to Environmental Protection Network and Lawyers for Good Government

Why this matters:

Local infrastructure may be unglamorous, but it’s foundational to public health and environmental protection — especially in communities already burdened by industrial pollution, poverty, and extreme weather. Wastewater systems, for example, keep untreated sewage out of homes and waterways, while resilience hubs and emergency power systems help protect residents during climate-fueled disasters. The rollback of EPA grants not only stalls urgent repairs but also threatens to deepen inequality, as smaller cities and nonprofits often lack the resources to replace lost federal funding. And while some cities are trying to appeal, the uncertain status of these grants has real consequences: lost time, wasted money, and growing public health risks.

Introduction

[00:00:14] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Hello, I'm Michael Novogradac, and this is Tax Credit Tuesday. This is the June 3rd, 2025, podcast. I'm here today with my partner Tony Grappone, and this is our latest installment in our monthly renewable energy tax credit finance series. We do have a playlist of all episodes in this energy series on YouTube.

This is our 18th installment of that series. And today's episode is a follow up to an episode that we aired last year on prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements for renewable energy tax credits, sometimes called PWA requirements. Now, our regular listeners may be wondering why we're so focused on prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements when a bill has been passed by the House that would be very detrimental to the renewable energy tax credit community. Now we do expect the Senate to relax some of the House provisions. And if you want to know more about how disastrous the House bill would be to the renewable energy community, if it were to be enacted as passed in the House, I'd encourage you to listen to or watch the podcast that Peter Lawrence, our chief public policy officer, and I recorded last week.

I'd also encourage you to review our various blog posts. And I'd also encourage you to join if you're not already a member of the Renewable Energy Tax Credit Working Group, which Tony leads along with Peter Lawrence and our public policy team. And beyond that, I'd encourage you to do advocacy on behalf of renewable energy tax credits, particularly with the Senate, particularly with the Senate Finance Committee.

That said, we do expect there to be a robust investment tax credit market for several years to come. And to that end, we thought it was important to revisit the PWA or prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. And today's episode we'll go a little bit deeper on practical strategies to ensure you're complying with those rules.

We'll share some useful tips and strategies as well as some traps to avoid. Now, before I proceed, I wanted to share some background as to why PWA compliance is so important, and this is a bit of level setting. And please bear with me if you're very experienced and already know the answer to the question.

Now in the renewable energy space, our less frequent listeners may be thinking of the investment tax credit as a 30% tax credit. For years and years, it was a 30% tax credit. Then it decreased, a little bit each year as it was phasing out down to 26%. And back in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act as a technical matter actually reduced the then 26% down to 6%.

Now, obviously we don't talk about a 6% credit. We talk about a 30% credit, and that's because the Inflation Reduction Act also enacted provisions that increase the credit rate to 30% if you satisfied certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. As a consequence. I mean, Tony, have you ever seen a 6% transaction?

No. No. Tony's shaking his head no. In case those of you that are listening and not watching on YouTube, so it's, everyone thinks about it as a 30% credit, and everyone thinks about it as you have apprenticeship and prevailing wage requirements that you need to satisfy. And to that end, Novogradac, with Tony's leadership and many others at Novogradac, we built a line of services tailored to satisfy investor due diligence requirements with respect to the PWA requirements.

And Tony and his team, as you know, work with many renewable energy developers and investors. And Tony will share his various tips on dos and don'ts for PWA compliance. Now we have a lot we want to cover today. So if you're ready, let's get started.

Conference Highlights and PWA Refresher

[00:04:30] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Tony, welcome back to Tax Credit Tuesday.

[00:04:36] Tony Grappone, CPA: Thanks, Mike.

It's always great to be here with you.

[00:04:39] Michael Novogradac, CPA: And it was great to see you in Chicago a few weeks ago at Novogradac 2025 Spring Renewable Energy Tax credit conference. And you know, as you, know, the conference kicked off just one day after the House Ways and Means Committee released their markup of the House reconciliation bill.

So there was no shortage of hot topics to talk about at the event about the damage that House bill would cause to clean energy.

[00:05:07] Tony Grappone, CPA: Yeah, indeed. I'll tell you, a lot of people come up to me at our renewable energy conferences, Mike, and they say, how do you guys time your events so well? So for some reason, I don't know how we do it, but coincidentally, we oftentimes our renewable energy conferences happen to take place at a time following some sort of major election or policy enactment or what have you, something that really impacts the industry from a legislative matter.

And so, yeah, the Washington Report panel that you moderated, as well as that policy discussion that you moderated with Jason Grumet, I mean. Those conversations were just so timely and had everybody on the edge of their seats. Somebody came up to me and said, you know, Mike's turned into like the E.F. Hutton of tax credit policy matters.

[00:05:54] Michael Novogradac, CPA: I think we're both dating ourselves with that reference.

[00:05:57] Tony Grappone, CPA: Right, right. We'll see how many listeners--

[00:05:59] Michael Novogradac, CPA: That you used it and I got it.

[00:06:02] Tony Grappone, CPA: Exactly. So, but no, the conference was an overall success. The timing couldn't have been better and I think a lot of people felt, all the attendees that were there said they're so, they were so glad to be there at that time to get all that excellent perspective on the House bill, you know, as it first got released. So, great timing.

Prevailing Wage Requirements

[00:06:20] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Great. Thank you for that. And, you know, one thing that I, well, actually before I ask you that question first, give a quick refresher on the prevail wage and apprenticeship rules, and then we'll go down, down a little bit deeper into each of those.

[00:06:34] Tony Grappone, CPA: Yeah. Great. Yep. So I'll cover this from high level.

As you pointed out, many of our listeners are sort of already familiar with some of the PWA rules, but for those of you who are new and there could be some folks here that aren't that familiar with it. And as we get through this podcast, I'll reveal some folks that this. This podcast really may appeal to, and those folks really may not be familiar with these rules at all.

And so it does make sense to kind of cover them, at least from a high level. All right, so first off, as you alluded to, the PWA requirements, you know, they first came into, for renewable energy tax credits they were never an issue until the Inflation Reduction Act was passed. Once the IRA was passed that require that, that requires taxpayers commencing construction on qualifying facilities after Jan. 28th, 2023, and facilities that are over one megawatt AC, those facilities are subject to this PWA criteria.

So now if you commenced construction before Jan. 29th, 2023, or if your facility is under one megawatt AC, then you're deemed to satisfy the PWA rules. Okay? Now these days, you know, we're not coming con, we're not coming across too many facilities that commenced construction before Jan. 29th, 2023, and we don't see too many facilities that are under one megawatt AC.

So you know, most facilities are subject to these rules if they want the higher tax credit percentage. So, but big picture, if you're subject to the PWA rules, then taxpayers are required to pay prevailing wages to all laborers performing construction and/or alteration of the facility. And they're also required to use apprentices for a minimum percentage of the hours to construct the facility.

Now, the PWA tax rules they provided for in final Treasury regulations that the IRS and Treasury published last June. And then for nuanced apprenticeship rules, those rules can be found in the applicable apprenticeship program guidelines for whichever apprenticeship program you're enrolled with.

[00:08:41] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Great.

Thank you for that overview. And there's probably a listener or viewer or two that are wondering, while we're not going into depth on this podcast, about the House bill and the damage it would cause to the clean energy community. They're probably wondering, does the House bill change at all the PWA requirements?

There was some talk that maybe the PWA requirements would be changed by House and or Senate Republicans.

[00:09:10] Tony Grappone, CPA: Right, right. So leading up to the House bill being passed, there was some speculation that maybe that House bill would change the way the PWE rules are, whether they apply at all or how they're, or how they're enforced.

We haven't seen that in the House bill. You know, maybe something does happen on the Senate side, but as of now, you know, we don't anticipate any changes to the PWA rules with respect to these tax credit percentages.

[00:09:33] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Great. Thank you for that. Now when we talk about prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, let's talk about them as two.

They're two separate requirements, but you know, both need to be satisfied. And before I ask you about the various services that you provide in each of those areas, can you first talk about when you recommend that you get engaged to provide the various services you provide to avoid failing to satisfy the requirements or committing foot faults?

[00:10:05] Tony Grappone, CPA: Yeah. Great. So we've, we have a bunch of PWA engagements in progress right now. We have many where we've been hired at the end of construction, we have several where we got engaged midway through construction. Right. And then we also have several where we got engaged before construction commenced.

If possible, I always recommend clients engage us before construction commences because if we're able to perform, you know, our analysis as construction progresses, then we can identify potential issues earlier on, which can then help clients kind of course correct. And if they can course correct timely enough, they can avoid costly, you know, penalties and corrective payments that may come up if you, if we're engaged kind of late or after construction's done.

[00:10:57] Michael Novogradac, CPA: And that's certainly a theme of this podcast and all the various areas where we provide services earlier is always better. And the longer you wait, the harder it can be to correct issues that get identified. You know, that being said, you definitely want to identify them as soon as possible, even know if it's later in the process.

Because, you know, you know, there, you know, time always allows the earlier it's found, the greater options you have. So let's start with prevailing wages and then we'll talk about apprenticeship requirements. So let's start with prevailing wages and tell our audience what the services are that you provide to help developers comply with various investor due diligence requirements and get a certain level of comfort as to their own compliance.

[00:11:46] Tony Grappone, CPA: Great. All right. So first off, I'll just note that the IRS doesn't require a third-party to review a prevailing wage and apprenticeship compliance profile. That being said, most investors in the marketplace do, as a condition precedent to financing, require a third party like Novogradac to perform diligence to analyze the PWA profile of a facility before they'll fund money.

And some tax insurance providers can also require that or tax credit buyers.

[00:12:20] Michael Novogradac, CPA: And I would just note that's much like historic tax credits. Investors will require a cost certification. You know, the low-income housing tax credit there is one required for state agencies. So there, it's a state agency requirement as well as an investor requirement, but it's quite common across all the various tax credits for investors to identify these cliff effect sorts of issues and want some degree of external assurance.

[00:12:46] Tony Grappone, CPA: Exactly. That's right. So we're usually doing this because an investor requires it. We do have some situations where just the developer is building a project on their own, doesn't have an outside investor, they're just kind of paranoid or nervous, or they just want to make sure they've got their ducks in a row.

So they just hire us without that sort of investor requirement. But anyway, just the big point is it's not an IRS requirement for third-party diligence. It's usually a, it usually comes into play because of a financing requirement. All right. So yeah, I, now let's unpack that a bit. I like how you focused on prevailing wages.

So I, that's how we approach it. We sort of think of prevailing wage testing as separate from the apprenticeship-style testing. So when we get engaged to help a client, we're usually getting engaged pursuant to what's called an agreed-upon procedures engagement. That's a classic type of engagement that investors like when they're looking for some third-party help to analyze some ty, some type of tax compliance matter.

Okay. So we perform the service pursuant to an agreed upon procedures engagement, and then for prevailing wage testing, what we're doing a lot of there is we're looking at what's called certified payroll records. We're taking certified payroll records from the taxpayer that owns the facility and oftentimes they're outsourcing that work to various contractors and subcontractors.

But anyway, we're looking at the certified payroll records from the employers of the laborers that are doing the construction of the facility. We're looking at the hours they worked, their job classifications, pay rates, and then we're comparing those, the amounts that they were paid to the minimum amounts that, that they were required to be paid based off of the prevailing wages as published by the Department of Labor.

Okay? So we analyze what they were paid against, and then we do a recalculation of what the minimum they were required to be paid during any pay period. And a pay period is usually a week. Okay. And so we'll do that for every laborer, for every pay period of every contractor throughout the whole entire construction period.

And we will identify, if we observe any situations of corrective payments necessary. A corrective payment would be necessary if in any pay period they were, you had a worker that was underpaid compared to what they were required to be paid.

[00:14:59] Michael Novogradac, CPA: So what are some of the common issues? You just mentioned one there, if a work, you identify a worker being underpaid.

Are there other issues that you commonly confront as you approach this analysis?

[00:15:14] Tony Grappone, CPA: Right. Yeah, exactly. So a common issue we can encounter is with respect to clarity on the certified payroll records. Okay. Couple of examples. One example might be a job classification that isn't particularly clear or explicit in terms of what their required pay rate is. That's one of, that's one example. Another example, a classic example, is with respect to fringe benefits. We see some certified payroll records where the fringe benefits, where there's some, where all fringe benefits are included on the certified payroll record. And when I say all fringe benefits, I'm talking about cash fringe benefits that are paid directly to the employee versus non-cash fringe benefits such as pension payments. Okay. We've seen certified payroll records that reveal all that information, and we've seen certified payroll records where some portion of the fringe benefits are paid outside the certified payroll records.

The issue that can create is if the, if we're looking at the certified payroll record and we're using that as the documentation as far as what the laborer was paid, well, if that certified payroll record omits any portion of their compensation, like non-cash fringe, then that can lead to us getting the impression that maybe they were underpaid and need a corrective payment.

And so oftentimes we'll do our analysis and if we start to see a trend of perceived underpayments, we'll reach back to our clients. Say, are we getting the full picture here? Are there, is it possible you've got some other payments going to this laborer that's paid outside the certified payroll records?

So that's those are probably two examples. Lack of clarification with job classifications and certified payroll records that don't include some portion of the laborers' compensation.

[00:16:57] Michael Novogradac, CPA: So let's talk about the consequences of failing to qualify. I mentioned earlier that a developer needs to comply with these requirements in order to get the 30% credit instead of 6%.

You've already implied in your answers that the consequences of failing to qualify isn't necessarily that you have to claim a lower credit. It's that you have these payments that you need to make. So explain the consequences of failing the prevailing wage requirements.

[00:17:28] Tony Grappone, CPA: Right, right. So let's imagine that, lo and behold, there was a, there was an actual underpayment of a laborer during any pay period during the year.

If that happens, then the taxpayer is required to make a corrective payment to that laborer. And let's imagine they do that. If they make that corrective payment timely, they're still in compliance. They're still entitled to the 30% ITC. And if they make the corrective payment within certain time limits, then they can also avoid IRS penalties.

Now, let's imagine they make the corrective payment, but they don't discover the corrective payment soon enough to avoid IRS penalties, then they can end up in a situation where they're not only making a corrective payment to the laborer, but they're also making a $5,000 IRS penalty payment plus interest.

And so that time window is very important. The IRS allows you to avoid that IRS penalty if you make corrective payments by the 30th day following the quarter end. So if we're talking about Q1 of 2025, if you discover a corrective payment and you make that corrective payment on or before April 30th, 2025, then you'd avoid the $5,000 penalty.

So it's, that's another reason why, if a firm like ours is involved earlier on and we're monitoring the results, as construction progresses, we can help identify potential corrective payment so they can make it so they can be made in a timely fashion and avoid costly IRS penalties.

[00:19:03] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Is that $5,000 per failure?

[00:19:07] Tony Grappone, CPA: It, oh, great question. So it's, it's per laborer during the calendar year. So for example, let's say you had John Doe was underpaid, $1 in every pay period during the year, it would be one $5,000 penalty. Now, let's imagine John Doe was underpaid one pay period for a dollar. Jane Doe was also underpaid $1 in one pay period. Well, now you have two $5,000 penalties. One per worker.

[00:19:40] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Great. Thank you for that. Anything else you want to say on prevailing wage? Just should we turn to apprenticeship?

[00:19:45] Tony Grappone, CPA: That's sufficient for now. We can turn to apprenticeship.

Apprenticeship Requirements

[00:19:48] Michael Novogradac, CPA: So let's go to apprenticeship. Please share with our audience some of the work that you do through an AUP to document compliance with apprenticeship requirements.

[00:20:00] Tony Grappone, CPA: Great. So with apprenticeship testing, the penalties that come into play for apprenticeship, it's not really with respect to how much the apprentice was paid. It's more about the hours they worked. So with apprenticeship compliance, the taxpayer needs to ensure that a minimum percentage of the total construction hours were performed by apprentices.

Okay. Now the apprenticeship compliance testing is performed on a daily basis. You remember when I talked about prevailing wage testing, I was focusing on amounts paid per pay period, which is per week. When you get into apprenticeship testing, that's a daily test, and what you're looking at there is you're looking at the number of hours an apprentice worked, and you're comparing that to the number of hours that there was a journey worker on site to provide adequate supervision and support.

Okay. Now, if the apprentice, if you have a situation where an apprentice worked hours and they lacked the requisite journey worker supervision and support, then those hours where the apprentice worked without being adequately supervised or having access to adequate supervision, those hours cannot be counted towards your apprentice hours for meeting the minimum percentage test.

And this is where, when we see issue, this is the biggest issue we see when we do PWA testing. In general, if you have an apprentice that worked without adequate journey worker support, those hours are now recast as hours subject to prevailing wage payments. Okay. And so I have never seen a state apprenticeship program that requires apprentices to be paid as much as prevailing wages.

They always in, in my experience, the apprentices can always be paid at lower rates than prevailing wages. And so an example would be the state apprenticeship program might require taxpayer to pay apprentices $30 an hour. Okay. Now, if that same apprentice was a journey worker, the prevailing wage rate per the Department of Labor might be, say for example, $50 an hour.

So if an apprentice goes out to the site and works eight hours that day, now you had a journey worker that went out, started the day alongside the apprentice, worked until noon, but then let's just imagine the journey worker got sick and had to go home, but the apprentice continued to work the afternoon, another four hours.

Well, those four hours in the afternoon, the apprentice can't be paid just $30 an hour. They're now recast for payment purposes. They were required to be paid the prevailing wage of $50 an hour. This is a classic example of where a client or a taxpayer didn't realize that the journey worker went home early and that a corrective payment's now needed for that apprentice.

That's a situation we see get discovered too late, too often. And so the most common scenario that we see triggering corrective payments is with respect to apprentices that ended up getting recast as a journey worker for required payment purposes. That gives the IRS a corrective payment, as well as if it gets discovered too late an IRS penalty. Okay.

Consequences of Non-Compliance

[00:23:24] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Yes. No, that's very interesting and all the more reason to be looking at both at the same time and looking at it at the beginning. Definitely. So these situations can be avoided. So what's, what are the consequences of failing to qualify for the apprenticeship or with the apprenticeship rules?

[00:23:49] Tony Grappone, CPA: Great. All right, so with apprenticeship, so we've talked about the IRS penalties, the $5,000 IRS penalty per worker that comes into play when a journey worker is underpaid or when an apprentice got recharacterized as a journey worker for required payment purposes. Okay, but now let me talk about just the apprentice penalties themselves.

Okay? You've got two types of apprenticeship penalties. One is what's called a non-participation penalty. What that means is if you're an employer of laborers doing work on the site, and you're required to enroll in a registered apprenticeship program but you did not actually enroll in apprenticeship program, then you're deemed to not comply with the participation requirement.

Okay, and so when are you required to participate? If you have four or more laborers performing work on site, you're required to use at least one apprentice. Okay, so if you have four more labors, you don't, and you didn't enroll and you didn't participate, then you're subject to a $50 per hour penalty. And there's a formula that I could talk you through, but it's a bit involved, so I'll skip that.

But there is a formula, okay? The second type of apprenticeship penalty is pretty simple. The taxpayer is supposed to use apprentices for a minimum percentage of total construction hours. If you commence construction in 2024, that's 15%. Okay, so what we do is we do this analysis where we add up all the construction hours performed during the construction period.

We multiply that by 15%. That tells you your minimum, you know, target to get apprentice for of qualified apprentice hours. And at the end of the day, if they fell short, they pay a separate $50 per hour penalty for the shortfall on hours. Okay?

[00:25:46] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Yeah.

[00:25:47] Tony Grappone, CPA: And so we've seen situations where a client cut it too close.

They were just at the 15% sort of threshold. However, they didn't realize they had a few situations where the journey worker went home sick, so to speak. Okay. And then that kind of dropped 'em underneath the sort of minimum bar.

[00:26:07] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Got it. And is there a recommendation that you give to clients? To say, well, don't cut the 50% too close. Is there a any sort of standard cushion or what's your general advice to clients with respect to that 15%?

[00:26:23] Tony Grappone, CPA: Yeah, it's, I definitely recommend they build in some, we what, when we see, you know, add like 5%, something like that. Like give a little bit of cushion there. Assume that you'll have some scenarios where the journey workers just won't be able to provide adequate support in certain days based on extenuating circumstances.

So just kind of round up a bit there. The other thing they can do is, again, if we get involved earlier on, we can help monitor how they're doing in terms of like reaching their target, right? And so when we're engaged earlier on, we'll keep. We'll ask them for their total budget of construction hours.

And so every month we're able to see how close they're getting to meeting their target. And if we observe that they're like really far behind, we can let them know because they, you have a lot of catch up to do here on the apprenticeship testing.

[00:27:05] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Yeah, it seems like the general approach would be to not get yourself in that situation. And ensure that you have an adequate ratio of journey workers to apprentices so that if one journey worker is unavailable.

[00:27:24] Tony Grappone, CPA: Yeah. I'll give you another example too because oftentimes you have like an EPC. An EPC is synonymous with like general contractor in the real estate world.

So you have like an EPC and then the EPC will sub out various tasks to a variety of subcontractors. Okay. Some subcontractors might represent to the EPC, they'll say, look, we don't anticipate having four more laborers, so we don't have to use apprentices. Okay? But then—

[00:27:53] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Lo and behold, I know where this is headed.

[00:27:56] Tony Grappone, CPA: They add that fourth or whatever the other one. The other thing too is there is what's known as a good faith effort exception. So if you're a subcontractor and you're located in an area. If you reach out to the apprenticeship program, you say, you know, we're an electrical sub, we need, apprentices, do you have any, please let us know.

If the apprenticeship program writes back and says, thanks for reaching out, we don't have any apprentices, then that qualifies for what's called a good faith effort exception. Okay. But to really set, to really meet the criteria of the good faith effort exception you're supposed to do, you're supposed to reach out to them in a certain timeframe, in a certain manner. Be very, include specifics about the facility. And so one thing that we'll see is an EPC will say, you know, X, Y, Z subcontractor meets the, told us they have a good faith effort exception. Okay. And we'll say, okay, wonderful. We'll need to, you know, can they provide the documentation? And then when we see the documentation, we've seen situations where that subcontractor reached out to the wrong apprenticeship program, didn't include the criteria, asked too late. Anyway, a variety of things where they don't actually check all the requisite IRS boxes in terms of meeting the good faith effort exception. So that can also, you might have an EPC that just assumes, oh, my subcontractor met the good faith effort exception, so we're all good here. And then lo and behold, they do not.

[00:29:17] Michael Novogradac, CPA: And what percentage of projects would you say rely on that exception? And how do investors feel about that exception versus documenting compliance with the apprenticeship rules?

[00:29:31] Tony Grappone, CPA: You know, some, sometimes if you've got a facility that's located in a particularly like rural area and you've got a well organized EPC or subcontractor that timely reaches out and so forth, then that good faith effort exception can really be a bonafide good faith effort exception.

What we find though, is it's, you might have a subcontractor that almost every facility has some small sub where they only had a few workers or whatever. And so they, they're not required to use it because too few laborers or you'll have at least one sub that claims they reached out to get a good faith effort exception.

You're going to, you're going to encounter it. And it just comes down to the quality of the paperwork and the manner in which they sought it out.

Closing Remarks

[00:30:14] Michael Novogradac, CPA: No, thank you for that. So Tony, I think we've done a good job of discussing the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements and the services that you provide, you know, along with encouraging prospective clients to engage us very early in the process. Anything else you want to share before we bring the podcast to a close on this topic?

[00:30:37] Tony Grappone, CPA: No, I think we've covered a lot. I mean, we do anticipate, I did a webinar on PWA last year. We anticipate doing another follow up to that webinar probably this summer.

And so if you're interested in a webinar, feel free to reach out to me and let us know some topics that you'd like us to include in that webinar.

[00:30:55] Michael Novogradac, CPA: Great. Thank you, Tony. I will include your contact information in today's show notes. I'll also include links to the podcast that Peter and I recorded last week about the big, beautiful bill that came out of the House, that's now in the Senate. And some of the adverse effects it would have in the renewable energy space, which we expect to see changes, in the Senate before such a bill's enacted. If it's enacted. as well as send, I'll share information about the Renewable Energy Tax Credit Working Group.

As well as some link to some blog posts about the bill, and then also we'll include a link to that webinar from last year, for those that are interested in that.

Off-Mike

[00:31:47] Michael Novogradac, CPA: With all of that said, Tony, you kicked off an Off-Mike section where we get to shout out, an industry colleague and I really enjoyed that feature that, so thank you for that inspiration.

[00:32:04] Tony Grappone, CPA: You're welcome.

[00:32:05] Michael Novogradac, CPA: This week, who's your industry shout out?

[00:32:08] Tony Grappone, CPA: Great. So sometimes I give the shout out to somebody in the industry outside the firm, and sometimes I shout out to somebody internal. This time I'm going to give a shout out to somebody internal. It's a principal here at Novogradac. His name is Nathan Berrett.

Meta claimed that reviving the nuclear plant will preserve more than 1,100 local jobs and contribute $13.5 million annually in tax revenue.

“It’s clear that there are many nuclear power plants serving the US that need long-term support to help our electricity grids remain reliable as energy needs grow,” the company said in a statement.

“Keeping an existing plant operating will have the same positive effect as adding new clean energy to the grid, and avoid the disruption that has occurred when other nuclear units have retired prematurely.”

Meta, like its hyperscale rivals, has been scouring for access to power to fuel its ongoing digital infrastructure expansion.

The firm recently raised its annual capital expenditure forecast up to $72 billion to fund its data centre ramp-up, with the infrastructure required to support its growing AI services and devices, like its revamped Ray Ban smart glasses.

The social media giant already spent a total of $13.7 billion in Q1, which was driven by investments in servers, data centres, and network infrastructure.

Capacity previously reported that Meta is looking to potentially invest over $200 billion in new data centre campuses, with sites being considered in Louisiana, Wyoming, and Texas, alongside a proposed ~$1 billion facility in Wisconsin.

In addition to sourcing nuclear power from Constellation Energy, Meta said it is in “final discussions” with a shortlist of potential projects to meet its 1-4 gigawatt energy target.

“As we look toward our future energy needs in advancing AI, we recognise the immense value of nuclear power in providing reliable, firm electricity, and the role nuclear projects can have in supporting local economies and strengthening America’s energy leadership,” the company said in a statement.

Meta joins a growing list of businesses looking to nuclear energy to power their data centres, with rivals Microsoft, Google, and Amazon also securing multi-decade deals.

Microsoft also revived a nuclear site previously marked for decommissioning: a plant on the infamous Three Mile Island, back in September.

The broadside, which Musk issued on his social media platform X, came just days after the president gave him a celebratory Oval Office farewell that marked the end of his work for the administration, where he spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency.

“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Musk posted on X. ""This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”

The legislation, which has passed the House and is currently under debate in the Senate, would curtail subsidies that benefit Tesla, Musk's electric automaker.

The tech billionaire followed his criticism with a threat aimed at Republicans.

“In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,” he wrote in another X post.

It's a sharp shift for Musk, the world's richest person, who spent at least $250 million supporting Trump's campaign last year. He previously pledged to help defeat Republican lawmakers deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump, but now he's suggesting voting them out if they advance the president's legislative priority.

However, it's unclear how Musk will follow through on his criticism. He recently said he would spend “a lot less” on political campaigns, though he left the door open to political involvement ""if I see a reason.""

The tech titan's missives could cause headaches for Republicans on Capitol Hill, who face conflicting demands from Trump and their party's wealthiest benefactor.

Alex Conant, a Republican strategist, said “it’s not helpful” to have Musk criticizing the legislation, but he doesn’t expect lawmakers to side with Musk over Trump.

“Senate Republicans are not going to let the tax cuts expire,” Conant said. “It just makes leadership’s job that much harder to wrangle the holdouts.”

Trump can change the outcome in Republican primaries with his endorsements, but Musk doesn’t wield that level of influence, Conant said.

“No matter what Elon Musk or anybody else says — and I don’t want to diminish him because I don’t think that’s fair — it’s still going to be second fiddle to President Trump,” said Republican West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.

Musk's business interests stand to take a hit if lawmakers approve Trump's bill, which would slash funding for electric vehicles and related technologies. Musk is the chief executive of Tesla, the nation's largest electric vehicle manufacturer, and SpaceX, which has massive defense contracts.

Last month, Musk said he was “disappointed” by the spending bill, a much milder criticism than the broadside he leveled Tuesday.

The budget package seeks to extend tax cuts approved in 2017, during Trump’s first term at the White House, and add new ones he campaigned on. It also includes a massive buildup of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security.

To defray some of the lost tax revenue to the government and limit piling onto the nation’s $36 trillion debt load, Republicans want to reduce federal spending by imposing work requirements for some Americans who rely on government safety net services.

Musk’s post threw another hurdle in front of Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s already complex task to pass a bill in time for Trump to achieve his goal of signing it by July 4. The South Dakota Republican has few votes to spare in the GOP's slim 53-seat majority.

Two of the Senate’s most fiscally hawkish Republicans quickly backed Musk.

“We can and must do better,” Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul wrote on X. Utah Sen. Mike Lee said “federal spending has become excessive,” adding that it causes inflation and “weaponizes government.”

Still, Trump enjoys fierce loyalty among the GOP base, and in the end, his opinion may be the only one that matters.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt played down Musk's criticism.

“The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,” Leavitt said, and Musk’s post “doesn’t change the president’s opinion.”

The tension in the GOP delighted Democrats, who found themselves in the unlikely position of siding with Musk. Democrats are waging an all-out political assault on GOP proposals to cut Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments to help pay for more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts — with many lawmakers being hammered at boisterous town halls back home.

“We’re in complete agreement,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said of Musk. The New York Democratic lawmaker stood alongside a poster-sized printout of Musk's post during a Capitol news conference.

The last time Musk weighed in significantly on legislation, the scenario was far different. His power was ascendant after the election, with Trump joining him for a rocket test in Texas and appointing him to spearhead DOGE.

During the transition period, Musk started whipping up opposition to legislation that would prevent a government shutdown, posting about it repeatedly on X. Trump soon weighed in, encouraging Republicans to back out of a bipartisan deal. Lawmakers eventually patched together a new agreement.

BRAMPTON, ONTARIO, CANADA, June 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Introduction to 247 Gard’s Futuristic Security Vision

247 Gard Security has officially integrated Electric Patrol Vehicles into its security operations. These vehicles are designed to support security operations across warehouses, parking lots, and expansive commercial campuses. This initiative reduces response time, increases mobility, and creates eco-friendly commercial security solutions for businesses. As demands of private security continue to evolve across North America, 247 Gard Security reaffirms its commitment to continue investing in modern innovations that strengthen client protection.

Modern Security Challenges

Large facilities have more complex logistical challenges for traditional foot patrol security guards. Vast areas like warehouse floors, sprawling parking structures, and interconnected building complexes often demand more time and physical exertion than foot patrol can efficiently manage alone. The introduction of Electric Patrol Vehicles covers these gaps directly. Compact yet powerful security vehicles enable security officers to traverse greater distances swiftly. Security Guards can now monitor critical areas with more frequent patrols and agility.

Client Safety Advantages

The integration of Electric Patrol vehicles is already generating substantial benefits for clients seeking to secure their premises without any compromise. Security officers who are known as mobile patrol security officers with their vehicles can watch a large facility, whether it be a warehouse, commercial property, or a large number of parking floors, without any fatigue.

In addition to operational efficiency, the visual impact of patrol vehicles serves as a powerful deterrent to potential trespassers and other security threats. For clients who are keen to take warehouse security services but worried about the company’s sustainability goals, the use of electric vehicles underscores a shared commitment to eco-friendly practices while highlighting the positive image of their facilities.

Targeted Deployment Across Critical Sectors

The Electric Patrol Vehicles are being deployed across key security sectors where improved mobility and rapid response deliver immediate operational benefits. Initial deployment focuses on warehouse facilities, parking structures, and corporate or industrial campuses.

Warehouse facilities are among the first to benefit, where protecting valuable goods, loading zones, and perimeter access points demands a vigilant mobile security presence. Clients should look for warehouse security services equipped with such eco-friendly mobility equipment.

Parking lots and garages, often sprawling across multiple levels or acres, now can benefit from faster coverage and greater deterrence against theft, vandalism, and loitering. People seeking parking enforcement services to secure their vast parking areas should consider 247 Gard security for better security protocols.

Corporate and industrial campuses are the places where employees and visitors expect a safe environment. Mobile patrol security officers cover and detect potential areas of security breaches and respond swiftly through electric patrol vehicles.

As this program expands, 247 Gard plans to introduce electric patrol solutions to residential communities, gated complexes, and large event venues, adjusting deployment based on site-specific needs.

Technology Designed For Strong Security Surveillance

Each Electric Patrol Vehicle introduced by 247 Gard has been purpose-built to meet the demands of professional security protocols. Vehicles feature high-visibility LED lighting, emergency sirens, and public address systems to provide additional tools for effective crowd control and incident communication.

Real-time GPS tracking enables dispatch teams to monitor patrol movements and coordinate security officer support with precision to manage situational incidents across large areas. Long-lasting electric batteries are engineered for long shifts and uninterrupted performance. These electric vehicles ensure that security officers remain operational without downtime, maintaining the high standards 247 Gard’s clients have come to expect.

Leadership Statement

,American Energy,2025-06-04 10:04:38+00:00,www.cbsnews.com,"An innovative ""ice battery"" system is being used to cool buildings and lower energy costs",David  Schechter,,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/innovative-ice-battery-system-cool-buildings-lower-energy-costs/,"""There's about 500,000 pounds of ice created every night,"" said Holly Paeper, president of Trane Technologies, the company responsible for installing the system it calls an ice battery.
The ice battery system freezes water at night when the cost of electricity is low.
Trane says that this system can lower cooling costs by up to 40%.
So, instead of building more power plants, the focus is on storing energy with a system such as ice batteries.
Shamberger said he sees a world where this system can be used to cool homes.","New York — In the heart of Manhattan, four stories below ground, the iconic Eleven Madison skyscraper is being air-conditioned using ice.

""There's about 500,000 pounds of ice created every night,"" said Holly Paeper, president of Trane Technologies, the company responsible for installing the system it calls an ice battery. ""And to put that into context, think about three city buses full of ice cubes.""

The ice battery system freezes water at night when the cost of electricity is low. Then, during the day, when the price is high, the building is cooled with the previous night's ice instead of using expensive electricity. Trane says that this system can lower cooling costs by up to 40%.

""So, when everyone else is using their electricity in the middle of July to cool their building or to cool their homes, it's a big draw on the grid,"" Paeper said. ""This building won't draw from that because it made its ice last night.""

Air conditioning makes up about 20% of energy use in homes and businesses worldwide, according to a 2018 report from the International Energy Agency. But on the hottest days, it can account for more than 70% of electricity use during peak hours, per a 2023 IEA report.

""We've done installations at about 4,000 sites globally,"" Paeper said. ""There are six million commercial buildings in the U.S. alone, and a very small fraction of them have installations like this.""

The problem that scientists like Dr. Patrick Shamberger are trying to solve isn't an overall lack of energy — it's when too many energy consumers are trying to use electricity at the same time, which puts stress on the grid.

""We don't want to build a whole bunch of excess power plants to just sit around, never turned on until that hot, hot day in August,"" said Shamberger, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at Texas A&M. ""It's a lot of capital investment that doesn't get used.""

So, instead of building more power plants, the focus is on storing energy with a system such as ice batteries. But because the process of freezing water uses a lot of energy itself, Shamberger and others are testing new materials that don't need to get as cold as ice, but can still keep buildings cool.

""We take water, we add some other elements and molecules to it,"" Shamberger explained. ""And based on the composition, we can control that temperature basically anywhere we want it, in the zero to 20 C range. And that's important, because what might work great here in Texas, maybe it's not the right temperature to store your heat at if you're in Nevada, or in Wisconsin, say.""

According to an analysis released last month by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a Washington, D.C.-based energy advocacy group, home electricity bills in the U.S. this summer are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, from June through September, up 6.2% from last year's projected average of $737.

It marks the highest such average in the 12 years that NEADA has been tracking summer residential cooling.

Shamberger said he sees a world where this system can be used to cool homes.

Facebook’s parent company Meta locked in 20 years of nuclear power on Tuesday from Constellation Energy to help meet the tech giant’s surging energy demand for artificial intelligence and its other power-intensive computing needs.

“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, said in a statement.

The agreement, which calls for Constellation to provide Meta with 1.1 gigawatts of power from its Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, is the latest in a slew of deals tying large tech companies to nuclear energy.

Google signed the first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors (SMRs) developed by Kairos Power in October. Amazon anchored a $500 million investment into X-energy Reactor Co.’s research and development of SMRs and is working with Dominion Energy to advance nuclear development in Virginia.

Microsoft entered into a power purchase agreement with Constellation in September to restart the energy company’s Three Mile Island nuclear unit in Pennsylvania. The 20-year deal is slated to contribute to Microsoft’s goal of matching the power its data centers use with carbon-free energy.

Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center, about 160 miles southwest of Chicago, was slated to close in 2017 after years of financial losses. But a zero-emission credit program saved the plant after legislation in Illinois provided financial support into mid-2027.

The agreement announced Tuesday with Meta takes effect in June 2027, when the state’s taxpayer credit program expires. It essentially replaces the credit program and ensures long-term operations of the plant without ratepayer support, according to Constellation.

“This partnership keeps Clinton at the forefront of clean energy while securing jobs and driving local growth,” said Illinois state Rep. Sally Turner, a Republican representing the 44th district, which includes Clinton. “It’s the kind of smart, private investment that strengthens communities without adding taxpayer burden.”

The Clinton power purchase agreement is set to preserve more than 1,000 local jobs and deliver $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the Baltimore-based energy company. Bobby Wendell, an official at a unit of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said in a statement that the agreement will deliver a “stable work environment” for workers at the plant.

The Energy Center generates enough clean electricity to power some 800,000 homes, according to Constellation. The deal with Meta will relicense and continue the operations in Clinton, while expanding its output by 30 megawatts from its current 1,121 megawatts. The financial details of the deal between Meta and Constellation were not disclosed.

The power purchase agreement comes as nuclear regains traction. Some see the energy source as an answer for the increasing power demands from data centers and AI as long as the technology can scale.

A coalition of large energy users like Amazon, Google, Dow and Meta pledged in March to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. Financial institutions like Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also endorsed the commitment for nuclear expansion.

Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said the deal with Meta ensures prior mistakes aren’t repeated by allowing a valuable energy plant to shut down as demand soars.

“Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards,” Dominguez said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Drone-Shot-of-Clinton-Facility-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 09:08:13.329306

Meta's 20-year deal with Constellation Energy follows similar maneuvers from Amazon, Google and Microsoft, but it will take years before nuclear energy can meet the tech industry's insatiable demand for new sources of electricity.

AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. The unexpected popularity of generative AI products over the past few years has disrupted many tech companies' carefully laid plans to supply their technology with energy sources that don't contribute to climate change.

Even as Meta anticipates more nuclear in the future, its more immediate plans rely on natural gas. Entergy, one of the nation’s largest utility providers, has been fast-tracking plans to build gas-fired power plants in Louisiana to prepare for a massive Meta data center complex.

Is the U.S. ready for nuclear-powered AI?

France has touted its ample nuclear power — which produces about 75% of the nation's electricity, the highest level in the world — as a key element in its pitch to be an AI leader. Hosting an AI summit in Paris earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron cited President Donald Trump’s “drill baby drill” slogan and offered another: “Here there’s no need to drill, it’s just plug baby plug.”

In the U.S., however, most of the electricity consumed by data centers relies on fossil fuels — burning natural gas and sometimes coal — according to an April report from the International Energy Agency. As AI demand rises, the main source of new supply over the coming years is expected to be from gas-fired plants, a cheap and reliable source of power but one that produces planet-warming emissions.

Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind account for about 24% of data center power in the U.S., while nuclear comprises about 15%, according to the IEA. It will take years before enough climate-friendlier power sources, including nuclear, could start slowing the expansion of fossil fuel power generation.

A report released by the U.S. Department of Energy late last year estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028 when it could consume up to 12% of the nation’s electricity.

Why does AI need so much energy?

It takes a lot of computing power to make an AI chatbot and the systems they're built on, such as Meta's Llama. It starts with a process called training or pretraining — the “P” in ChatGPT — that involves AI systems “learning” from the patterns of huge troves of data. To do that, they need specialized computer chips — usually graphics processors, or GPUs — that can run many calculations at a time on a network of devices in communication with each other.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2EsaE75PybF5qxaiPA.qlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap_finance_articles_694/c1a9df38c855a668e06f34090e346967,N,,2025-06-04 11:08:35.668002

The investment with Meta will also expand the output of a Constellation Energy Illinois nuclear plant.

The agreement announced Tuesday is just the latest in a string of tech-nuclear partnerships as the use of AI expands. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed.

Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center was actually slated to close in 2017 after years of financial losses but was saved by legislation in Illinois establishing a zero-emission credit program to support the plant into 2027. The agreement deal takes effect in June of 2027, when the state’s taxpayer funded zero-emission credit program expires.

With the arrival of Meta, Clinton’s clean energy output will expand by 30 megawatts, preserve 1,100 local jobs and bring in $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the companies. The plant currently powers the equivalent of about 800,000 U.S. homes. George Gross, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois. estimates that 30 additional megawatts would be enough to power a city with about 30,00 residents for one year.

“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” said Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy.

Surging investments in small nuclear reactors comes at a time when large tech companies are facing two major demands: a need to increase their energy supply for AI and data centers, among other needs, while also trying to meet their long-term goals to significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Constellation, the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, said in September that it planned to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft could secure power to supply its data centers. Three Mile Island, located on the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident in 1979.

Also last fall, Amazon said it was investing in small nuclear reactors, two days after a similar announcement by Google. Additionally, Google announced last month that it was investing in three advanced nuclear energy projects with Elementl Power.

U.S. states have been positioning themselves to meet the tech industry’s power needs as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and gutting regulatory obstacles.

Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy, and lawmakers this year have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, according to the trade association Nuclear Energy Institute.

Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government’s regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms.

Still, it’s unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production within the next 25 years, like the White House wants. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

Additionally, Gross recommends that the U.S. invest more in the transmission grid that moves that power around.

“That’s my biggest concern,” Gross said, adding that spending on the grid has actually fallen off in recent years, despite the voracious demand for energy.

Amazon, Google and Microsoft also have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions.

Still, the threat of rising electricity bills has made some lawmakers nervous about scrapping federal support for clean energy.
Why electricity prices have been rising Since 2022, U.S. residential electricity prices have risen 13 percent on average, outpacing inflation, according to the Energy Information Administration.
The White House called the program “unnecessary,” and said families would be helped by policies that lowered energy prices.
But many power companies and analysts argue that the clean electricity tax credits are essential for keeping a lid on power prices in the near term.","The cost of electricity is rising across the country, forcing Americans to pay more on their monthly bills and squeezing manufacturers and small businesses that rely on cheap power.

And some of President Trump’s policies risk making things worse, despite his promises to slash energy prices, companies and researchers say.

This week, the Senate is taking up Mr. Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill, which has already passed the House. In its current form, that bill would abruptly end most of the Biden-era federal tax credits for low-carbon sources of electricity like wind, solar, batteries and geothermal power.

Repealing those credits could increase the average family’s energy bill by as much as $400 per year within a decade, according to several studies published this year.

The studies rely on similar reasoning: Electricity demand is surging for the first time in decades, partly because of data centers needed for artificial intelligence, and power companies are already struggling to keep up. Ending tax breaks for solar panels, wind turbines and batteries would make them more expensive and less plentiful, increasing demand for energy from power plants that burn natural gas.

That could push up the price of gas, which currently generates 43 percent of America’s electricity.

On top of that, the Trump administration’s efforts to sell more gas overseas could further hike prices, while Mr. Trump’s new tariffs on steel, aluminum and other materials would raise the cost of transmission lines and other electrical equipment.

These cascading events could lead to further painful increases in electric bills.

“There’s a lot of concern about some pretty big price spikes,” said Rich Powell, chief executive of the Clean Energy Buyers Association, which represents companies that have committed to buying renewable energy, including General Motors, Honda, Intel and Microsoft.

A study commissioned by the association found that repealing the clean electricity credits could cause power prices to surge more than 13 percent in states like Arizona, Kansas, New Jersey and North Carolina and lead to thousands of job losses nationwide by 2032.

“President Trump’s agenda is to lower the cost of oil production in the United States, lower the cost of natural gas production in the United States — that ultimately will lead to lower average prices and at the same time profitability for businesses,” said Ben Dietderich, an Energy Department spokesman.

He added that “prices are going to move up and down in the short term,” but that the administration was focused on policies “that will deliver long-lasting prosperity.”

While government forecasters expect electricity prices to rise quickly over the next two years, they predict gasoline prices for cars will fall, offsetting some household costs. Oil prices have already declined nearly 20 percent since Mr. Trump took office, partly because of concerns that his tariffs could slow global economic growth.

Still, the threat of rising electricity bills has made some lawmakers nervous about scrapping federal support for clean energy.

“Given rising energy demand, it is imperative that any modifications to the tax code avoid worsening the economic pressures that American households and businesses already face,” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, wrote in a letter with three fellow Republicans in April. Repealing some tax breaks “would translate into immediate utility bill increases, placing additional strain on hardworking Americans,” they wrote.

Why electricity prices have been rising

Since 2022, U.S. residential electricity prices have risen 13 percent on average, outpacing inflation, according to the Energy Information Administration. In New England, the Mid-Atlantic and the West Coast, prices are increasing even faster.

The shocks are also being felt in places like Ohio, where this month rates are rising by 26 percent, on average — hundreds of dollars more per year for many families — as energy-hungry data centers flood the state.

The causes of rising rates are complex. In California, utilities face soaring costs from worsening wildfires. Elsewhere, power companies are spending tens of billions of dollars to upgrade aging electric grids and prepare for weather disasters, electric vehicles and growing amounts of renewable energy. Transmission and distribution costs have been soaring and now make up nearly 40 percent of power bills.

One big driver has been fluctuating natural gas prices. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, gas prices spiked and so did electricity bills. While gas prices fell to record lows last year, they are expected to nearly double this year and climb further in 2026, as demand rises at home and the U.S. sells more of its gas abroad.

The United States already exports roughly 11 percent of its gas in the form of liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., much of it to European and Asian countries willing to pay a premium. U.S. export capacity is set to nearly double by 2028 while tech companies are demanding ever more gas power for data centers.

“L.N.G. was already a tidal wave of demand and now you’ve just got on top of it these other forces,” said Gordon Huddleston, president and partner of Dallas-based Aethon Energy, one of the largest privately-held gas producers in the country. “Every real estate guy in Dallas is running around developing a data center.”

On top of that, the cost of building gas power plants has nearly tripled since 2022, and power companies now face wait times of five years or more for new gas turbines. Tariffs are also making it more expensive to drill for natural gas by raising the cost of equipment such as steel pipe.

Many businesses fear a strain.

“Whenever there’s an inadequate supply of natural gas or electricity, manufacturing’s the first thing to be curtailed,” said Paul Cicio, president of the Industrial Energy Consumers of America, a trade association that represents energy-intensive manufacturers in steel, aluminum, plastics, chemicals and paper.

Mr. Cicio said that this past winter, pipeline operators told some of his member companies to curb their gas use because of inadequate supplies.

In 2020, 34 million households reported difficulties in paying their energy bills or said they kept their homes at unsafe temperatures because of cost concerns.

The crunch comes as the Trump administration wants to end the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a $4 billion federal fund that helps 6.2 million people from Texas to Maine pay for high heating and cooling bills. The White House called the program “unnecessary,” and said families would be helped by policies that lowered energy prices.

“We’ve got millions of families that are already struggling to pay their bills,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. “Now you bring in extreme temperatures, record heat, and it’s a very bad situation.”

A fight over power bills

There are several competing ideas to ease electricity prices.

One strategy, popular with the oil and gas industry, is to expand gas production and ease permitting for new pipelines.

But many power companies and analysts argue that the clean electricity tax credits are essential for keeping a lid on power prices in the near term.

That’s because companies were already planning to build a bunch of wind, solar and batteries in the next few years, which account for 95 percent of electric capacity waiting to connect to grids, and utilities can pass through savings from the tax credits for these projects to consumers. The Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade association, estimates that the tax breaks would save Americans $45 billion on their bills through 2031.

Another argument is that the tax credits can help protect against the risk of volatile gas prices by encouraging alternatives, including both renewable energy and longer-term technologies like nuclear or geothermal power.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04cli-energy-costs-01-hpkm/04cli-energy-costs-01-hpkm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 07:03:16.266568

An estimated 3 billion people depend on the ocean for their livelihoods, according to the United Nations.
She found that marine protected areas may help mitigate the collapse of large groundfish like hake and grouper that live and feed at the bottom of the sea and have commercial value.
But only a network of well connected and designed marine protected areas will make a difference.
Currently, around 8 percent of the Mediterranean Sea is protected on paper, and less than 1 percent is protected in reality, Abello said.","NICE, France—More than 2,000 scientists, advocates and policymakers from at least 100 countries convened this week at the One Ocean Science Congress, warning of a mounting marine crisis and promising recommendations to solve it—not only for the sake of life below the surface, but for the entire planet.

“The ocean is suffering at the cause of humanity,” said the Mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, who spoke at the event’s opening ceremony Tuesday at Port Lympia. “Either we save our oceans or the entire race will pay.”

Rising sea temperatures due to global warming, ocean acidification, plastic pollution, and offshore oil and gas developments are just some of the threats plaguing the ocean and jeopardizing humans in the process. So are overfishing and other destructive fishing practices such as bottom trawling—an industrial fishing technique that drags large weighted nets along the seabed to herd target species, destroying almost every other living thing in its path.

“Sound research shows global human health is intrinsically linked to a healthy ocean,” said Peter Thomson, the United Nations secretary-general’s special envoy for the ocean.

The ocean produces more than half of the oxygen humans breathe. It helps regulate temperatures by absorbing excess heat and carbon dioxide, and by distributing hot and cold waters around the world via its underwater currents.

An estimated 3 billion people depend on the ocean for their livelihoods, according to the United Nations. But, at the congress’s opening ceremony, Thomson said, “the ocean’s health is currently, measurably in decline.”

Now is the time to chart a new future for the ocean, he said.

The four-day congress, organized by the French National Centre for Scientific Research and Ifremer, the only French public research institute dedicated solely to ocean studies, runs through Friday and serves as a prelude to the third United Nations Ocean Conference beginning here June 9.

“Faith has been placed upon this congress to serve as the scientific pillar of the U.N. Ocean Conference,” said Thomson. “We’re expecting that the scientifically compiled conclusions of this congress will inform the leaders and the representatives of governments and civil society who will be attending the conference.”

By the end of the oceans summit, U.N. member states intend to adopt a voluntary political declaration that will promote the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources called “Our Ocean, Our Future: United for Urgent Action.”

Science in Action

“Science for ocean action” is also the motto of this week’s congress. Over the next three days at least 500 oral presentations and 300 roundtable discussions will cover a wide range of topics from deep sea ecosystems to carbon dioxide removal approaches and ocean-based renewable energy such as offshore wind, solar, wave, thermal and tidal energy.

Several sessions will examine the effectiveness of marine protected areas, which limit human activity in order to promote the restoration of vulnerable ecosystems and climate refugia such as coral reefs that are showing signs of resilience in the face of rising ocean temperatures, which are now causing most corals to bleach.

On Tuesday, French fishery scientist Clea Abello presented research she’s been conducting at Marbec, a marine research institute based at the University of Montpellier in France, on the role marine protected areas can potentially play in mitigating projected negative impacts of climate change on the Mediterranean Sea. She said it is warming 25 percent faster than the rest of the world’s oceans due to it being largely enclosed by mountains and coastal urban areas.

Her research uses a climate model to forecast changes in climate over time based on a worst case high emissions scenario—in this case a 30-year period between 2070 and 2100. She found that marine protected areas may help mitigate the collapse of large groundfish like hake and grouper that live and feed at the bottom of the sea and have commercial value.

But only a network of well connected and designed marine protected areas will make a difference.

According to the 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, 30 percent of all marine areas should be protected by 2030 in order to halt biodiversity loss, but progress towards reaching this ambitious goal is slow, Abello said.

Currently, around 8 percent of the Mediterranean Sea is protected on paper, and less than 1 percent is protected in reality, Abello said.

“We have to make sure that we’re not just going towards the target and just putting paper parks,” she said.

In the coming days at the congress, she said, she hopes to continue “sounding the alarm” on this issue and promoting more protections for the Mediterranean Sea. “It’s such a rich area,” she said, “but we’re far behind.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1815424021-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 07:03:32.840572

Constellation Energy President and CEO of Constellation Joe Dominguez said the company was proud to pair with Meta. He said the tech company determined that “supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy.”

“Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards,” Dominguez said.

This partnership will ensure long-term operation of the nuclear plant, add new 30 megawatts of capacity, and will help maintain 1,100 jobs, the companies said Tuesday.

“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, said in a statement. “We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.”

The Clinton Clean Energy Center began operating in 1987. It’s located about 30 miles southeast of Bloomington-Normal.

The plant was first headed for closure in 2017 after years of financial losses, despite being one of the best performing nuclear plants in Illinois, according to Constellation.

State lawmakers saved the plant — at least until 2027 — with passage of the Future Energy Jobs Act and its Zero Emission Credit program. But that state program ends in mid-2027. The deal with Meta keeps the plant operating beyond that date.

The plant won’t directly power Meta’s data centers.

“The power purchase agreement [PPA] will enable the Clinton Clean Energy Center to continue to flow power onto the local grid, providing grid reliability and low-cost power to the region for decades to come,” the companies said. “Meta is purchasing the plant’s clean energy attributes as part of its commitment to match 100% of its electricity use with clean and renewable energy.”

Constellation says it’s also “evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor [SMR]” in Clinton.

The plant directly employs over 530 people and generates enough carbon-free electricity to power over 800,000 homes.

The Environmental Protection Agency has published its first National Climate Change Risk Assessment.

It is calling for urgent action within the next five years to increase the resilience of Ireland’s energy transmission and communications infrastructure.

The report says it is possible that climate change might bring fewer extreme wind storms in the future, but warns that when the big winds come, they will be stronger and do more damage than ever before.

What are the risks that Ireland faces?

The assessment says Ireland’s exposure to extreme wind is at a critical level.

Consequently, making energy and communications infrastructure more resilient is a priority that needs to be addressed in the next five years.

The National Climate Change Risk Assessment report also notes how other critical services and functions are severely compromised when electricity and communications systems are damaged.

This was the experience across the country due to Storms Darragh and Éowyn earlier this year.

The EPA added disruption and damage to buildings and transport infrastructure as a result of extreme wind, coastal erosion, and coastal flooding to the list of significant risks that must be addressed within the next five years.

Ireland’s coastline is already experiencing the impacts of coastal erosion and flooding.

The report warns that buildings and transport infrastructure concentrated in coastal areas in and around Dublin, the southeast, and the southwest are particularly exposed to coastal erosion and coastal flooding.

Inland flooding is another priority risk that needs to be addressed.

The report highlights how changes in precipitation patterns will result in an increase in the frequency and severity of river, surface water, and groundwater flooding events.

It says the built environment, which includes transport infrastructure and buildings, is particularly exposed because hard surfaces exacerbate flood risks.

The EPA is warning that by mid-century, those risks will have increased to a critical level, with consequences for both physical and mental human health.

EPA Director General Laura Burke said the report ""highlights the need for additional urgent action to ensure Ireland is sustainably resilient to the risks that we currently face, and will increasingly experience, in the coming decades.""

What are the opportunities?

The report says warmer temperatures, increased precipitation, and warmer seas present potential opportunities for certain economic sectors.

It identified five so-called ""opportunities"" where it thinks climate change could benefit the country.

It suggests climate change could bring improved physical and mental health for people from spending more time outdoors due to higher average temperatures.

A longer season for outdoor activities will encourage economic activity related to tourism, also due to higher average temperatures.

For agriculture in Ireland, higher average temperatures could result in a longer growing season and improved livestock nutrition and grazing.

There is potential, too, for increased hydropower generation because of increased rainfall.

Tax credits drive renewable energy projects to record highs

Credits could be weakened or eliminated if Trump cuts costs

By Carey L. Biron

Labor leaders claim that federal tax credits under the former president Joe Biden for green energy production and construction have created an influx of new jobs - inspiring young workers to participate in the U.S. transition towards energy in a rapidly aging sector.

""We were slammed, pretty much full employment. Everyone was making plenty money,"" said Kilton webb, an electrician from Maine who saw his job opportunities skyrocket following a 2022 legislation that created the incentives.

Webb has worked on over 15 solar farms, where the electricians are key players, but he fears that many developers will be scared.

You can feel it. ""They don't even know what is going to happen on a daily basis,"" said Webb. He is now a Maine State Representative and union leader.

According to a Deloitte report, renewable energy will create twice as many jobs in 2023 as fossil fuels. Energy construction jobs are also growing twice as fast as other construction projects.

The incentives, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, have been scrutinized as lawmakers have tried to draft a federal budget that is in line with the President Donald Trump’s efforts to cut costs.

In May, lawmakers voted for a phase-out of the subsidies in the coming years. They also included language which experts claim would reduce the number eligible projects during the interim and place new restrictions on the importation of key Chinese parts.

The budget talks are now moving to the Senate. Leaders hope to send a bill directly to the President by the beginning of July.

Trump declared an ""energy emergency"" on his first day as president, with the goal of boosting domestic energy production through a faster approval process for new oil and natural gas production. He also pledged to create jobs and lower energy costs.

Trump's budget proposal for the following year called for the elimination of billions in funding for ""unreliable"" renewable energy.

In an email, a White House official stated that the budget being considered will benefit construction and trade workers through wage increases, encouraging new investments by construction firms and other means.

""A HARD CONVERSATION""

Labor groups, however, say that clean energy projects can help to revitalize the construction industry.

Pat Devaney is the secretary-treasurer for the Illinois AFL-CIO. The union has 900,000 workers.

He said, ""We have a lot jobs in fossil-generation in parts of the State where there aren’t many other opportunities... but we've seen a huge increase in the number clean-energy project coming into our state.""

Illinois has 150 green energy projects at utility scale either in development or planning, according to him. All of these are eligible for federal credits.

He said that this would result in over 33,000 megawatts and more than 51,000 clean jobs, and more than $56 billion of investment.

Devaney said, ""That's an important issue for Illinois union employees."" He is ""extraordinarily worried"" about the debate over cutting green energy credits.

Tax credits that reduce taxes for such projects in order to make them economically viable were already in place when Biden became president, but they were expanded by his administration and their timeline was increased to a decade.

The longer timeline provided developers with greater certainty and the renewables sector reached record highs in the last year. Lori Bird is the director of the U.S. Energy Program at the WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition.

She said that ""they've played a very large role in the new power plants coming on to the grid.""

According to the American Clean Power Association, renewables accounted for more than 90% the energy capacity added in America last year. Bird says that the uncertainty caused by the debate over tax credits and new import tariffs is already delaying the projects that were attracting younger workers.

According to the federal government, more than a fifth (or 55%) of construction workers have reached retirement age. This proportion has doubled from 2003 to 2020.

""When we are trying to recruit individuals into an industry which is a new market share for our company, they ask: What kind of longevity will I see?"" Kent Miller is the president of Wisconsin Laborers' District Council (a grouping of five unions).

He said that these unions ""struggled"" before the law of 2022, but the approvals of major solar projects have helped to bring in new workers as well as a record number apprentices.

Myeisha, 30, has chosen this path in Illinois after graduating from a statewide program that includes initial training and employer introductions for those looking to get into clean-energy construction.

She told me that she knew a woman who installed solar panels but wasn't sure if the field was available to women.

Cook was able to land a job in carpentry after taking the course. She is now looking for jobs in Chicago, such as building energy-efficient buildings or working on new subway extensions.

As a leader in the Ironworkers union in Indiana, representing over 1,300 workers, I know firsthand how important clean energy is to making our economy work for all of us.

Investments in clean energy have enabled our union locals to build back Indiana manufacturing, create good-paying jobs, and drive down energy costs, all while helping America maintain our global competitiveness.

The House budget reconciliation bill, however, proposes what amounts to a total repeal of clean energy investments, putting our jobs at risk. As SEIA, the primary trade organization for the solar industry, put it: “this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history.” Let’s be clear: this bill is a direct assault on American manufacturing and American-made energy right here in Indiana.

We strongly support clean energy investments at both the federal level and in the private sector because they are fueling a clean energy economic boom in Indiana. We are grateful that Senator Todd Young has supported clean energy development in the state, such as Entek’s Battery Separators Factory and Toyota’s EV Manufacturing Expansion.

On April 9, four of Young’s Republican colleagues in the Senate signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader Thune in support of the clean energy tax credits that have brought direct benefits to so many parts of the country.

“As Republicans committed to strengthening America’s energy security and economic growth, we write to emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development. While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” they wrote in their letter.

This is exactly right. Unfortunately, the House bill will implement unreasonable phase-outs, impossible red tape and restrictions, or outright termination of tax credits for clean energy that together make the tax credits completely unworkable, by design. Simply put, this bill is a full-scale repeal. It also repeals home energy tax credits, which would lead directly to higher energy costs, in addition to good-paying jobs.

This bill would lead to serious consequences for Americans across the country and especially in Indiana. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, there have been 22 clean energy projects in Indiana, resulting in over 12,930 jobs and over $17 million in investment across the state.

We are already seeing the impacts of this approach taking a “sledgehammer” to clean energy. In 2024, Wabash Valley Resources received a $1.5 billion loan to build a carbon-negative fertilizer production facility, creating over 1,100 direct and indirect jobs to a community impacted by the decline of a coal-related industry. However, reckless actions against clean energy put these jobs and investments in jeopardy.

Not only does the bill imperil Indiana’s clean energy economy, but it also puts our energy supply at risk. In 2023, 14% of Indiana’s total energy generation came from clean energy, with wind power alone accounting for 10%. Two new wind projects are planned in the state, which will bring 4.7 GW of clean energy capacity to the state, enough to power over 3 million homes.

These projects are coming online just in time, because Indiana’s energy demand is about to skyrocket. Our state is home to as many as 70 data centers, and Indiana Michigan Power estimates that these data centers will use more electricity than all Hoosier households by 2030. Clean energy is cheaper and quicker to bring online than other sorts of power; we need to build more, not less.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would gut America’s clean energy production, raising costs for Indiana families and killing hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs nationwide. Trump and Republicans promised to lower energy costs. Instead, this legislation would undermine America’s fastest-growing, most affordable energy sources.

Thankfully, Young has an opportunity to fix this bill to protect clean energy and the jobs that come along with it. Now that the bill has passed the House, it moves to the Senate next. As Young has said, a more balanced approach is needed. Repealing clean energy investments would be bad for American businesses and bad for American workers.

We urge Senator Young to continue being the leader we need and fix this reckless legislation.

I. Background

A. Description of a SIP

Each State has a SIP containing, among other things, the control measures and strategies used to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The SIP is extensive, containing such elements as air pollution control regulations, emission inventories, monitoring networks, attainment demonstrations, and enforcement mechanisms.

B. How the EPA Enforces SIPs

Each State must formally adopt the control measures and strategies to attain and maintain the NAAQS after the public has had an opportunity to comment on them. They are then submitted to the EPA as requested SIP revisions upon which the EPA must formally act. Once these control measures and strategies are approved by the EPA, after notice and comment rulemaking, they are incorporated into the federally approved SIP and are identified in part 52 (Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans), title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR part 52). The EPA uses the process of incorporation by reference (IBR) to incorporate material into the CFR by referencing the original document(s) without publishing the full text of the material. The actual State regulations approved by the EPA are not reproduced in their entirety in 40 CFR part 52 but are “incorporated by reference,” which means that the EPA has approved a given State regulation with a specific effective date. This format allows both the EPA and the public to know which measures are contained in a given SIP and to help determine whether the State is enforcing the regulations. This format also assists the EPA and the public in taking enforcement action, should a State not enforce its SIP-approved regulations.

C. How the State and the EPA Update the SIP

The SIP is a dynamic document, which the State can revise as necessary to address the unique air pollution problems in the state. Therefore, the EPA must periodically take action on State SIP revisions containing new and/or revised regulations and other materials in order to make them part of the federally-approved SIP. The EPA establishes a docket for its actions using a unique Docket Identification Number, which is listed in each action. These dockets and the complete submissions are available for viewing on www.regulations.gov.

On May 22, 1997 (62 FR 27968), the EPA revised the formatting procedures for incorporating by reference federally-approved SIP revisions, as a result of consultations between the EPA and the Office of the Federal Register. These procedures include: (1) a revised SIP document for each State that would use the IBR process under the provisions of title 1 CFR part 51; (2) a revised mechanism for announcing the EPA's approval of revisions to an applicable SIP and updating both the document that has gone through the IBR process and the CFR; and (3) a revised format of the “Identification of Plan” sections for each applicable subpart in 40 CFR part 52 to reflect these revised IBR procedures. The description of the revised SIP document, IBR procedures, and “Identification of plan” format are discussed in further detail in the May 22, 1997 Federal Register document. We have taken action to revise the format for many State SIPs, see, e.g.,40 CFR 52.1470 and 52.1490 (“Identification of plan” and “Original identification of plan” sections for the State of Nevada SIP), and take a second step today toward revising the format of the California SIP.

D. How the EPA Compiles the SIPs

Under the revised SIP format, the federally-approved regulations, source-specific requirements, and nonregulatory provisions (entirely or portions of) submitted by each State agency have been compiled by the EPA into a “SIP compilation.” The SIP compilation contains the regulations, source-specific requirements, and nonregulatory and quasi-regulatory provisions approved by the EPA through previous rulemaking actions published in the Federal Register .

E. How the EPA Organizes the SIP Compilation

Each compilation contains three parts. Part one contains the regulations, part two contains the source-specific requirements, and part three contains the nonregulatory and quasi-regulatory provisions that have been approved by EPA as part of the SIP. Each part consists of a table or tables of identifying information for each SIP-approved regulation, each SIP-approved source-specific requirement, and each nonregulatory or quasi-regulatory SIP provision. The EPA Regional Offices have the primary responsibility for updating the compilations and ensuring their accuracy.

Given the size of the California SIP, the EPA is revising the format of the California SIP in a phased manner. In 2016, the EPA took the first action and published the tables listing the State statutes and regulations, and the California test procedures, test methods and specifications that EPA had previously approved into the applicable California SIP.[ ] In this second action, the EPA is publishing the tables listing EPA-approved local ordinances as well as EPA-approved rules adopted by eight local or regional California air districts.

F. Where You Can Find a Copy of the SIP Compilation

EPA Region IX has developed and will maintain the SIP compilation for California. A copy of the full text of California's regulatory and source-specific SIP compilation will also be maintained at NARA.

G. The Format of the California Identification of Plan Sections

The California SIP is found in 40 CFR part 52 (“Approval and promulgation of implementation plans”), subpart F (“California”), § 52.220 (“Identification of plan—in part”) and § 52.220a (“Identification of plan—in part”). Section 52.220 currently lists air district rules, local ordinances, source-specific requirements, and nonregulatory and quasi-regulatory provisions approved as part of the SIP and also lists State statutes and State regulations approved on or prior to April 1, 2016. Section 52.220a currently lists State statutes and State regulations approved after April 1, 2016, but also lists State statutes and State regulations that remain in the current applicable SIP because they were approved on or before April 1, ( printed page 23620) 2016, and have not yet been superseded or removed.

As noted above, on May 26, 2016 (81 FR 33397), the EPA began revising the IBR procedures for California by revising the format for approved State statutes and State regulations. In preparation for future actions to revise the format of the remaining portions of the California SIP, the May 26, 2016 action also organized 40 CFR 52.220a into five subsections: (a) Purpose and scope; (b) Incorporation by reference; (c) EPA-approved regulations; (d) EPA-approved source-specific requirements; and (e) EPA-approved nonregulatory provisions and quasi-regulatory measures such as transportation control measures, certain nonregulatory statutory provisions, control strategies, and monitoring networks.

In this action, we are revising the format for portions of the California SIP related to local ordinances and the rules adopted by the following eight California air districts: Amador Air District, Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District (AQMD), Bay Area AQMD, Butte County AQMD, Calaveras County Air Pollution Control District (APCD), Colusa County APCD, Eastern Kern APCD, and El Dorado County AQMD. This format revision involves materials approved on or before April 17, 2025, that are part of the current applicable SIP. All subsequent actions by the EPA to approve California SIP revisions related to local ordinances or these eight air districts will be promulgated in 40 CFR 52.220a, paragraph (c) using the new table format. EPA approvals of source-specific requirements, nonregulatory and quasi-regulatory provisions, and rules from air districts other than these eight air districts will continue to be promulgated in 40 CFR 52.220 using the paragraph format.

Over time, as the EPA completes further rulemaking actions to convert the format of the California SIP, § 52.220a will include a growing number of air district rules, local ordinances, source-specific requirements, and nonregulatory and quasi-regulatory provisions. Once the conversion process is completed, the EPA will redesignate § 52.220a as § 52.220 and rename it simply “Identification of plan.” At that point, all subsequent actions by the EPA to approve California SIP revisions will be promulgated using the new table format.

H. When a SIP Revision Becomes Federally Enforceable

All revisions to the applicable SIP become federally enforceable as of the effective date of the revision to the applicable “Identification of plan” section found in each subpart of 40 CFR part 52. All future revisions to the relevant portion of the applicable SIP being converted to the new table format in this action become federally enforceable as of the effective date of the revisions to paragraph (c) of § 52.220a, in subpart F of 40 CFR part 52.

I. The Historical Record of SIP Revision Approvals

To facilitate enforcement of previously approved SIP provisions and provide a smooth transition to the new SIP processing system, the EPA will retain the “Identification of plan—in part” section for California appearing in 40 CFR 52.220 until the conversion process is completed. After the conversion of the entire California SIP is completed, the “Identification of plan—in part” section will be moved to 40 CFR 52.250. After an initial two-year period, the EPA will review its experience with the new SIP processing system and decide whether to retain the “Identification of plan—in part” section for some further period.

II. What the EPA Is Doing in This Action

In this action, the EPA is revising the format for portions of the applicable California SIP related to local ordinances and the rules from the following eight air districts: Amador Air District, Antelope Valley AQMD, Bay Area AQMD, Butte County AQMD, Calaveras County APCD, Colusa County APCD, Eastern Kern APCD, and El Dorado County AQMD. This format revision involves materials approved on or before April 17, 2025, that are part of the current applicable SIP. This action constitutes a “housekeeping” exercise to ensure that all EPA-approved revisions to the State programs that have occurred are accurately reflected in 40 CFR part 52. The requirements that apply to states and that relate to SIPs and SIP revisions are set forth in the Clean Air Act and in the EPA's regulations at 40 CFR part 51. When the EPA receives a formal SIP revision request, the Agency must publish the proposed revision in the Federal Register and provide for public comment before approval.

The EPA has determined that this rule falls under the “good cause” exemption in section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) which, upon finding “good cause,” authorizes agencies to dispense with public participation and section 553(d)(3) which allows an agency to make a rule effective immediately, thereby avoiding the 30-day delayed effective date otherwise provided for in the APA. This action simply reformats and recodifies provisions which are already in effect as a matter of law in Federal and approved State programs. Under section 553 of the APA, an agency may find good cause where notice and public procedure are “impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Public comment is “unnecessary” and “contrary to the public interest” for this action because the EPA is merely reformatting and recodifying existing law. Immediate notice in the CFR benefits the public by removing outdated citations and making the IBR format clearer and more user-friendly.

III. Incorporation by Reference

In this rule, the EPA is finalizing regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, the EPA is reformatting the materials incorporated by reference in previous rulemakings on submittal of the California SIP and SIP revisions, as described in section II. of this preamble. The EPA has made, and will continue to make, these documents generally available through www.regulations.gov and at the appropriate EPA office (see the ADDRESSES section of this preamble for more information).

IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

A. General Requirements

This action does not impose additional requirements beyond those previously approved into the SIP and already imposed by State law. For that reason, this action:

Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget underExecutive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);

Is not subject toExecutive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) because SIP actions are exempt from review under Executive Order 12866;

Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);

Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);

Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);

Does not have Federalism implications as specified in Executive ( printed page 23621) Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);

Is not subject toExecutive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it is an administrative action related to State program approval;

Is not a significant regulatory action subject toExecutive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and

Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA.

In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian Tribe has demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).

B. Submission to Congress and the Comptroller General

The Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. Section 808 allows the issuing agency to make a rule effective sooner than otherwise provided by the CRA if the agency makes a good cause finding that notice and public procedure is impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest. This action simply reformats and recodifies provisions that are already in effect as a matter of law in Federal and approved State programs. 5 U.S.C. 802(2). As stated previously, the EPA has made such a good cause finding, including the reasons therefore, and established an effective date of June 4, 2025. The EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the Federal Register . This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

C. Petitions for Judicial Review

The EPA has also determined that the provisions of section 307(b)(1) of the CA A pertaining to petitions for judicial review are not applicable to this action. Prior EPA rulemaking actions for each individual component of the California SIP compilation had previously afforded interested parties the opportunity to file a petition for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days of such rulemaking action. Thus, the EPA believes judicial review of this action under section 307(b)(1) is not available.

Clean energy tax credits are working for Montana.
I urge Senators Daines and Sheehy to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect all these tax credits.","On May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m disappointed.

Make no mistake: These cuts will hurt Montana if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution, and threaten growing economic investments we’ve seen in Montana. The House passage of this bill just put these investments at risk.

These tax credits have been working. Since 2022, Montana has benefited from $2.4 billion in specific investments covering 14 projects, and creating 3080 jobs. Mayors and county commissioners have been writing to our Montana delegation asking them to keep these tax credits because they are so beneficial.

The legislation has overwhelmingly helped Republican-held districts—78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP. That includes Montana, where companies like Northwestern Energy (MT Hydro), Calumet/Montana Renewables, and NextEra, among others, have announced major investments thanks to these tax credits.

Counties from Cascade to Custer are thrilled - the tax revenues generated by the companies’ projects enable the counties to make large-scale renovations, build civic centers, and keep roads, bridges, and schools in great shape. If the tax credits are left intact, they could assist more companies to implement projects in all 56 counties, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in property taxes per year—money the counties won’t have to tax their citizens.

But that success story could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Rolling back these tax credits means Montana ratepayers will face electricity prices that are up to 7% higher in the coming years.

Manufacturing will slow. Phasing out tax credits that support clean-energy manufacturing will jeopardize long-term projects like upgrading and building transmission lines, hydroelectric power expansion, solar/wind farm projects, or even a potential nuclear plant in Colstrip currently being discussed in town hall meetings.

Households and local businesses will take a hit. A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades like rooftop solar is a blow to Montana’s residents who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills. Incentives have made it easier for homeowners and ranchers to install solar panels, save money, and even help stabilize America’s power grid. But those benefits—and the local businesses that depend on them—are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts.

But, if they are protected, it would be a huge boost to Montana’s economy over the next decade. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will add $8 billion to the state’s economy from 2025-2035 and support 5,200 full-time jobs in Montana annually. That’s real money and real livelihoods for Montanans.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are speaking up. Four Republican Senators recently sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) wants to keep tax credits such as 45Q for carbon capture and 45U for existing nuclear power to also help reduce emissions while helping maintain dependable, affordable electricity.

Clean energy tax credits are working for Montana. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. I urge Senators Daines and Sheehy to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect all these tax credits.

The bill finally unleashes American energy dominance by opening federal lands and waters to oil, gas, coal, geothermal, and mineral leasing.","Here are 50 reasons why President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is the best chance in a generation to pass critical reforms for which Americans voted:

It delivers the largest tax cut in American history. This means an extra $5,000 in Americans’ pockets with a DOUBLE-DIGIT percent DECREASE to their tax bills. Americans earning between $30,000 and $80,000 will pay around 15% less in taxes.

It makes the Trump Tax Cuts permanent, preventing the largest tax increase ever. If the bill doesn’t pass, Americans will see the largest tax increase in history.

It raises Americans’ take-home pay by as much as $13,300 and wages by as much as $11,600.

It reverses the spending curse plaguing Washington, D.C. The bill delivers the largest deficit reduction in nearly 30 years, with $1.6 trillion in mandatory savings — the largest single reduction in mandatory spending in our country’s history.

It delivers NO TAX ON TIPS and NO TAX ON OVERTIME. This makes good on two of President Trump’s cornerstone campaign promises and will benefit hardworking Americans where they need it the most — their paychecks.

It provides historic tax cuts for seniors.

It finishes President Trump’s border wall. As a result, 701 miles of primary wall, 900 miles of river barriers, 629 miles of secondary barriers, and 141 miles of vehicle and pedestrian barriers will be constructed.

It boosts Border Patrol and ICE agents on the frontlines with the largest border security investment in history. This means funding to hire 10,000 new ICE personnel, 5,000 new customs officers, and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents to detain and deport at least one million illegal immigrants annually.

It increases the child tax credit to $2,500 per family.

It protects Medicaid for Americans who truly need it. This bill eliminates waste, fraud, and abuse by ending benefits for at least 1.4 million illegal immigrants who are gaming the system.

It implementspopular work requirements for able-bodied Americans receiving taxpayer-funded benefits. Through commonsense, Clinton-era work, volunteer, education, or training requirements, the One Big Beautiful Bill lifts Americans up to find a better quality of life through the dignity of work.

It eliminates hundreds of billions of dollars in Green New Scam tax credits. The legislation immediately stops credits from flowing to China, saving taxpayers $500+ billion every year.

It reverses electric vehicle mandates that let radical climate activists set the standards for American energy.

It ends Biden’s war on American energy. The bill finally unleashes American energy dominance by opening federal lands and waters to oil, gas, coal, geothermal, and mineral leasing.

It streamlines onerous permitting processes so America can get building again.

It refills the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to safeguard America’s energy security.

It repeals and rescinds every “green” corporate welfare subsidy in Democrats’ so-called “Inflation Reduction Act.”

It stops illegal immigrants from receiving tax credits and taxes remittances sent to foreign countries.

It supports small businesses by increasing the Section 199A deduction to 23% — promoting the growth and success of Main Street.

It incentivizes MADE IN AMERICA. The bill rewards companies that build their products in America with lower taxes — and allows Americans who buy an American-made vehicle to fully deduct their auto loan interest.

It creates new Trump Savings Accounts for newborns — allowing children across America to experience the miracle of compounded growth.

It expands access to childcare for hardworking American families.

It provides a historic increase in funding for the U.S. Coast Guard. This will help block illegal drugs and migrants from entering our country, protect our sovereignty in the Arctic, and promote our national security.

It supports building new factories to grow domestic business operations. The bill renews 100% immediate expensing and interest deductions, increases the small business deduction, and establishes 100% immediate expensing for equipment and machinery.

It helps American farmers, producers, and ranchers compete and sell products in foreign markets. The bill makes sure American farmers aren’t crowded out by foreign imports in liquid fuel production markets.

It holds woke, elitist universities accountable by increasing the endowment tax on large universities.

It protects hardworking taxpayers by canceling Biden’s illegal and unfair student loan bailouts.

It ends taxpayer-funded sex changes. It reverses the Biden-era mandate that Medicaid cover so-called “gender transition” procedures — ending the taxpayer-funded chemical castration and mutilation of American children.

It’s a once-in-a-generation chance to revolutionize our nation’s defense capabilities and protect the homeland against new threats by funding President Trump’s Golden Dome.

It enhances the capacity of America’s naval fleet. The bill provides billions of dollars to revitalize America’s shipbuilding and maritime industrial base.

It modernizes air traffic control — fulfilling President Trump’s plan to completely overhaul the systems that keep Americans flying safely and efficiently.

It strengthens SNAP benefits. The legislation requires states to contribute a greater portion of the cost of administering benefits, thereby controlling costs, and closes the excessively broad loopholes for work requirements.

It implements critical program integrity and cost containment provisions in Medicaid to strengthen it for future generations. These include removing deceased individuals from the program and limiting retroactive coverage from three months to one month prior to enrollment.

It safeguards Second Amendment rights by removing tax and registration requirements for firearm silencers and eliminating silencers from the National Firearms Act.

It provides critical disaster recovery funding to farmers, producers, and ranchers.

It provides funding to rebuild America’s military — including $9+ billion to improve quality of life for our servicemembers, $20+ billion to bolster U.S. munitions production, and $12+ billion to modernize our nuclear arsenal.

It expands health savings accounts to give Americans greater choice and flexibility in how they spend their money.

It gives $10,000 bonuses annually over the next four years to Border Patrol and ICE agents on the frontlines.

It incentivizes scholarships that empower American families and students to choose the education that best fits their needs.

It repeals Democrats’ insane attack on the gig economy — ending the requirement that Venmo, PayPal, and other gig transactions over $600 be reported to the IRS.

It reforms and streamlines the federal student loan program to drive down tuition costs and simplify repayment plans. This includes reasonable limits on amounts students can borrow.

It strengthens accountability for students and taxpayers on federal student loans. The bill imposes “skin in the game” requirements to hold universities financially accountable to the government on defaulted federal student loans.

It implements critical reforms to Pell Grants to make sure they prioritize students who truly need financial assistance while promoting completion. The legislation allows grants to be used for short-term, high-quality workforce training programs to support Americans who want to learn a trade instead of the traditional four-year colleges.

It increases timber sales on federal lands. This means an increase in timber production and improvement to forest management — improving the resilience of timber and saving billions on future wildfire suppression costs.

It authorizes the sale of expanded spectrum MHz to strengthen rural broadband and secure America’s technological dominance in AI and other emerging technologies.

It creates permanent fees that illegal immigrants must pay for their applications so American taxpayers aren’t saddled with covering these costs. These fees will bring in over $77 billion to cover adjudication costs and fund immigration processes and enforcement actions.

It protects family farmers. The bill prevents the greedy death tax from hitting two million family-owned farms who would otherwise see their exemptions cut in half and cuts taxes on farmers by over $10 billion.

It ends abusive financing practices in Medicaid by freezing existing provider taxes and prohibiting new provider taxes. This ensures states cannot improperly increase the federal government’s cost-share of a state Medicaid program at the expense of taxpayers.

It reins in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren has long functioned as another woke, weaponized arm of the bureaucracy — with minimal accountability or oversight — that leverages its power against certain industries and individuals disfavored by the so-called “elites.”

It rolls back harmful Biden-era regulations that increase cost and administrative burdens with limited flexibility for states. These burdensome regulations, such as federal staffing mandates at nursing homes, lead to closures, reduced access to care, and increased costs, particularly in areas already overwhelmed by labor shortages.",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 05:03:48.767515

When it comes to energy mix, one size does not fit all. Each country or region has distinct needs and demands that shape their respective energy-mix strategies. Different regions and countries are exploring varied strategies to become more energy resilient. These strategies have decades-long time frames and aim at diversification and distribution, with implications for regional planning and how energy portfolios intersect with economic development strategies.

Economic security and resilience to external shocks

With fossil fuels highly concentrated regionally,10 most nations have long relied on imports to meet their energy needs, so diversifying their energy mix is increasingly imperative as energy demand rise.

Research shows that renewable energy is more evenly distributed,11 which can help mitigate some countries’ concerns related to high import costs or disruptions in critical supply. As such, many nations are accelerating investments in new energy sources. China, the world’s largest oil importer,12 has made significant strides in clean energy development. Currently, non-fossil energy accounts for more than 21% of China's primary energy production mix, nearly doubling its share within a decade.13 Even nations rich in fossil fuels, such as the United States, are progressively incorporating low-carbon sources into their energy portfolios. In 2023, non-fossil sources contributed over 16% of the US primary energy production mix.14

Balancing sustainability and economic realities

Some governments worldwide are increasingly prioritizing sustainable growth and reducing carbon emissions.15 Governments are balancing sustainability goals with practical realities. The result: The transition to a low-carbon future will be gradual. Many countries will continue to use fossil fuels even as they increasingly prioritize clean energy and low-carbon sources. Consider India, whose energy supply remains heavily reliant on coal (46%) and crude oil (24%), much of which is imported.16 As the world’s most populous nation, India faces the challenge of balancing sustainability with economic stability. While it is actively diversifying its energy mix by expanding clean energy sources, particularly solar power, fossil fuels will likely remain a critical component of its energy strategy for the foreseeable future to avoid hindering economic growth.

Playing to strengths

Beyond economic and sustainability drivers, countries continue to explore particularly suitable energy sources. It’s no surprise, for example, that India and China—with massive territory and abundant sun—have turned to solar power.17 By contrast, when Denmark sought to diversify its energy base during the 1970s oil crisis, it zeroed in on wind energy due to its coastal geography and consistent strong winds.18 Denmark has developed a comprehensive energy policy; it has introduced certain taxes and incentives, removed specific legislative barriers, built innovation ecosystems, and carried out permitting and regulatory reforms—all focused on developing wind energy infrastructure.19 In 2023, wind energy supplied half of the country’s electricity demand, with the goal of reaching 60% by 2030.20

Catalyzing energy-mix strategic choices

Governments can make the strategic choice to develop a road map for a future energy mix. To help diversify an energy base by increasing the share of low-carbon energy alternatives in the energy mix, countries may need actions on both the supply and demand side to enhance both the generation and end use of clean energy.

On the supply side, governments can consider streamlining regulations, upgrading grid infrastructure, supporting domestic manufacturing of clean energy equipment and components, and funding research and development. On the demand side, they can incentivize industries to decarbonize, promote broader electrification in transportation, and simplify the permitting process for energy connections to local grids.

Government leaders should combine industrial policies, regulatory approaches, incentive structures, and other policy nudges to help build long-term energy resiliency and security.

Strategic investments catalyzing clean energy growth

Governments often play a crucial role, both directly and indirectly, in shaping energy resilience efforts, marshaling private sector investment, and ensuring that systems work together.

In the United States, data indicates that recent industrial policies have served as force multipliers for advancing new energy sources and related technologies, such as biofuels, clean hydrogen, and nuclear energy.21

The European Green Deal aims to make the European Union climate-neutral by 2050 and has set a 2030 target of reducing emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels. Clean energy deployment is a key goal, intensified by a regional gas crisis created in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.22 In 2023, EU countries invested US$110 billion in clean energy generation, an increase of 6% from the previous year.23 The European Union aims to guide its energy transition via clear sectoral and economywide standards.24 China is focusing on investment, putting US$676 billion toward energy transition projects in 2023.25

Regulatory sandboxes to accelerate innovations in new energy solutions

Testing innovative technologies in real-life settings with fewer restrictions can help shape regulatory frameworks while developing breakthrough solutions.26 Singapore’s Energy Market Authority sandbox allows temporary regulatory waivers to test new products and services in a safe space27—for instance, setting up and exploring virtual power plants: digital platforms that bundle distributed energy systems to operate as a single power generator.28 Similarly, the Northern German Living Lab tests innovations in clean energy sources, including testing hydrogen energy in the industrial and mobility sectors.29

The Intermountain Power Agency’s Intermountain Power Project, currently reliant on coal to power parts of Utah and southern California,30 aims to phase out coal in favor of natural gas and, eventually, hydrogen. The project looks to use clean energy sources to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, storing the latter in underground salt caverns to be used as fuel for electricity-generating turbines. The project aims to begin with 30% hydrogen fuel and transition to 100% by 2045 as technology improves.31

Supporting industry-led efforts to manage new energy demands

Few technologies have had such a rapid and profound impact on energy systems as artificial intelligence. Initial estimates put the energy demand of Al-driven data centers worldwide to be as high as Japan’s annual energy usage by as early as 2026.32

While continuous innovation within the industry is enhancing the energy efficiency of Al solutions—a trend expected to accelerate in the coming years33—government support can further catalyze innovation in critical areas. For instance, the US Department of Energy has allocated US$68 million to fund 43 projects across national labs, universities, and businesses to develop more energy-efficient Al hardware and algorithms.34

Just as governments are addressing the demand side of Al’s energy needs, they are also managing the supply side by supporting industry-led efforts. Take, for example, Project Stargate in the United States, a joint venture involving leading American tech firms and SoftBank Group (a global investment holding company).35 The partnership plans to invest US$100 billion of entirely private sector funding, with the potential to scale up to US$500 billion, to create computing infrastructure designed to support AI. To ensure this infrastructure has the energy required to function effectively, the venture will support both the construction of data centers and the development of the electricity generation capacity needed to power them.36 In January 2025, the US federal government pledged its support for the venture, committing to intervene when necessary to accelerate progress.37

Regulators in some jurisdictions are putting guardrails around Al’s energy consumption. The European Parliament has introduced requirements for Al systems to log their energy consumption throughout their life cycle; such regulations enhance transparency and accountability, encouraging technology companies to prioritize energy efficiency.38

At the same time, there is a growing realization within the public sector that, despite AI’s strain on energy resources, it could also help enhance energy resilience. Hyperscalers and data centers are increasingly securing long-term purchase agreements with clean energy producers.39 These agreements not only guarantee a consistent energy supply for technology companies but also provide critical funding for new clean and low-carbon energy projects. Furthermore, they enable electricity providers and innovators to test and scale advanced energy technologies by offering a dependable source of capital.40

Moreover, AI itself can make energy systems more efficient. It can help utilities make electric grids more cost-effective, reliable, and efficient by enhancing weather and load forecasting, optimizing grid management and clean energy asset performance, accelerating storm recovery, improving wildfire risk assessment, and more.41

Building energy-resilient communities

The energy infrastructure built and scaled at the national level should percolate to the community level to help meet needs and guarantee access to uninterrupted, reliable, and affordable energy. In 2022, 91% of the world’s population had access to electricity, compared to 73% just two decades earlier. But 2022 was also the year when COVID-19 pandemic supply shocks, geopolitical tensions, and extreme weather events halted decades of progress, leaving 10 million more people without electricity access than in 2021.67

While many governments are developing strategies to improve national energy security and resilience, an equally important task is embedding energy resiliency in communities.

Empowering communities to build energy emergency preparedness

Agencies should have robust energy emergency preparedness and resiliency plans in place to help communities—urban, suburban, or rural—be prepared for energy disruptions and recover efficiently. Enhancing these plans often involves reinforcing energy systems and ensuring infrastructure can withstand and quickly recover from disruptions.

Rural electric cooperatives—member-owned, nonprofit utilities that serve rural communities in nearly every US state68—operate under a model that emphasizes local control and member engagement. This enables them to address their communities’ specific needs. By investing in resilient infrastructure and coordinating with state energy officials, rural electric cooperatives can also help ensure a reliable power supply during emergencies and natural disasters.69

Regional governments can help bolster energy resiliency in communities. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources collaborated with the cities of Stockton, Rolla, and St. James to craft a Roadmap to Resilience, aimed at equipping communities with essential resources, leading practices, and tools to fortify critical infrastructure. One component of this initiative focused on enhancing energy efficiency in buildings and homes, aiming to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters.70

Multilateral agencies also have a significant role to play. The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, through their US$220 million Ghana Energy and Development Access Project, are working to improve energy access for isolated communities in Ghana. Five mini-grids are helping convert solar power into continuous electricity for these remote areas, impacting approximately 10,000 people.71

Mitigate risks to energy infrastructure from extreme weather events

Changing weather patterns and more frequent extreme weather events can affect all types of power generation sources.72 In May 2022, a thunderstorm shut off electricity to 1.1 million Canadians73; in 2024, a Melbourne windstorm knocked out power for more than half a million customers74; the January 2025 Los Angeles wildfires knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of customers.75

With extreme weather becoming more common globally, enhancing electric grid resilience will be critical. The European Union, as part of its efforts to modernize the energy sector, has funded various smart grid projects through its research and innovation program, Horizon 2020, and its funding program for energy infrastructure, Connecting Europe Facility.76 In 2021, the US Virgin Islands used federal emergency management funds to bury electric lines underground and build wind-resistant composite poles. Along the same lines, Connecticut’s Climate Resilience Plan Grants funded walls protecting power substations from flooding.77

Build and deploy microgrids in communities

When storms or power outages shut down the main electricity grid in an area, microgrids can switch away from the main grid and continue to power homes, businesses, and critical services.78 Planned effectively, microgrids can power entire communities or single sites such as hospitals, bus stations, and military bases. In India, Chhattisgarh State Renewable Energy Development Agency has installed and operates more than 500 solar microgrids.79

Microgrids also empower smaller communities to achieve self-reliance. In Japan, the town of Mutsuzawa has established a decentralized microgrid system that uses locally produced natural gas and solar energy. Partnering with a private company, Mutsuzawa manages an energy business through a self-sustaining power system, with any energy shortfall supplemented by purchasing electricity from external sources.80",https://assets.deloitte.com/is/image/deloitte/US188031_Social:1200-x-627,N,,2025-06-04 09:08:36.745729

and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt,"" added Musk, who left the White House last week.
Asked Tuesday at a news briefing about Musk’s initial post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill.
This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.” The White House declined to offer additional comment.
“I don’t think there’s an ounce of sincerity in Elon Musk’s interest in trying to reduce red ink,” Murphy said.","Elon Musk issued a blistering criticism of the massive Republican bill for President Donald Trump’s agenda Tuesday, posting on X that it is a ""disgusting abomination.""

""I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,"" Musk wrote. ""This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.""

""It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt,"" added Musk, who left the White House last week.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the package would increase the deficit by $2.3 trillion with its tax cuts and spending hikes on immigration enforcement in the military outstripping the savings.

Musk, a top Republican donor during the 2024 elections, doubled down later in the day, posting on X: “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.”

A source familiar with the Musk-Trump relationship told NBC News that four issues, which Axios was first to report, were likely behind Musk's frustration on social media.

The source highlighted the absence of electric vehicle tax credits from the bill, which would benefit Musk's Tesla customers as one factor, and noted how Musk had been pushing for the Federal Aviation Administration to use his Starlink satellite system in their FAA control systems.

The source also pointed to personnel issues, noting that a nomination for Musk ally Jared Isaacman to serve as NASA administrator had been pulled over the weekend and that Musk himself had hoped to stay on in his special government employee capacity beyond the 130-day period, which the White House ultimately did not accommodate.

Musk, the CEO of Tesla, hadpreviously signaled his disappointment in the legislation, telling CBS News he believed it was a “massive spending bill” that “undermines” the work of his Department of Government Efficiency operation.

The remarks came as an unwelcome surprise to Republicans on Tuesday as the Senate considers changes to the version passed by the House while seeking to placate competing factions internally, including those that want to reduce the red ink.

“We obviously respect everything that Elon did with DOGE. On this particular issue, we have a difference of opinion,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters. “He’s entitled to that opinion, but we’re going to proceed full speed ahead.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said it was “a dangerous thing” for Musk to be “meddling with” the economy, noting that a debt limit hike to avert a default was part of the bill.

""This is the key to the economic resurgence of America. It’s going to be jet fuel for the economy. And the sooner we do it, the better,"" Johnson told reporters. ""And by the way, the debt ceiling is also revved into this legislation. That is a dangerous thing for Elon or anyone who has who cares about the U.S. economy to be meddling with. And I think the risk is very great.”

Musk's comments emboldened fiscal hawks like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., two rare Republicans who have voted against the measure consistently.

Some GOP senators who have supported the measure conceded that there was at least some validity to Musk's view.

“I think he has a point,” Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said, adding that Musk wasn’t giving enough credit to the “growth” that the tax cuts would bring. “I like Elon Musk, but he’s one man.”

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told NBC News: “The Senate should make the bill substantially better, and I hope and believe we will do that. There’s no doubt we need to reduce spending more.”

Other Republicans dismissed Musk’s criticism.

“I ain’t got any thoughts on that. We got a lot of work to do,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. “He doesn’t get to vote.”

The White House is seeking to codify $9.4 billion in cuts proposed by DOGE, the advisory entity Musk helmed in the initial months of Trump's second administration.

Asked Tuesday at a news briefing about Musk’s initial post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn’t change the president’s opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.”

The White House declined to offer additional comment.

Democrats, meanwhile, welcomed Musk’s criticism.

“I agree with Elon Musk,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calling his own words “something I didn’t think was imaginable” for him to say.

Still, some doubted his intentions.

“A broken clock is right twice a day,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., joked, while doubting that Musk’s criticism was about sincere concern for deficits. “I don’t think there’s an ounce of sincerity in Elon Musk’s interest in trying to reduce red ink,” Murphy said. “I think DOGE was a very transparent play to increase his profile and to help his businesses.”

The bill, as it stands, would extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, eliminate taxes on tips and overtime work and boost funding for immigration enforcement and the military. It would also make cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.

The House narrowly passed the broader package last month, but it still has several steps to clear before it reaches Trump’s desk. Any changes the Senate makes would have to go back through the House, where Republicans hold a small majority, before it can be signed into law.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a close Trump ally who voted for the measure, expressed regret on X on Tuesday over a provision she said she didn’t know was included.

Musk criticized the bill just days after Trump gave him an official send-off from the Oval Office. His stint in Washington has been the subject of withering criticism, with many pointing out that Musk, the wealthiest person in the world, was able to achieve only a fraction of the $2 trillion in cuts he had set out to make.

They also hint at lingering tensions with the Trump administration — some of which made their way to the public through news reports about tense meetings and shouting matches. Musk previously took some of his grievances public, including criticism of Trump’s tariffs.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250602-elon-musk-mn-1025-c12a49.jpg",N,,2025-06-04 03:02:28.365070

The U.S. Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), and U.S. Department of Energy (""DOE"") recently announced a second round of investment tax credit allocations for the Section 48C(e) Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit Program (""48C""), together with related guidance. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") provided $10 billion in funding for the 48C program, which supports investments in facilities and projects in the U.S. that involve clean energy products and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at industrial facilities.

The IRS, based on DOE's recommendation, may allocate 48C investment tax credits to a taxpayer for qualified investments in an advanced energy project. In March 2024, the IRS allocated approximately $4 billion of 48C credits for over 100 projects across 35 states in the first round of IRA allocations. Clean energy manufacturing and recycling projects received approximately 67% of first round allocations. $6 billion of credits are available in round two, of which approximately $2.5 billion must be allocated to projects located in certain ""energy communities."" Energy communities include certain census tracts (or adjoining tracts) with closed coal mines or retired coal-fired power plants.

The 48C credit has a base amount of 6% of the amount of qualified investments; the credit rate increases to a maximum of 30% if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. In addition to offsetting federal tax liability, 48C credits are transferable and eligible for sale to an unrelated third party. 48C credits are also eligible for direct pay for certain tax-exempt organizations.

The allocation of 48C investment tax credits is administered under a competitive, discretionary program with a multi-step application process:

Taxpayers must first submit a concept paper via the 48C program's online application portal by June 21, 2024 at 5 p.m. EST.

The DOE then evaluates concept papers and, on a rolling basis, will send a letter to the taxpayer encouraging or discouraging submission of a full application for the project. Note that a letter of discouragement does not preclude a taxpayer from filing a full 48C application.

To be considered for a 48C allocation, the taxpayer must submit a full application via the online application portal no later than 50 days after the DOE opens the portal for applications in Summer 2024 (specific date to be determined).

The DOE will review submitted applications and transmit allocation recommendations to the IRS for final consideration.

The IRS will make all round two allocation decisions no later than January 15, 2025.

48C Qualification:

Qualifying projects for the 48C program may be focused in the advanced manufacturing, energy, and automotive sectors and include investments in facilities that manufacture products such as, but not limited to:

Clean vehicles or EVs and components

Renewable energy production components

Fuel cells and energy storage systems

Electric grid modernization equipment or components

Materials such as low-carbon cement, low-carbon iron and steel, low-carbon chemicals, and other lower carbon intensity materials

Other manufacturing sectors may benefit from a separate industrial decarbonization qualification.

Equipment manufactured and deployed to enable the production of other greenhouse gas-reducing and qualifying advance energy property may be eligible.

Projects that generate renewable energy, including solar farms or wind farms, are not eligible for 48C credits. Other credits, such as the Section 48 Energy Investment Tax Credit and Section 45 Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit, may apply to clean energy development projects.

Considerations:

The timeline for round two of 48C funding is condensed as compared to the first round. Applicants must submit concept papers via the 48C program's online application portal by June 21, 2024 at 5 p.m. EST, which is 30 days from the opening of round two.

The DOE has identified certain priority areas for round two funding based on analytical criteria, including an assessment of current and anticipated supply chain gaps in areas eligible under 48C. While applicants are not required to meet one of the priority areas, the DOE will consider whether a project addresses a priority area when evaluating clean energy manufacturing and recycling projects. Round two priority funding areas include, but are not limited to:

Clean hydrogen production equipment manufacturing

Electric grid component manufacturing

Electric heat pump manufacturing

Electric vehicles and component manufacturing

Solar energy equipment manufacturing

Wind energy equipment manufacturing

Round two guidance provides clarification on potential project eligibility for certain categories and expands qualifying projects to include ""deployment"" projects that would not otherwise qualify under the industrial decarbonziation qualification. It is expected that qualification clarification and expansion will result in a highly competitive application round.

It is actually tumbling down from the pedestal where automakers positioned it.

With the development of the charging network hardly crawling and the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump's administration in full swing, customers have downsized their interest in EVs, and it is showing in sales figures.

We are rapidly approaching the halfway mark of the year, and automakers are facing a volatile market and struggling to keep up with present and upcoming regulations. Ford makes no exception. The Detroit firm reported a 16.3% increase in May, but its sales of EVs dropped by 25%, after a 39% drop last April.

The numbers point to a major shift in market preferences and is mirrored by customers' preference for hybrids, which posted a 28.9% jump in sales last month. Furthermore, the Detroit automaker registered a 17.2% increase in the purchase of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines only.

In the meantime, Lincoln sales increased 39% and the brand has the all-new Navigator to thank for it. The updated SUV's sales surged 133% year over year.

Ford and Lincoln sold a total of 29,442 electrified vehicles in May and just 6,723, while hybrids accounted for 22,719. In the meantime, customers purchased 191,517 ICE-powered Ford- and Lincoln-badged models, which represents a 17.2% increase compared to May 2024, outperforming every other type of drivetrain.

The best-selling EV crown remains on top of the Mustang Mach-E's head, as the electric crossover was up 2.8% last month. Meanwhile, in bad need of a refresh, the F-150 Lightning was down 41.7%.

Ford continues to sell SUVs best, as 83,022 customers went for a high-ride model produced by the Dearborn carmaker, with the Explorer, the Bronco, and Bronco Sport leading the way. Meanwhile, 79,817 chose a Ford truck of the F-Series.

America's only muscle car that is still powered by a V8 engine, the Ford Mustang, was 3.2% down last month for a total of 18% drop since the beginning of 2025.

May was Ford's third consecutive year-over-year double-digit sales increase. Its employee discount pricing program continues until July 4.

The Clinton site has one nuclear reactor and is the smallest of the six nuclear plants across the state, all owned by Constellation Energy.
Meta’s purchase of power from Constellation begins in 2027 and will be used for California-based Meta’s operations, the company said.
In Illinois, Meta operates a data center in DeKalb and hasn’t announced any additional plans to expand.
That bill also proposed ending a longtime ban on building new nuclear power plants to help the state meet future energy needs.","Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said it has an agreement to buy power from the Clinton nuclear power plant in central Illinois for 20 years to run data operations and support its development of artificial intelligence.

The agreement is unusual for Illinois but resembles transactions around the country as Meta and other big tech companies race to become leaders in AI technology powered by data centers that require enormous amounts of energy.

The Clinton site has one nuclear reactor and is the smallest of the six nuclear plants across the state, all owned by Constellation Energy. In 2016, state lawmakers agreed to subsidize the Clinton plant through charges on electric customers’ bills after then-owner Exelon threatened to shut it down.

The companies said the agreement could potentially lead to increasing power output from the site.

“This agreement ensures a critical plant will stay online and meet growing energy needs,” Meta said in a statement, “and allows Constellation to explore further nuclear development at the site.”

The announcement follows other big technology power agreements over the last year, including Microsoft’s purchase of energy from Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant, which is also owned by Constellation. Last fall, Constellation announced it was reopening the plant, which shut down in 2019.

The 1979 partial meltdown of a reactor at Three Mile Island was the most serious nuclear accident in U.S. history. While that reactor was retired, another reactor provided power until 2019.

Meta “figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy,” said Joe Dominguez, chief executive of Constellation.

Meta’s purchase of power from Constellation begins in 2027 and will be used for California-based Meta’s operations, the company said.

In Illinois, Meta operates a data center in DeKalb and hasn’t announced any additional plans to expand.

Next month, ComEd customers are going to see a spike in their electric bills because of growing power demand across the country.

State lawmakers just adjourned after failing to pass legislation to address increasing power demand in Illinois as data centers rapidly expand and require large amounts of electricity. The measure aimed to add solar and wind power as well as develop large batteries to store energy.

That bill also proposed ending a longtime ban on building new nuclear power plants to help the state meet future energy needs.

Business groups effectively killed the bill, saying they had concerns about the costs. Lawmakers hope to revive the effort in a short legislative session in the fall.

Three years ago, Exelon, which owns electric utility ComEd, spun off its nuclear plants across the country to form Constellation.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b03d742/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1050x599+0+75/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc8%2F74%2F89a78a4e4dcf9b6a839eb84905c5%2Fclinton-nuke.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 01:06:04.742619

First, the rising price of bitcoin could discourage miners from converting their mining facilities or selling excess power to data centers.
Nuclear, Natural Gas Generator Providers May Benefit Small modular nuclear reactors are one solution that gives companies the flexibility they’ll need.
However, small reactors are a nascent, ""next decade technology,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.
Meta on Tuesday signed a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy (CEG), America's largest nuclear power provider, to sustain its AI.","AI data centers are expected to consume a massive amount of energy in the coming years, and meeting that need could be a boon to some investments, according to Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley forecasts U.S. data centers will consume 65 gigawatts of power between 2025 and 2028, but available capacity could fall short by about 45 GW. To make up the difference, “all potential ‘de-bottlenecking’ solutions will need to be drawn upon,” the analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday.

Possible solutions, they say, include converting crypto mining operations into data centers, building data centers at large nuclear power plants, and constructing new natural gas-fired power plants.

But all of that is easier said than done. First, the rising price of bitcoin could discourage miners from converting their mining facilities or selling excess power to data centers. Second, concerns about stressing regional power grids could compel regulators to mandate that new data centers not come online until additional power sources are connected to the grid.

That’s why Morgan Stanley expects to see hyperscalers and data-center owners adopt a “bridge” approach, “in which temporary, mobile generation is deployed” to address the regulatory and economic hurdles to quickly ramping power capacity.

Nuclear, Natural Gas Generator Providers May Benefit

Small modular nuclear reactors are one solution that gives companies the flexibility they’ll need. SMRs have the added benefit of providing reliable carbon-free energy that aligns with Big Tech’s emission-reduction goals. However, small reactors are a nascent, ""next decade technology,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.

For that reason, cloud hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META) increasingly have turned to existing nuclear infrastructure during the AI buildout of the past few years. Meta on Tuesday signed a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy (CEG), America's largest nuclear power provider, to sustain its AI. Constellation and Microsoft last year agreed to bring back online a reactor at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island.

With SMRs still a ways off, new data centers are likely to rely on small, mobile natural gas generators from the likes of GE Vernova (GEV) and Caterpillar (CAT).

Hyperscalers may also buy from fuel cell manufacturers like Bloom Energy (BE), whose electricity servers are a low-carbon way to convert natural gas, biofuel, or hydrogen into power. These fuel cells, the analysts said, offer the benefit of short lead times, reliable equipment, the ability to add redundant capacity in the event of a unit failure, and exceptional flexibility in terms of power output.

Introduction and summary

The newly elected German government faces important choices in securing its energy future and sovereignty. Germany is dependent on imports to cover 95 percent of its fossil gas demand.1 The Russian invasion of Ukraine reminded Europeans of the hazards of relying on Russian gas and “the risks of blackmail, economic coercion and price shocks,” as summarized by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.2 The newly unveiled REPowerEU road map is designed to ensure “full energy independence from Russia,” pool gas demand and procurement, and accelerate renewable energy deployment and the clean energy transition.3 However, U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to leverage the recent expansion in U.S. gas export capacity and promote fossil fuel interests to demand that Europeans buy more fossil imports from the United States, without regard for Germany’s or the European Union’s forecasted gas demand and energy transition plans.4

President Trump’s actions toward Europe show that ending fossil fuel influence and maintaining sovereignty require broader strategy than solely ending Russian energy imports. As Chancellor of Germany Friedrich Merz himself said in February: “My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA … it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.”5 Chancellor Merz was speaking about the risks of relying on American military security guarantees, but the same logic applies to energy security.

Undoubtedly, the current German government faces a difficult energy security situation—one the far right has exploited to grow its political base amid soaring energy costs that have weighed heavily on the German economy since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the abrupt end of cheap Russian gas. To meet immediate energy needs and offer a credible political alternative, the government may have no choice but to rely on U.S. LNG in the short term. However, Germany must use this period to accelerate the development of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy storage solutions; modernize its electricity grid; and expand domestic clean energy capacity. Without these investments, LNG reliance risks locking the country into long-term fossil fuel dependence and continued economic vulnerability. While Germany has made important steps to end its reliance on Russia for energy needs, dependence on the United States for volatile fossil fuel imports that emit more greenhouse gases than coal is not Germany’s only or best option.

Importing U.S. LNG is expensive, disruptive to the climate, and risky to national security. Germany should not copy the U.S. playbook on natural gas, nor should it be beholden to the U.S. political and corporate interests pushing LNG on Germany. The EU is likely to reach peak LNG demand in 2025,6 and recent studies show it will have a fossil gas supply glut when accounting for the EU’s current suppliers, own production, and existing contracts. Future energy needs can be met with cleaner and more affordable energy solutions, which are the more responsible choice for protecting all consumers and households from rising energy costs, preserving German energy independence, decreasing local pollution, and mitigating the climate crisis. Germany’s thriving clean tech businesses, innovators, and workforce are ready to meet the challenges ahead.

Fossil gas remains a risky and costly option, and long-term reliance on U.S. LNG is out of line with Germany’s climate targets and the global climate targets needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.7 Taking into account methane emissions during production and transport, U.S. LNG can have higher emissions than coal.8 Moreover, expensive long-term LNG contracts lock in high prices, and the import infrastructure LNG requires relies on domestic subsidies in order to be viable. Neither Germany nor the European Union can afford a wave of new, long-term LNG supply agreements.

Long-term LNG contracts may enrich oil and gas companies, but ordinary citizens—both German and American—will end up paying the price by overpaying for energy.

This report documents both the risks Germany would face by making long-term commitments to purchase unnecessary LNG from the United States and the economic and environmental costs Americans would bear as a result of increasing exports of fossil gas. The final sections identify more affordable, clean, and sustainable ways for Germany to meet its heating, power, and industrial energy needs.

Oil and gas companies tout LNG as a cheap and clean source of energy, but its economic, political, and emission profile is costly for consumers, risky for importing countries’ independence, and damaging to public health and the climate. Long-term LNG contracts may enrich oil and gas companies, but ordinary citizens—both German and American—will end up paying the price by overpaying for energy.

Increased LNG imports undermine Germany’s economic and energy independence

Global demand and consumption of fossil gas, branded by the industry as “natural gas,” has increased almost every year since the 1980s.9 The United States did not start exporting LNG until 2016, but in less than a decade, it has become the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas—fossil gas compressed for transportation over long distances.10 Shell expects LNG demand to rise 60 percent over the next 15 years, driven largely by demand in China and India.11

Germany’s gas imports, whether by pipeline or LNG terminals from neighboring countries, peaked in 2019 at 6,042,840 terajoules, dropped precipitously in 2022, and slightly rebounded in 2024.12 However, compared with average consumption from 2018 to 2021, Germany consumed about 14 percent less natural gas in 2024.13

Germany’s demand for and consumption of gas is decreasing and the utilization of newly created LNG terminals is low, but the nation plans to further expand the recently created LNG import capacity.14 During the European energy crises of 2022, the United States rerouted LNG destined for Asian markets to the European Union, including to Germany, to provide emergency support. Over the past 10 years, German banks and technology companies have provided more than $4.4 billion in loans for the construction of LNG export terminals in the United States.15 Furthermore, bonds amounting to about $675 million were secured.16 In addition to direct financing of projects, long-term supply contracts have also been signed between U.S. LNG operators and German companies.17 Most deliveries are scheduled to start in 2026 or 2027 and will run for up to 20 years.18 Currently, almost all of the LNG imported to Germany already comes from the United States; in 2024, the share was 86 percent.19

Now, the Trump administration is looking for buyers of additional LNG from U.S. export terminals, already securing agreements with Bangladesh (nonbinding), India (in negotiation, despite needing to offload LNG from the current contract),20 Saudi Arabia (20-year contract),21 and Qatar (to invest in U.S. LNG export terminals).22 The Qatari investment in U.S. LNG terminals was announced as part of President Trump’s visit and economic investment deal with Qatar, from which President Trump was gifted a jet and where the Trump Organization also announced it would be investing $5.5 billion in a golf club in Qatar.23 Eight U.S. LNG export terminals approved by the first Trump administration to export LNG to countries without a free-trade agreement have yet to start construction, and the U.S. LNG industry is hungry for buyers while facing high costs24 and competition, especially from Qatar.25

Germany does not require new LNG contracts or infrastructure for energy security

American systems scientist Peter Senge wrote, “Today’s problems come from yesterday’s solutions.”26 This is the case with the rushed expansion of LNG exports from the United States to Germany, during a desperate time in response to the cutoff of Russian gas following its invasion of Ukraine. While Germany undoubtedly faces ongoing concerns around energy security, the energy crisis is definitely over; and now, additional long-term LNG contracts will weaken, rather than strengthen, German energy security. No new LNG contracts or expansion of LNG import capacity is necessary to secure energy supply going forward.27 In fact, Germany navigated the Russian gas cutoff rather well, especially through an increase of fossil gas imports via Norway and the Netherlands, energy efficiency, and a fast scale-up of renewable alternatives.28 Germany can now make decisions that are strategically aligned with its long-term interests.

As a result of the energy crisis, the German government passed the LNG Acceleration Act, “LNG-Beschleunigungsgesetz,” to ramp up LNG infrastructure and imports on a large scale. In an unprecedented move, the 2022 law weakened participation rights and canceled environmental impact assessments for floating terminals, known as floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs).29 The former German government coalition seized on LNG as the primary solution for securing Germany’s energy supply. Politicians at the German and European levels are still pushing for new long-term LNG contracts with the United States, with the idea featuring prominently in the EU Affordable Energy action plan30 and the German government’s new coalition treaty.31

These emergency measures have proven unnecessary. Significant LNG import capacity only came online when the worst of the crisis was over. Based on the prior record of delayed projects and deliveries due to explosions, hurricanes, and construction delays,32 as well as looming global oversupply,33 U.S. LNG contracts may be an unreliable solution to other countries’ energy needs.

The German import terminals are likewise facing significant viability issues due to low capacity utilization,34 needing public subsidies to even be viable.35 Nine LNG terminals are currently planned in Germany. Despite receiving expedited permits, only four of the six permitted FSRUs are currently operating. (see Figure 1) These four FSRUs went into operation in Brunsbüttel, Mukran, and Wilhelmshaven—where there are two units. Meanwhile, onshore terminals will be added in a second expansion phase in Stade, Wilhelmshaven, and Brunsbüttel; these onshore capacities are scheduled to go into operation in 2027 and 2028.

FIGURE 1

Germany’s ramp-up of LNG import capacity was designed to meet demand that no longer exists and is expected to continue to decline. As noted earlier, approximately 14 percent less natural gas was consumed in Germany in 2024 compared with average consumption between 2018 and 2021.36 For 2024, the German government predicted a fossil gas demand of 85 billion cubic meters (bcm).37 However only a total of 73 bcm, or 844 terawatt hours, of fossil gas were consumed in 2024.38

A 2024 meta-study by the Öko-Institut on the major climate neutrality scenarios, including the official scenarios from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, shows that Germany’s natural gas consumption will fall by 28 percent to 63 percent by 2035.39 The EU’s gas demand is similarly set to fall rapidly, decreasing 29 percent from 2024 levels by 2030 and 67 percent by 2040, according to the European Commission’s impact assessment for the proposed 90 percent emissions reduction target by 2040.40

If all LNG projects were implemented as planned, Germany would have an overcapacity of at least 50 billion cubic meters in 2030.

At approximately 6.9 bcm, the three German LNG terminals currently operating represent a relatively minor portion—roughly 8 percent—of the total gas imports that were fed into the German grid in 2024.41 However, LNG import capacity currently being planned would increase to about 58 bcm by 2030, well in excess of domestic demand, even as the operating terminals in Germany ran at less than 50 percent average capacity in 2024 due to low demand. Together with already existing imports via pipelines and neighboring terminals of around 69 bcm—including from Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium—Germany is rushing to increase its fossil gas import capacity to ﷟127 bcm in 2030,42 although even conservative estimates expect a maximum of 74 bcm of national fossil gas demand in the same year.43 If all LNG projects were implemented as planned, Germany would have an overcapacity of at least 50 bcm in 2030. Such overcapacity would be a dangerous energy policy failure and economic boondoggle, especially if public subsidies are footing the upfront bill and shouldering the downside risk in long-term contracts.

FIGURE 2

A recent study looking at the EU’s future gas supply similarly finds that by 2035, there will be a fossil gas supply glut in the EU, taking into account production in Norway and Algeria, the EU’s foremost suppliers; its own production; and existing contracts.44 Europe’s Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) concluded that the EU is likely to have reached peak LNG demand in 2024.45

FIGURE 3

LNG ramp-up in Germany would worsen climate damage

The creation of massive LNG overcapacities would drive both Germany and exporting countries into a fossil path dependency as German investments flow both into import capacities and export facilities in the United States.46

The creation of new fossil infrastructure conflicts with the German Climate Protection Act, which stipulates that Germany must achieve greenhouse gas neutrality by 2045.47 Yet a recently published report confirms that Germany is about to fail its climate targets after 2030 and might reach its 2030 target only due to the economic recession caused by the global pandemic.48 The import terminals Germany is planning to have in 2030—if used to their full capacity to import U.S. LNG—would lead to 870 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, when the gas is burned. Additionally, the production of the gas would cause 2.9 million tons of methane emissions based on the methane intensity factor provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Such warming potential equates to 85.4 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) over a time span of 100 years, or up to 236.4 million tons of CO2e if the impacts of the two gases are compared over 20 years.49 The massive amounts of CO2 and methane emissions that could be emitted by the LNG terminals and the combustion of the imported LNG would consume a large part of the remaining budget that Germany still has to meet in line with the Paris Agreement.

Climate impact of U.S. fossil gas and LNG

Fossil, or “natural,” gas is made up of 70 to 90 percent methane—a potent, planet-warming gas that accounted for 12 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 and is worsening the climate crisis.50 The climate impact of fossil gas is so high due to the potency of methane, which “has more than 80 times the warming power” of CO2 over 20 years.51 In fact, the carbon footprint of U.S.-fracked gas converted into LNG is at least as bad as that of coal when accounting for the methane leaks that occur during extraction, transportation, and storage.52 Recent studies have shown that methane pollution caused by U.S. oil and gas extraction is more than four times higher than official figures and more than eight times higher than industry targets.53 From production to distribution, fracking produces significant methane pollution at every step in the process, including from gas leaks, combustion, and contamination, while the underregulated nature of the industry has led to flaring and venting during oil and gas production, which are also large sources of methane emissions.54 A recent study notes, “Even [considering] the time frame of 100 years after emission, which severely understates the climatic damage of methane, the LNG footprint equals or exceeds that of coal.”55 In other words, even apart from the other environmental and human rights impacts, U.S. LNG derived from fracked gas is some of the most climate-damaging fossil gas available on the market.

Substituting Germany’s reliance on LNG from Russia with reliance on the United States does not guarantee security

Replacing dependence on Russia with dependence on the United States only shifts the problem to reliance on another world power with an expansive military that is renegotiating their commitments to European security.56 Russian President Vladimir Putin has used energy as a weapon to divide Europe and punish Ukraine, and U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly signaled he would rather abandon Ukraine entirely than undermine thawing relations with the Kremlin.57 In that scenario, German LNG contracts with the United States could easily become a bargaining chip in a broader geopolitical game—subject to pressure, price hikes, or outright disruption if Berlin pushes back against the Trump administration’s reproachment with Russia or does not give in to Trump’s demands in the trade war kicked off by his administration’s tariff hikes.58 Qatar, another top exporter of LNG, has also made clear its intention to use LNG for political leverage, issuing an ultimatum to cut off LNG from Europe if the latter were to enforce its law allowing liability for damages related to labor and environmental violations.59

Trump’s claims that world leaders are “dying to make a deal” as well as other derogatory remarks in response to his administration’s tariffs suggest that he intended to use them as leverage over other countries.60 Indeed, President Trump’s recent demand that Europe buy an additional $350 billion in fossil energy from the United States to balance the trade deficit and obtain tariff relief is a prime example of what Europe would expose itself to by increasing dependence on U.S. LNG.61 For its part, the EU has recently submitted an offer to buy a total of 50 billion in goods from the United States, of which LNG would probably account for a significant proportion.62 Furthermore, as part of tariff negotiations, internal government messages obtained by The Washington Post demonstrate that the U.S. State Department recently put pressure on countries to adopt Elon Musk’s Starlink for satellite internet services.63

Germany cannot afford to build its energy future on political quicksand.

The Trump administration’s prioritization of corporate interests over the national or public interest is not unique to promoting U.S. LNG. A far cry from diplomacy based on peacebuilding and respect for sovereignty, the Trump administration negotiated for U.S. companies to have access to Ukraine’s mineral wealth as a step to ending the Russian invasion of Ukraine.64 President Trump is now seeking to give U.S. investors access to Russian gas infrastructure, such as the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and restore Russia’s gas exports to the EU, a move strongly rejected by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and one that would revert to the EU’s vulnerability and reliance on Russia.65

Germany cannot afford to build its energy future on political quicksand; and that’s exactly what locking in long-term LNG contracts with the United States under the Trump administration would mean. If the EU and Germany are serious about maintaining leadership and action on climate, they cannot allow President Trump’s fossil fuel agenda to dictate the terms of transatlantic energy trade.66 The Trump administration has already proven willing to weaponize trade and foreign policy.67 It has turned on allies before—imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada, holding military aid to Ukraine hostage, and ripping up international agreements.68 Germany would face serious risks tying its energy security to an administration that views alliances as transactions and energy as leverage; locking in long-term contracts could pass this leverage on to successive U.S. presidents, without real checks on potential abuse of that power.

New U.S.-German LNG agreements are already being signed

A prime example of a potentially imprudent and harmful contract is the 15-year contract between Delfin LNG and the state-owned German company Securing Energy for Europe (SEFE), signed in March 2025.69 For this project, Delfin would be building its deepwater port off the coast of Louisiana—a biodiversity hotspot that is already under immense ecological pressure. The Trump administration approved the Delfin deepwater port, which would be the first deepwater port for LNG in the United States.70 The Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig explosion and spill, as well as several explosions and worker fatalities and hundreds of fires and worker injuries from offshore oil and gas operations in the United States over the past decade, demonstrates the heightened risks of these projects for Gulf residents and German buyers.71 German state-owned energy company Uniper concluded another problematic LNG deal with Woodside using a Louisiana terminal in April 2025, only weeks after SEFE’s agreement with Delfin LNG.72 Woodside has an equity interest of 100 percent in Louisiana LNG LLC, in which Saudi Arabia’s Aramco agreed to invest as part of the $90 billion investment deal with the United States that President Trump announced after his recent visit.73

These agreements increase dependence on foreign imports, create political entanglements with countries that are hugely reliant on fossil fuel exports, and lock in the excessive pollution inherent to LNG while posing significant price risks to German consumers. Germany should avoid these long-term contracts.

The LNG expansion is costly and carries unnecessary economic risks

LNG is expensive, requires excessive and considerable public subsidies, and locks nations into fossil fuel-dependent economies.74 Moreover, the costs of transportation, liquefaction, and regasification required in the importation of LNG from the United States make U.S. LNG far more expensive than alternative fossil gas supplies via pipelines from countries such as Norway.75 Furthermore, the economic life of onshore LNG terminals is several decades.76 This means that constructing these terminals requires either a long-term commitment to the use of fossil gases or acceptance that these will become stranded assets if the terminals are not used and fully amortized. The construction of LNG terminals on both sides of the Atlantic is cementing the dependency on fossil gas during decades that are crucial for achieving carbon neutrality.

Many of the infrastructure projects required of LNG imports would not be economically viable without taxpayer-funded subsidies.77 Upfront capital is needed for the construction of new pipeline infrastructure, storage tanks, and guarantees, as well as the charter rates and berthing fees for the ships docking with floating terminals. The total expenditure for the charter rate of one of the currently permitted German FSRUs is an average of 55 million euros net per year, which equates to an approximate daily cost of more than net 150,000 euros.78 For the floating terminals alone, costs are significantly higher than the estimated marketing revenues of the German government.79 Government subsidies would be better spent on the deployment of clean energy technologies.

Even as large as these public expenditures are, returns on these investments cannot be guaranteed. For example, public investment in the infrastructure-related site costs for the FSRU terminals amounts to about 6.9 billion euros—excluding any income generated from the federal government subchartering to private operators or from the sale of pipeline pipes to private operators.80 However, some of the assumed revenues from the FSRU terminals have already failed to materialize, due to cost overruns and project delays, lower-than-expected demand, and competition from other energy sources. For example, the subchartering of the FSRU in the Baltic Sea did not work out due to the private operator reneging on the contract.81 These risks result in additional costs to the public: The state guarantees at least 8.7 billion euros that can be drawn on to compensate operators for shortfalls in expected revenues, as well as several million in state investments for the construction of onshore LNG terminals.82

Building up LNG infrastructure means locking in higher costs for decades to come instead of investing in renewable and zero-emission technologies, which are dropping in price.

State investments will also flow into the three planned onshore terminal facilities in Stade, Brunsbüttel, and Wilhelmshaven, where some investment decisions have already been made binding. Public funding for the project in Brunsbüttel currently amounts to 940 million euros, with the German development bank KfW acquiring a 50 percent stake in the undertaking.83 This massive amount of state aid stands out in particular and is currently contested in a court case by Hanseatic Energy Hub, the prospective operator of the Stade onshore terminal that will directly compete with Brunsbüttel.84 The European Commission had previously approved 40 million euros in state aid in the form of a preferential dividend mechanism for the Brunsbüttel terminal without even considering the KfW stake as a subsidy.85

The German government—not private companies—is taking on the risk of overpayment amid lower-than-contracted demand. Should the conditions for the guarantees materialize, the federal budget could incur total costs for all LNG terminals of at least 16.8 billion euros.86 (see Figure 4)

In addition to the economic risk, locking in LNG infrastructure would cement high costs for German households for the long term. The gas price for German household customers is composed of three constituent elements. First, there are the costs associated with procurement, accounting for approximately 73 percent of the total price; these costs include extraction, transportation, sales, and traders’ margins. Second, there are the fees for the use of the corresponding energy infrastructure, accounting for 12 percent of the total price; these fees are known as regulated network charges. Third, there are other levies and taxes, which account for about 15 percent of the total price; examples of such taxes include the CO2 price, concession fees, and the gas tax and value-added tax (VAT).87

LNG is more expensive to transport and store than other forms of energy.88 Building up LNG infrastructure means locking in higher costs for decades to come instead of investing in renewable and zero-emission technologies, which are dropping in price.89 At a time when households and industries are already squeezed by inflation and energy price shocks, this is no way to establish a resilient economy.90

Climate change continues to escalate the intensity and frequency of hurricanes and flooding along the American Gulf Coast, where the vast majority of LNG export facilities are located, further increasing the physical and financial risks and unreliability of U.S. LNG export facilities.91 In 2024, Hurricane Beryl resulted in temporary closures of Freeport LNG, an export terminal located in Texas, and even with its multiple 20-year, long-term agreements under “take or pay” terms, where the customers—not Freeport LNG—bear the risk of natural gas supply, Fitch Ratings still downgraded Freeport LNG’s default risk and rating.92 The high climate disaster risk in the Gulf of Mexico and underregulated nature of the LNG industry in the United States could result in disruption to LNG deliveries from these facilities, potentially increasing the costs of finding alternative supplies with little notice.

German LNG infrastructure is vulnerable to security threats, accidents, and climate-related disasters

The operation and construction of LNG infrastructure in Germany poses new security threats due to the terminals’ location and surrounding infrastructure.93 Many terminals are situated near sensitive sites such as closed nuclear plants, petrochemical clusters, important shipping routes, and residential areas, raising concerns about potential vulnerabilities in case of accidents or attacks. Their proximity to residential areas and nature reserves also heightens the risk of damage to communities in the event of a disaster. The fact that security risks are not sufficiently managed is proven by an accident that recently took place when the LNG carrier Iberica Knutsen ran aground before the island of Rügen.94 And the terminals’ location along busy marine routes, such as the Elbe River, which features narrow waterways, complicates both maritime traffic management and emergency response, and requires security expenses and monitoring.95 Building up these large, permanent LNG capacities in Germany instead of quickly ramping down gas consumption introduces new vulnerabilities to sabotage and attacks on critical points in Germany’s energy import infrastructure. LNG facilities can be exploited by hostile parties in an increasingly volatile geopolitical atmosphere and unstable climate.

LNG facilities can be exploited by hostile parties in an increasingly volatile geopolitical atmosphere and unstable climate.

LNG terminal facilities are also first-class hazardous incident facilities. The 2022 explosion and fireball at the U.S. LNG facility in Freeport, Texas, was a reminder of the extreme explosive potential of compressed fossil gas. Although the explosion was felt miles away,96 Freeport LNG claimed that “[a]t no time did the incident pose a threat to the surrounding community.” The facility was allowed to reopen just eight months later, despite a U.S. Department of Energy probe concluding that the explosion was a result of overworked staff leading to operator fatigue as well as faulty operating procedures.97

Climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, and even minor alterations in mean sea level have the capacity to enhance the frequency and intensity of flood events.98 It is anticipated that storm surges, heavy rainfall events, and flooding will become both more extreme and more frequent. The effects of these phenomena are already clearly observable in the Baltic and North seas as well as along the Elbe River.99 The Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) was published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2019.100 The findings from the SROCC demonstrate that the rate of sea level rise for the 1993–2015 measurement period is significantly higher than the average rise assumed in the IPCC’s last report, from 2013.

Yet recent studies of floods in Germany, including 2021 floods in Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia, as well as Storm Viktor in October 2023, have not been incorporated into the planning for the new LNG terminals in Germany. These floods, which have been described as “floods of the century,” or historical centennial events, had serious consequences and will occur more frequently in the future due to climate change.101 Assessments of the so-called floods of the century have also not been incorporated into analysis by the authorities responsible for issuing permits.

Pollution from LNG infrastructure harms ecosystems and people

The construction and operation of onshore and floating LNG terminals in Germany means building fixed infrastructure such as pipeline connections, regular dredging of harbors, new installation of jetties, and an increase in pollutant emissions for the surrounding areas. This leads to long-term changes for the environment and wildlife as well as new threats to human health.

Impacts on ecosystems, wildlife, and fisheries

In addition to the climate, geopolitical, economic, and security effects of German LNG expansion, the environmental impact on German coastal areas would be devastating. The construction and operation of new LNG terminals is currently leading to an industrialization close to protected areas on a scale never before seen.102

The LNG Acceleration Act enables FSRUs, as well as connecting pipelines for terminals, to be built without environmental impact assessments.103 This LNG infrastructure and the increased shipping traffic pose significant threats to several Natura 2000 sites designated to conserve nature and biodiversity, as well as other protected areas. In Germany, a total of 14 Natura 2000 sites are affected by LNG infrastructure, including eight special protection areas (SPAs) for birds and six flora-fauna-habitat (FFH) sites. The construction of LNG terminals and pipelines leads to habitat destruction and fragmentation, encroaching on protected ecosystems and displacing wildlife. Large-scale construction activities disturb sensitive species, altering their natural behavior and movement patterns.104

FIGURE 5

The cumulative impacts of LNG projects threaten the integrity of protected areas by disrupting food webs, degrading habitats, and reducing biodiversity, especially among protected fish and bird species. The delicate ecological balance of these areas is altered, compromising long-term conservation goals. Despite existing mitigation efforts, the continued expansion of LNG infrastructure presents a major challenge to preserving some of Germany’s most valuable and sensitive natural habitats.

The expansion of LNG infrastructure inevitably leads to more shipping activity, increasing the likelihood of vessel collisions with marine mammals such as porpoises and seals. A typical LNG tanker carries about 0.1 bcm LNG, meaning that Germany’s envisaged LNG import capacity by 2030, if fully utilized, would lead to up to 580 additional tankers arriving every year.105 The resulting wave action and altered hydrodynamics could further degrade tidal zones and nesting habitats.106 Moreover, a higher number of vessels raises the risk of maritime accidents, including gas spills, which would have devastating consequences for fragile coastal and marine environments.

Another concern linked to LNG activities is water pollution. The discharge of heated cooling water from LNG terminals can raise local water temperatures, putting additional pressure on natural ecological balances. The release of biocides and other harmful substances further threatens aquatic life, impairing species reproduction and degrading habitat quality.107 Construction activities also contribute to increased sedimentation, which decreases water clarity and depletes oxygen, placing additional stress on already vulnerable ecosystems.

One of the most severe implications of LNG infrastructure is the impact on marine mammals, especially harbor porpoises and seals. Germany’s only native cetacean, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), is particularly vulnerable to intense underwater noise generated by ship engines, dynamic positioning systems, regasification processes, and construction activities. Chronic noise pollution interferes with their echolocation and communication, causes physiological stress, and forces them to abandon critical habitats.108 Seals, which rely on undisturbed coastal and marine environments, are similarly affected. Noise from construction and operational activities can disrupt their resting, breeding, and foraging behavior.109 Both species are highly sensitive to changes in their acoustic environment, making them especially vulnerable to the cumulative effects of LNG infrastructure near their habitats.

The cumulative impacts of LNG projects threaten the integrity of protected areas by disrupting food webs, degrading habitats, and reducing biodiversity.

In addition to acoustic disturbance, LNG projects contribute to habitat and prey loss, further endangering marine life. For instance, maintenance dredging for FSRUs, such as around the LNG terminal in Mukran in the Baltic Sea, degrades water quality and impacts the availability of herring—a key prey species for both porpoises and seals.110 Fish populations are also at risk, facing a combination of threats, including the loss of spawning grounds and feeding habitats, often due to dredging and sedimentation. Pollutant deposition from LNG operations contributes to eutrophication, which can result in oxygen-depleted “dead zones” where aquatic life cannot survive, especially in Baltic Sea ecosystems.111 Furthermore, the water intake systems used for the regasification process can cause impingement and entrainment, killing enormous amounts of fish eggs, larvae, and small organisms.112

One of the operating FSRUs in Wilhelmshaven, the Höegh Esperanza, uses sodium hypochlorite as an antifouling biocide. Permanent chlorination and the subsequent products from chemical reactions are a major threat to marine life as well as to local fisheries. These chemicals are used to prevent organisms such as mussels from growing on infrastructure; but they also have toxic effects on plankton, fish, and benthic flora and fauna when disposed to open water, disrupting the base of the marine food web and reducing overall biodiversity.113 The FSRU was approved to use biocide even though Wilhelmshaven is located next to the Wadden Sea UNESCO World Heritage Site and its pristine marine life.114 This FSRU was initially intended to be used south of Melbourne, Australia, but after failing environmental regulations due to the usage of biocide,115 it was relocated to Germany, where it is now harming a whole marine ecosystem.116

While marine species are significantly affected, LNG infrastructure also impacts migratory birds, particularly in coastal and wetland areas. Light pollution from terminals and vessels disorients birds during migration, increasing exhaustion, collisions, and mortality.117 Erosion and changes in water currents threaten tidal flats, essential feeding, and nesting grounds for numerous bird species.

Impacts on human health

Pollutant emissions from German LNG terminals are explicitly regulated, with various exemptions that pose serious health risks. The floating terminal in Wilhelmshaven that uses biocides releases large amounts of chlorine into the Jade Bay and the Wadden Sea.118 The biocide and its subsequent products from chemical reactions can accumulate in marine organisms such as mussels, which are then consumed by humans.119

In addition, the floating terminal in Brunsbüttel is allowed to emit many times the normal levels of nitrogen oxide,120 carbon monoxide,121 and formaldehyde.122 This has been regulated by the Schleswig-Holstein environmental agency through a special permit.123 Such high emissions can cause serious health problems in nearby residential areas. The pollutants are also deposited in the soil, contaminating the surrounding area. This may contribute to localized exceedances of critical nitrogen loads in nearby habitats, including forests and water bodies. In turn, this could potentially result in adverse effects on sensitive ecosystems—possibly also in areas used for recreational purposes, such as popular swimming spots around Rügen. A significant impairment of these ecosystems cannot be ruled out and may, under continued operation, be considered likely.124

While sufficient data do not yet exist on the impact of air pollution from German LNG terminals on human health due to their recent entry into operation, research on methane125 and power plant emissions,126 along with the experience of the United States, shows that they can be severe. Frequent venting and flaring of fossil gas at U.S. export terminals have been linked to catastrophic levels of air pollution, with pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, soot, volatile organic compounds, and methane far exceeding safety levels and causing respiratory illnesses, among other ailments.127 For example, the city of Port Arthur, Texas, which suffers from proximity to a highly polluting LNG terminal and other fossil infrastructure, has recently been included by the United Nations in its list of “sacrifice zones” due to its extremely high air pollution and cancer rates.128

Downstream infrastructure such as gas power and heating plants also causes major air pollution in surrounding areas. Major pollutants emitted include sulphur oxides, nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide, and methane,129 leading to respiratory illnesses and premature deaths, especially among the elderly and young as well as people with preexisting conditions. Fossil gas infrastructure contributes significantly to air pollution, which is already exceeding threshold values in several German cities.130 Plans by the new German government to build 20 gigawatts (GW)131 of new power plants instead of accelerating the expansion of renewables, batteries, and efficient grids would lock in future air pollution and health impacts as well as climate damage.132

Furthermore, the noise pollution for residential areas in the vicinity of LNG terminals is fundamentally underestimated, and relevant noise guidelines are exceeded by the terminals already in operation in some cases.133 The noise pollution at the terminals is not only caused by the generators on board the FSRUs or by the regasification and loading processes but also by the gas combustion units, which are designed to burn excess gas in a controlled manner in emergencies. According to the operating licenses, this system may only be used in the event of danger to public safety or to avert an operational emergency. The fact that the gas combustion units onboard FSRUs in Germany frequently flare gas is a cause for concern. Either there are constant emergencies that pose a risk to public safety, or the company systematically disregards the regulations. Both are unacceptable and endanger people and animals.

Moreover, noise pollution impairs the quality of life of people living near the plants. Noise from the turbines disturbs sleep and rest periods. Depending on the wind direction, the noise is also carried several kilometers inland. And people suffer not only from the constant roar of turbines but also from low-frequency sounds that lead to harmful conditions for residents.134 Both are harmful to the health of humans and animals. The low-frequency sounds pass through walls, windows, and doors.135 There are no working hours, no closing times, and no rest periods—such as on weekends or at night—to which operators adhere.

Light pollution from the FSRUs is also negatively affecting residential areas. LNG terminals are illuminated 24 hours a day, but the strong lighting at night can lead to sleep disorders and increase the risk of diseases such as obesity, depression, diabetes, and cancer.136 Excessive lighting impairs the quality of life for people living near the installations. As part of the emissions-control approval process, permitting authorities of the German LNG terminals found that calculated illuminance levels and the values for psychological glare, particularly at night, were well below the illuminance guide values. However, the estimated lighting intensity from the plants in these simulations may not correspond to the actual conditions and must be verified and monitored.137

The high levels of pollution, light, and noise associated with LNG terminals have a massive impact on the health of the local environment and the people who live there, and these externalities and quality-of-life concerns disfavor further expansion of LNG import facilities.

Exporting LNG increases energy costs and pollution exposure for Americans

U.S. exports of LNG have expanded rapidly over the past decade, but with significant negative externalities for many Americans. U.S. households and businesses are now exposed to global gas markets, in addition to global oil markets. The lifecycle of LNG—from fracking fields in Appalachia to pipelines crisscrossing dozens of states to compression terminals primarily along the Gulf Coast—increases pollution for millions of Americans in its wake.

LNG exports increase energy costs for American households and businesses

In the United States, exports of liquefied natural gas have contributed to increased energy costs for Americans. LNG exports raise domestic prices by increasing demand for gas produced in the United States and connecting domestic gas markets to higher global prices, which increases domestic exposure to price fluctuations in the global market and the consequences of geopolitical conflicts, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Residential natural gas prices generally decreased between 2009 and 2018 as a result of increased shale gas production.138 In 2016, the United States built its first LNG export facility and became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017.139 Residential gas prices increased by 38.8 percent between 2019 and 2024, in nominal terms, partially due to rapid growth of LNG exports and the integration of domestic and international natural gas markets.140

LNG Exports Raise Natural Gas Prices for Americans

Chris Martinez

In November 2021, utilities across the country filed requests to raise natural gas rates, citing a supply squeeze from increased global demand.141 The following year, the United States increased exports to Europe amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and domestic natural gas prices in the United States reached highs not seen since 2008, with residential prices averaging $14.75 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).142 Residential and industrial natural gas prices in 2022 were 36.8 percent and 131.6 percent higher, respectively, than prices in 2020. Meanwhile, U.S. expenditures on natural gas across sectors in 2022 were 38 percent higher than expenditures in 2021, while consumption only increased by percent.143 New England, one of the few U.S. regions that relies on LNG imports and hence competes with the global market directly, saw a weighted-average price between December 2021 and November 2022 that was triple the price over the same period between 2020 and 2021.144

In addition to the effect of global geopolitical tensions on U.S. domestic prices, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) analyzed the general relationship between expanding LNG exports and domestic natural gas prices. The DOE analysis showed that an unconstrained increase in LNG exports would be associated with higher U.S. residential natural gas and electricity prices in 2050, with households experiencing up to a $122.54 annual increase in energy expenditures.145 Furthermore, the analysis showed that increasing LNG exports would not only increase household energy costs as a result of exposure to the global market but also increase indirect costs passed through from U.S. manufacturers who themselves would face overall energy cost increases of up to $125 billion.146

Other studies reiterate the relationship between expanding LNG exports and U.S. domestic prices. An analysis from the nongovernmental organization Resources for the Future found that domestic gas prices could see more than twice the increase estimated by the DOE.147 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) found that higher LNG exports resulted in upward pressure on domestic natural gas prices, while lower LNG exports resulted in downward pressure.148 The EIA analysis projects wholesale natural gas prices by 2050149 under a scenario with faster build-out of LNG terminals and higher LNG prices than a reference case with restricted LNG capacity expansion. Public Citizen analysis, building on EIA modeling, found that increased export capacity would cost domestic consumers $14.3 billion in 2050.150 More recently, the EIA forecasted the average 2026 Henry Hub price at $4.80/MMBtu, which is more than double the price from 2024, attributing the increase to rising LNG demand.151 Continuing or expanding U.S. LNG exports would further increase domestic natural gas and electricity prices, with negative economic impacts on both American consumers and businesses—except for the oil and gas industry itself.

Pollution from the lifecycle of LNG inflicts harm on American families, especially low-income and working-class households

The upstream impacts of LNG throughout its lifecycle—from extraction to transportation through pipelines and freight to liquefaction and storage—all emit harmful pollution that harms American families, especially low-income and working-class households and communities.

Extraction

Nearly 80 percent of U.S. natural gas is produced by hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” a process that blasts fluid below the earth’s surface to release oil and gas reserves within sedimentary rock.152 Countless studies have shown that fracking has exposed residents in the United States to dangerous chemicals that compromise their health and development and that “regulations are incapable of preventing harm” inherent in the process of gas and oil extraction—including air and water pollution, increased earthquakes and tremors, radioactive waste, and well leaks.153 Across the United States, these harms have been linked to increased heart attacks, early deaths among older adults, higher risk of cancer in children, worsened asthma symptoms, poor childbirth and child development outcomes, poor mental health, and high levels of migraine and fatigue symptoms.154 An analysis of fracking in the Appalachian region, which spans across 13 U.S. states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee, found that between 2004 to 2016—even prior to increased production for LNG exports—1,200 to 4,600 premature deaths from fracking-related pollution in communities yielded economic costs of $23 billion and climate costs of $34 billion.155

Fossil gas extraction is also a source of human rights violations and environmental injustices, as it concentrates pollution in specific geographies and neighborhoods along economic and racial lines.156 More than 18 million Americans live within a mile of a fracked oil or gas well, and a disproportionate share of them belong to marginalized or vulnerable groups, including 3 million older adults, 3 million who live in households below the poverty line, more than 1 million young children, and millions of people of color.157 For instance, in the majority-Latino town of West Odessa, Texas, residents are situated in the “heart” of the most productive gas and oil field in the United States.158 Though the fracking boom in Texas’ Permian Basin has brought jobs to the region, they have “come at a cost” for communities confronted by dangerous toxins and undrinkable water—only a single spill or explosion away from ruin.159 In fact, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently concluded that oil and gas fracking brings a high risk of unsafe drinking water.160 As a result of oil and gas production, Americans had $77 billion in additional health costs in 2016 alone, as a result of 410,000 cases of worsened asthma, 2,200 new cases of asthma in children, and 7,500 excess deaths.161

At both a community level and on a national scale, the science has shown that fossil gas and fracking are clear threats to the health of the American people.162

Transportation over land

In addition to extraction, the pipelines and facilities that contain fossil gas compound Americans’ health risks and environmental harms. The United States has a 3 million-mile natural gas pipeline network.163 These pipelines leak an estimated 2.6 million tons of methane every year, with some researchers finding that emissions might be four times higher than current estimates.164 Pipeline leaks in U.S. communities expose nearby residents to methane and other dangerous pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hydrogen sulfide, all of which can increase the occurrence of cancer, premature births, and respiratory issues, especially for outdoor workers, pregnant people, and children.165

One study found that the density of natural gas leaks in U.S. metropolitan areas increases by 37 percent as the percentage of households of color increases and by 26 percent as median household incomes decrease.166 The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that in 2024 alone, a total of 260 significant gas pipeline incidents resulted in 13 fatalities, 35 injuries, and $148 million in property damages.167

Liquefaction and export terminals

LNG export terminals also threaten U.S. health and safety, with direct air pollution from currently operating terminals resulting in $957 million in health costs for Americans and 60 premature deaths annually. All currently operating U.S. terminals are estimated to cause up to 2,020 premature deaths and nearly $29 billion in total health costs by 2050; yet these estimates would more than double if full LNG build-out of planned projects were to occur.168

U.S. energy infrastructure is often sited near low-income Black and Hispanic communities, unevenly distributing the impacts of fossil gas facilities.169 As shown in the Sierra Club’s LNG export tracker, air pollution from operating LNG terminals along the Gulf Coast’s chemical and industrial corridor—part of which is known as “Cancer Alley”—exerts heavy health burdens on neighboring communities, most of which are low income, including Jefferson Davis, Calcasieu, and Cameron parishes in Louisiana.170 These three parishes each have lower median incomes than the national average and, in 2023, had the three highest rates of premature deaths per million people—up to 17.4 million, 13.1 million, and 10.1 million deaths, respectively—due to pollution from operating the Sabine Pass, Cameron, and Calcasieu Pass LNG terminals.171 Communities near these terminals have also cited concerns about underreporting of emissions from flaring at liquefaction facilities.172

A study of flared natural gas in North Dakota found that ZIP codes exposed to heavier amounts of flaring tended to be economically disadvantaged and that neighborhoods that were exposed to more than half of all flared natural gas extracted less than 20 percent of all resource wealth, indicating that the economic gains from fracking development are not realized by the populations most exposed to its pollution.173

German energy company contracts with a U.S. LNG company that is increasing pollution and worsening quality of life for local residents

In April 2025, the German energy company Uniper signed a new LNG supply agreement with Woodside, a planned new LNG export terminal in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana.174 At least one insurance company has dropped insurance for the facility, possibly due to sustained opposition and growing climate risks.175 The area already has extensive fossil infrastructure that particularly affects disadvantaged populations. The existing Calcasieu Pass terminal causes massive local pollution by venting and flaring in continuous breach of environmental permits and decimates fish stocks, threatening local fisherfolk’s way of life. The LNG going through Louisiana’s export terminals is produced almost exclusively from fracked gas, an extremely harmful production method associated with cancer and a variety of negative environmental and health impacts resulting from air, water, and soil pollution.

The impacts of gas terminals and pipelines in U.S. communities are also amplified by environmental racism and human rights abuses, including through the exploitation of indigenous people and marginalized communities.176 LNG terminals built on U.S. Tribal territories can degrade the quality of water, wildlife, and sacred areas, exerting disproportionate health harms on communities of color and residents with low incomes, who often lack the political and social capital necessary to stave off polluting industries that see them as “paths of least resistance.”177 Communities of color and low-income populations in Louisiana and Texas, for instance, are more likely to be adversely impacted by LNG facilities and see higher rates of cancer, asthma, and obesity as a result.178 If all currently planned LNG terminals and expansion projects in the United States are built by 2030, Black and Hispanic Americans would be exposed to air pollution at rates up to 170 percent and 129 percent higher, respectively, than white Americans.179

While the health harms from fossil energy are concentrated in marginalized communities, the economic benefits of oil and gas activities do not “trickle down.” Of Americans that rely on the fossil fuel industry for revenue and jobs, nearly half of them live in areas with higher rates of poverty, air pollution exposure, health problems, unemployment, inaccessible transportation, or a combination of these factors.180 Moreover, major oil and gas plants are being planned along the Gulf Coast in flood-prone areas, which only heighten the risks and harms from natural gas expansion and the need to counteract increased production.181

The fossil gas industry continues to “greenwash,” but LNG is one of the biggest threats to a livable climate

In the face of mounting human health and environmental harms, the fossil gas industry has rhetorically positioned itself as a dedicated member of the “clean energy” economy,182 while its actions reflect a continued pursuit of fossil fuels. The gas industry is currently trying to push “gas certification,” which would charge a premium to certify whether or not wells are “responsibly” sourcing gas and staying below certain methane emissions thresholds.183 Yet the gas certification process has been found to unreliably detect pollution events, lack transparency and public access with regard to monitoring data, and overstate its role in reaching net-zero goals, which misleads the public and regulators in climate-conscious markets such as Europe.184

In 2023, the global oil and gas industry invested $28 billion into “clean energy,” which the IEA considers to be nuclear energy, fossil fuels used with carbon capture, and low-emissions fuels, in addition to renewable energy.185 This amounted to less than 4 percent of the industry’s total spending, with less than half of this investment going toward wind and solar energy.186 The world’s largest oil and gas companies are estimated to spend more on climate-related communications than actual climate solutions.187 Only 12 percent of their capital investments go toward “low-carbon solutions,” largely to technologies with questionable or overstated effectiveness in reducing overall emissions, such as fossil-based hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.188

The world’s largest oil and gas companies are estimated to spend more on climate-related communications than actual climate solutions, with only 12 percent of their capital investments going toward “low-carbon solutions.”

The fossil gas industry seeks to cement itself as the prime solution in the clean energy transition while understating its role in driving climate change, stagnating long-term energy security, and blocking new investments in cleaner solutions that are far more equitable and beneficial for public and environmental health.189 Doubling down on LNG terminals now would mean locking in fossil fuel infrastructure for decades when the country needs to accelerate decarbonization now.

These Fossil Fuel Industry Tactics Are Fueling Democratic Backsliding

Germany should invest in cheaper and cleaner alternatives to fossil gas

Fossil gas use accounts for about 15 percent of Germany’s gross electricity generation and persists mainly in industry, heating applications and power production.190 Every year, the country pays about 20 billion euros in fossil gas imports alone.191 Cheaper and cleaner alternatives already exist to replace almost all of current gas consumption in Germany and the EU.192 Renewable technologies and electrification provide the only viable basis for a resilient, affordable and future-proof European energy system, while also avoiding the geopolitical dependency fostered by the current resurgence of fossil gas.193 Progress on building a 100 percent renewable energy system in Europe is uneven but ongoing,194 and there are particularly beneficial developments in solar and battery prices and deployment.195 The German government and the IEA recently issued an “Energy Policy Review” for Germany, outlining a pathway for a secure and sustainable energy transition and how to build on actions that are already underway across Europe.196

Power

In the power sector, renewable technologies such as wind and solar energy installations have, for years, held a cost advantage over new fossil power plants, to the point where there is little market interest in building new gas-fired power plants without significant subsidies.197 To even make them viable, the new German government is planning to subsidize the addition of 20 GW gas power plants while simultaneously looking to lower support for renewable energy installations.198

Renewable energy also has a price-lowering effect on wholesale power prices, as it is produced at zero marginal cost. In a recent analysis spanning 24 European countries, the International Monetary Fund found that a 1 percent increase in renewable energy production, on average, equaled a 0.6 percent power price decrease, which is a significant benefit to households as well as industrial electricity consumers.199 Last year in Germany, record levels of renewable energy generation contributed to an 18 percent fall in power prices compared with 2023.200 Renewables also have the key advantage of requiring no continuous purchase of costly and polluting fossil fuels, as sun and wind energy do not need to be purchased or exploited from the ground. Fossil gas power plants, by contrast, are the highest-cost power-generation technology currently online in Germany and thus tend to be price-setting in electricity markets, which has a massive impact on power prices in times of high gas prices, such as during the early years of Russia’s war on Ukraine.201

In a recent analysis spanning 24 European countries, the International Monetary Fund found that a 1 percent increase in renewable energy production, on average, equaled a 0.6 percent power price decrease.

Reasonable planning and regulation can address challenges with the intermittency of renewables to reap the full cost-benefits for consumers. A recent study found that by ramping up the installations of batteries—prices for which have been falling rapidly—the EU could save an annual 9 billion euros in fossil gas costs by 2030.202 Germany could have avoided 36 gigawatt hours (GWh) of expensive fossil power in June 2024 alone if it had 2 GW more battery capacity, which is only 20 percent more than currently installed.203 Yet ramping up battery storage as a flexibility and power system backup option is largely overlooked by the new governing coalition’s plans for the German power market.204 Similarly, smart regulation allowing grid charges and power prices to better reflect system conditions and renewable energy capacity could make the power system considerably more efficient, driving down costs and setting incentives for grid expansion where it is needed the most.205

Heat

The majority of low- to medium-heat applications are currently powered by fossil gas, which means that almost all gas heating systems in residential buildings as well as most industrial gas use could be replaced with heat pumps.206 Increasing the share of heat pumps also has significant system benefits, as they provide another flexibility option to balance the grid, enabling greater renewable energy shares.207 Decarbonization scenarios consistently show a much higher share of heat pumps in the industry and heating sectors, which brings benefits to consumers, in addition to replacing gas demand and enabling carbon neutrality.208

A recent study published in Nature highlights how heat pumps could contribute to rapidly reducing gas consumption in Germany.209 The study compares several heat pump deployment scenarios in the residential, commercial, industrial, and power sectors, finding that up to 60 percent of the gas imported by Germany from Russia in 2020 could be substituted by 2025. Despite higher installation costs, heat pumps have significant long-term cost benefits, compared with gas boilers.210

Unfortunately, heat pumps have become an extremely divisive issue in Germany due to public discontent over perceived installation costs associated with Germany’s Buildings Energy Act (2023–2024),211 leading to misinformation and falling heat pump sales.212 The German far right, including the Alternative for Germany (AfD), successfully politicized the issue, capitalizing on people’s fear over rising energy and associated costs.213 The new Buildings Energy Act still includes significantly increased support for heat pump installations, but due to correctable problems in policy design, the expected rise in installation figures has, so far, not materialized.214

Additionally, the incoming new government has announced it will scrap the Building Energy Act, which would slow down the heating transition and risk increasing reliance on fossil gas.215 While some policy adjustments are needed, giving up on heat pumps would hurt consumers and continue the cycle of scrambling for gas imports every time there is a shortage or price spike due to geopolitical volatility.216 There is a better course of action to advance the heating transition and save households money, while also saving tax funds and cutting back on bureaucracy. Instead of reducing financial support for heat pumps, it would be better to restructure the support scheme from a percentage-based subsidy, which incentivizes heat pump manufacturers to raise prices and leads to higher prices in Germany than other European countries, to fixed price support, which would provide a set euro discount per heat pump.217 Other much needed policies to jump-start heat pump installations include streamlining permitting and installation requirements, training installers, and requiring utilities to install smart meters for heat pump users while scrapping subsidies for fossil and biomass heating systems.

Industry

Proponents of fossil gas support a narrative that carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen can enable a pathway for fossil gas toward zero greenhouse gas emissions.218 This narrative is used to justify new fossil gas infrastructure such as LNG terminals and gas power plants on the assumption that they can be converted to run on hydrogen or fitted with CCS technology at a later date.219 This is highly speculative at best and actively harmful at worst. Electricity-based technologies such as heat pumps and arc furnaces already exist and provide by far the most energy-efficient decarbonization pathway for industry.220

CCS is very expensive, primarily due to its considerable energy requirements.221 Cost reduction due to technological improvements is unlikely, as CCS is also characterized by high design complexity and a need for customization according to the use case, so even long term, it is likely to require considerable public subsidies to be economically viable.222 As a result, economic large-scale applications mainly exist outside of enhanced oil recovery, which further fuels climate change.223 A study comparing low-CCS with high-CCS scenarios from the IPCC’s sixth assessment report found that a high reliance on CCS would make the transition to climate neutrality by 2050 $30 trillion more expensive.224 CCS costs are not expected to fall significantly in the future, as the same study shows that “in more than 40 years, estimates of the costs of fossil power with CCS have not declined at all, indicating a lack of technological learning in any part of the process.” CCS should only be considered where it is the only available option, such as capturing unavoidable process emissions; it cannot serve as a widely applicable solution to decarbonizing fossil gas use.

Green hydrogen development is currently massively lagging behind envisioned targets, with a recent study published in Nature showing that only 7 percent of global capacity announcements were finished on schedule.225 Green hydrogen is set to become a scarce and pricey commodity with severely limited applications, likely for the coming decades.226 Any hopes of decarbonizing new fossil gas power plants by converting them to hydrogen, as the new German government is planning, are thus highly unlikely to succeed and would lead to massively increased power prices even if they do. Blue hydrogen—that is, hydrogen produced on the basis of fossil gas with the resulting CO2 emissions avoided with CCS technology—is not a likely solution either. The high capture rates needed to provide any climate benefit are currently unattainable, with some analysts estimating that blue hydrogen would have an even worse climate impact than fossil gas.227

Regardless of the carbon intensity of the hydrogen itself, blending hydrogen with methane or using infrastructure intended for methane for hydrogen instead is not currently possible at high volumes.228 The size differential and physical properties of the two gases make it unlikely that affordable and feasible solutions will be available any time soon.229 Increased leakage,230 embrittlement of container materials, and safety concerns are all large barriers to substituting hydrogen in place of methane using the same infrastructure.231

Recommendations

Germany

The new German government should not continue the previous government’s course of increasing LNG terminal overcapacity while looking for new long-term LNG contracts. Additional long-term LNG capacity is not needed to provide security of supply given future gas demand projections, and new contracts would lock Germany into fossil energy use for decades to come. This would increase costs for consumers, taxpayers, and businesses while creating a new dependency and potential energy security risk that could hurt the German economy, much like the recent dependency on Russian gas.

Instead, the new German government should strive to provide energy and climate security simultaneously by actively reducing dependence on fossil gas and increasing the deployment of clean energy. It needs to accelerate the decommissioning of gas grids and the installation of heat pumps while accelerating renewable energy and battery deployment, rather than new gas power plants, to cover future power demand. Only by decisively promoting an energy transition based on renewables rather than fossil gas can the new government provide a secure, affordable, and clean energy system, safeguarding the prospects of Germany’s economy in times of rapidly accelerating climate change and geopolitical uncertainty.

United States

Pushing LNG exports serves the oil and gas industry’s interests at the expense of Americans’ pocketbooks and health. The United States should stop pressuring allies into long-term fossil fuel infrastructure and LNG import deals that would undermine their energy transitions and independence. Coercive diplomacy—whether through back-channel deals, trade threats, or conditional military support—erodes America’s credibility, damages transatlantic unity, and weakens global climate action and cooperation. Bullying close partners into locking in fossil fuels undercuts the very leadership Washington should offer on climate and clean energy innovation.

Instead, the Unite States should align its energy foreign policy with its citizens’ need for affordable energy and rights to clean air and water. It should use diplomacy to strengthen U.S. allies and support all countries’ efforts to scale renewables, improve grid infrastructure, and reduce fossil dependency and pollution.

Conclusion

New long-term LNG supply contracts are not just unnecessary; they are highly undesirable from an economic and energy security perspective. Better technological alternatives already exist and are growing quickly. But political will is needed to provide planning and certainty to mobilize the needed investments from the public and private sectors. Every U.S. dollar or euro that is invested in fossil infrastructure and new gas supplies, rather than clean technologies, forgoes spending to reduce the clean tech investment gap. These misguided investments simply finance technologies and fuels that directly displace renewables and lock in even more fossil gas consumption, along with its accompanying pollution and volatile consumer prices.

The broadside by Musk, who only last week left his role as the guiding force behind the administration's Department of Government Efficiency, comes at a critical moment for the GOP legislation. Republicans in the Senate are beginning work this week on the multi-trillion package of tax and spending cuts after it narrowly cleared the House in May. The party can only afford to lose three votes in order to pass the package. Even before Musk's comments several lawmakers were raising concerns similar to his about the bill's cost.

Tuesday's remarks were not Musk's first time speaking out against what Republicans have dubbed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act."" In an interview with CBS last week, he said he was ""disappointed"" by the price tag associated with the package.

""I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,"" Musk said.

His continued criticism could complicate the work of Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who has committed to having the bill to President Trump's desk by July 4. The billionaire CEO of Tesla has become an influential figure in Republican politics. He spent nearly $300 million to support Trump's campaign and has funneled money to GOP candidates in political races across the country.

Speaking with reporters after Musk's post, Thune said he believes Musk's assessment of the bill is tied to an estimate from Congressional Budget Office that the bill could add $2.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade. Thune said that initial estimate fails to account for potential economic growth as a result of the policy changes in the bill. The CBO is expected to release those details in the coming days.

Thune said he hopes Musk will reconsider his position after he sees those numbers. He also emphasized that elected Republicans ran on promises to enact policies to extend the 2017 tax cuts, expand border security, invest in the military and expand U.S. energy production.

Still, Musk is not alone in his criticism inside the GOP. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, responded to Musk's post by writing, ""The Senate must make this bill better."" Wisconsin's Ron Johnson has threatened to withhold his vote unless Republicans agree to return spending to pre-pandemic levels, while Kentucky's Rand Paul has signaled he will vote no if the final bill includes a provision to lift the nation's borrowing limit.

Paul's criticism prompted President Trump to lash out against him on social media Tuesday. The president said Paul's ideas ""are actually crazy (losers!)""

But the White House was more muted when it came to Musk.

""Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during her daily briefing. ""It doesn't change the president's opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he's sticking to it.""

“This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.
It’s a sharp shift for Musk, the world’s richest person, who spent at least $250 million supporting Trump’s campaign last year.
Musk’s business interests stand to take a hit if lawmakers approve Trump’s bill, which would slash funding for electric vehicles and related technologies.
Last month, Musk said he was “disappointed” by the spending bill, a much milder criticism than the broadside he leveled Tuesday.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Elon Musk blasted President Donald Trump’s“big, beautiful bill” of tax breaks and spending cuts as a “disgusting abomination” on Tuesday, testing the limits of his political influence as he targeted the centerpiece of Republicans’ legislative agenda.

The broadside, which Musk issued on his social media platform X, came just days after the president gave him a celebratory Oval Office farewell that marked the end of his work for the administration, where he spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency.

“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Musk posted on X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”

The legislation, which has passed the House and is currently under debate in the Senate, would curtail subsidies that benefit Tesla, Musk’s electric automaker.

The tech billionaire followed his criticism with a threat aimed at Republicans.

“In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,” he wrote in another X post.

It’s a sharp shift for Musk, the world’s richest person, who spent at least $250 million supporting Trump’s campaign last year. He previously pledged to help defeat Republican lawmakers deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump, but now he’s suggesting voting them out if they advance the president’s legislative priority.

However, it’s unclear how Musk will follow through on his criticism. He recently said he would spend “a lot less” on political campaigns, though he left the door open to political involvement “if I see a reason.”

The tech titan’s missives could cause headaches for Republicans on Capitol Hill, who face conflicting demands from Trump and their party’s wealthiest benefactor.

Alex Conant, a Republican strategist, said “it’s not helpful” to have Musk criticizing the legislation, but he doesn’t expect lawmakers to side with Musk over Trump.

“Senate Republicans are not going to let the tax cuts expire,” Conant said. “It just makes leadership’s job that much harder to wrangle the holdouts.”

Trump can change the outcome in Republican primaries with his endorsements, but Musk doesn’t wield that level of influence, Conant said.

“No matter what Elon Musk or anybody else says — and I don’t want to diminish him because I don’t think that’s fair — it’s still going to be second fiddle to President Trump,” said Republican West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.

Musk’s business interests stand to take a hit if lawmakers approve Trump’s bill, which would slash funding for electric vehicles and related technologies. Musk is the chief executive of Tesla, the nation’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, and SpaceX, which has massive defense contracts.

Last month, Musk said he was “disappointed” by the spending bill, a much milder criticism than the broadside he leveled Tuesday.

The budget package seeks to extend tax cuts approved in 2017, during Trump’s first term at the White House, and add new ones he campaigned on. It also includes a massive buildup of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security.

To defray some of the lost tax revenue to the government and limit piling onto the nation’s $36 trillion debt load, Republicans want to reduce federal spending by imposing work requirements for some Americans who rely on government safety net services.

Musk’s post threw another hurdle in front of Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s already complex task to pass a bill in time for Trump to achieve his goal of signing it by July 4. The South Dakota Republican has few votes to spare in the GOP’s slim 53-seat majority.

Two of the Senate’s most fiscally hawkish Republicans quickly backed Musk.

“We can and must do better,” Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul wrote on X. Utah Sen. Mike Lee said “federal spending has become excessive,” adding that it causes inflation and “weaponizes government.”

Still, Trump enjoys fierce loyalty among the GOP base, and in the end, his opinion may be the only one that matters.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt played down Musk’s criticism.

“The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,” Leavitt said, and Musk’s post “doesn’t change the president’s opinion.”

The tension in the GOP delighted Democrats, who found themselves in the unlikely position of siding with Musk. Democrats are waging an all-out political assault on GOP proposals to cut Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments to help pay for more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts — with many lawmakers being hammered at boisterous town halls back home.

“We’re in complete agreement,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said of Musk. The New York Democratic lawmaker stood alongside a poster-sized printout of Musk’s post during a Capitol news conference.

The last time Musk weighed in significantly on legislation, the scenario was far different. His power was ascendant after the election, with Trump joining him for a rocket test in Texas and appointing him to spearhead DOGE.",https://www.kxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MuskTesla.jpg?icb=1749035015,N,,2025-06-04 07:03:36.730139

“If the U.S. fails to build out sufficient solar capacity, it will likely face energy capacity shortages within the next several years,” SEIA said.

Of the 330,000 jobs at risk, SEIA said 94,000 are in manufacturing, 236,000 are in construction, development, distribution, operations and maintenance, among others. At the state level, SEIA said 35,700 jobs are at risk in California, followed by 34,100 jobs in Texas, 21,800 in Florida and 13,900 in Illinois.

Additionally, provisions targeting residential rooftop solar could cost 62,000 jobs this year and almost 200,000 jobs in 2026, SEIA said.

“Modifications that inhibit our ability to deploy new energy production risk sparking an energy crisis,” said a letter signed by 21 House Republicans. “Such repeals would increase utility bills the very next day.”

SEIA’s analysis found that Trump Country would fare the worst if the clean energy incentives are repealed.

SEIA noted that no other energy generation technology is ready to step in to power AI data centers, which use massive amounts of energy. A repeal could cost 173 TWh in generation, which SEIA said is about as much electricity as Pennsylvania and Nevada used in 2023 combined.

Solar and storage are expected to make up 73% of capacity additions from 2025 to 2030, according to SEIA.

According to SEIA:

Clean Energy Buyers Association: 48E and 48Y repeal would lead to a national average 7% electricity price increase for households, and a 10% increase for businesses in 2026

Resources for the Future: Regional electricity price increases reach up to $300 to $400 per year in the upper Plains states

Edison Electric Institute: In Texas, repeal of federal credits and funding would increase average annual household energy costs (electricity and fuel) by over $90 per year in 2030, and over $370 per year in 2035

Brattle Group: By 2035, loss of tax credits would result in $51 billion per year of additional customer electricity costs, across all customer classes

SEIA is urging the industry to contact their representatives to urge revisions to the legislation to protect jobs, keep manufacturing in America and to promote the build out of solar and energy storage at a time when we need it most.

The Clinton Clean Energy Center, capable of powering approximately 800,000 homes, was initially slated for closure in 2017 due to financial losses.
This deal will enable the Clinton Clean Energy Center to continue providing grid reliability and low-cost power to the region for decades.
This announcement comes as public support for nuclear power continues to rise, with a recent poll indicating that support for nuclear energy has increased to 61% of U.S. adults.
The partnership ensures the continuation of clean energy and good-paying jobs in central Illinois, driving economic development for decades to come.","Meta has secured a 20-year power purchase agreement with constellation energy to obtain 1,121 megawatts of emissions-free nuclear energy from the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. This deal, effective from June 2027, will support Meta's clean energy initiatives and regional operations. The agreement will enable the Clinton plant to increase its clean energy output by 30 megawatts through plant uprates, preserve over 1,100 local jobs, deliver $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, and contribute $1 million in charitable giving to local nonprofits over five years.

The Clinton Clean Energy Center, capable of powering approximately 800,000 homes, was initially slated for closure in 2017 due to financial losses. The Future Energy Jobs Act's Zero Emission Credit program provided financial support to the plant through mid-2027. Meta's agreement with Constellation offers a market-based solution, replacing the ZEC program and ensuring the plant's long-term operations without ratepayer support. This deal will enable the Clinton Clean Energy Center to continue providing grid reliability and low-cost power to the region for decades.

Meta's decision to secure clean, reliable energy is driven by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence and other computing needs. By partnering with Constellation, meta aims to advance its AI ambitions while supporting the local community and economy. The agreement aligns with Meta's goal to match 100% of its electricity use with clean and renewable energy.

The economic and environmental impacts of the Clinton Clean Energy Center are significant. The Center directly employs over 530 people and contributes approximately $13.5 million in annual taxes. An analysis found that shutting down the plant would raise emissions by more than 34 million metric tons of carbon over 20 years, equivalent to adding approximately 7.4 million gasoline-powered cars on the road for a year. The same report indicated that Illinois' GDP would drop by $765 million annually, impacting businesses and jobs across multiple industries. Constellation's deal with Meta prevents these adverse impacts.

Under the agreement, Constellation will add 30 megawatts of increased output from nuclear uprates, covering central and southern Illinois. With the guarantee that the Clinton plant will continue to run for another two decades, Constellation is also evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit to pursue the development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor (SMR) at the Clinton Clean Energy Center site.

Constellation's commitment to the Clinton community includes increased charitable giving, with the company investing $1 million over five years starting in 2026 to support workforce development, social services, education, and local nonprofits. This announcement comes as public support for nuclear power continues to rise, with a recent poll indicating that support for nuclear energy has increased to 61% of U.S. adults.

The agreement has been welcomed by Illinois policymakers and key stakeholders, who recognize the importance of the Clinton nuclear plant to the local economy and community. The partnership ensures the continuation of clean energy and good-paying jobs in central Illinois, driving economic development for decades to come.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-1ac90e8857c20002.png,N,,2025-06-04 02:00:03.654341

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

The stakes are high for Tesla if it becomes law.,"Ana Altchek, Alice Tecotzky, Kelsey Vlamis",,,,,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-big-beautiful-bill-impact-tesla-xai-elon-musk-2025-6,"Tesla could take a hit if President Donald Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" becomes law.
Musk has previously said that eliminating the EV tax credit would devastate Tesla's competitors and impact the automaker as well.
Goldstein said that tax credit elimination could lead to a decrease in sales volume, which the automaker has already been struggling with.
The spending bill also threatens Tesla's energy business, which Musk has said is ""growing like wildfire,"" by ending energy tax credits.
xAI may benefit from AI regulation changes Trump's spending bill, if signed into law, may also help his AI company, xAI.","Tesla could take a hit if President Donald Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" becomes law.

Elon Musk's AI company, however, may get a boost.

Many of Musk's companies rely largely on federal regulations, subsidies, or contracts. That means the GOP's federal spending bill, if signed into law, could directly impact his businesses.

While Musk has previously shared his disapproval of the bill, the billionaire ratcheted up his criticism this week.

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,"" Musk posted on X on Tuesday. ""This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.""

""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong,"" he said in criticism aimed at the Republican politicians who voted in favor of the bill.

Musk's sharp words for Trump's bill come just days after he officially left his position as the de facto head of the DOGE office, ending his formal work at the White House. In recent weeks, both Trump and Musk have looked to assure the public that their relationship remains intact, even if they disagree on some issues.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing on Tuesday that the President already knew where Musk stood on the spending bill and that the Tesla CEO's recent comments criticizing it wouldn't change Trump's stance.

The bill, which champions Trump's agenda, includes cuts to Medicaid and the extension of the tax cuts that the president signed into law during his first term in 2017. It also includes administration priorities, including removing taxes on tips and overtime.

In regard to the companies Musk leads, the bill could have a mixed impact. While Tesla stands to potentially lose, companies like SpaceX and xAI may benefit from the president's massive spending bill.

Tesla's credits threatened

The bill, as written, makes big changes to the Biden-era EV tax credits, which aim to encourage more Americans to buy electric vehicles. It would largely phase out the clean vehicle credit, which lets people buying a new EV claim up to $7,500, and up to $4,000 for used-EVs.

Electric vehicles would no longer qualify for the tax credit if the automaker sold more than 200,000 previously qualifying EVs between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025, if the bill became law. Tesla delivered more than 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025 alone.

Musk has previously said that eliminating the EV tax credit would devastate Tesla's competitors and impact the automaker as well. However, he said that the move would probably help Tesla in the long term. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Others don't seem sold on Musk's rationale.

Seth Goldstein, an equity strategist at Morningstar, told BI that the expedited elimination of the EV tax credit will be ""the biggest area that could impact Tesla.""

""Consumers have increased long-range EV choices at similar price points as Tesla,"" Goldstein said. ""It's on Tesla to make the case for consumers to even slightly pay up today versus some other EVs.""

Goldstein said that tax credit elimination could lead to a decrease in sales volume, which the automaker has already been struggling with.

JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in an investor note that Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" combined with other proposed legislation, including ending the California Air Resources Board Program, threatens over half of Tesla's 2025 profits.

Brinkman wrote in the note that the $7,500 consumer tax made up 19% of Tesla's 2024 earnings before interest and tax, and could result in a potential $1.2 billion headwind. He added that the automaker could face a $2 billion headwind from the removal of CARB ZEV credit sales, which encourage the sales of zero-emission vehicles.

Tesla is betting big on AI and robotics as it pushes to reach full autonomy, in part through its upcoming robotaxi service, efforts that Musk has said are key to growing the company's valuation. However, Brinkman said that any material benefit from Tesla's autonomous robotaxi business is years away, while the headwind from EV subsidy removal would likely hit the automaker in 2025 and 2026.

""We expect estimates to come down as the impact of Trump Administration EV subsidy removal becomes clearer,"" Brinkman wrote.

Goldstein said that the removal of the tax credit could ""accelerate"" Tesla's transition to an AI and robotics company.

It's also possible that the expiration of the EV tax credit on Tesla vehicles could spur some short-term demand from buyers looking to purchase one of the company's EVs before the window closes.

Trump's spending bill wouldn't only change existing taxes and fees. Under its current language, it would also impose a $250 yearly fee for EV drivers through the Federal Highway Administration, and a $100 yearly fee for hybrid vehicles.

As written, the bill also scraps a loan program that Tesla utilized in 2010, long before Trump even entered the political scene.

The spending bill also threatens Tesla's energy business, which Musk has said is ""growing like wildfire,"" by ending energy tax credits. The automaker's energy generation and storage business, which includes Tesla's Megapack and Powerwall battery systems, brought in $2.73 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a 67% increase from the year prior.

Musk shared a post on X from the official Tesla Energy account that said, ""abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America's energy independence and the reliability of our grid.""

Tesla Energy also added that it urges the Senate to enact legislation with a ""sensible wind down"" to continue speedy deployment that supports AI and domestic manufacturing.

""This bill would hurt Tesla around the energy tax credits going away,"" Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and a noted Tesla bull, told BI.

xAI may benefit from AI regulation changes

Trump's spending bill, if signed into law, may also help his AI company, xAI.

One section of the bill prohibits states and local governments from regulating AI for the next decade in an effort to remove legal barriers related to deploying and adopting AI.

That could allow Musk to develop and advance xAI with less red tape on the regulatory side to slow the company down.

Several dozen protesters were outside Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage, where U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin were featured speakers. The federal officials were continuing a multiday trip aimed at highlighting President Donald Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state.

The trip has included meetings with pro-drilling groups and officials, including some Alaska Native leaders on the petroleum-rich North Slope, and a visit to the Prudhoe Bay oil field near the Arctic Ocean that featured selfies near the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline.

Calls for additional oil and gas drilling — including Trump’s renewed focus on getting a massive liquefied natural gas project built — are “false solutions” to energy needs and climate concerns, protester Sarah Furman said outside the Anchorage convention hall, as people carried signs with slogans such as “Alaska is Not for Sale” and “Protect our Public Lands.”

""We find it really disingenuous that they’re hosting this conference and not talking about real solutions,” she said.

Topics at the conference, which runs through Thursday, also include mining, carbon management, nuclear energy, renewables and hydrogen. Oil has been Alaska’s economic lifeblood for decades, and Dunleavy has continued to embrace fossil fuels even as he has touted other energy opportunities in the state.

Another protester, Rochelle Adams, who is Gwich’in, raised concerns about the ongoing push to allow oil and gas drilling on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Gwich’in leaders have said they consider the coastal plain sacred, as caribou they rely on calve there. Leaders of the Iñupiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling as economically vital and have joined Alaska political leaders in welcoming Trump's interest in reviving a leasing program there.

“When these people come from outside to take and take and take, we are going to be left with the aftereffects,” Adams said, adding later: “It's our health that will be impacted. It’s our wellness, our ways of life.”

Zeldin, during a friendly question-and-answer period led by Dunleavy, said wildlife he saw while on the North Slope didn't appear “to be victims of their surroundings” and seemed “happy.”

Burgum, addressing a move toward additional drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, said wildlife and development can coexist. His agency during the Alaska trip announced plans to repeal Biden-era restrictions on future leasing and industrial development in portions of the petroleum preserve that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.

Wright bristled at the idea of policy ""in the name of climate change” that he said would have no impact on climate change. Stopping oil production in Alaska doesn't change demand for oil, he said.

“You know, we hear terms like clean energy and renewable energy. These are inaccurate marketing terms,” he said. “There is no energy source that does not take significant materials, land and impact on the environment to produce. Zero.”

Joining for part of the U.S. officials' trip were representatives from Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and United Arab Emirates. Asian countries are being courted to sign onto the Alaska gas project, which has floundered for years to gain traction amid cost and other concerns. The project, as proposed, would include a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from the North Slope to port, with an eye largely on exports of liquefied natural gas.

Wright told reporters a goal in inviting them to the Prudhoe Bay stop was for them to see the oil pipeline infrastructure and environment and meet with residents and business leaders.

Glenfarne Alaska LNG LLC, which has taken a lead in advancing the project, on Tuesday announced expressions of interest from a number of “potential partners."" Costs surrounding the project — which have been pegged around $44 billion for the pipeline and other infrastructure — are in the process of being refined before a decision is made on whether to move forward.

Republican lawmakers' tax and spending package could touch many aspects of Americans' lives, including maybe what you drive. That's because the bill, which is now being discussed in the Senate, would roll back the tax incentives that the Biden administration signed into law to encourage buying electric vehicles. NPR's Camila Domonoske has the details. Hi there.

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi, Juana.

SUMMERS: So Camila, if this bill passes, what could it mean for car shoppers?

DOMONOSKE: Yeah, based on the version that came out of the House, the credit for buying a used electric vehicle, which is worth up to $4,000 for qualifying people, that would go away at the end of this year. And the credit for new EVs, which is worth up to 7,500, that would get very narrow. It would apply to fewer cars next year and then go away completely at the end of 2026. You know, not just for electric vehicles, but for clean energy more broadly, a lot of advocates say that this proposed package is pretty close to a full repeal of the tax credits that were added under the Biden administration. And on top of that, this would add a new fee for electric vehicle owners - $250 every year. That's described as something that would make up for the gas taxes that EV drivers don't pay, but it's a lot more than people who drive gas cars typically pay in gas taxes.

SUMMERS: OK, help us understand the logic behind removing these incentives.

DOMONOSKE: Certainly, a lot of Republican lawmakers objected strongly to these tax credits when they were first added or expanded by Democrats in their big climate law - the Inflation Reduction Act. We saw GOP lawmakers call it wasteful, say that it's simply not the government's business to try to incentivize one kind of car over another. These credits have also been critiqued for mostly helping wealthier families because new vehicles at all, and electric vehicles in general, are simply so expensive that that's who can afford them. That is something that the used car credit was, in fact, meant to address. And kind of ironically, this Republican tax package overall would itself benefit the wealthiest Americans and hurt the poorest - that's according to the Congressional Budget Office. And, you know, that is another element of what's happening here, which is all these tax cuts in the package are expensive for the government. Lawmakers have to find money somewhere to at least partially offset them, and EV tax credits are an easy target.

SUMMERS: Well, I mean, didn't President Trump as a candidate campaign against former President Biden's EV policies? So haven't automakers been preparing for this at all?

DOMONOSKE: Right. It's not totally shocking. But first of all, it is simply difficult for carmakers to adapt to a U-turn that is this rapid. We're talking about an industry that plans things years in advance. And secondly, there was some hope that Republicans would actually defend these tax credits, and that's because Republican districts in particular have benefited from them. The new manufacturing that these EV tax credits helped spur is largely going into districts that lean red, and there are jobs on the line. Companies and EV advocates are certainly making that case to senators as they deliberate, but I spoke with Levi McAllister, a Morgan Lewis lawyer who focuses on EVs.

LEVI MCALLISTER: I think companies are finally starting to say, hey, for us to plan, we need to assume all of this - all of it's going away, and we have to plan it with that environment in mind.

SUMMERS: So Camila, if these incentives do all go away, well, what would this mean for the future of electric vehicles?

DOMONOSKE: Well, companies will still make them. They're betting that EVs will get better, cheaper, a lot more people will want them in the future. And, importantly, the rest of the world is still moving in this direction, and companies don't want to get left behind. But it will really affect the pace that affects these manufacturing projects, and it affects efforts to meet climate goals, which was the logic behind these incentives in the first place - right? - that reducing reliance on gasoline is crucial to slowing the damage from climate change.

SUMMERS: NPR's Camila Domonoske, thank you.

The new U.S. administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an ""American energy dominance"" agenda.

Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California, has devoted time to environmental causes since leaving political office in 2011.

He said Tuesday he keeps hearing from environmentalists and policy experts lately who ask, “What is the point of fighting for a clean environment when the government of the United States says climate change is a hoax and coal and oil is the future?”

Schwarzenegger told the Austrian World Summit in Vienna, an event he helps organize, that he responds: “Stop whining and get to work.”

He pointed to examples of local and regional governments and companies taking action, including his own administration in California, and argued 70% of pollution is reduced at the local or state level.

“Be the mayor that makes buses electric; be the CEO who ends fossil fuel dependence; be the school that puts (up) solar roofs,"" he said.

“You can't just sit around and make excuses because one guy in a very nice White House on Pennsylvania Avenue doesn't agree with you,” he said, adding that attacking the president is “not my style” and he doesn't criticize any president when outside the U.S.

“I know that the people are sick and tired of the whining and the complaining and the doom and gloom,” Schwarzenegger said. “The only way we win the people's hearts and minds is by showing them action that makes their lives better.”

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Republicans including U.S. President Donald Trump have criticized clean energy tax credits for incentivizing intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar that vary depending on weather conditions. They say the nation needs more baseload power, which includes coal and natural gas, to serve soaring electricity needs tied to data centers and artificial intelligence.

But in the letter sent on Tuesday, a group of nuclear, energy storage, geothermal and hydropower companies and organizations said they, too, need the subsidies to support their baseload technologies.

KEY QUOTE

""Baseload technologies rely on these credits to secure financing, plan multi-decade investments, and build the infrastructure needed for a reliable and resilient grid. Altering the availability, phase-out schedule, or transferability of these credits would jeopardize the firm capacity now in active development and undercut America's broader goals of energy security and productive investment,"" the companies said in the letter addressed to Senators John Thune, the Republican leader, Chuck Schumer, leader of the minority Democrats, Mike Crapo, the Republican chairman of the Senate finance committee, and Ron Wyden, the committee's top Democrat.

Specifically, PosiGen urges the Senate to provide a reasonable pathway that does not undermine business investment and threatens nearly 300,000 jobs, and also preserves the ability for working class households to access the tax credits to save on their utility bills through solar leasing.

""We've helped tens of thousands of working class families save on their energy costs with rooftop solar leasing—without requiring high credit scores, high incomes, or upfront costs,"" said Tom Neyhart, Founder of PosiGen. ""Immediately eliminating the energy credits in the way that the House bill does would punish businesses, increase energy costs, and shut out the very families who need this support the most. ""

PosiGen serves over 40,000 homeowners across 15 states, including Louisiana, Mississippi, West Virginia, Maine, and Pennsylvania—many in communities with some of the highest energy burdens in the country, according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). At a time when energy demand is spiking across the country, we need all energy sources – including rooftop solar – so that we don't face blackouts and spiking energy costs.

""This is about energy dominance and affordability, not politics,"" said Peter Shaper, CEO of PosiGen. ""These credits have supported a resurgence in American energy manufacturing, created hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and helped millions of households keep the lights on. Ending them abruptly would pull the rug on businesses and undo years of progress.""

According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the U.S. solar industry supports more than 263,000 jobs, over 100,000 of which are tied to rooftop solar. Also at risk are over 300 new manufacturing facilities and nearly $300 billion in investments. Elimination of these credits would also have an inflationary effect by increasing energy costs by $51 billion for American families and businesses.""Solar is incredibly popular across the country and provides families one of the most powerful tools we have to take control of their energy costs and increase their resilience to power outages. ,"" said Kyle Wallace, PosiGen's VP of Policy and Chair of SEIA's Residential Solar & Storage Division. ""We cannot afford to go backwards. Congress must ensure that we don't make the critical mistake of creating energy chaos that will hurt our economy and send American manufacturing back to China.""

The South African-born tech billionaire's time in the Trump administration came to an end on 31 May, although Trump said that ""he will, always, be with us, helping all the way"".
In a series of posts on X on Tuesday, Musk said that the ""outrageous, pork-filled"" spending bill will ""massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!)
Asked about Musk's comments soon after the first post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ""the President already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill"".
""Even Elon Musk, who's been part of the whole process, and is one of Trump's buddies, said the bill is bad,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.","Elon Musk has hit out at President Donald Trump's signature tax and spending bill, describing it as a ""disgusting abomination"", in a widening rift between the two allies.

The budget - which includes multi-trillion dollar tax breaks and more defence spending while also allowing the US government to borrow more money - was passed by the House of Representatives last month.

""Shame on those who voted for it,"" Musk said in a post on X about the legislative linchpin of Trump's second-term agenda.

The tech billionaire left the administration abruptly last week after 129 days working to cut costs with his team, known as Doge.

The comments mark his first public disagreement with Trump since leaving government, after having previously called the plan ""disappointing"".

The South African-born tech billionaire's time in the Trump administration came to an end on 31 May, although Trump said that ""he will, always, be with us, helping all the way"".

In its current form, the bill - which Trump refers to as the ""big beautiful bill"" - has been estimated to increase the budget deficit - the difference between what the government spends and the revenue it receives - by about $600bn (£444bn) in the next fiscal year.

It's Musk's last day - what has he achieved at the White House?

In a series of posts on X on Tuesday, Musk said that the ""outrageous, pork-filled"" spending bill will ""massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America [sic] citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt"".

In American politics ""pork"" refers to spending on projects in lawmakers' constituencies.

Musk, who had previously vowed to fund campaign challenges against any Republican that votes against Trump's agenda, added a political warning in another post.

""In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,"" he wrote.

Asked about Musk's comments soon after the first post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ""the President already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill"".

""This is one, big, beautiful bill,"" she added. ""And he's sticking to it.""

The legislation also pledges to extend soon-to-expire tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration in 2017, as well as an influx of funds for defence spending and to fund the administration's mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.

To the dismay of fiscal conservatives, it would lift the limit on the amount of money the government can borrow, known as the debt ceiling, to $4tn.

The comments from Musk reflect wider tensions among Republicans over the plan, which faced stiff opposition from different wings of the party as it worked its way through the House.

The Senate has now taken it up, and divisions are already emerging in that chamber, which is also narrowly controlled by Republicans.

Kentucky Senator Rand Paul has said over the last few days he will not support the bill if it raises the debt ceiling.

""The GOP [the Republican Party] will own the debt once they vote for this,"" he told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, over the weekend.

Trump responded to Paul with a series of social media posts, accusing him of having ""very little understanding of the bill"" and saying that the ""people of Kentucky can't stand him"".

""His ideas are actually crazy,"" Trump wrote.

Republican lawmakers pushed back on Musk's comments, with Senate majority leader John Thune telling reporters the party plans to ""proceed full speed ahead"" despite ""a difference of opinion"".

""We have an agenda that everybody campaigned on, most notably the president,"" he said.

Mike Johnson - the Republican Speaker who has ushered the legislation through the House - told reporters on Capitol Hill that ""my friend Elon is terribly wrong"".

""It's a very important first start. Elon is missing it,"" Johnson said.

Johnson said he had a 20-minute phone call with the tycoon about the bill on Monday, adding that its phasing out of electric vehicle tax credits could ""have an effect"" on Tesla, Musk's firm.

""I lament that,"" Johnson said, expressing surprise that Musk criticised the bill despite their call. ""I just deeply regret he's made this mistake.”

Among the issues that upset Musk involved air traffic control at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), according to Axios.

Musk was hoping it would be run on his Starlink satellite system, but he was denied because of issues relating to the technology and the appearance of a conflict of interest, the political outlet reported.

Some Democrats welcomed Musk’s comments despite their previous criticism of him and the work of Doge.

""Even Elon Musk, who's been part of the whole process, and is one of Trump's buddies, said the bill is bad,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. ""We can imagine how bad this bill is.""

Trump and Republicans in Congress have set a deadline of 4 July to get the measure passed and signed into law.

Musk supported Trump in last year's November election with donations of more than $250m.

To make peace with spending hawks, Trump is also asking Congress to pass a plan that would reduce current spending by $9.4bn, a figure derived from Doge's work.

More importantly, he said, for the people of Houston and across the country, renewable energy means less pollution.","Washington — Since President Trump took office in January, his Environmental Protection Agency has been both slashing and reconsidering dozens of rules designed to fight pollution. The White House is also firing many of the EPA staffers who enforce the rules that remain.

This week, CBS News visited a Houston neighborhood that's near an NRG Energy coal-fired power plant, the largest in Texas.

When CBS News visited the same neighborhood in December, Mr. Trump had just been elected to a second term, promising the energy industry that he would roll back environmental regulations that protect air quality.

""I think of pollution as a silent and invisible killer,"" Dr. Winston Liaw, chair of the Health Systems and Population Health Sciences Department at the University of Houston, told CBS News.

Liaw treats patients who run a higher risk of lung disease, asthma and heart attacks due to emissions from oil refineries, chemical plants and coal plants in the Houston area.

He explained how the air in Houston can impact human health.

""There are these tiny particles, and they're so small that they bypass a lot of our defenses,"" Liaw said. ""And then they start injuring all sorts of tissue in our body.""

A 2018 study from Rice University found that pollution from the NRG plant contributes to 177 premature deaths per year.

In April, the Trump administration gave 68 plants — including the NRG plant in the Rice study — a two-year exemption from complying with federal regulations intended to lower mercury emissions, a powerful toxin that can affect the brain.

CBS News analyzed the Trump administration's exemptions and found that nearly 65% of these plants are located within 3 miles of low-income, minority communities.

""Bottom line is, who's more at risk are poor people,"" said Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group that has led an effort to try and close almost two-thirds of the nation's coal plants.

""When you start increasing production of coal-fired power plants, you're going to kill more people, and you're going to cause more heart attacks, and you're going to cause more asthma attacks,"" Jealous said.

In a statement provided to CBS News, NRG Energy said its ""coal units operate in compliance with the current Mercury Air Toxics Standards (MATS) and will operate in compliance with any future MATS requirements.""

In a separate statement, the Trump administration said Biden-era coal plant regulations ""stacked burdensome regulations on top of the longstanding Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, raising the risk of coal-fired plants shutting down – which would eliminate thousands of jobs, strain our electrical grid, and undermine our national security by leaving America vulnerable to electricity shortages.""

Jealous argues that coal is not a more reliable energy source than renewable energies.

""The argument that coal gives you more reliable energy isn't valid,"" Jealous said. ""Solar, wind and batteries gives you the most reliable, the most resilient grid.""

More importantly, he said, for the people of Houston and across the country, renewable energy means less pollution.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/03/c3542f96-697d-40d5-96ab-e90ccca196c0/thumbnail/1200x630/eefeb695285fc2afcf83b2e721385c74/1748993154728.png?v=bf13c71e7181bf2db128edf777c4aecf,N,,2025-06-03 22:06:22.390504

Executive Order 14302 – Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base

This EO directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to, inter alia:

Facilitate 5 gigawatt of power uprates to existing nuclear reactors and construction start on ten new large reactors by 2030. The DOE Loan Programs Office is directed to prioritize nuclear restarts, power uprates, recommencement of suspended nuclear reactor construction, advanced nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel supply chain improvements.

Coordinate with the Department of Defense (DOD) to assess the feasibility of restarting or repurposing closed nuclear power plants as energy hubs for military microgrid support.

Prioritize funding for qualified advanced nuclear technologies via federal support.

Within 240 days (by January 18, 2026), submit a report setting out a national policy for managing spent nuclear fuel, developing advanced fuel cycle capabilities, and recycling and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from DOE and DOD reactors.

Within 120 days (by September 20, 2025), develop a plan to expand domestic uranium processing and enrichment for use as low enriched uranium (LEU), high enriched uranium, and high assay, low enriched uranium (HALEU) fuels.

Within 30 days (by June 23, 2025), utilize authority under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to seek voluntary agreements with U.S. nuclear energy companies for cooperative procurement of LEU and HALEU.

Executive Order 14299 – Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security

This EO directs the federal government to support the rapid growth of advanced nuclear technologies domestically and for export to U.S. allies and commercial partners.

Among other things, the Secretary of Energy is directed to:

Designate artificial intelligence (AI) data centers located at or operated with DOE facilities as critical defense facilities.

Within 90 days (by August 21, 2025), designate DOE-owned sites for deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies to power AI infrastructure. Within 30 months (in 2027), an advanced nuclear reactor is targeted for operation at the first site.

The Secretary of Defense is similarly directed to utilize nuclear energy for installation energy and operational energy, including by commencing operation of a nuclear reactor, regulated by the U.S. Army, at a domestic military base or installation by no later than September 30, 2028.

To promote U.S. nuclear exports, inter alia:

The Secretary of State is directed to pursue at least 20 new Agreements for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation pursuant to section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (the 123 Agreements) by January 3, 2029 (close of the 120th Congress) and to renegotiate 123 Agreements set to expire within the next decade.

The DOE must review and decide on technology transfer export authorization requests within 30 days of receipt of complete applications and any related DOE analysis, excluding time for concurrence by the Department of the State and any foreign government retransfer and nonproliferation assurances.

Within 90 days (by August 21, 2025), specified agencies and departments must determine strategies to support federal financing agencies with respect to domestic nuclear energy technologies and exports, and leverage U.S. participation in multilateral development banks to support client country access to financing tools and technical assistance for adoption of nuclear energy technologies and fuel supply chains.

Within 90 days (by August 21, 2025), the Secretary of State shall implement a program to boost the global competitiveness of U.S. nuclear suppliers, investors and lenders.

Executive Order 14300 – Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

This EO directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to work with other executive departments and agencies and undertake a review of its regulations and guidance documents, following which, final rules and guidance are to be issued within 18 months (by November 2026). The NRC will, inter alia, establish maximum deadlines of no more than 18 months for a final decision on an application to construct and operate new reactors and no more than one year for a final decision on an application to continue operating existing reactors. The EO also directs the NRC to establish fixed caps on NRC’s recovery of hourly fees to help ensure that these deadlines are followed.

The EO also directs the NRC to establish an expedited pathway to approve reactor designs that the DOD or the DOE have tested and that have demonstrated the ability to function safely. NRC review of such designs would focus solely on risks arising from new applications subject to NRC jurisdiction, rather than revisiting risks already been addressed by DOE or DOD.

Executive Order 14301 – Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy

This EO seeks to steer the development and construction of advanced nuclear test reactors toward the Department of Energy and away from the NRC, and directs the DOE to implement reforms to reactor testing processes, including:

Within 60 days (by July 22, 2025), DOE must issue guidance regarding what would be considered a “qualified test reactor” and, within 90 days (by August 21, 2025), revise regulations, guidance and procedures to “significantly expedite review, approval and deployment of advanced reactors” under DOE’s jurisdiction.

The Secretary of Energy shall approve at least three reactors under a newly created pilot program (outside the National Laboratories) for reactor construction and operation by July 4, 2026.

This EO also directs the Secretary of Energy to fast-track reform of the DOE’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance regulations by June 30, 2025, consistent with EO 14154 – Unleashing American Energy, and use existing authorities to eliminate or expedite the DOE’s environmental reviews, including by creating new categorical exclusions for reactors (or relying on existing ones).

Steam Whistle Brewing has been around for a long time—since 2000, in fact. Before “craft beer” had entered the popular lexicon, the company was brewing its sole offering, Steam Whistle Pilsner, and distributing it to bars and homes across Canada. It was one of the very first of what we’d today call craft breweries; now it’s one of the most well-established. But you may not have known that Steam Whistle was also on the forefront of electrifying classic vehicles.

From almost the very beginning, Steam Whistle co-founder and CEO Greg Taylor saw the potential in using liveried classic trucks to deliver and promote his company’s beer. The first retro Steam Whistle truck was a 1949 International affectionately named “Lumpy.” Lumpy was probably named for the ride quality, because despite having a relatively modern diesel powertrain swapped in, the chassis was mostly original—not the smoothest suspension. But the bumpy ride was worth it, because Taylor quickly saw the smiles and positive reactions Lumpy drew when driving around Toronto. “Everywhere you go, it’s like a one-car car show,” he says.

As the business grew, so did the collection of bright-green classic vehicles with the Steam Whistle logo stamped on the sides. Our subject car, this 1958 Chevrolet Apache pickup, was originally used as a promotional vehicle for the brewery’s then-new Western operations in Vancouver, circa 2011. But according to Taylor, the company’s B.C. counterpart said while people loved the image of the classic truck, the smelly and noisy gasoline engine was doing them no favours in eco-friendly Vancouver.

Thus the plan was hatched for the Apache to be converted to a Tesla EV drivetrain, at a time when such swaps were very complicated and uncommon. It was so unusual, in fact, that Driving.ca assigned our own Alyn Edwards to cover it in April 2011. It was during this conversion that the Apache gained its current moniker: “Retro Electro.” Edwards described the original Retro Electro as a “pavement-mauler”: it boasted more than 450 lb-ft of torque, and when coupled to a drag-racing-style line-lock system, the Retro Electro could absolutely haze a set of tires. In short, it was a beast of a hot rod.

It no longer hauled kegs, though, because the bed was mostly occupied with the battery pack. But it was frequently parked at events and shows to promote the brand. The EV-swapped truck served the company well for many years, but eventually, it was time for an update. See, while the original conversion was fast and functional, it was also very difficult to use—it was completed back when EV swaps were in their infancy.

A detailed Post-It note lived on the dashboard describing the complicated manner of starting and driving the thing, a problem because it was a company vehicle and needed to be moved constantly by many different employees, not all of whom were familiar with its quirks. And because of the power-focused setup, the range was sub-par, even for the standards of a promotional vehicle. So in 2024, Steam Whistle reached out to the talented team at Beachman to revitalize the Retro Electro.

You may have seen the Beachman logo before, likely on the gas tank of some cool-looking bike. Well, I call it a “gas tank,” but the Beachman bikes are completely electric—the “tank” simply covers the electrical bits. Beachmans are currently classified as e-bikes, but they are in the process of being certified as a road-legal motorcycle; when they receive that certification, we’ll have a proper road test here on Driving.

But Beachman also works on EV conversions. For this project, the Tesla powertrain would be removed and a much simpler Nissan Leaf setup would take its place. The Leaf makes less power, but it’s much easier to package. A “stack” contains the motor and the inverter in a single lump, about the size of a four-cylinder gas engine. That stack is bolted to a conventional four-speed manual transmission, locked into fourth (as EVs don’t need multiple gears). The power is then sent through a driveshaft to the rear wheels, just like a conventional truck.

The original conversion was fast and functional, but it was also very difficult to use—it was completed back when EV swaps were in their infancy

Beachman even went as far as to retrofit the electric power steering and electrically boosted brakes from the Leaf to the truck. A simple three-button shifter – with a button each for Reverse, Neutral, and Drive – replaces the complicated scheme from the Tesla swap. Even the Leaf’s regen settings have been retained! The Retro Electro is easier to drive than it’s ever been.

Plop yourself behind the wheel and get comfy on a padded bench that feels more like a diner booth than a car seat. There’s a panoramic view in all directions from the cab, and the cozy dimensions are a far cry from today’s luxury-liner quad cabs. Twisting a key powers up the system, and pushing the small under-dash button for “D” selects Drive.

The driving experience is an interesting mix of new and old. Everything you can see looks like a 1950s pickup truck—the view down the hood gives nothing away about about what’s underneath the hood. But everything you hear and feel is like nothing from the ’50s. Taking off from a stop is smooth and quiet. The Leaf motor isn’t exactly a powerhouse, and being locked into fourth gear probably doesn’t help its case. That being said, the team tell me it will cruise at 100 km/h all day without issue, and it has enough juice to move around downtown with ease.

Because you’ve set the engine noise to “mute,” all other noises become much more obvious. Steve Payne at Beachman made it his mission to chase down every single rattle and neutralize it. The bed is mounted on insulating foam tape, and many other small pieces that were the sources of rattles have been tweaked for silence. The build quality and attention to detail is very impressive, especially considering this is a one-off promotional vehicle and not a consumer product. During our short drive loop, the Retro Electro garners multiple points, stares, thumbs-up, and camera flashes. I’m reminded of what Greg Taylor said about the one-car car show.

The Steam Whistle brewery is located in a historic rail roundhouse in downtown Toronto. The structure dates back to 1929, and its future wasn’t always certain. As the city grew and evolved, its inhabitants weren’t sure they wanted an enormous, old railyard right in the centre of downtown. For many years, the roundhouse lay abandoned. But new life was breathed into the old structure. The railyard it once served has been turned into a public park, and the trains it once housed have been replaced with a bustling brewery. In the same way, Steam Whistle has breathed new life into this 1958 Chevrolet. Like the Toronto roundhouse, the truck has been updated to better fit its modern role. Both are good examples of how to add modern functionality while retaining the classic charm of the original. And writing all this has made me mighty thirsty.

Meta (META-2.36%) has secured a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy (CEG-2.56%) to purchase nuclear power from the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, as it works to secure more energy for its growing AI operations, the company said Tuesday.

Meta said the deal, set to begin in 2027, will supply 1,121 megawatts of electricity, preserve more than 1,100 local jobs, and inject $13.5 million annually into the local economy, without requiring state subsidies.

“We are proud to partner with Meta because they asked that important question, and even better, they figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy,” Joe Dominguez, president and CEO, Constellation, said in a press release. “Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.”

It will also rescind the regulations and reconsider the regulatory determinations for several other PFAS, including PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), a Hazard Index mixture involving those three compounds and PFBS.

These changes include several plans that could make it easier for public water systems to comply with federal drinking water standards.

The EPA's latest announcement follows the establishment of final National Primary Drinking Water Regulations on April 10, 2024. The standards set legally enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for these PFAS. These regulations establish nationwide limits for these persistent ""forever chemicals"" in public drinking water. They apply to ""public water systems,"" defined as any publicly or privately owned system providing water for human consumption that has at least 15 service connections or regularly serves an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days per year.

The EPA initially gave public water systems until 2029 to comply with these MCLs, which many criticized as infeasible. In its latest announcement, the EPA signaled a move toward greater flexibility for public water systems in meeting compliance requirements, emphasizing its dual goals of protecting public health and ensuring that regulatory compliance is achievable, particularly for smaller water systems.

The latest move also follows the EPA's newly released guidance to help states address PFAS discharges into water sources, which can result in the contamination of drinking water.

The EPA outlined several new initiatives aimed at supporting water systems:

Extended compliance deadlines: The EPA plans to initiate a rulemaking process to extend the compliance deadline for the PFOA and PFOS MCLs to 2031.

Federal exemption framework: The EPA intends to establish a federal exemption framework, offering a structured approach for systems needing more time or facing unique challenges.

PFAS OUT Initiative: A new program, the PFAS OUTreach Initiative (PFAS OUT), will engage utilities, technical assistance providers, and local, state, tribal, and territorial leaders to develop practical and effective solutions, with a particular focus on rural and small communities.

The EPA's decision to maintain PFOA and PFOS standards while also providing extended compliance timelines and new support mechanisms offers a degree of certainty combined with necessary flexibility for public water systems.

Water systems and other stakeholders should stay informed about the upcoming rulemaking process for the extended compliance deadlines and the development of the federal exemption framework. They should also take advantage of the resources and engagement opportunities that will be available through the PFAS OUTreach Initiative. It remains crucial for water systems to continue assessing their water sources for PFAS and to plan for necessary treatment and compliance measures, keeping the new timelines in mind.

In focus: Trump legal threat fuels RGGI uncertainty

London, 30 May (Argus) — The question of whether the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump's deregulatory agenda is weighing on the market as his administration begins to challenge state climate policies in court. Ever since Trump issued an executive order on 8 April directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to identify and potentially challenge a slate of policies states have enacted to address climate change, the power plant CO2 emissions market has been in a state of volatility. Market participants are unsure whether RGGI, a collective of 10 northeastern US states, could be targeted by the federal government. The market plunged immediately after Trump issued the order, and even now, its potential legal effects continue to weigh on the market, despite the presence of more bullish factors , such as expectations for heightened summer electricity demand. US attorney general Pam Bondi is expected to release a report sometime in early June which could provide more clarity on the state programs that may be targeted by the administration or Congress — and whether RGGI is on the federal government's radar. The DOJ has already filed lawsuits against four states, including New York and Vermont , for their attempts to hold fossil fuel companies responsible for the climate change-related harms resulting from their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, Maine conservatives have asked Bondi to review the state's policies, including its membership in RGGI. Litigate now, ask questions later While Trump's executive order has cast a shadow of legal uncertainty over RGGI and other environmental markets , the order itself does not have much of a direct legal effect. Rather than directing federal agencies to issue regulations — which are, by law, subject to notice and comment periods — the order only requires the DOJ to investigate state laws and policies that could negatively affect US energy production. The lack of such lengthy administrative procedures could make the order ""highly vulnerable to being overturned by the courts"" and is an example of how much more ""reckless"" the Trump administration is now compared to the first term, said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. During Trump's first term, many states leveraged existing laws and regulations to prevent federal projects from going through, and those lessons are informing how the administration is now addressing what it perceives as state overreach, according to Matthew Dobbins, a partner at Vinson & Elkins specializing in environmental issues. The Trump administration does ""not want state laws being abused to defeat things that have national implications like energy,"" he said. In addition, the order is likely meant to delay or even stop states from implementation of more-ambitious climate policies already under consideration. ""Certainly, the net legal effect is … intended to chill state leadership on climate action, which has been a big part of the United States' climate response in the last decade or more,"" said Joshua Rosen, an associate at Foley Hoag in Boston practicing energy and climate law. While the lawsuits that the Trump administration has or intends to initiate will likely take many years to resolve, they are reflective of a ""flood-the-zone"" or ""flood-the-field"" strategy, both Dobbins and Rosen said. Even if those challenges are unlikely to succeed, they could still temporarily halt policy implementation, something that could significantly affect cap-and-trade markets such as RGGI, Dobbins said. Out of sight, out of mind While Trump's order broadly directs Bondi to identify laws that address climate change, GHG emissions, and collect carbon ""penalties"" or ""taxes"", it remains to be seen whether RGGI is in the sights of the administration. Unlike California, whose cap-and-trade program was explicitly called out in the order, there has not yet been any mention of RGGI. Even if there are more compelling legal arguments against RGGI, the administration might prioritize going after California's program for political reasons, as it is a much more well-known market in a state that has historically been at odds with Trump, according to Dobbins. ""I think if they can take down or get any traction attacking the California cap and trade program, then RGGI is going to be next in the crosshairs,"" he said. In addition, RGGI has been running for nearly 20 years and, in that period, the program has faced a number of unsuccessful lawsuits, Gerrard said. But Rosen noted that ""the success of the RGGI program could make it in the crosshairs"" of the Trump administration's effort to draw attention to its deregulatory agenda when it comes to climate policy and ""have sort of a soft effect of intimidating states."" The administration could challenge RGGI based on the Compact Clause of the US Constitution, which forbids states from entering into agreements without approval from the US Congress. But while interpretations of that clause have been more nuanced in the past, there could be a legitimate argument to be made, particularly if a case reaches the US Supreme Court, which, under its current makeup, has been more ""textually focused,"" said Dobbins. The dormant commerce clause, a constitutional legal doctrine barring states from discriminating against out-of-state businesses or burdening interstate economic activity, could be another avenue for the federal government. Essentially, the doctrine could be used to argue that RGGI puts an undue economic burden on electricity generators in member states compared to out-of-state generators that import electricity but do not have to buy allowances for compliance. The federal government could also claim that RGGI is undermining its regulatory authority granted by the Clean Air Act — an argument that has already been used in its lawsuits against the New York and Vermont climate ""superfund"" laws. But that argument might be moot since the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has plans to repeal a slew of environmental polices, Dobbins said. In addition, the Clean Air Act is designed in such a way that ""federal standards are a floor, not a ceiling, and states may set stronger standards,"" Gerrard said. There is also the question of how the RGGI states might respond collectively to a lawsuit from the federal government. Many states are facing pressure from high energy costs, causing even liberal lawmakers to balk at enacting more ambitious policies. This could result in a more ""fragmented"" response from RGGI states, particularly as the 2026 elections draw closer, Dobbins said. Still, while affordability concerns are a major pressure point for politicians, RGGI has been successful in not only lowering CO2 emissions, but also providing funds for energy efficiency programs — a somewhat non-partisan climate issue, according to Rosen. RGGI allowance prices have been rising since last year due in large part to expectations of rising electricity demand from the buildout of power-hungry data centers. The program has been in a review process that includes plans to extend the emissions cap beyond 2030. But that review, which started in February 2021 , has been subject to multiple delays and is currently slated to complete sometime this year. It remains to be seen how Trump's executive order could affect the progress of the review. RGGI has not yet responded to requests for comment.

""I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,"" Musk said in a post on his social media platform X.
""Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,"" Leavitt said.
Trump's bill would also end $7,500 consumer tax credits for buyers of electric vehicles, a policy advanced by former President Joe Biden that has benefited electric car companies like Musk's Tesla.
""We are very confident in our own economic analyses of this bill,"" Leavitt said, arguing the bill will produce $1.6 trillion in savings.","WASHINGTON ― Days after leaving his role in the White House, Elon Musk excoriated President Donald Trump's tax and domestic policy bill as a ""disgusting abomination,"" escalating his criticism of the president's signature legislation over concerns that it will increase the deficit.

Musk's pointed June 3 remarks came after Trump held a friendly send-off for the world's richest man in the Oval Office last Friday and as the second-term Republican president is working to push what he's called his ""big, beautiful bill"" through the Senate.

""I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,"" Musk said in a post on his social media platform X. ""This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.""

The bill, which cleared the House last month with only Republican support, would extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, implement new tax breaks for tipped wages and overtime, overhaul Medicaid and food stamps, beef up border security and significantly increase military spending. Republican leaders are trying to pass the Senate bill through a filibuster-proof budget process known as reconciliation.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.

""It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt,"" Musk said in a follow-up post on X. ""Congress is making America bankrupt.""

Musk's remarks spoil his friendly send-off

Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and the social media platform X, left the White House as a senior adviser last week after leading the Department of Government Efficiency for the past four months. Before signing off, Musk said in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning that he was ""disappointed"" with Trump's reconciliation bill, arguing it will grow the deficit and ""undermines"" DOGE, which has been working to drastically cut federal government spending.

Yet Musk and Trump had seemed to smooth things over when the president welcomed the billionaire tech entrepreneur into the Oval Office for one final news conference with reporters. “We’ll remember you as we announce billions of dollars of extra waste, fraud and abuse,” Trump told Musk, lauding him as ""one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shrugged off Musk's latest criticism of Trump's tax and policy bill.

""Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,"" Leavitt said. ""It doesn't change the president's opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he's sticking to it.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, who helped Trump advance the legislation in the House, told reporters that he spoke to Musk for 20 minutes on June 2 and that he's “terribly wrong” about the bill.

“For him to come out and pan the whole bill is to me just very disappointing,"" Johnson told The Hill. ""Very surprising in light of the conversation I had with him yesterday.”

'I agree with Elon,' Rand Paul says

Over the weekend, Musk expressed disappointment after Trump withdrew his nominee for administrator of NASA, Jared Isaacman, a billionaire commercial astronaut with close ties to Musk.

Trump's bill would also end $7,500 consumer tax credits for buyers of electric vehicles, a policy advanced by former President Joe Biden that has benefited electric car companies like Musk's Tesla.

Musk's fiscal objections to the bill mirror concerns held by some Republican senators ‒ including Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin ‒ whose votes are crucial for Trump to pass the legislation with only Republican backing.

""I agree with Elon,"" Paul said in a post on X. ""We have both seen the massive waste in government spending and we know another $5 trillion in debt is a huge mistake. We can and must do better.""

Paul has said he will vote against the bill if not changes are made, prompting Trump to lash out at the Kentucky senator earlier in the day in a post on Truth Social. ""Rand votes NO on everything, but never has any practical or constructive ideas. His ideas are actually crazy (losers!). The people of Kentucky can’t stand him,"" Trump wrote.

Leavitt pushed back at the debt concerns raised by Paul and Johnson, accusing them of ""not having their facts together"" during her June 3 briefing with reporters. The White House has insisted the legislation won't raise the deficit despite the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that it will.

Leavitt said the CBO has a history of being wrong with their fiscal projections. And despite the office's nonpartisan status, she accused the CBO of being ""partisan and political"" and run by mostly Democratic budget analysts.

""We are very confident in our own economic analyses of this bill,"" Leavitt said, arguing the bill will produce $1.6 trillion in savings.

Most vehicles that fell short only missed their EPA estimates by a handful of miles. Some were egregious offenders. A few others beat their estimates by 40 miles.

The publication ran fully charged vehicles at a steady speed of 70 mph until their batteries were depleted.

Even the most ardent electric-vehicle fan will tell you there's often a big gap between the range that you're supposed to get and what you actually get. An EV's actual range can depend on a great many things, like outside temperatures, tires, how smooth the acceleration is and how fast it's going on the highway.

I'll say this from experience, too: Nothing is worse than getting far less range than you expected to, especially when you're crossing long distances in a hurry. But many modern EVs actually exceed the range estimates handed down by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the automakers themselves—even on the highway.

Consumer Reports has been in the habit of buying and range-testing EVs at highway speeds until they die for some time now. It's an extreme test, and one that ends with a car being flatbed-towed to a charger when its battery is fully depleted. So far, CR is up to 30 different 100% to 0% range tests. (Also speaking from experience: 30 different towing bills can be difficult for some publications to justify to their parent company.)

The publication's latest test actually shows a good deal of improvement in highway range, and range consistency. ""Most vehicles that fell short only missed their EPA estimates by a handful of miles,"" CR said. One offender was especially bad: the Ford F-150 Lightning. ""Its battery ran out after just 270 miles—a 50-mile difference from the EPA estimate,"" CR said.

Ford F-150 Lightning Pro

That doesn't exactly come as a surprise. The F-150 Lightning is an excellent electric truck, but it's big, heavy and aerodynamic as a brick. I had a close call in one once, too.

But CR's latest test has a few surprising winners that exceed—in a few cases, handily—their EPA-stated range. The BMW iX is one of the big winners here, pulling 370 miles of range when it should only do 309 miles. Even better is the Mercedes-Benz EQS 580 sedan. Benz's controversially styled electric four-door is a range king, managing 380 miles on the highway. While that's only nine miles more than its EPA rating, it's the best result among this test group.

Overall, BMW in particular had a great showing in CR's testing. The BMW i4 significantly outperformed its EPA estimate on the highway by 51 miles, and the i5 did nearly as well at 45 miles. Even the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N did 15 miles better than expected, which is a nice outcome for all the performance it offers too. Interestingly, the Lucid Air Touring—among some of the American market's longest-range and most efficient EVs—was off the mark by a whole 33 miles here.

“It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt,” he added in a subsequent post.

Musk’s beef does not appear to be with the massive cuts the Trump-endorsed reconciliation package makes to social services like Medicaid in order to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, but the trillions it is expected to add to the nation deficit. His ire could also be tied to the fact that the bill will likely cut tax credits for Americans who purchase electric vehicles, which were a boon to EV manufacturers like Tesla.

The billionaire left the Trump administration amid a sharp decline in popularity, and national protests against his vehicle company fueled by his chaotic and corrupt management of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). DOGE haphazardly gutted several federal agencies — ostensibly in the name of cutting waste, fraud, and abuse — jeopardizing some of the government’s most critical public services while enriching Musk’s companies.

Trump and Musk lauded each other during the billionaire’s sendoff last week, but speculation has abounded about the true nature of their relationship. Axios reported on Tuesday that Musk discussed staying in the administration beyond the 130-day limit of his special employee status, but that the White House said no.

It may or may not be true that Musk is “not really leaving” despite his official departure, as Trump insisted last week, but if Republicans hoped that Musk would continue quietly operating as a asset to themselves and the president, Tuesday’s statement was an unwelcome surprise that drew quick condemnation.

“I know that the EV mandate is very important to him; that is going away because the government should not be subsidizing these things as part of the Green New Deal,” Johnson added, calling out what may be the true cause of Musk’s public opposition to the legislation. “I know that has an effect on his business and I lament that. We talked about the ramp down period on that and how that should be duly considered by Congress.”

“But for him to come out and pan the whole bill is to me just very disappointing […] I just deeply regret that he’s made this mistake,” Johnson said.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded by noting that “the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill [and] it doesn’t change the president’s opinion.”

“This is one big, beautiful bill and he is sticking to it,” she added.

Congressional Democrats seized on Musk’s statement. “Breaking news: Elon Musk and I agree with each other,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said on Tuesday. “The GOP tax scam is a disgusting abomination. Every single Republican who voted for the one big ugly bill should be ashamed of themselves. They aren’t helping their constituents, they are hurting their constituents.”

Give a listen! Republicans are maneuvering the biggest carrot and the biggest stick. Two weeks ago, the Senate removed to take the biggest stick from California. It overturned the waiver that allowed the Golden State to put automakers on a path to 100% EVs by 2035. That same week, the House of Representatives removed the biggest carrot, or better put, the whole bushel of carrots contained in the Inflation Reduction Act. That includes the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers and a slew of tax credits that make it easier for automakers to take the full leap into electric. None of this is for sure yet. California is suing to keep its ability to require EVs, and a few senators could still save the EV tax credits. At stake is whether the U.S. approaches the EV market and its huge economic opportunities at an urgent pace, or a lazy one.

Mr. Musk started publicly criticizing Mr. Trump’s bill last week, saying on CBS News’s “Sunday Morning” that he was disappointed in the legislation’s size and impact on the deficit.","Elon Musk lashed out on Tuesday against the far-reaching Republican bill intended to enact President Trump’s domestic policy agenda, posting on X that it was a “disgusting abomination” and telling House members who voted for it: “You know you did wrong.”

The tech billionaire criticized the bill, one of Mr. Trump’s top priorities, in a series of about 10 posts. In them, Mr. Musk reshared commentary from lawmakers like Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, two Republicans who had sided with him in opposing the rising U.S. deficit.

“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Mr. Musk wrote on X. He called the domestic policy bill “massive, outrageous, pork-filled,” adding that it would “massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit” and that “Congress is making America bankrupt.”

He did not target any specific members of Congress, but hinted that he might support efforts to unseat those who backed the bill in the 2026 midterm elections. “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,” he wrote.

The blitz of messages signaled a widening rift between Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump as the tech mogul winds down his governmental role leading the Department of Government Efficiency. While the men have publicly professed continued admiration for each other, Mr. Musk’s departure from Washington has appeared to liberate him from presenting a united front with the White House.

Instead, he has returned to wielding his brand of unpredictable political influence through X, the social media platform he owns. In December, before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Musk torpedoed a bipartisan spending bill with an onslaught of posts on X, including a threat to find primary challengers for Republicans who supported it. In March, he tried unsuccessfully to sway the outcome of a Wisconsin judicial race with myriad posts in favor of the conservative candidate.

Now unshackled from loyalty to the Trump party line, Mr. Musk can again foment chaos with his X feed.

Mr. Musk, 53, has often criticized legislation, agencies and others that are against the interests of himself and his companies, which include the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX. In its current form, Mr. Trump’s domestic policy bill would end subsidies and tax credits meant to spur consumers to buy electric vehicles, which would have ramifications for Tesla.

The House speaker, Mike Johnson, called Mr. Musk’s criticism of the domestic policy bill “very disappointing.” He told reporters at the Capitol that the two spoke on Monday and that Mr. Musk “seemed to understand” the virtues of the legislation.

The White House and the president were caught off guard by Mr. Musk’s posts, a person with knowledge of the situation said, but it’s not yet clear whether Mr. Trump will return fire.

“The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary. “It doesn’t change the president’s opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.”

A representative for Mr. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Trump has urged swift passage of the legislation — officially called the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act — which would slash taxes, providing the biggest savings to the wealthy, and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement. As written, the legislation would cut health, nutrition, education and clean energy programs to cover part of the cost.

White House officials and Mr. Johnson have claimed that the bill would shrink the national debt, although the Congressional Budget Office and a number of independent analysts have estimated that the bill would increase federal deficits by well over $1 trillion, even when economic growth is factored in.

Mr. Musk posted his criticism at a critical moment for the bill, which passed the House on May 22 in the face of a strong pressure campaign by Mr. Trump. As Mr. Johnson corralled several competing Republican factions, the president summoned recalcitrant holdouts to the White House, and his staff likened Republican opposition to the bill to “the ultimate betrayal.”

But Republican senators have already made clear that they plan to make changes to the bill. Fiscal conservatives, alarmed at the estimates that it would swell the national debt, have demanded further changes and cuts to Medicaid and other programs that could help rein in deficits. Mr. Trump has warned Republicans not to mess with Medicaid, a program that many of his supporters rely on.

Mr. Musk started publicly criticizing Mr. Trump’s bill last week, saying on CBS News’s “Sunday Morning” that he was disappointed in the legislation’s size and impact on the deficit.

People close to the congressional negotiations said Mr. Musk was disappointed that Republicans were removing electric vehicle subsidies, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.

“I know that has an effect on his business, and I lament that,” Mr. Johnson said. But he added that he did not believe the government should be subsidizing a transition to electric cars.

Mr. Musk’s threats about unseating Republicans contrast with his political spending last year. His super PAC, America PAC, spent about $20 million in the last election cycle to boost Republicans running for the House. And a different PAC he backed spent $10 million to help Republicans in the Senate.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/03/multimedia/03biz-musk-trump-fbqp/03biz-musk-trump-fbqp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 20:08:32.663170

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has issued a Code Orange Air Quality Action Day for the Susquehanna Valley for Wednesday due to high ozone levels caused in part by smoke from wildfires in Canada.

During a Code Orange, air quality is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, including the elderly, individuals with preexisting heart or lung disease, children and those with asthma.

The Code Orange has been issued for Dauphin, Cumberland, York, Lebanon, and Lancaster counties, as well as the Philadelphia area and Lehigh Valley region.

Officials with the DEP said Wednesday’s forecast for sunny skies and high temperatures combined with a thin layer of smoke originating from wildfires in the Canadian province of Manitoba will lead to rapid ozone development during the late morning and afternoon hours.

Periods of elevated ozone levels can lead to an increase in asthma attacks and hospital admissions according to studies from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

State officials say residents can take the following steps to reduce ozone levels:

• Driving less by carpooling or using public transportation;

• Combining errands to reduce vehicle trips;

• Limiting engine idling;

• Refueling cars and trucks after dusk; and

• Conserving electricity by setting the air conditioning to a higher temperature and turning off lights that are not in use.

Forecasters with the Air Quality Partnership of the Susquehanna Valley say ozone levels are expected to drop back into the moderate range Thursday and air quality is expected to continue to improve throughout the week.

However, forecasters are monitoring an area of smoke across the Great Lakes that could impact the region next week.",https://www.witf.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/smoky-day-21-1620x1080.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 20:07:32.883523

As the closest government closest to communities, councils are critical to creating a sustainable, prosperous future for Australia – as well as helping the Federal Government achieve its target of net zero emissions by 2050.

However, councils will require support to to prepare and manage the impacts of a changing climate for their communities.

Climate adaptation

Many of Australia’s councils are at the frontline of climate adaptation. For example, local governments build public swimming pools to keep people cool, plant trees to provide shade, and upgrade stormwater systems to manage heavy rains.

The climate of every community is different, and each council knows what their community needs to prepare and adapt.

However, local governments are significantly underfunded, meaning the burden for the increased services and infrastructure needed to adapt falls to local communities.

Of the 120 councils who participated in the latest Australian Local Government Climate Review 2024, two-thirds of respondents have undertaken a climate risk assessment and 72 per cent are implementing climate initiatives. Councils are already investing significantly to prepare and manage the impacts of a changing climate, but they need greater support which matches the scale of the challenges.

ALGA is calling for a new $400 million per year climate adaptation fund, to be distributed across all councils to provide local, place-based solutions to Australia’s changing climate.

ALGA is also asking the Federal Government to:

Streamline and make it easier for local governments to undertake climate risk management. This should involve implementing a voluntary climate risk framework for local government which supports consistent climate risk assessment, reporting, decision making and expenditure.

Develop, operate and maintain an information and data suite designed specifically for local government adaptation use (on an opt-in basis).

Emissions reduction

The Australian Local Government Climate Review 2024 found 86 per cent of councils (of 120 council respondents) had an emissions inventory. Barriers to reducing corporate emissions included internal resourcing (69 per cent), funding (64 per cent), and staff capability (40 per cent).

While councils are committed to reducing emissions at a local level, more funding is needed so that costs aren’t borne by ratepayers and allow communities to share in the savings and benefits of low emissions technologies quicker.

ALGA is asking the Federal Government to:

Collaborate with local governments as part of a multi-level governance approach (per the Australian Government’s pledge to the Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships) to undertake strategic planning and prioritisation of net zero projects, infrastructure and service needs on a regional level.

Fund emissions reduction plans with local governments across states and territories to facilitate a place-based approach to achieving net zero communities.

Expand, and make more accessible, existing funding programs which enable local governments to reduce emissions and support community emissions reduction.

Provide councils with accessible and nationally harmonised tools to maintain pace with trends in emissions measurement and reporting.

Ensure local governments are compensated where emissions reduction processes place additional pressure on services and infrastructure (e.g, heavier EV truck impact on maintenance/standards of roads/bridges).

Renewable energy transition

Local governments are irreplaceable and essential partners in all aspects of transition to net zero. They often liaise with proponents, negotiate benefits for their communities, provide trusted information to residents, and manage the stresses that large projects can create, such as on roads, housing, and local skills and trades.

Local governments work to balance the need to build a positive long-term legacy through the opportunities of the transition, with the risks and impacts of the immediate roll-out.

ALGA is asking the Federal Government to:

Create a program of work dedicated to understanding local government experiences with renewable energy transition in their local area and region and develop specific supports for local governments.

Establish a national approach and mechanism for cost recovery to local governments for the role of brokering benefits between project proponents and their communities, benefitting all Australians.

Develop and maintain regional plans and a national map demonstrating zoning for prospective and proposed renewable energy projects and transmission corridors.",https://alga.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cropped-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-03 22:06:18.718207
